The university was given an ultimatum to be in compliance by 15 May which is tomorrow and to cease any further payments that were out of line with that compliance, prior to that.  Have we received confirmation from the president of UCC that the university has complied with the demand?</p></speech>

These are serious matters that need to be addressed.  After the president of the university replies to the Secretary General, we can look into the matter in greater detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#B00900"><p>The HEA and the Department will be before us as part of our work schedule so we can deal with the matter later on.</p> <p>  No. 3A.4 is correspondence, dated 11 May 2015, from the Health Service Executive and is a follow-up to our meeting of 23 April 2015.  Members can see the information on screen.</p> <p>  In regard to the matter raised by Deputy Costello, which I will deal with now rather than raise it later on, alongside that issue, a number of reports were given to us by a whistleblower relating to Cork Insitute of Technology.  I know this is a different matter but it is still part of the third level sector.  Then there were reports on Waterford Institute of Technology, there were problems in regard to the amalgamation of Carlow and Waterford ITs and Tralee and Cork ITs.  Within what was said at those meetings, there were serious issues which have not been addressed in an adequate way.  We should not just remind the Department of Education and Skills but, if necessary, bring forward the date of our hearing with it if we do not get the appropriate replies.  Extremely serious allegations were made but it seems to me that the Department has not taken them seriously.  </p> <p>  In the context of the amalgamation of institutes at both Carlow and Waterford and Tralee and Cork, significant moneys are involved and the Department has not clarified the matter yet the amalgamations continue apace.  Again, it is a question of having the information before us, being able to make a decision and not allowing a process to continue that will further cloud the financial circumstances of the colleges involved so that we will never get to the end of the matter.  We should express our concern directly to the Department about these matters that have been raised.  If we do not receive a comprehensive reply to the queries raised by members and whistleblowers, then we should have an earlier than planned meeting with the Department, the Higher Education Authority and representatives from the different colleges concerned.  Deputies could deal with the issues raised in the correspondence supplied by the Department at that meeting.  The allegations are far too serious for this committee to ignore. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#B01000"><p>I agree with the Chairman that we should bring forward the meeting with the Department.  I would like to read into the record the letter sent by the Secretary General to the president of the college:</p><blockquote>The Department, however, has established from an analysis of the schedule submitted by the President with his letter that it includes additional unauthorised payments which were not previously notified to us.  The information contained in the schedule is regrettably incomplete and the outstanding data have been sought from the university.</blockquote> <p>The correspondence refers to the public sector payments that were not authorised.  He stated further: &quot;I have directed the President to cease with immediate effect all remaining additional payments contained in the schedule which remain extant and to confirm to me by the 15th May that this has been done.&quot;  As tomorrow is 15 May, I suggest we meet the Department on some date this month.  The meeting would prove valuable as the Department could deal with this matter and all of the other issues outlined by the Chairman.</p></speech>

It might be more useful to have him in when we meet the HEA and the Department.  I have spoken to him and he has agreed to meet the Committee of Public Accounts once he has finalised his report.</p><p>My understanding is that he is taking a look at some of the issues you raised as well.  He has had to wait until the two governing bodies in Waterford and Carlow met and until they have been put together before he issues his report.  There has been a delay because of that and I believe that is reasonable.  However, if we are asking in the Higher Education Authority with the Department of Education and Skills then I believe it would be useful to bring him in and discuss his report and findings as well, because he is examining the issues you have raised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C00300"><p>Yes, that is grand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C00400"><p>It is a broader issue of governance and reporting between the colleges and the Department, and, in turn, reporting between the Department, the HEA and the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is obvious that we are not getting the information.  It is clear to me that there is almost an attempt not to give us full information, and that is not acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C00500"><p>That is fair enough.  He is probably the one person who has been tasked with independently reviewing the governance matters that you are talking about.  Therefore, if we are going to have a meeting on the matter it might be useful to have him before the committee to talk about his findings when it comes to the governance and the stream of information between the Department, the Committee of Public Accounts and the HEA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C00600"><p>It might be no harm if he was invited in and heard the exchange in respect of the issues that have already come before the Committee of Public Accounts and which have not been answered by the Department in any way, shape or form.  This has to do with a serious lack of governance and control of taxpayers' money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C00700"><p>I agree with you on that point.  What we are talking about is Government pay policy, but we are not getting full information.  It is only dripping out subsequently when we hear of breaches of pay policy that are unauthorised.  This is a clear case of it.  Some of the other issues raised are related to this.  It is important that this be done urgently and that the matter be raised at this committee.  I agree that it could be done and that the broader issues could be dealt with at a later stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C00800"><p>We were dealing with correspondence from the HSE which is a follow-up from the 23 April 2015 meeting.  There are a number of other outstanding matters that the executive has to deal with but this correspondence answers some of the questions raised.  In the context of the HSE reflecting on our meeting I suggest that we forward a transcript of that meeting to the Garda Commissioner in light of the issues raised separately, relating to the home in Waterford and other matters.  We are told the Garda is investigating.  It is extremely lax on the part of the HSE and the Garda that this matter is not being dealt with in a more open way.  On one side there are approximately 30 young adults who have been affected by what happened there, but I get no sense from the HSE that there is an urgency about this or any desire to resolve it.</p> <p>  The position is likewise in respect of the investigation into the procurement process.  That has not been rightly explained to us either.  Perhaps the transcript may be of help to the Garda.</p> <p>  A protected disclosure was made, under legislation, on more than one occasion from more than one person, but nothing has happened since.  The Garda Commissioner needs to understand that we have had our hearing, that protected disclosures have been made and that we would have expected a far greater urgency as a result of that meeting.  The care of these 30 or more individuals is a matter of concern to us.  Given all the reports undertaken into incidents within the HSE one wonders whether the executive is fit for purpose at all.  Perhaps the transcripts should also go to the Minister out of concern for the issues raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C00900"><p>There is a good deal in this.  As you have said, one of the issues the committee dealt with has to do with procurement and tendering.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has carried out reports on the matter.  Across the board when it comes to the HSE it is clear that the executive is a bad actor, frankly, when it comes to tendering within public procurement guidelines.  When it comes to the issue that you have just raised and what the committee has dealt with in recent weeks, the appropriateness of hiring former HSE employees to do reports for the HSE on issues as disturbing as those we have been dealing with is questionable.</p> <p>  When Mr. O'Brien was before the committee and questioned with regard to the process whereby the tender was awarded, he pointed to some regulations that needed to be followed.  When he was questioned about whether they had been followed in that particular case and for the particular contract in question, it was clear that they had not because the procurement office said it had no communication with the HSE on the matter.  In hindsight the answer he gave was disingenuous.  We have done a great deal of work when it comes to this issue as well as the tendering of contracts by the HSE and the potential conflicts of interest that arise when former employees of the HSE get these contracts.</p> <p>  We should put a formal proposal from the committee to the Minister to change this arrangement.  Most of the work has already been done by the committee.  It would be simple to do.  The issues we have raised in the committee have not been raised in any other forum in the Oireachtas and therefore it is reasonable for us to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C01000"><p>I support Deputy Deasy's proposal, particularly in the context of the last meeting with HSE.  You might recall, Chairman, that in the afternoon session yourself and myself stumbled into the &Aacute;ras Attracta investigation by accident.  No more than the concerns Deputy Deasy raised in respect of the south east, the same questions were left unanswered in respect of who was involved and how the team investigating &Aacute;ras Attracta by the HSE was appointed.  To be honest, the answers that came from the HSE officials were wholly unsatisfactory.  We are still waiting to hear whether there is to be another investigation into something the HSE is responsible for and whether those involved have learned anything from it.  It seems to me that they have not.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C01100"><p>Maybe it is appropriate, then, given that proposition, to ask the clerk to do a short report on the basis of that meeting.  The members can feed into that and it could be done for next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C01200"><p>It will be the week after next.  We are not meeting next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C01300"><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General has done much work on procurement and HSE tendering.  I will preface my comments by saying that one would wonder about value for money as far as the taxpayer is concerned when it comes to a contract being given to a former employee and individuals who were known within the organisation and who had been there for decades but it is far beyond that, frankly.  The conflicts of interest that arise in these issues are incredibly disturbing and far supersede that consideration.</p> <p>  The premise is in place.  You have done a great deal of work in this area, Chairman, as has the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Perhaps you could feed into any report that the committee might do.  That would be useful.  Rather than simply point out the position, we should come up with a solution.  I think we should come up with a clear determination, as a committee, about what should not happen when it comes to the issuing of a contract by the HSE.  This should include an absolute bar on individuals who are former employees of the HSE getting these contracts.  I believe that step will need to be considered by the Minister and we should make that recommendation and consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#C01400"><p>The only comment I would make in that regard is that there may be a problem in law in respect of making a restriction completely debarring people who have legitimately set up in business from tendering for work.  The complication in this case was that it was people, who had previously worked for or who had been previously engaged with the HSE, who were appointed without any competition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#D00100"><p> If the Government is prepared to pass a law that prevents politicians or former politicians lobbying their former colleagues, I do not see a problem with the Government passing a law preventing former employees of the HSE getting contracts as it applies to cases like these.  Anything can be achieved if enough thought and consideration is given to it.  I understand Mr. McCarthy's point, but if the will is there and the potential conflicts are understood well enough by the Department, it can probably do that too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#D00200"><p>I do not want to argue for or against the proposition the Deputy is making because it comes into a policy area.  I am just saying there may be a restriction in terms of the contestability of the issue and excluding certain categories.  However, it is a matter that can be looked into.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#D00300"><p>We can bring forward a draft report that we will present to the Minister in a short format.  We can then discuss it and members can decide on recommendations, such as the one Deputy Deasy is putting forward.  It is clear, in the context of all these reports, that there is a crisis in the management of the HSE.  No political system or Minister could manage the HSE the way it is.  It will appear before the Joint Committee on Health and Children this morning.  The stonewalling that goes on when one is trying to sort out a problem is just incredible.  It is unacceptable and somebody will have to do something about it.  My concern is that while we are discussing this and while we had our meeting with the HSE and are now going to bring forward this short report with recommendations, there are individuals out there who are suffering because of it and nobody seems to mind.  The system seems to be conditioned to a high level of acceptance of this stuff going on.  It is not acceptable.  That is what members are saying in the context of trying to achieve balance and a change.  Somebody has to change the system in the interest of justice and fair play.  It is all one side at the moment and no one seems to be paying a bit of notice to any of the public hearings that are going on.  That is not acceptable.  We will have this short report as soon as possible.  We will put it before the members and then we can decide what is necessary.</p> <p>  All the correspondence that has been mentioned is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  No. 3B.1 is correspondence from individuals.  We dealt with correspondence previously from Mr. Philip Cantwell regarding illegal dumping of waste.  The correspondence is to be noted and published and the Department is to be requested to give a full up-to-date account of its investigations into this matter because it was raised directly with the Secretary General at the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will ask for that in a timely fashion, so that we can respond to Mr. Cantwell.</p> <p>  Correspondence from Mr. Paul O'Toole, CEO of SOLAS, regarding spousal travel in F&Aacute;S 2002-2008 is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Nos. 3C.1 and 3C.2 are documents relating to today's meeting, namely, the opening statements and briefing documents.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  Nos. 4.1 and 4.2 are reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting on 7 May from Trinity College, Dublin.  Regarding 4.1, the committee's attention is drawn to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset, which is standard for universities.</p></speech>

The work programme is now on the screen.  The clerk is providing us with a dossier on the information that was brought forward at a briefing session last week.  That will be ready for us in the coming week.  I presume that after it is made available to members we should make it available to the Department before our meeting with it.

In the course of our discussions and briefing, it was said that a recording was available to members if they wished to see it.  I ask the clerk to make that available to any member who wants to view it.  A date can be arranged on which a number of members can view it, or it can be reviewed independently.  Members should indicate their availability to the clerk so that we can arrange that.</p> <p>  Are there any questions on the work programme?  The D&aacute;il is not sitting next week, so our next meeting will be on 28 May.  We will be dealing with the Department of Social Protection.  Would MABS be brought in under that Department?</p></speech>

We have a duty of care to these people to ensure that what is happening in their name is looked after.</p><p>I am suspicious that the service that runs the fund is not audited internally or externally.

I think the Deputy is referring to section 8 of the 1993 Act which provides for inspection.

One of the major points raised by Deputy Sean Fleming at the last meeting was that we are talking about a totally different scenario where many of the wards of court are living to quite an old age and the issue of investment has changed dramatically from what it might have been 50 years ago and, therefore, there may be a need to explore the matter to some degree.  If there are public moneys involved, there is an accountability issue for the committee.  The very least we need to do is to tease out and see what level of public moneys may be involved.  I agree entirely with the proposal that we should invite them in and let us take it from there.</p></speech>

Therefore, we will not get anywhere with regard to the recommendation in the report until there is some degree of change in thinking when it comes to transferring the oversight of this area to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If we are to do that I would ask the Department of Justice and Equality to be involved as well.</p></speech>

Obviously the recommendation is very important.  Much of the funding would come from the estate of the people concerned.  It would not always come from insurance companies.  It could be the residual of probate.</p></speech>

Members of the committee may wish to note that the accounts do not include a balance sheet.  The accounts have a statutory purpose of providing an annual statement of Central Fund transactions on a cash basis and are not intended to be a comprehensive set of annual financial statements for the State or for central Government.</p> <p>  The national debt accounts, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and audited separately by me, are also presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.</p> <p>  The chapters from my Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2013 that are the subject of today's meeting were compiled to highlight key aggregates and trends in Central Fund transactions and in broader State liabilities.  Chapter 1 summarises the Exchequer's financial outturn for 2013, when Central Fund issues exceeded receipts by &euro;11.5 billion.  Receipts into the Central Fund in 2013 totalled &euro;44.1 billion, an increase of 7% year on year.  Issues from the Central Fund amounted to &euro;55.6 billion in 2013, a decrease of 1% year on year.  Figure 1.1 shows the trends in issues and receipts from 2002, and the progress being made in closing the gap between them that emerged during the recession.  Some significant developments during 2013 which the committee may wish to note are an increase of approximately 28% year on year in the cost of servicing the national debt, which in 2013 amounted to &euro;7.5 billion; an increase of 24% year on year in Ireland's contribution to the EU budget, which amounted to &euro;1.73 billion in 2013; and payments of just over &euro;1 billion under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, following the winding up of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation in February 2013.  These were mainly payments made to bondholders and depositors with IBRC, arising from protection provided under the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.</p> <p>  At the end of 2013, Ireland's general Government debt stood at approximately &euro;216 billion.  The debt represented 123% of Ireland's gross domestic product, compared with 117% a year earlier.  The principal component of the general Government debt at the end of 2013 was borrowing by the NTMA on behalf of the State, totalling &euro;197.5 billion.  This is referred to as the "gross national debt" and is accounted for in the national debt account.  It increased by &euro;36 billion or 22% during 2013.</p> <p>  A substantial part of the increase in the national debt in 2013 related to the extinguishing of the promissory notes issued in 2010 by the Minister for Finance to the predecessor institutions of IBRC.  These notes were not included in the NTMA's national debt accounting but were included within the definition of the general Government debt.  The promissory notes held by the Central Bank as collateral for lending to IBRC were replaced with floating rate Government bonds issued by the NTMA when IBRC was placed in liquidation in February 2013.  The new bonds form part of the gross national debt, accounting for 23% of the Government bond debt in issue at the end of 2013.</p> <p>  Medium and long-term debt at the end of June 2014 accounted for just over 90% of the gross national debt.  Figure 2.3 presents a maturity profile of this debt, which indicates that, at that date, approximately &euro;100 billion falls due for repayment or refinancing in the period up to and including 2020.  Funding received under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland accounted for over one third of medium and long-term debt.  Since the publication of my report, Ireland has repaid &euro;9 billion of EU-IMF funding ahead of schedule, with the agreement of other programme lenders.  The Accounting Officer can update the committee further on this.</p> <p>  As I said, Exchequer payments in 2013 related to servicing of borrowing undertaken by the NTMA were approximately &euro;7.5 billion.  The NTMA estimated that the weighted average cost of servicing the gross national debt was just under 4% at the end of June 2014.  At that date, around 88% of the debt was at fixed rates, including debt where hedging had been undertaken.  The balance of the debt was at floating interest rates.</p> <p>  Cash and other financial assets held by the Exchequer totalled &euro;23.6 billion at the end of 2013, rising to &euro;25.4 billion at the end of June 2014.  High levels of cash balances had been maintained since the beginning of the financial crisis and the Accounting Officer can update the committee on the level of balances held currently.  In the past, the bulk of Exchequer cash balances were held in the form of deposits with the Central Bank.  In contrast, by the end of June 2014, only around 19% of the total was held as cash on deposit in the Central Bank.  The rest of the assets were held in a variety of forms, including short-term bank deposits with commercial banks, non-Irish treasury bills and instruments called tri-party reverse purchase agreements with financial institutions.  Such investments typically earn a higher rate of return than the interest on Central Bank deposits, but they also carry a higher risk.</p> <p>  While the form in which Exchequer balances are held has changed significantly, with greater investment in higher yielding and higher risk instruments, the average return on Exchequer balances is still lower than the average cost of borrowing.  This means that there is a cost to the Exchequer associated with holding high levels of cash balances.  The Minister for Finance has not set a specific monetary limit for the level of cash and financial assets maintained by the NTMA.  At the time of my report, the NTMA stated that its aim was to maintain these balances at a level high enough to cover at least 12 months' Exchequer funding requirements.</p> <p>  Finally, the 2013 appropriation account for the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance records expenditure totalling &euro;27.3 million on five programme areas, up from &euro;26.2 million in 2012.  The programme areas relate to the costs incurred in respect of European Union and international policy; financial services policy; fiscal policy; and economic policy and provision of shared services.  The expenditure on financial services policy recorded in the appropriation accounts is &euro;9.6 million.  However, it should be noted that this is not the full cost of the financial services policy function, because it does not include costs associated with staff who are seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues and certain related consultancy costs.</p><p>These costs are borne by the NTMA and not recouped from the Department.  The level of costs incurred on these services is not disclosed in either the appropriation accounts or the NTMA's financial statements.  At the end of 2013 the Department had underspent by &euro;8.6 million, which amount was, accordingly, liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#G00300"><p>With me today are Ms Nolan, second Secretary General and head of the banking directorate; Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist; Mr. Declan Reid, shareholder management unit, and Ms Cep Carty, finance unit.<br/><br/>As the committee is aware, I was appointed Secretary General in July last year.  In addition to speaking to the issues and items on the agenda, I propose to touch briefly on some of the things we have done within the Department during that time.<br/><br/>The first item on the agenda is the 2013 appropriation accounts for the Department.  The Estimate for 2013 was set at &euro;33.187 million.  The spend was &euro;24.6 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered of approximately &euro;8.6 million.  The savings arose in three main areas: banking related consultancies, in respect of which there was a saving of &euro;3 million because of cost-sharing with the industry and the later than anticipated timing of national payments plan projects; non-administrative pay budget costs, in respect of which some &euro;2 million in savings were recorded because economies had been achieved in our EU Presidency work, while certain IT infrastructure projects such as ePQ and eSubmissions systems were undertaken in-house rather than being contracted out; and budgets provided to enhance external and international engagement which had been completed using internal and cross-departmental resources or funded by the receiving organisation.<br/><br/>Since 2013, the Department has operated within reduced budgets of &euro;31.2 million and &euro;30.6 million in 2014 and 2015, respectively.  This reflects a number of key changes, including the transfer of some staff to the shared payroll services in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It also reflects the ongoing focus on cost control, having regard to appropriate resource allocation in the context of wider deliverables in the Department.<br/><br/>With regard to the other three items on the agenda which are Exchequer focused, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the following key statistics.  Tax revenues increased from &euro;37.8 billion in 2013 to &euro;41.2 billion in 2014.  That trend is continuing in 2015, with tax revenues for the first four months at &euro;12.8 billion, or 4.2%, above the expected profile.  The Exchequer deficit fell to &euro;8.2 billion in 2014 and we are forecasting that it will drop to about &euro;3.5 billion by the end of the year.  We expect to move toward a balanced budget by 2018.  On general Government debt, the debt as a percentage of GDP is projected to drop to 105% in 2015 from a peak of 123.7% in 2013.  We project that this downward trend will continue and that by 2020 we will be well below 90%.  All of these trends are very positive and encouraging.<br/><br/>After a number of very difficult years, the economy is showing signs of recovery and the medium-term prospects are bright.  Budgetary policies continue to focus on the need to reduce public debt and, within this, to generate sufficient funding for public services and boost the growth capacity of the economy.  A modest recovery in the economy has been under way since 2011, but it has gained momentum in the past 12 or 18 months.  We are seeing improvements in domestic consumption, people have more confidence and are willing to spend and, for the first time since the crisis, made a positive contribution to economic growth in 2014.  We expect this to continue.  Much of the competitiveness lost during the boom has been recovered.  Unemployment, while still high, has fallen by 5 percentage points and is set to fall below 10% in the coming months.  The number in employment has grown by 95,000, or 5%, from its lowest point.  The Department forecasts that employment lost during the downturn will be recovered by 2018.<br/><br/>The improvement in the public finances goes hand-in-hand with the improvements in the economy.  The general Government deficit has fallen from a peak of 11.5% in 2009 to an estimated 2.3% by the end of this year.  Gross Government debt has peaked and fallen.  We expect to get to a rate of around 100% of GDP by the end of 2016.  Appropriate fiscal policies will continue to be necessary to ensure deficit and debt levels maintain their downward trajectory.  The recently published spring economic statement clearly signals that this can be achieved within the fiscal rules, allowing for a modest increase in expenditure, balanced by a focus on taxation measures, while still complying with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The spring economic statement is an important development and reform in how we budget.<br/><br/>Tax policy is one of the core functions of the Department.  For several years we have been reforming and modernising the way we develop tax policy advice.  Central to this is much greater emphasis on open public consultation processes which lead to better evidence based policy making.  The contributions of all stakeholders, interest groups and individual members of the public are welcome as part of this process and carefully assessed.  We are using public consultations more and more across the entire Department as a way of improving policy outputs.  Last year there were seven separate public consultations on tax policy, ranging from the OECD BEPS project all the way through to agricultural taxation expenditures.  This year there will be three additional consultations on the knowledge development box, the local property tax and the taxation of zoned but undeveloped land.  To ensure policy proposals are robust, we introduced in 2015 new tax expenditure guidelines to assist with <i>ex ante </i>and <i>ex post</i>evaluations of expenditures.  A workshop was held for all Departments and State agencies to set out the requirements of the new guidelines, which will have to be followed when tax expenditures are proposed.  The Department has also initiated an annual tax policy conference, now in its third year, at which more than 150 stakeholders, academics and policy makers discuss tax policy issues.  Papers on topical issues which are examined by the tax strategy group in advance of the budget have always been published and provide a very good source of data and a narrative from the Department across all tax heads.<br/><br/>Work continues on a wide range of challenging issues within the banking and financial sector.  The investment by the taxpayer in the banks has been unprecedented, totalling over &euro;64 billion.  This investment comprised &euro;34.7 billion in Anglo Irish Bank-INBS and &euro;29.4 billion in the three viable banks of AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB.  Our objective in the Department is to help recover as much and preferably all of the money the taxpayer invested in these living banks.  Over the course of the past two years major steps have been taken to reduce the overall cost of recapitalisation.  The liquidation of IBRC and the replacement of the promissory note by floating rate bonds in February 2013 reduced the gross borrowing requirement of the State in the next decade by some &euro;20 billion.  The sale of debt investments in Bank of Ireland, the sale of Irish Life and the repurchase of the contingent capital notes by PTSB have led to the return of around &euro;5.5 billion to the State in the form of capital receipts.  In addition, some &euro;5.9 billion has been received in interest and fees across all of the banks.  The preliminary independent valuation of the State&rsquo;s equity and preference shareholding in AIB, recently completed by the NTMA, stands at &euro;11.7 billion.  The State also holds &euro;1.6 billion in convertible capital notes in the bank.  Our equity investment in Bank of Ireland, based on current market prices, is approximately &euro;1.6 billion.  That brings the total current value of the State&rsquo;s investments to over &euro;16.1 billion, including its equity investment in PTSB.  We are confident that over time the aggregate funds the State has invested in the three banks will be recovered.  PTSB has recently announced that it has raised &euro;525 million, a significant milestone in its recovery.  As part of the raising of capital, the State will recoup &euro;509 million in capital receipts from the sale of shares and the repurchase by the bank of the contingent capital notes invested in by the State as part of the 2011 recapitalisation of the bank.<br/><br/>The success of the liquidation of IBRC to date has far exceeded expectations at the time of the promissory note transaction in 2013.  In October 2014 the debt acquired by NAMA as part of the promissory note transaction was fully repaid.  The success of the loan sales process removes any residual risk of further calls on the Exchequer.  To February 2015, the second anniversary of the liquidation, &euro;16.5 billion in cash inflows had been generated.  This has allowed for the payment of &euro;14.7 billion to IBRC creditors and resulted in a cash balance of &euro;1.85 billion, which ultimately will be available for distribution to creditors, including the State. <br/><br/>The international financial services strategy commits us to protecting and enhancing the competitiveness of the funds industry.  The Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Act 2015 is an important step towards that goal.  There is a strong linkage between a number of work streams within the Department and the IFS2020 strategy launched in March.  We are fusing these together to ensure we can fully support this important Government initiative and deliver on our commitments in the strategy actions.<br/><br/>There has been a suite of interventions designed to address the issue of mortgage arrears, including specific Central Bank targets, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the recasting of personal insolvency legislation, the provision of advice through Department of Social Protection-led initiatives and the mortgage-to-rent scheme.</p><p>It is a positive development to be able to report that the number of mortgages in arrears is declining year on year, although the issue of longer-term arrears remains a big challenge.  For example, according to Central Bank data, the number of principal dwelling house accounts classified as restructured at the end of 2014 stood at 114,674, an improvement of 29% on the number of restructured accounts for the same period in 2013.  As members will be aware, further enhancements were announced by the Government yesterday in terms of bank vetoes in the insolvency process, further resources for Department of Social Protection-led initiatives and changes to the mortgage-to-rent scheme.</p><p> At the end of 2014 NAMA had redeemed a total of &euro;16.6 billion of senior bonds, which represents approximately 55% of senior bonds issued.  NAMA is confident, assuming current market performance is sustained, that it will be in a position to fully repay its borrowings and hopes to achieve a surplus over its lifetime, thus eliminating the State&rsquo;s contingent liability.</p><p> Turning back to the Department, we have placed a high emphasis on resources in the past few years, including the upskilling of staff through a continuous training programme and an improvement in information systems that are integral to our day-to-day business.  This is and will be a continuing process.  In the past year the executive board and I have concentrated on three areas - learning and development, the structure of the organisation and governance.  The Department of Finance is a knowledge-based organisation and our people are our most important asset.  As an organisation, we must always seek to ensure staff have the requisite skills for the job, complemented by our investment and focus on performance management, the enhancement of our IT systems, employee engagement, workforce planning and learning development.  These developments are managed and led by our senior management team and actively contributed to and supported by our staff.</p><p> The learning and development strategy 2014 to 2016 was published in October 2014.  It is aligned with our business needs and plays a crucial role in supporting the organisation.  It is a living document that will change as the needs of the Department change.  Strategies for learning include building skills capability through effective training and the development of a learning culture within the organisation; developing talented staff through bespoke training; continuously acquiring new knowledge and skills; and learning and improving from experience.  For example, consistent with our overall emphasis on learning and development in the Department, a comprehensive technical tax training initiative has been put in place for departmental staff through a strategic training partnership with the Irish Tax Institute, as has a training initiative on project management, leading to the award of both a diploma and international accreditation.  The Department is very proud to have been shortlisted, in the top three, for the best learning and development organisation in the Irish Institute of Training &amp;amp; Development awards 2015.  It intends to build further on this initiative, particularly in the context of benchmarking our learning against industry standards.</p><p> Our organisational structure derives from our core job of providing policy advice for the Minister and the implementation of Government decisions.  For the purposes of day-to-day management, we have significantly simplified the structure of the Department by creating two directorates - an economics and fiscal directorate and a finance and banking directorate.  Within each there are a number of divisions.  The economic and fiscal directorate reports directly to me and is focused on economic, budget, tax and international engagement.  As Accounting Officer, corporate affairs, HR and departmental finances also fall within my remit in this directorate.  The second directorate focuses on finance and banking, including credit, lending, EU and domestic financial legislation, shareholding management, risk, legal and compliance matters and engagement with international financial institutions.  This directorate reports to Ms Nolan in her role as second Secretary General.  She also acts as deputy to me in the overall management of the Department.  This change meets one of the key recommendations made in the Wright report.</p><p> My other objective has been to enhance and promote good corporate governance and compliance within the Department.  Work has just been completed on a governance framework for the Department, the purpose of which is to provide a clear and comprehensive summary for all staff of how we work within the Department.  It ensures a framework of structures, policies and processes are in place to deliver on our obligations.  It is envisaged that the governance framework will be further developed over time and have regard to implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan which will inform any update in the future.  The codification of the governance framework for the Department, its roll-out to all staff and the embedding of its principles in how we do our work are important developments.</p><p> I acknowledge the work and contribution of all the staff of the Department.  The progress we have made would not have been possible without them.</p></speech>

I understand he was only appointed in July 2014, but I wish to refer to some historical issues on which we need answers because this is the first opportunity Department of Finance officials have had to respond to parliamentarians directly on these issues - Siteserv, in particular - the timelines involved and the issues that have arisen.  Mr. Moran may delegate as necessary to provide responses to the questions.  Although he may not have been the person involved in the meetings, we need clarity on the issues involved, notwithstanding the written responses we have received from the Department in recent days.</p> <p>  I will start by asking questions about the Siteserv shares.  Media reports in the past couple of months have suggested there was a sudden spike in Siteserv share activity between November 2011 and February 2012.  I find it curious that it took a request from a Member of the D&aacute;il to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to initiate a potential investigation into issues that might have arisen from the sudden spike in share activity.  When the Department read media reports on an organisation, of which it had oversight through IBRC, which was in effect sold by the State, what did it do?  Did it make inquiries about the share prices and activity reported in late 2011 and early 2012?</p></speech>

I would preface any comment by saying I am anxious to assist the committee on this issue and that we provided a comprehensive background document for the committee on Tuesday evening.  I am also conscious of the review of the transaction being carried out by the special liquidators, assisted by Mr. Justice O'Neill, which needs to take its course.  Therefore, we will stay away from the transaction and its details and talk around the framework and the relationship.</p> <p>  On the alleged spike in share transactions, the monitoring of share transactions is a matter for the Stock Exchange which does not fall under the aegis of the Department.  Where there is suspicion of anything happening along the lines the Deputy has described, the Stock Exchange is obliged to communicate with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015051400002#H00600"><p>Let me stop Mr. Moran.  The public is listening to us and everything in the country has supposedly changed.  However, while we have not concluded our banking inquiry into what happened seven or eight years ago, we are now finding that we are conducting another inquiry into a bank we own.  Somebody might ask the question: "What is worse governance wise?"  Was what happened in the 2000s in banks we did not own and of which there was no oversight and regulation worse?</p><p>The answer is that that was worse, given the devastation caused to our country and people.  Technically, though, what is worse in governance terms is that we are holding an inquiry into a bank that we owned.  That is how I will premise my comments.  If the Department of Finance technically does not have a remit over the investigation of alleged insider trading, I am not sure whether it is sufficient to assert that that was not the Department's job.  The Department had oversight of IBRC.  The State owned it.  When the media reported an alleged spike in share activity, did anyone in the Department contact the Stock Exchange, the Garda or the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE?  If the answer is "No", we have a problem.  If someone robs my house, I go to the Garda and make a statement.  A Deputy has made a request of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  His office's answer was that it wondered whether it had a remit in this area.  We have an issue with the process when it comes to the investigation of alleged insider trading.  The answer to my question is that the Department did not contact anyone about an alleged spike in share activity.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the alleged spike happened several months before the transaction was executed or during the run-up to the transaction.

I am talking about the process.  We have a problem.  Compare this with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, which is a law enforcement commission, has an enforcement division and prosecutes civil cases before courts.  It is unclear what happens in Ireland where there is an allegation or report, but the SEC acts on media reports.  If it reads something about the industry in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, it acts on it.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement's response in a news article was that his office &quot;did not receive any requests from any other regulatory authority asking us to commence an investigation&quot; into Siteserv share trading.  This begs the question of what the office needs.  Is it a papal bull from the Vatican?  I do not know what initiates an investigation.  If the Department of Finance has no interest, we have a serious problem.</p><p>The problem with the Stock Exchange is that it is owned by stockbroking firms.  Someone might ask whether it is in the public's interest for them to have responsibility and remit for initiating an investigation.  Is this a fair analysis or point to make?  It is unbelievable that, if something like this is reported in the press, the Department of Finance does not have an opinion or will not ask even basic questions of the bodies and agencies that have a remit for alleged insider trading.  Is this not even remotely reasonable?</p></speech>

These do not fall within the remit of the Department.  I just want to be clear on that.

Before Ms Nolan speaks, I find it unbelievable that someone from the Department of Finance would not pick up the telephone if there were several reports about a spike in Siteserv's share activity, given what has been in the media in recent months.  The response from the ODCE was equally amazing.  The office made contact with "a number of other regulatory authorities with a view to seeking to establish as to whether any issues arise that might come within remit".  It did not even know what its remit was in this situation.  The Stock Exchange is responsible for monitoring any suspicious trading, but we are none the wiser as to whether it has conducted a preliminary inquiry or investigation.  It passes its files to the ODCE, which then investigates any alleged breach in company law.  Is it not always the case of something being someone else's job?  This must change.  Given what the country has gone through in the past ten years, surely the Department of Finance would have some interest in finding out whether someone or some agency or body was examining what has been reported.  This is reasonable, fair and simple.  Does Ms Nolan wish to respond?</p></speech>

The public will be amazed that the Department of Finance did not make even the most basic of inquiries of the ODCE, the Stock Exchange or the Garda into whether the issue was being examined, investigated or inquired into.  It is amazing.  The witnesses might say that they were not there at the time, that this was not their job or that, statutorily, this was not an issue for them, but the public will not buy that any longer.</p><p>What Deputy Catherine Murphy asked in the D&aacute;il was reasonable.  This committee should make inquiries, as the issue relates to taxpayers' money.  The Department of Finance held the opinion that there was potential for an awful lot of taxpayers' money to be lost, so a review was commenced.  It was concerned about an asset being sold for a price that was too small.  The very least the Committee of Public Accounts should do is to inquire whether the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has looked at the matter and whether it is inquiring into it.  We should echo what the Deputy asked for in the D&aacute;il Chamber, if the Department is not going to do anything, and take it from there.  It is unbelievable that the Department might not be prepared to make inquiries over the telephone, so the committee will have to do so.</p><p> I wish to inquiry about Siteserv.  As I said earlier, this is the first time the officials from the Department of Finance have had an opportunity to respond to questions regarding Siteserv.  They have given written answers to some of the questions we asked and, in many respects, the replies are comprehensive.  I will start with the date of the review conducted by the Department, which was a meeting with senior IBRC officials held on 11 June 2012.  What prompted the review by the Department?  What concern prompted the Department to seek a meeting on Siteserv?</p></speech>

The Department did not have visibility on the Siteserv deal.  Critical to this issue is when we first had an inkling that there might be an issue.  We got a representation from a member of the public expressing concerns, and then there was a series of one or two parliamentary questions which brought up issues of concern.</p> <p>  A routine monthly management meeting was held in April at which the question of alerting the Department was raised.  It was agreed with the chairman and CEO on 31 May that we would do so.  It was in response to an e-mail from a member of the public, some press reporting and parliamentary questions.  The review took place on 11 June, and Departmental officials and officials of the bank went through the various details on how the transaction was done.</p> <p>  The key element of concern was the first point that Siteserv led the sale and not IBRC - it was handed off to them - which gave rise to a range of other issues.  It was those types of concern.  We listened to the response, and there were five issues, all of which flowed from the fact that the company was allowed to run the sales process: not opening the sale to trade buyers, entering into exclusivity with a single bidder, the payment, the quantum of the payment to shareholders, and certainly the suggestion of not accepting higher bids.  That is what gave rise to it, and it was immediately afterwards.</p> <p>  We have looked at the records and we have searched thoroughly in the Department.  There is no record of details of Siteserv being provided by the IBRC to the Department before April 2012.</p></speech>

I want to be fair to all the people involved.  At the time the bank was taken over it was a going concern, and the ordinary course of business was, of course, ordinary banking business.  It was, I think, August to September 2010 when we put the bank into wind-down.  The ordinary course of business, in extent, changed because, at that point, they were then winding down.  This type of transaction was not captured.  It became an ordinary course of business and probably should have been captured.</p></speech>

As I said to the witnesses earlier, it is ironic that before concluding a banking inquiry into something that happened historically, we have initiated another inquiry into a bank that we did own.</p> <p>  I asked a question about the framework that existed initially.  I understand what Ms Nolan is saying, but a lot of people have reached the conclusion that, regardless of the issue of commercial freedom, the State and the Department of Finance did not act accordingly in terms of the oversight of IBRC, and had to change the framework document subsequently.  That is really what happened.</p></speech>

The 2009 relationship framework was based on a company that was supposed to return to being a bank.  Its normal trade was to be banking.  That changed in the latter half of 2010, with a business plan being agreed with the EU in January 2011, after which it went into wind-down.</p> <p>  There was a provision in the original relationship framework that any material acquisition, disposal, investment, realisation or transaction other than in the course of ordinary business would be a reserved function of the Department.  When it went into wind-down, such disposals became part of the ordinary business, and fell out.  That meant the relationship framework was no longer the right one.</p></speech>

We will get down to the nub of this now.  The suspicion is that the Act was enacted and the details within the Act were not followed through on and there was not a sufficient level of communication or inquiry when it came to the Department and the bank.  There is some reasonable evidence to suggest that the details of the Act and the spirit of the Act were not followed through on.  Ms Nolan has said that she went back through the files.  When it came to full access to information, does Ms Nolan believe now that there was a serious problem?  I think the answer is obviously, "Yes," because the whole framework was revised subsequently.</p></speech>

We had no option but to allow commercial freedom to the bank and to limit our inquiries, and that was insisted on by DG Comp.  One of the reasons the second relationship framework took a long time to negotiate was because DG Comp was reluctant to allow us to put in the kind of thresholds that would say certain documents would have to come to us.</p></speech>

The question of the revised relationship frameworks came up in August when we had the other major bits done and they were discussed then between August 2011 and March 2012 and that is when they were put in place.</p></speech>

We were going into a programme and a general election.  All conditionality that went with that programme had to be implemented as a priority for the release of funds.  In addition, the State was locked out of the markets.  As Ms Nolan has said, the rewriting of the relationship framework became a condition of the programme after the third review.  It was originally to be delivered by the end of December 2011 and it was not delivered until the end of the first quarter.  There was slippage on that.  That was a relationship framework negotiated between us, the bank, the three members of the troika, and DG Comp.  It was not simple.  It was multi-party.  To paraphrase what Ms Nolan has said, I think DG Comp wanted us to be even further away and more hands-off in our relationship with the banks rather than closer.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran has said that the Department then decided to put an official in on the board to keep an eye on things.  The board did not like it.  It begs the question whether it should have occurred much earlier.  That is the issue.  Therefore, we go back to Siteserv and other transactions, and we now have a public inquiry into whether the public achieved what it should have achieved through the sale of that.  The public did not expect the Department to fall down so badly so quickly after what occurred.  The requisite scrutiny was not there.  The Department changed it, effectively, at a certain point, but I do not believe that it was there.  I think the Department fell down.</p></speech>

The independence of the banks was an absolute prerequisite of DG Comp.  It remains the issue that the responsibility for the running of the banks is a matter for the boards of the banks and we appointed a board chaired by Alan Dukes, a former Minister for Finance, a very capable man.  I have no evidence, to this day, that any of the transactions were wrong, but I accept that there are many questions about Siteserv.  We had questions ourselves about Siteserv.  We do not know the outcome of the inquiry.  We have set up an inquiry to look not only at that but all of the other deals that that board did.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance would have a very clear opinion with regard to the amounts of money that were recovered from the sale of Siteserv, and the opinion of the Department of Finance was that it was not enough and that the State did not achieve what it should have.  That was, in effect, the opinion within the Department of Finance and that is why things changed.  So when Ms Nolan says that there is no evidence of anything that went wrong, there is a clear opinion that came from the Department of Finance that things were not as they should have been.</p></speech>

There were aspects of it where we felt it was possible that a different set of actions could have brought a better solution.  The board told us and assured us and the Minster that that was not the case, that this was the best possible transaction.  We have now asked the special liquidators under Mr. Justice O'Neill to inquire into that and look at all of the facts and establish whether or not they agree with the board.  Certainly, there were aspects of that transaction we were unhappy with.  There is a big difference between that and suggesting that everything that that board did was wrong-----</p></speech>

After all Ireland has been through, and especially the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance has now set up an inquiry, to report back to him at the end of August, with a blank cheque and with no fee having been agreed.  Have we learned nothing?  Has the Department of Finance learned nothing?  I understand daily rates and hourly rates, and I will pursue the witnesses on that in a moment, but we now find that the Department has appointed people to carry out an inquiry and to compile a report but cannot give me a figure for the fee.  Is it &euro;1 million?  Is it &euro;2 million?  As was said in the opening statement, it will be paid by the liquidator and may ultimately come out of what is available for distribution to the creditors, including the State.  So the Irish taxpayer is now paying for this inquiry.</p><p>I am sure the Department has agreed the number of staff and the hourly rate for those staff.  Can Ms Nolan tell me what KPMG charges for the work it is doing today?  How many additional staff will be required?  KPMG was given a ministerial directive to carry out this function.  There was no bid for the contract and it was not put out to public tender, which the Department could have done.  Instead, the Department decided to take a short cut and appoint KPMG because it was <i>in situ</i>and had the most access to the books.  We spoke about procurement and tendering a few days ago.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might comment on whether this was such an exceptional measure that it required normal public tendering processes to be put to one side.</p><p>How much is it costing per day?  Even if the Department cannot tell me, it must have an estimate. </p></speech>

I have 21 more pages of questions and answers about Siteserv and I probably have a total of 60 or 70 pages about Siteserv in my folder this morning courtesy of the Department.  I am asking a simple question.  There were calls for an independent commission of inquiry into what happened with Siteserv.  A decision was made to appoint KPMG so that it could get the job done by the end of August, but the Department does not know the figure for costs and does not even have the daily rates being charged.  Mr. Moran, that is a bad day for the Department.  We look at the Department as the custodians of the national finances, but it has appointed consultants to do work willy-nilly, without an agreed fee or a ceiling to the fee.  I am a former employee of KPMG and it is a good organisation.  I know the rates they charge.  They could easily have said, for example, that if the job took a month it would cost &euro;600,000 or if it took two months or more it could be a different figure.  They must have given the Department some indication.  Can the witnesses tell me about the discussions it held with KPMG about the total fees for this project?</p></speech>

I will leave him out of it because he is not here.  Did Mr. Moran not advise the Minister to take a few extra days?  There was talk during the week it all happened.  The Taoiseach wanted the Comptroller and Auditor General to do it and did not understand he could not do it.  The next day in the D&aacute;il the T&aacute;naiste wanted an independent authority to do it.  Independent people called for somebody independent to do it.  On Friday morning we had an announcement from Riga that KPMG would do it.  Then there was confusion and a judge was appointed.  The Secretary General is the Accounting Officer and the headlong rush into this by the Department to get it done quickly has exposed the taxpayer to the possibility of greater costs than might have been necessary had the Department taken its time and planned this or had the project put out to tender.  It might have taken longer but it would have been more independent.  Is this how the Department of Finance is still doing its business?  It just appoints people and tells them come back in a few weeks to tell it how much they think it will cost.  This breaches all public procurement rules.</p></speech>

The person with all the information to have the capacity to review the concerns the public might have is the special liquidator.  A contract is already in place, which was properly negotiated . A fee structure is in place.  Many statements have been made but at the end of the day this will be charged against the surplus in the liquidation, although possibly not the judge's fees.  It will not fall back on voted expenditure.  We have in place an existing arrangement, existing contracts and an existing fee structure.  The Minister has the power in the Act to issue a direction for the liquidator to take this on, which is what was done.  We should have a report by the end of August which will then be made available for consideration and we will see where we go from there.  This is a very quick turnaround.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran gave getting this job done expeditiously as the only reason for taking this route.

We will move on and agree to disagree on the independence issue.</p> <p>  I hate to say it but Mr. Moran's wording was very clever and accurate but nicely confusing to the public.  He made it very clear a minute ago, and rightly so, technically correct but giving the wrong impression, that the cost of this would not have to come out of any voted expenditure.  In his opening statement to us an hour ago with regard to IBRC, he said the liquidation has resulted in a cash balance of &euro;1.85 billion which ultimately will be available for distribution to creditors including the State.  What he is actually saying is it will come out of taxpayers' money because the State is the taxpayer.  He is saying any cost that comes out of this extra inquiry will come out of the amount available for distribution to the State.  That is in his opening statement and it is accurate.  He also said a minute ago that the cost of this inquiry will not come out of any voted expenditure.  That is also accurate.  If the people of Ireland, whom we are here to represent, listened to what he said a minute ago they would think this cost will not be voted in some way by the people because he said it would not come out of voted expenditure.  I must highlight he said a half an hour ago it will come from any distribution available to the State and the taxpayer.  The taxpayer is paying for this through the amount of funding that will come back as a result of the distribution.  A lower distribution will now be available to the taxpayer and the State because of the cost of this, and we still do not know to the nearest million how much it will be.</p> <p>  I apologise to the Chairman for the time I have taken on this point.  I expected a straight-up answer in this day and age on how much it will cost.  I was expecting to be told it was commercially sensitive, but I expected somebody somewhere to have a cost.</p> <p>  The essence of what Deputy Deasy said about Siteserv was a relationship framework was in place since 2009.  In the documents we received during the week Mr. Moran stated IBRC received further significant levels of State support and ultimately began pursuing an orderly wind-down strategy in accordance with the joint restructuring and work-out plan for IBRC dated 31 January 2011 which was approved by the European Commission and EU state aid rules.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran said he had a busy year, and everyone is busy, but the public will be disappointed that a decision was made on 31 January 2011 but it was 15 months later before the Department of Finance came back.  The revised framework was all under Mr. Moran's control.  Under the revised framework, the new arrangement states that representatives of the Minister can attend board meetings in an observer capacity.  Had the Department of Finance been doing its business in 2011 or earlier than that, the Minister would have had the right to have an observer at all the board meetings in 2011, long before the Siteserv deal was on the agenda.  The revised agreement also stated the Minister was entitled to be notified of any information he reasonably required.  All of this could have been in place long before the Siteserv deal came in.  It was in the ability of the Department of Finance to do that.  What is even more worrying from what Mr. Moran said a few minutes ago is that, ultimately, the troika put a deadline on it.  He said the troika had in its third review that this was to be done by the final quarter of 2011 and that it slipped to the first quarter of 2012.</p><p>Even if the troika had not been in town, the Department of Finance should have done this in a more expeditious manner.  If it had done so, that revised framework agreement would have been in place 12 months earlier than it was.  Why did it take 15 months to put the revised framework in place when the Department knew this was in a wind-down situation, approved by the EU on 31 January 2011?</p></speech>

The discussions about a relationship framework were happening from the beginning.  I have emphasised that it was a matter not just for us.  The negotiations included multiple partners including the Department and IBRC, but there was also the negotiation of relationship frameworks for the other banks, the three members of the troika and the Directorate-General for Competition.  It was negotiated over a prolonged period of time.  While it would have been much better if it had been put in place earlier, nobody was sitting on their hands and ignoring the issues.  The issues had to be worked through.</p></speech>

The issue for us was trying to get the frameworks in place for all the banks in a way that gave commercial freedom and involved no political interference in ordinary day-to-day business but enough oversight for the Department to ensure we were happy with how they were doing.  There was tension in the negotiations between the Department, the banks and the Directorate-General for Competition.  I am not sure the troika members had such a major issue in that regard.  It took longer than we would have liked to get them in place.</p></speech>

IBRC was not a bank at that stage.  It was a separate case.  While the other banks are continuing and, hopefully, prospering into the future, IBRC was not in that category.

This is how things happen.  It has been well reported that the legislation had been drafted several months beforehand.  Although people think it was rushed legislation, it was not.  It had been properly planned and drafted over a long period of time external to people and, understandably, the board was not made aware of it.  I understand the need for confidentiality.  I am sure Mr. Kieran Wallace had it in his top drawer and was out with it the minute he received the phone call.  It was rushed through the D&aacute;il.  There is an impression that it was produced that evening and rushed through the D&aacute;il.  When exactly in 2012 did the Department make the decision?  It was simultaneously expressing concerns about Siteserv.  Ms Nolan has said the two events were not linked.  When did the Department begin the process and memos about the special liquidator for IBRC and when were the first and second drafts completed?  Who drafted it?  I am sure it was done externally.  When did the Department have something on it in place.  It sat for a while until it was deemed that the appropriate time had come to launch it.</p></speech>

It became clear to us that there was no political appetite to pay cash for any of the promissory notes.  It was clear that the ECB was not going to accept a further repo similar to what we had done.  There was a &euro;3.6 billion payment on the promissory note which was to happen every March for ten years.  It was paid that March by issuing a bond from NTMA, which was given to IBRC, which was not in a position to use the bond with the ECB.  It swapped the bond for cash with Bank of Ireland, and Bank of Ireland was in a position to go to the ECB to get cash.</p></speech>

It is known as a repo.  It is a swap.  I give you the bond and you give me the money but at a later date we will swap them back.  This meant between that March and the next March we had to come up with an alternative treatment for the promissory note.  We had been in discussions with the troika for some time about different options, none of which was attractive from the point of view of the Irish State because most of them were much more short term than the one we ended up with.  The first mention I remember of a possible liquidation of IBRC was in the very beginning of September 2012, when there was an initial discussion involving the Department and the troika members, on a very small scale, about whether we could replace the promissory note with long-term bonds if IBRC were liquidated.  If IBRC were liquidated, the promissory note would be left in the hands of the Irish Central Bank.  The ECB was extremely unhappy with it having it, we would volunteer to swap it for long-term bonds and the bank would be liquidated.  This was totally separate from the questions on Siteserv.</p></speech>

Towards the end of September, after a number of discussions with various parties involved, it became clear that it might be a viable option.  The first heads of Bill were done in our Department at the end of September.  We were in negotiations with the Office of the Attorney General and the Bill was entirely drafted between our Department and the Attorney General's office.  We had a first draft that was workable by the middle of October, which we revised a number of times to produce an improved final draft.  We were very conscious that we had a drop-dead date of March and we did not know how long it would take to build some sort of consensus by which the ECB would be willing to note it - which it did in the end, although it did not agree it - and we did not want any fall-down on our part if that happened.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Moran and his team.  In referring to who is paying the appointee and to what his job will be, it would be wrong to make any inference about impartiality.</p> <p>  The success of the liquidation of the IBRC to date has far exceeded the expectations at the time of the promissory note transactions in 2013.  In October 2014, the debt acquired by NAMA as part of the promissory note transaction was fully repaid.  The success of the loan sales processes negated the need to transfer any assets to NAMA as part of this process and removed any residual risk of further calls on the Exchequer.</p> <p>  It is important to put on the record also that loans of par value of &euro;21.7 billion have been prepared, brought to the market and sold.  Among other assets, loans with a par value of &euro;3.6 billion remain, which the special liquidator is to continue to manage.  To 6 February 2015, the second anniversary of the IBRC liquidation, &euro;16.5 billion in cash inflows have been generated.  This has allowed for the repayment of &euro;14.7 billion to the IBRC&rsquo;s preferential creditors and to meet costs to date.  This has resulted in a cash balance of &euro;1.85 billion, which will ultimately be available for distribution to creditors.</p> <p>  It is important that we put this in the context of the questions I will ask.  Perhaps Mr. Moran would like to comment on the great success on the part of the Department.  It is important that the committee, as an accountability body, acknowledge the extraordinary achievement in two years.  Maybe Mr. Moran will give an overview, after which I will have three questions to ask.</p></speech>

It was a remarkable deal.  It was a remarkable resolution in the end, led by Ms Nolan and her team.  As it has worked its way through, it has been very successful.  At the end of the day, there will be a residual of just under &euro;2 billion.  ELG fees owed will probably be the biggest part of the outlay.  One would hope the State will get some money back on behalf of the taxpayer.  The timing of that will all depend on the resolution of something like 300 court cases which are pending.  It will take time to work through but it has been a very positive thing.  Notwithstanding that, we must always be cognisant of the fact that the liquidation of the bank means we are pretty much not getting back the money that went into Anglo Irish Bank.  One has to recognise that on the other side of the balance sheet.  Some &euro;34 billion went in and it was liquidated.  In terms of getting money back, the Department is working towards getting back the money it invested in the other banks, the living banks.  It has been a successful project, however.  There will be creditors for that &euro;1.8 billion, with small amounts going back to local authorities, and larger amounts coming back to ourselves through the ELG and through the settlement of a range of issues.  The Deputy is absolutely right that it turned out to be an extraordinarily well-run and effective liquidation, coming out with a very good result ultimately.</p></speech>

It is easy to look back with the benefit of hindsight, based on things having changed, but at the time in question one was looking at a very dormant, bleak balance sheet.</p></speech>

One must remember the timeframe.  On 1 January 2009, Anglo Irish Bank was put into State ownership.  On 31 March, the larger provision for bad loans required was reported to the Department of Finance.  On 1 August 2010, Irish Nationwide Building Society was effectively nationalised.  On 15 September 2010, the Government decided the bank would be wound down over a ten-year period.  In November 2010, Mr. Moran led the development of the bank deleveraging plans for the IMF-EU-ECB memorandum of understanding.  The 31st D&aacute;il met on 9 March 2011.  Mr. Moran joined the Department of Finance on 11 March as second secretary in charge of the banking area.  On 1 July 2011 there was the court-mandated merger of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The core assignment of the IBRC was completely different then because it was dealing with the toxic loans.  The framework measures were put in place to manage the new relationship between the Department of Finance and IBRC.  Specifically, what new measures were introduced to reflect the more difficult and complex challenges being assigned to IBRC?</p></speech>

I can tick them off individually and if I miss any, my colleagues will fill them in.  We did not observe board meetings under the first framework.  Under the revised framework someone from the Department attended and observed board meetings.  We received all of the board documents under the revised framework but not under the original one.</p></speech>

I refer to the framework document, specifically regarding Irish Nationwide Building Society.  These are all toxic debts in cases that were absolutely hopeless.  Obviously, from 2009 up to that period, it was very much a loose arrangement, but from that date on, in the light of the scale of what was being taken over, was there much of a difference?</p></speech>

In terms of material transactions, consent had to be provided.  In the case of transactional reviews and the deleveraging committee, where previously the Department would not have been attending, it attended and observed and received the information at a current time.  There was a significant set of changes within the arrangements.  The Department was far more hands-on and had far more information available to it.</p></speech>

The document with responses to questions posed to the Minister for Finance in preparation for today's meeting of the committee states the shareholding management unit, SMU, within the Department was responsible for managing the day-to-day relationship with IBRC and that the SMU had daily instructions with the senior management team in the bank on a wide variety of issues, including the bank's performance, progress in deleveraging and various consent and consultation requests.  The reply also states formal monthly meetings were held between the SMU and senior management of the bank.  Did the SMU take notes on these interactions and is there any documentation on them in the Department?  Given the scale of the loans outstanding and the cost implications for taxpayers, I would have expected the Department to have kept meticulous records of such transactions.</p> <p>  Did the Department have an internal reporting system to senior departmental management and the Minister on the monthly progress of IBRC operations?  From what original source documents were such reports prepared and circulated?  Again, given the scale of the loans outstanding and the cost implications for taxpayers, I would expect the Department to have had in place the means to ensure the Minister was fully and regularly briefed on the key operations and other decisions of IBRC.  There is an amazing blank timeframe from August 2011 to 8 February 2012 when nothing appears to have happened.</p></speech>

There is an important difference in that period.  We had somebody in the bank.  We had much higher visibility of what was going on; therefore, any issue that might have arisen was dealt with in time.  It is quite different.</p> <p>  Regarding formal monthly meetings with the management team, notes would have been kept.</p></speech>

That was the case under both the original relationship framework and the revised relationship framework.  The revised relationship framework added dimensions to it.  That is at the end of the question about the primary changes.  More formal consent and consultation procedures were put in place, with the receipt of the monthly board packs and the corporate institutional recovery reports which gives us the high level side of what was going on in terms of the transactions.  There is also attendance at meetings of the board as an observer and at the transactions committee.  They are the important distinctions.</p></speech>

However, given the scale of the loans and the due diligence process that was ongoing, one can imagine the scale of concern about the indebtedness of the taxpayer regarding the outstanding loans and their cost implications and that one would be meticulous in this regard.

In the autumn of 2011 Siteserv could not repay a debt of &euro;150 million to IBRC.  It went to the market and IBRC hired Walter Hobbs to supervise the sale.  This is in the period all of these appointments were being made.</p><p>On 9 March 2011 the 31st D&aacute;il met and new members of the Government were appointed.  In March 2011 Mr. Moran joined the Department of Finance as second Secretary General in charge of banking.  On 1 July there was the court-mandated merger of Anglo Irish Bank.  On 6 October Mr. Cardiff became the Government's nominee to the European Court of Auditors to commence in February 2012.  The closing date for the receipt of applications for the position of Secretary General was 24 November.  On 21 December Siteserv's stock closed unchanged at 2 cent.  On 31 December Siteserv's stock hit a 52-week low of 1.5 cent.  On 31 January 2012 it closed unchanged at 1 cent.  In January 2012 the first media reports surfaced that Siteserv could be sold for less than its &euro;150 million debt.  On 15 January the <i>Sunday Independent</i>reported that Davy and KPMG were seeking a new owner for Siteserv, that it would be sold at a significant discount on its bank debt of &euro;150 million and that a bidding process was already under way.  The shareholder stock was almost at zero and it was unlikely any payment would be received.</p><p>In early 2012 there were 12 bids for Siteserv.  On 2 February Mr. Cardiff officially left his post and on 22 February Siteserv's stock increased by 0.9 cent or 45% for the second consecutive day.  On 22 February Siteserv's stock crashed.  On 28 February it soared to 0.5 cent.  On 1 March the Secretary General left his post having been appointed to the European Court of Auditors.  On 6 March <i>The Irish Times</i>carried a report on the new Secretary General, Mr. John Moran.  It was stated Mr. Dukes had said he had had private conversations about a wish to join the IBRC board shortly before he became Secretary General.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Mr. Moran&rsquo;s consistent theme this morning has been that all of these things happened and that he was unaware of them because he was not afforded the visibility required to ascertain exactly what was going on.  I note from the documentation that has been released under FOI and the documents we have that Mr. Moran was conscious for a number of years that there was public disquiet specifically around Siteserv, and obviously that penetrated to the Department.  Could I put it to Mr. Moran that, given the turn of events and his statement that he was essentially locked out from a lot of the information to which, in my view and that of the committee, the Department should have had access, it is astonishing that he would deem it appropriate in any way to suggest or recommend to the Minister that what amounts to an in-house, insider review by the special liquidator was the most effective or the most illuminating way to proceed.  I am astonished by that.</p></speech>

I know the Taoiseach mentioned the possibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General doing a report.  I spoke to the Comptroller and Auditor General himself about the legal framework in which that could or could not be done.  It became very clear that it could not be done under the existing law.  We looked at the option of having a commission of investigation under the DPER Act and we decided that it would take a great deal of time.  We were in a position to get something done in a relatively short period of time with the special liquidator.  Obviously, the option of having a commission of investigation afterwards is one the committee or the D&aacute;il could consider, but we decided to recommend something that could be done quickly.  There was a certain concern that we would just be seen to be kicking things away down the road and not looking for information quickly.</p></speech>

Do they also accept that, having been wrong-footed, sidelined or whatever term they wish to use, it is extraordinary that they would be happy to allow an arrangement in which there is a clear conflict of interest at play to be the chosen method of examining the matters in question?</p> <p>  There was some discussion earlier of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, whose integrity is beyond approach.  The very appointment of the judge acknowledges - game, set and match - that there is a clear and evident conflict of interest.  Different things have been put to the officials in the course of this morning&rsquo;s meeting, but what troubles me most is that, notwithstanding the fact that the officials said they had no visibility and that they were locked out, and due to the relationship framework, which I will come to in a moment, they now seem to have recommended to the Minister an approach that again raises questions around transparency and thoroughness, among other issues.  I find it quite something that this was the recommendation of the officials to the Minister.</p></speech>

The witnesses tell us that there was daily contact between officials in Mr. Reid's unit, one presumes, and the bank itself.  There were monthly meetings and so on.  However, at the core of this, in terms of the Department's watchdog role, I have formed the view that the Department was passive.  I put it to the witnesses that it is a convenient interpretation for the Department to say now that the relationship framework was restrictive and locked it out.  The facts indicate that the Department did not test the framework in anything like the way it should have if it was honouring its core objective, which was to minimise cost and risk to the public.</p></speech>

My understanding is that it was a challenging relationship.  It was at times a difficult relationship.  However, the concerns the Department had and the tensions that arose and which were reflected in particular around the period of the inquiries on Siteserv had, it is fair to say, run for some time.  How will I put it?  The Department asked awkward questions, and the extent to which-----</p></speech>

There was push-back from IBRC.  It was mentioned in the minute of the meeting with the Minister that the Department kept asking all these questions and that a better structure was needed.  There was that.  At the end of the day, the whole purpose of the shareholder management unit was to shadow, follow and question the operations of the financial institutions it was looking after.  I do not accept that it was passive.  Could it have been better?  "Yes" is the answer.</p></speech>

The independence of the board was absolutely paramount, and they were very conscious of that.  They brought it to our attention any time we seemed to step over in that direction.  It is illegal to have shadow directors following everything the directors do.</p></speech>

What interests me is that in the Department's explanation of the turn of events, it cites the original relationship framework and argues that it was restrictive.  The Department says its hands were tied, there was nothing it could do, it did not see it and it did not know it.  However, when one drills into the facts of this, it emerges that the Department did not, in my view, assert itself in the way taxpayers, citizens or anyone with an iota of sense would have expected.  The Department tells me that relationships were tense and Mr. Moran says there was push-back.  Is the Department saying it was bullied off the pitch?  Who was this push-back coming from?  Was it from the chairman and CEO, or did it manifest itself in the daily tic-tac-ing?</p></speech>

The transactions we are talking about here are quintessential to a winding-down process, which became the normal course of business and started to fall outside the relationship framework in terms of access to information.</p><p>It started to fall outside the relationship framework in terms of accessing information on it.

This has given rise to a number of dilemmas and questions in the public mind.  The Department did not fulfil the role that reasonable people would have expected from it in terms of keeping its eye on the ball.  Mr. Moran argues this is because the Department was kept out of the arrangement but it seems to me that it did not assert itself in the way that would be expected.  I do not buy his line that the fault was with the original framework.  I appreciate that the framework was subsequently changed but that argument does not convince me.</p> <p>  The issues arising in respect of Siteserv came to the Department's attention because of an e-mail sent by a member of the public.  In regard to the other transactions that gave rise to concern after the fact - all of these concerns emerged after the fact - I ask Mr. Moran to briefly outline to the committee how these matters came to his attention.</p></speech>

Some of the transactions were not concluded until the company was liquidated.  In regard to the other matters highlighted in the documentation, concerns arose about the Apthorp sale on foot of communication from somebody within the company to the Department about a conflict of interest.  We brought these concerns to the attention of IBRC and they were dealt with appropriately at board level.  To my recollection, that disposal did not happen until after the liquidation.</p></speech>

Another issue that strikes me is the level of trust or acceptance demonstrated by the Minister in the word of the chairman of IBRC, in particular, and the CEO.  I refer the witnesses to the review that was carried out in June.  To complete the sequence of events, the Department received an e-mail from a member of the public, alarm bells rang and a meeting was held on 5 April 2012 with the Minister, the chairman of IBRC, Mr. Dukes, the then Secretary General of the Department, Mr. John Moran, and Mr. Michael Torpey.  Various matters were discussed and, under the heading of other issues, Mr. Dukes mentioned transactions and relations that were subject to adverse press comment or innuendo and stressed that all such issues were handled on a commercial basis in the best interest of IBRC and the State, and without favour to any party.  It is interesting that the chairman raised the issue of these transactions rather than the Minister or the departmental officials.</p></speech>

Subsequent meetings were held in May.  It appears that everyone was continuing to take the word of IBRC and its chairman but none the less a review was carried out on 11 June 2012.  If this document is correct, it took one hour to complete.  The review was carried out on foot of a previous meeting on 31 May, at which it was agreed that the Department would review the Siteserv transaction to better understand the decisions taken.  The review document states that the Department was not in possession of documents on the transaction other than the timeline, which was received at the meeting, and that no file review was completed.  What does that mean?</p></speech>

We now have the picture - the Department gets word from the public, alarm bells sound, there are concerns, the issue is raised and raised again at the end of May, the review is agreed and this is the review.

Let us fast-forward.  I understand the documents we have are not complete documents.  Mr. Moran mentioned earlier that other material has been the subject of freedom of information, FOI, requests.  I think that relates to the monthly meetings.  Did I take him up correctly on that? </p></speech>

I do not know if that is possible but we might return to that point.</p> <p>  Let us move on.  The documentation we have suggests, as Mr. Moran said, that there were ongoing concerns and worries.  I presume that coming away from the review, which was not really a review, on 11 June the Department still had worries and concerns.  It is now May 2015.  Can Mr. Moran tell me what happened in the intervening period from 2011 into 2012?  This is the bit that concerns me.  There was no proper review and the Department had not got any clarity, satisfaction or comfort on any of the issues.  What was going on in the meantime in terms of the Department getting to the bottom of these matters prior to the freedom of information releases made to Deputy Catherine Murphy and others in the media?  Will Mr. Moran give me an account of what his Department did in the meantime in the intervening two years?</p></speech>

These concerns, all originating from a concern that the company rather than the bank was leading the transaction, were put to the chairman and he gave a reassurance that this had been executed correctly and appropriately.  The IBRC board has fiduciary and legal responsibilities and the chairman could not have given that assurance without serious consideration and, at the end of the day, the Minister, and ultimately the officials, accepted the assurances.</p></speech>

To complete the picture, in June the review, as such, happens and the matter is unresolved; then the July meeting happens, as Mr. Moran set it out; the reassurances are received from the chairman of the board; and, the Minister and, by extension, the Department clearly accepted those assurances.  In so far as Mr. Moran and his Department were concerned that was the end of the matter.  Is that right?</p></speech>

We had got to July and had the assurance of the chairman that this had been conducted appropriately through the board and that the board had executed its proper functions, and the Minister and the Department had in a sense moved on.

The Minister took that view, the transaction was completed, the Department moved along and there was a new relationship framework, "sin sin", story over.

The issue was then on the shelf and forgotten about until its recent emergence.  I can explain how I have come to the conclusion that the Department was passive in its relationship with this institution, and it is that sequence of events that strongly suggests that to me.

Even in the original relationship framework, there is a piece outlining that certain matters are "deemed reserved" for the Minister, etc.  There is reference to "keeping an eye" on the establishment of varying of any transaction or arrangement between Anglo Irish Bank and a director, a former director or any connected person of a director or former director on terms other than normal commercial arm's length terms agreed in the ordinary course of business.  In the original framework, there was such knowledge.  We live in a small country and people operate in small networks, and there was to be an eye given to the potential conflicts and relationships at play.</p></speech>

I am talking about document No. 8.  Going on from there, under the sections entitled "Our Position" and "Business Conduct", there are blanks.  It is difficult to believe, in the context of the work of this committee, that anyone could stand over the blanking out of that much information from documents that we are trying to examine.  Will Ms Nolan look at the amount of paperwork in the Department related to the concerns that were expressed about transactions by officials within the Department?  Consideration must be given to the fact that if a business is purchasing from IBRC it is up to the business to get the best deal possible, but it is up to IBRC and the Department's officials to ensure that taxpayers' interests are looked after.  I want to see within those documents how well that interest was looked after, because it would seem to me that someone fell asleep at the wheel.</p> <p>  Earlier, Deputy Perry was trying to tease this out when he spoke about the various activities within the Department about the Secretary General and, perhaps, others.  Listening to what he had to say, I suppose it is going too far to describe it as a shambles.  However, it would seem to me that someone lost track of the course of things when officials were replaced, while on the other side - the commercial side - no one lost sight of what was going on.  I am not talking specifically about one company.</p> <p>  Returning to my question, will the Department release the information on the concerns its officials had about the various transactions without redaction?  I do not expect Ms Nolan to answer that now, but she can certainly follow it up.</p></speech>

In this document, the Department explains its position.  It is a briefing note for a meeting with the CEO and the chairman of IBRC.  It talks about "a clear example of IBRC's lack of regard for the Minister's wishes".  This was in July 2012.  The Department's briefing note is really outlining the total disregard that IBRC had at that time for the Department and for the Minister.</p></speech>

It goes on then to state, "There have been other instances where senior management in IBRC have shown similar disregard for the spirit of the Relationship ...".  It is fairly strong language in the context of a briefing note.  Indeed, in terms of the request to increase the payments to staff within IBRC, they have totally disregarded the Department.  They were treating the Department as if it had no input into this.  Is that correct?  I presume that is why the Department provided the briefing note.</p></speech>

The briefing note then goes on to deal with the appointment of non-executive directors, which was suggested in November 2010, stating "and despite a letter issuing to you to progress the appointments in January it has taken until June for the Board to approve appointment".  This was a bank that was clearly born out of trouble and was in trouble, showing absolute disregard for the Minister and for the officials in the Department, and the Department's response to it was to roll over.</p></speech>

This meeting was one of two meetings.  There was that meeting with the Minister and a follow-up meeting between John Moran and Mike Aynsley.  Our response to this was to place a very senior member of staff with banking experience from the Department onto IBRC's executive board committee to ensure that we had better co-operation subsequently.</p></speech>

The Department's briefing, dated July 2012, centred around, for example, remuneration issues.  It describes a request, "Approval sought for an appointment", and stated, "Proposed salary was almost 40% more than [the] equivalent" in other banks.  For an interim head of internal audit, they sought approval, but "Appointment did not proceed".  For an internal head of HR, "Appointment did not proceed".  There was legal advice "on 60% time" at a rate beyond what was the norm.  All of this was being discussed.</p><p>It appears that the Department was battling with IBRC over the direction it was taking.  It appears that it was taking ownership and that it did not want the Department putting its nose into its business.  It seems that the Department's strong advice to people in attending meetings stopped at that because not much was achieved.</p></speech>

It seems that the Department had to fight with it all the way.  It was comparing IBRC to NAMA and suggesting what should happen about salaries, but that did not happen.  The Department then went on to raise issues about various sales.  Its position was that a number of governance concerns had arisen from a particular incident and it was concerned about the fact that a matter about a member of the senior management team was not addressed or communicated to the board.  There were concerns about the simple transaction of communication not taking place between management and the board.  IBRC was ignoring everything to do with good governance, with no respect for taxpayers' money and the Department&rsquo;s involvement in the process, and just proceeded at speed.  All of this happened at a time when the Department had expressed concern about the manner in which certain transactions were being completed.  In fact, in the note on other business conduct concerns, it was stated the Department was concerned about the number of transactions that had been poorly executed under the direction of the current CEO and that the performance of management in executing these transactions raised a question about the effectiveness of the CEO.  Having made such a statement in the context of a private and confidential briefing document, I would have expected the Department to move decisively to correct the imbalance in the role being played by IBRC and the Department.</p></speech>

It was concerned about the way it was being dealt with and security of fuel supply, which obviously is very important because it has the contract for Dublin Airport.  We made sure it was talking to the right people in IBRC.  In the event, I think it was a little concerned that its loan would be sold.  It was not sold by the board of IBRC but was sold later by the liquidator.</p></speech>

Obviously, since they were working to me, I would have been aware of the issues at the time.  I think the briefing note which was written in a strong form indicated a certain frustration.  I agree with the Chairman, but I think a number of the issues were written down in a hurry and with a great deal of detail and when we looked into them, we were able to satisfy ourselves.  The point the Chairman raised, the one about which I was most concerned, concerned the concept of finding out late about things and not necessarily being treated in the most open manner.  We decided that we needed to address that issue by putting somebody directly into IBRC who would be on its management board.</p></speech>

She said it was written in a moment in time.  At this moment, reflecting on it, there was no need for concern.  Is that what she is saying?</p></speech>

Different aspects were reflected differently.  In terms of Siteserv, for example, as has been said by Mr. Moran to Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, the Department was absolutely reassured by the board that it had reviewed the matter.  They were the people with the fiduciary duty, which we accepted.  I now accept that there is still public concern, notwithstanding the fact that the board reassured us.  I am perfectly happy that there should be further inquiries.</p></speech>

That is from where the concern comes.</p></speech>

It is interesting, when we get to the meeting with the Minister, that he refers twice in the course of that meeting to wanting this relationship to work, questions more or less why these issues did not arise with the other banks with which we have a framework agreement and, equally, has to point out that officials represent him when they are looking for information.  This is not a good place and is the culmination of a number of things.  On the individual pieces, I listed them from one to six from the wealth management unit to Apthorp.  They are point in time concerns and different.  Some of them did not happen and some of them changed.  However, putting someone into the bank, as happened subsequently, was a way of trying to repair the flow of information and have oversight.</p></speech>

I am reading the documents to inform myself and taking out of them the view that the Department was not up to taking on IBRC and its determination to run on its own without departmental interference.  I take out of the documents the view that it did as it pleased to a point.  They tell us it had no regard for the Minister or the officials.  Mr. Moran is saying this; someone in the Department is saying it.  If the public are reading this, they will inform themselves about how the sales or transactions went.  However, it is clear that for a long period of time the Department had no control and it appears from the documents that it had no confidence in the CEO.  That is what appears in the documents and it is mentioned a few times.  If that is not the case, when briefing the committee, Mr. Moran should please say so.  We are asking for the documents to be informed.  If they are informing us incorrectly or if at the time they were written wrongly or should not have been written, that should be said.  Otherwise, those watching these proceedings will take a different view and we want to inform the public.</p></speech>

It was imperative to know how a bank that was State-owned was operating and how it was dealing with what were effectively State assets.  The excuse given was related to the very conservative viewpoint of the commission when it came to commercial independence.  I do not accept this and the Department should not have accepted it.  There should have been far greater ongoing scrutiny when it came to the operation of IBRC which, as the Chairman said, pretty much ignored the Department for a number of years.  It took a member of the public to contact the Department.  Only when that member of the public contacted it did it act.  That is the problem.  The Department then had to react and figured out that the decisions being made at senior levels within IBRC were questionable.  That is where we are.  Ultimately, what happened was that the Minister and the Department questioned and were given assurances by IBRC at a meeting that everything that had taken place was above board and carried out properly.  There was no scrutiny from day one.  The Department's attitude towards oversight within IBRC was coloured by an acceptance of the commission's very conservative viewpoint.  That is where the mistake was made and there needs to be an acceptance of this.</p></speech>

That culture of pushing the Department around was alive and well.  We did not have enough strength from the taxpayers' and the Department's point of view to simply take them on and put a stop to what they were doing.  There is still a lot of that culture in forcing any of the other banks to deal with the real issues in terms of mortgages, debt or support for businesses and so on.  Until such time as we take the bull by the horns and deal with the issue, we will be dealing with this type of thing day in and day out.  As part of the Department's restructuring - Mr. Moran mentioned this in his opening statement in terms of the quality and qualifications of the people involved and so on - it might be no harm if it got a few hard-nosed individuals from the private sector to attempt to deal with the banks because they are still out of control.  They are almost back on their feet and as soon as that happens, God help the rest of us.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran gave the figures for KPMG hourly rates, which ranged from &euro;95 to &euro;295 an hour.  Will he give us the numbers of people employed at these rates?  Does the Department have ten people on &euro;95 an hour or is it more at the upper end of the scale quoted?  If Mr. Moran does not have the figures available, will he, please, make them available to us as soon as possible?  How many hours have they clocked up to date?  Surely the Department knows that figure.  We clock in and out here every day.  I am sure the Department gets KPMG staff to clock in and out on a regular basis and that it has someone keeping an eye on them.  Can Mr. Moran give us a breakdown of the figures?</p></speech>

This was an entity for which the Department was responsible.  The response that the Department did not even lift the telephone to check to see if a preliminary investigation was ongoing in any respect when it came to the alleged share activity bothers me.  It suggests a level of inertia when it comes to looking at this issue that continues, which worries me.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on some of the issues surrounding Siteserv.  How were the relationships with the other banks?  It was indicated that the relationship with NAMA was quite positive.

That was done with the involvement of the Department, notwithstanding the fact it was the old relationship framework.  Mr. John Moran was involved with that and we would have had high visibility of all of the process, the bidding process and all of the decisions taken on that transaction, because it was such a big transaction.  Therefore, it is not an absolute that we had no visibility of the transactions that were done before the new transaction relationship.  The issue was that transactions could be done without their telling us about them.  However, we did have visibility of some of the transactions that happened at that time.</p></speech>

They came in a package on 7 April.  Therefore, the Department had four sets of minutes, but the set that was missing was the set for 15 March, the one in which the transaction for Siteserv was done.</p></speech>

If I was to speculate as to why it happened that way, it may be that because they had board meetings frequently, the board meeting of 20 March had the minutes from 15 March and the first board pack we got in April had the ones from the other meetings.

The minutes for 7 April were the first minutes for April.  We got later April minutes at later board meetings.  The pack we got had those particular ones.  I would be shocked if IBRC had gone as far as removing a set of minutes or if a set of minutes did not go to the board.  I can only assume that the minutes of 15 March went to the board at one of the meetings before our period on the board.</p></speech>

The revised framework was put in place and the Department received the first set of minutes following that, for the week after the revised framework was put in place.

We have not had time to go into the substance of the work the Department has been doing.</p><p>Reading the report and listening to the presentation, I can see the Department has done fantastic work managing the various difficulties it experienced, in terms of the amount of money and debt involved, to reach a stage at which it was able to save 25% in 2013.  That must be one of the highest ever savings in the running of a Department - &euro;8.6 million achieved through a series of steps to modernise the Department.</p></speech>

Has this matter been discussed between the Department as shareholder and the Central Bank as regulator?  These issues are in the public arena now.  What discussions have taken place with the Central Bank about possible regulatory issues?  Obviously the Department&rsquo;s officials had some issues.</p></speech>

The issue is whether it did a bad deal - whether a better one could have been done.  That said, we meet the regulator very regularly, fortnightly or monthly, once a month at the moment.  Any issues it has with any of the banks could be brought up, and IBRC would always be mentioned at those meetings.</p></speech>

Ms Nolan said the issues that arose were not regulatory issues, but the memo on the screen says the performance of management in executing these transactions raised the question of the effectiveness of the chief executive officer, CEO.  A fundamental part of regulation by the Central Bank is to have confidence in the CEO and senior management.  I do not know who wrote that memo, but if an official in the Department is able to write that memo about the effectiveness and the competence of the CEO - I am not saying I share those views - that is written down in front of me, that is an issue that should be brought to the regulator&rsquo;s attention, because the regulator has to approve senior positions, and if the regulator is aware of issues around the competence or effectiveness of the CEO, that is a regulatory issue.  Were these concerns passed on by the Department to the Central Bank, in view of the concerns the Department had about the management, which is a regulatory issue?  We could all say most of what happened was because of the performance of people in key positions.  That is a regulatory issue.  What did the Department do on that?  Ms Nolan said the Department meets the Central Bank every month.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that any concerns are expressed more strongly in that document than they might have been if we were being more careful about what we said.  Any concerns the Department had about personnel or transactions would have been shared with the regulator.</p></speech>

We need to contact the regulator, because everybody is talking about the shareholder and Siteserv and the special liquidator.

I made an inquiry to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport about using the fund to fund infrastructure in regional airports, specifically Waterford Regional Airport.  The Department told me that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was drawing up a paper on the strategic investment fund and how best to operate it from now on, because there are concerns that it could be better utilised.  There is a question of State aid when using State money or the strategic investment fund for particular infrastructure in regional airports, but the Department did not rule it out.  It did not rule out projects that did not come within the scope of the 2015-19 regional airports programme.  Beyond that, there was a possibility of its being used for that purpose.  It is significant if the fund can be used for a regional airport.  The only parameter is that there be a return to the State and that it generate regional economic development.  It is something that the Department of Finance launched and advertised and that it conducts.  I am hoping the Department of Finance might consider it with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and come to some conclusion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

Its business plan and strategy are in place.  There is a new board, the NTMA, which supervises it.</p><p>The investment committee is in place and the deals and projects are starting to flow.  It has two mandates, to derive a commercial return and a long-term economic return.  It must find a proper fit for regional development issues and projects so it is a question of getting the interaction right.  The Department of Public Expenditure is well aware of its prospects.  This is a new stream of potential development but it must show a commercial and long-term economic return.  The initiative will take a much more long-term view rather than a short-term one for a purely commercial return.</p></speech>

Along with the Minister, I worked on the initiative over recent years and I sought to extend it beyond Georgian buildings.  It is not an initiative that affects my constituency much but a few buildings will probably be affected.  Although the initiative took two years to develop with the European Commission, the Dublin Civic Trust has called it meaningless because it restricts grants being given to buildings larger than 200 sq. m.  The normal size of a Georgian building in Dublin ranges between 300 sq. m and 400 sq. m.  Does it defeat the purpose of the initiative, which has taken two years to develop, if there is a restriction?  Is the Department surprised by the attitude displayed by the Dublin Civic Trust?  Has the Department plans to extend the initiative?  To preclude buildings of between 300 sq. m and 400 sq. m would defeat the purpose of a very good scheme.  A lot of local authorities would agree with me that it is a good initiative and are using it to develop city centres.  However, the Dublin Civic Trust has a point if a certain category of Georgian buildings will be excluded.</p></speech>

The scheme started off as a pilot project for Georgian buildings in Limerick and Waterford and it has taken a very long time to get through the state aid process to here.  Along the way the criteria were widened to take in all buildings pre-1915 which has made it a more effective instrument to redevelop city centres.</p> <p>  The limit is 210 sq. m which is significantly greater than the maximum of 125 sq. m that was approved for previous regeneration schemes.  I am not clear in my mind whether the restriction was, ultimately, part of state aid approval.  In Georgian buildings one can redevelop floors and break up the project to avail of the initiative.  However, I take the point made by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Has someone in the Department not understood that in many cases Georgian buildings ranging in size between 300 sq. m and 400 sq. m are the ones that need the attention?  The response by the Department and from the individual who was questioned by one of the national newspapers was that we do not want to get involved in that type of mansion or give grants to those types of mansions.  That response was unfair and did not illuminate the issue.  Many of the houses we are talking about are not located on the south side.  They are on the north side of Dublin and deserve and need the work.  They have not been subdivided and their only chance of being upgraded is if they are included in the initiative.

The matter is worth looking at.  I do not know whether the size is a condition of state aid approval which, as the Deputy will know, took a long time to secure.  The purpose of the scheme was also amended during the course of negotiations.  Following a lot of consultation, the initiative was broadened to include anything built pre-1915.  We will come back to the Deputy on the matter.</p></speech>

I looked at the map drawn up by Dublin City Council on the buildings that are covered by the scheme.  The map looks like a puzzle and streets have been cut across even though they are the same housing age.  In other words, half a street is included while the remainder is omitted.  While it is worthwhile that the initiative has been extended to include more than Georgian housing, nevertheless the attempt to include all pre-1915 buildings has been unsuccessful.  I do not think any local authority has attempted to include all pre-1915 buildings.</p></speech>

The initiative has two serious defects.  The first one is what Deputy Deasy has indicated, that the initiative has a very low threshold of square footage in terms of what it applies to and, therefore, divides buildings.  Anyone who lives in a large Georgian building will be unable to avail of the scheme.</p> <p>  Second, the initiative is supposed to apply to pre-1915 buildings but it does so in a random fashion.  The local authorities have picked and chosen certain housing, streets and parts of streets that are pre-1915 but not other buildings.  It has taken a long time to get the scheme going from what was originally planned.  The initiative has existed for two or three years but its recommendations have not been well thought-out.  Can the Department take a fresh look at the anomalies in the scheme and find out why they have not been ironed out?</p></speech>

Earlier I suggested that we would review it today and determine whether we have to ask the officials to come back in when discussing the general Vote.  In the meantime we might take up the issue raised by the Deputies.  We can also write to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about the issue, if necessary.</p> <p>  I must leave to attend another meeting that is scheduled to begin at 3.30 p.m. so I will ask Deputy Deasy to take the Chair.  Before leaving I have two questions for the Department of Finance which are not for answer today but it can forward its replies to me.  Recently, I tabled a parliamentary question on Belfry investments to the Department but in its reply it referred me all over the place for figures.  If I was interested enough in Belfry investments to table a parliamentary question then the Department might have considered its answer and given me the figures rather than signposts to go elsewhere.</p> <p>  My last comment is for Mr. Walsh from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  On 5 March, the Secretary General of that Department, Mr. Watt, said he would circulate a note to the Secretaries General of Departments informing them that they should be timely in the context of their responses to this committee.  I wish, through Mr. Walsh, to bring to Mr. Watt's attention the fact the Department of Education and Skills has a number of reports on third level education, some of which came before us through whistleblowers, that we are anxious to have dealt with.  We intend to discuss other third level issues with that Department and the Higher Education Authority.</p><p>Can Mr. Walsh please ask Mr. Watt to remind that particular Secretary General that we are awaiting the replies?  If we do not receive them in a timely fashion, we will set a date for a meeting where we can include all the Government stakeholders and Departments and thrash it out publicly.  I presume Mr. Moran will come back to me with the information requested in the parliamentary question I tabled.</p></speech>

In 2012, &euro;85 million was paid, making a total of &euro;146 million.  Could the officials send us a spreadsheet showing the total payments in respect of fees and expenses?

The officials might give the committee the breakdown of the figure.  I suspect we are well over the &euro;200 million; I do not know.  The officials might give the breakdown of who got the payments between the IMF, the ECB and the Commission.  They can send that on.</p> <p>  Another schedule the officials can send on is that of the loans we drew down from the three different groups and the repayment schedules as to who gets paid.  I think some are being paid early.  That information can come through the committee secretariat.</p> <p>  Now that we are talking about the national debt, Mr. Moran's document states that the average cost of funding was about 4%.  We all hear how low it is to borrow, yet if the average is 4% there must be quite a lot much higher than that.  The officials might send us a note on the ten most expensive loans we have.  Are we still paying 7% or 8% on some debt?  The obvious question is why we are not replacing those debts with cheaper ones.</p> <p>  I am trying to give the officials my questions and I am happy for the answers to come back after the meeting.  I have only one question I would like answered here.  As regards the banks' support by the taxpayer, the officials are saying the three banks that are still alive will hopefully cover themselves.  The &euro;34 billion or &euro;35 billion that the taxpayer has put into the banking system, mainly into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, was in effect a write-down the taxpayers did to save the banks.  The officials might give us a breakdown of that between what went to the corporate business sector and what went for write-downs of personal mortgages.  I have a feeling it all went to business.  How does Mr. Moran see the proportion?  Very little of it seems to have gone for individual mortgage holders compared with the corporate end of things.  Do the officials think it was a fair proportion?</p></speech>

I know the two are related but it is only one of the factors that goes into the stress test.  Things like economic growth in the future and all that go into the stress tests as well.

The &euro;4 billion that was for Irish Nationwide Building Society would be all mortgages and not business, more or less.</p></speech>

They said that as part of the stress test done by the Central Bank or whoever, there was provision for some write-down of mortgages in some of the banks.  What I am asking is, how much of the funding in respect of possible mortgage write-downs that went to the banks as a result of the stress test did the banks actually use to write off people's accounts?  I suspect there is no relationship between the two.  I think they got about &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion for mortgage write-downs and there is no evidence they have done any of that in the market.</p></speech>

I think we have addressed this in a number of parliamentary questions and I do not think we can identify what part of the stress test capital that went in was for mortgage write-downs.  However, I will see what I can do.  I certainly can find out what has been written back.  It should also be said that on the mortgage side, in many cases and particularly in things like split mortgages, some of the banks have arranged that it will be written off eventually but not upfront.

My understanding was that NAMA had a 57% write-down on the debts that were transferred to it and on the impaired assets.  When officials from NAMA came before the committee, their statement was that they expect to make a profit or at least to break even.  NAMA has also said it intends to complete its transactions more quickly than the allocated time in the legislation.  I think they expect to do it by 2018 instead of 2020.  With the recovery in the market and comparing what the sale of certain assets was a couple of years ago to what is happening now, would it be better for NAMA to delay and go the full term that is allocated under legislation?  What is the officials' advice to NAMA?  The very recovery that is taking place is raising the value of the assets they have, which were previously impaired.  Instead of shortening the time, perhaps we should be thinking of lengthening it.  That might provide a better return.</p></speech>

While there are competing factors within the system, it would be fair to say that the elimination of all those contingent liabilities has been one of the big successes for Ireland Inc. and the overall economy in the 18 months since we left the programme.</p><p>The issue concerns the elimination of all these contingent liabilities.  We were having difficulty in borrowing, not just because of the level of our debt which was big but also because it was perceived by the market, regardless of whether we liked it, that the residual IBRC was a weight on the Irish taxpayer because of the guarantee.  The guarantee in the case of NAMA was also perceived as a weight on the Irish taxpayer.  The fact that NAMA has repaid the best part of 60% of its debt and IBRC has repaid all the Government-guaranteed part of its debt is a big factor in how the market has recovered.  The question of a further overhang always has to be balanced with the benefit to be gained; there is a benefit to be gained in getting rid of it as well as in holding on to it.</p><p> We have looked at strategic areas where a long-term investment and State involvement would be particularly useful, the main one being the housing market in the big cities where NAMA has the capacity to build houses that the rest of the system does not seem to be able to deliver.  It is providing 4,500 houses in the big cities.  Another example is the strategic development zones, particularly in the Dublin docklands where it does not have complete ownership but an interest in a huge amount property.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  And as we've a quorum, the Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now in public session, and can I remind members, and those in the public gallery, to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  We begin today with session one, public hearing, discussion with Mr. Laurence Crowley, former governor, Bank of Ireland, and Mr. Richard Burrows, former governor, Bank of Ireland.</p><p>I would like to welcome everyone to the 26th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with senior bank executives who had roles during and before the crisis.  This morning we will hear from witnesses from Bank of Ireland, both governor ... both former governor, Mr. Laurence Crowley, and Mr. Richard Burrows.  Dr. Laurence Crowley was governor, i.e. chairman, of the Bank of Ireland from 2002 to 2005, having previously been deputy governor from 1995 to 1997, and a non-executive director from 1990 to 2000.  Previously he was a partner in KPMG Stokes Kennedy Crowley, chartered accountants, where he specialised in corporate structuring and insolvency.  Richard Burrows was governor of Bank of Ireland from 2006 to 2009 and a non-executive director from 2000 to 2005.  He has held senior positions within the drinks industry, including chief ... or co-chief executive of Pernod Ricard and CEO of Irish Distillers Group.  Mr. Burrows is currently the chairman of British American Tobacco, a role he has held since 2009.  Dr. Crowley, Mr. Burrows, you're very welcome before the inquiry this morning.</p><p>Before I engage with the witnesses, I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you're directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you're entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist a smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  </p>  <p>               For those sitting in the gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screen to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  The witnesses have been directed to attend these meetings of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied in the questioning and will form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  I will now ask the clerk to administer the oath.</p></speech>

Mr. Chairman, I have provided a written statement to the inquiry on the topics you raised with me and I would like this morning to make a few general points.</p>  <p>  The first, and to me the most important point, I would ask the inquiry to bear in mind that my role as non-executive governor or chairman of Bank of Ireland ended in July 2005, just under ten years ago and I have absolutely no involvement with the bank in the intervening decade.  Whilst I am anxious to assist the inquiry as much as I can and do not wish to appear in any way unhelpful, the truth is my recollection of events, of meetings and correspondence is significantly impaired by the passage of time.  It happens to all of us and I trust the inquiry will understand and accept this.  I note that a lot of the documents you have sent me relate to periods after I left the bank and I hope you will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment in any way on these documents.</p>  <p>  The second point I would like to make concerns the standards of governance and oversight in the bank during my time there.  Most of the board, including myself, were non-executive and therefore part-time.  It is not the job of non-executives to run the bank nor are they or can they be expected to know everything that is going on in the bank.  Their role is an oversight one, to approve strategy and general direction and to be satisfied that there are proper governance structures in place.  In looking at historical practices, whether in banking or anywhere else, I believe that these practices should be judged against the standards of best practice which existed at that time.  There is no doubt that corporate governance has evolved significantly over the last decade, both generally for public companies and specifically for financial institutions in the light of the financial crisis but in my view, a fair assessment of practice in the past requires them to be judged in the context of standards of best practice at the time concerned.  </p>  <p>  I believe that the structure which was in place in Bank of Ireland during my time there reflected best practice and I have summarised the main control processes which existed in my written statement.  I had no cause for concern about the adequacy or appropriateness of the reporting and the accountability structures which we benchmarked against practice at the time, with the help in particular of our internal auditors and our external auditors.</p>  <p>  In relation to the strategy of the bank approved by the board in 2002, it is clear that this was an ambitious growth strategy.  </p>  <p>         It must be viewed, however, in the context of the economy at the time which was growing rapidly and with all indications pointing to a long period of sustained growth.  What is also important to note is that the strategy was not reliant on property lending.  My recall is that the growth in the balance sheet was to be achieved through a combination of acquisitions, particularly in life and pensions businesses, and through managing the capital of the bank through share buy-backs and other mechanisms.  We were particularly focused on growing the business outside Ireland and that was largely why we recruited a CEO who had been working abroad.  My understanding from reading the materials you have sent to me is that, in fact, property lending did not grow in a disproportionate fashion compared to other lending in Bank of Ireland and this would be what I would have expected from my experience there.  </p> <p> In my written statement in relation to the subject of property lending, I say that I do not recall any issue of imprudent lending being brought to the board.  I understand that this statement by me has been put to one of the other witnesses.  I was not intending to suggest that executives were aware at the time of imprudent property lending and chose not to bring it to the board.  I'm completely satisfied that this is not the case.  There was always open dialogue between the board and the executives and I have no doubt that if there was a material issue relating to property lending, the board would have been informed.  Of course, the board were aware that the bank, like all banks, had bad debts and I recall that the bank was conservative in making provisions for bad debts.  While some of the bad debts may well have related to property lending, I have no reason to believe that this was a result of imprudent or reckless lending.  </p> <p> Finally, in relation to property lending, I've seen references to the establishment of a specialist property group in the bank in late 2004, the implication being that this is evidence of a decision to place a particular emphasis on property lending.  I don't believe that the reason for the decision was to significantly increase the level of property lending.  It was part of a move towards specialisation, where individual lenders would focus on particular areas, rather than have someone who might be lending to a property developer in the morning and a grocer in the afternoon and I believe that this was a sensible approach.</p> <p> Can I conclude by coming back to what is the role of a director?  For as long as I've been involved in business, it has always been the case that the primary duty of a director is to act in good faith in what he or she honestly believes is in the best interests of the company involved.  I understand that this principle has now been enshrined in legislation in the new Companies Act, recently passed by you and your colleagues in the Oireachtas.  I genuinely believe that everything I and other directors of Bank of Ireland did during my time was done in good faith in what we believed was the bank's best interests.  I believe we discharged our responsibilities to the best of our ability.  When, as I was leaving ... when I was leaving the bank in 2005, it was operating in a very strong economic environment and there were no signs that the bank would do anything but go from strength to strength.  If, with the benefit of hindsight, decisions taken during my time later contributed to the problems facing the bank, then this is clearly something I regret.  Thank you.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.834" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Burrows" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#D00300"><p>Mr. Chairman and members of the joint committee, I welcome this opportunity to meet with you and to assist you with your inquiry into the banking crisis.  As requested by you, I submitted a written statement on a number of specific topics identified by you.  I do not propose today to repeat all of the points made in my written statement, but I do want to highlight a number of points which I believe are of particular relevance to the business of the inquiry.  Looking at events from a number of years ago, it's important to try and recall and to understand the context in which actions were taken or decisions were made.  </p>  <p>         This is particularly so in circumstances where the banking world has changed so dramatically in the intervening period.  Before touching on some of the points made in my written statement, let me make a few brief words about the backdrop against which Bank of Ireland and other banks operated during my time on the board.</p> <p> Peter Nyberg's evidence to the inquiry described that the global consensus back in the noughties was that financial markets were stable and efficient, a view to which Irish private and public sector decision makers adhered.  A number of previous witnesses before the inquiry have referred to the general economic backdrop to the early 2000s, including the strong growth in employment, the extraordinary growth in the Irish population and the consequent huge increase in demand for new housing.</p> <p> The report by Regling and Watson, which forms part of the evidence presented to the inquiry, notes that Ireland's strong and extended expansion during the previous decade fostered expectations of a continued rise in living standards and in asset values.  Regling and Watson also note that in this macroeconomic setting, bank governance and financial supervision faced major challenges and, looking back, I would agree with this observation.  They described banks operating in a setting of greatly increased wholesale funding opportunities following the adoption of the euro and banks from abroad beginning to compete strongly in retail mortgage lending.  Another factor highlighted by Regling and Watson was that when modern Ireland ... was that modern Ireland had never experienced a property crash.  As the chief economist of Bank of Ireland set out in his written statement to the inquiry, the fall in house prices in the first half of 2008 was modest and the full effect of the unprecedented collapse of the global credit markets which followed the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008 was not felt until 2009.  So the 2008 crisis was not primarily caused by the property devaluation but by other factors, later exacerbated by the collapse of property values.</p> <p> I was asked to discuss the quality of the business model setting process in Bank of Ireland, which I took to mean the quality and setting of the strategic plans.  In my view, a key point to bear in mind when making judgments on a strategy setting process is the backdrop against which the strategy is developed.  Bank of Ireland's strategy was informed by the consensus view on likely economic developments in the countries in which the bank was most exposed to credit risk.  While I believe that the process for setting the bank's strategy was extensive and robust, in hindsight the bank's strategy, in common with other financial institutions in Ireland and internationally, which assumed continued economic growth in the bank's main markets, reflecting the consensus view, led the bank to expand in a manner which, as I said at the extraordinary general meeting of the bank in March 2009, was regrettable.  The bank's funding of that growth assumed the continued normal functioning of wholesale interbank markets, which did not happen, and the risk of this funding not being available was not, in light of our perception of future events at that time, fully appreciated.</p> <p> While prudent strategic decisions were made to focus on the bank's core business, and not to enter into certain business segments, which meant that Bank of Ireland's position, when compared against many of its peer companies, was less severe overall, this was of little consolation to the bank's shareholders, who suffered a very serious decline in the value of their shares and through the cancellation of dividends.  </p>  <p>         At the extraordinary general meeting in March 2009, I also acknowledged that the bank's change of strategy, to a much more defensive position, was not commenced early enough in the cycle of the economic decline.  Reports commissioned by the bank in the period following the crisis have noted that while the bank could not have escaped the unusually severe economic downturn, the effects could have been mitigated if corrective action had been taken earlier.</p> <p> As I said at the time and at the AGM in July 2009, I accept responsibility and accountability as governor for the situation in which Bank of Ireland found itself in 2008.  I also placed clearly on the record then, my appreciation of the Government actions in 2008 and 2009, which ensured the survival of Bank of Ireland.</p> <p> I&rsquo;m referring to the guarantee, which stabilised the situation in September of 2008, the capital infusion into Bank of Ireland, since, thankfully, fully repaid and the creation of NAMA and its acquisition of the banks property loans, which allowed Bank of Ireland to become an investable institution and thus allowed new, third-party shareholders to come aboard.  This package of support was comprehensive and determined the continued viability of the bank.  I have outlined in my written statement, the structures which were in place in Bank of Ireland in relation to risk monitoring.  A key issue in my view, is that despite these structures, we the board and management did not fully appreciate nor factor in the risk inherent in the rate of growth of the bank's core businesses and in particular, while property lending grew broadly in line with other lending, the risks arising from the absolute amount of property lending and from the group's reliance on wholesale funding.</p> <p> In hindsight, risk should have been a more fundamental driver of the setting of strategy.  This would have resulted in a set of constraints around strategy development reflecting the risk appetite being set down by the board.  I do not believe that the appetite for property lending in Bank of Ireland was any greater than for lending into other sectors.  In particular, Bank of Ireland had a relatively lower appetite for, and by extension, lower relative exposure to, landbank lending than other banks in the Irish market.  So, while the growth in property lending was not disproportionate, the amount of the bank's property and construction book was significant and thus the bank was heavily exposed to the significant downturn in the Irish and UK property markets.</p> <p> I have seen from the previous evidence sought by the inquiry that the members have a strong interest in analysing the decision to introduce the bank guarantee on the night of 29 September 2008.  You have asked for my opinion on the appropriateness of that guarantee and in response, I would say that there is no doubt that the Government at the time found itself in an extraordinarily difficult situation, particularly on that night of 29 September, when it became clear that a liquidity default risk facing Anglo Irish Bank could have serious implications for the entire banking system.  I am not aware of the range of options considered by the Government at the end of September 2008 and I am not, therefore, in a position to comment on the appropriateness of the guarantee as against those other options.  I would say that in my view, the immediate funding requirements of Anglo Irish Bank could have been addressed by guaranteed financial support, which Bank of Ireland and AIB were prepared to make available in the short term to Anglo Irish Bank.  </p>  <p>         Such a decision may have given the Government more time to consider its options.  However, the Government chose to go further and to guarantee all financial institutions, which certainly avoided the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank that week.</p> <p> Let me conclude these remarks by repeating that it was a source of great regret to the board of Bank of Ireland, which had served its stakeholders so well for over two centuries, that we required substantial support from the Irish taxpayer and from the State.  As I've said earlier, that support was comprehensive and ensured the continuing viability of the bank, and for that I remain very grateful.  I'll do my best to answer any questions which you may wish to raise, Chairman.</p></speech>

Mr. Burrows, let me start with you.  Mr. Crowley in his statement said "In particular, I do not recall any issues of imprudent lending being brought to a Board by the Executives of the Bank, the internal auditors or the external auditors."  Did that happen in your term as governor or would you make the same statement as your colleague?</p></speech>

I'd add to it by saying that within Bank of Ireland we had a pretty robust system of control in place which meant that in relation to any lending we relied on the three lines of defence which I think you've heard about before.  And those three lines of defence were of course the very front office - the person engaged in the lending contact - the credit committee to whom that was referred and then an oversight by the internal audit as to the appropriateness of whether the procedures were being followed properly or not.  So, therefore ... and that was monitored carefully by the court.  So there was a robust system in place, of course there were always debates, I think, but at the same time there wasn't a situation where a particular case was brought to the attention of the court in my time.</p></speech>

And it's certainly fair to say that some of these matters were brought to our attention.  At the time, we were still working within the assumption that I mentioned in my opening statement as, I think, in common with most commentators, that whilst there could well be a slowdown, that we were not looking into the kind of catastrophic decline in values which subsequently emerged.</p></speech>

I can't speak for the earlier period that you're referring to but ... because all the time that I was there the structure on credit control and on lending approval was as I've stated it - a very robust structure within the bank with very clear limits being set at each level of authority, and any question of any of those limits being exceeded then meant that that particular matter had to be referred to a higher level of credit committee for resolution.  So I think there was a very robust system in place.</p></speech>

I might put one question to Mr. Crowley.  And this is core document B2, pages 37-47, Mr. Crowley, and they'll come up in a while.  This was a board decision to allow ... to move the earnings multiplier allowing customers to borrow up to 4.5 times their annual income and also to increase the loan-to-value threshold and was made in 2002.  Why did the board do that, Mr. Crowley?</p></speech>

I don't recall this, but I can only think that it was doing it in the light of the very healthy economy.

Was the risk in doing that understood by the board at the time, given what we said about ... that the first reason there, the point to Mr. Burrows, was that the absolute quantum of property lending was the major issue, the first one listed as why Bank of Ireland subsequently got into trouble?</p></speech>

And the reason for that is that when you establish policies in relation to credit and lending, you're going to draw the terms of those policies very tightly.  And so, therefore, in complex lending situations, it is quite likely that you will find in any particular transaction an exception.  An exception doesn't mean that the policy is being infringed, it just means that it has to be referred to a higher level of credit committee within the bank, within the institution in order to resolve whether it is a genuine exception, as in a deal breaker, or whether it is something that arises because of the tightness of the way that the policy has been drawn.</p></speech>

The loan-to-deposit ratio rising very rapidly, now you said in your presentation in 2009 you attempted to get back a higher rate of deposits.  But when it rose very rapidly, 159% instead of the recommended 120% in September 2008, were there alarm bells at that time about the high level of reliance on wholesale funding?</p></speech>

From much earlier than 2009, we ought to have been making sure that we had a far better loan-to-deposit ratio than we had.</p></speech>

He wrote to the Bank of Ireland on 31 July 2013 about the maintenance of lending standards, ongoing monitoring, the management and control of risk in relation to residential mortgages and that correspondence was still in operation the following December.  Was there a very slow rate of response and interaction between the regulator and the bank?</p></speech>

And we had a affidavit yesterday, a document submitted from the Construction Industry Federation, requiring NAMA to honour verbal agreements with banks on business that was transferred.  So was banking professional enough in its lending practices in the run-up to this crisis?</p></speech>

Were there any concerns at board about the launch of that product?</p></speech>

I think the fact is, with the benefit of hindsight, one would not do 100% mortgages today but I'd make two points about that.  Firstly, the collapse in property values that occurred in 2008, 2009 and 2010 was of the order of 50% so whether it was a 100% mortgage or a 90% mortgage or an 80% mortgage, it wouldn't have made any difference.  The second thing is that 100% mortgages within Bank of Ireland, even at their peak, were a very low percentage of the total mortgage book, less than 5% of the total mortgage book so I don't think it was a major factor.</p></speech>

Going back right through your time with Bank of Ireland, right back to your time as a non-executive director, you were quite happy with the information flow that was coming through to you?</p></speech>

Non-executive directors have the right to receive the information from management as you described.  But they also have the responsibility to look for information from management, either individually or collectively, and that happens at board meetings where non-executive directors have a responsibility to challenge management.  This happens particularly in the area of strategy or, indeed, tactics from time to time, but also can require management to produce specific reports on situations which arise or to cause external advisers to be brought in if that's necessary.  So it's a two-way street.</p></speech>

And Mr. Crowley, would you concur with Mr. Burrows's analysis of the role of a director and how it functioned in Bank of Ireland at that time?  And would you have been surprised at the information, or would you have been satisfied with the information you would have been receiving as a non-executive director?</p></speech>

One of the problems at boards is that you can suffer an overload of information that the executives can, in a sense, drown you in information and give you hundreds of pages to read and that is not effective.  That does not contribute to efficiency in operating as a director.<br/><br/>In my opening remarks, I said two things.  I re-say that about the role of a director, for as long as I've been involved in business, there's always been the case that the primary duty of a director is to act in good faith in what he or she honestly believes is the best interest of the company involved.  I stated:</p><blockquote>It is not the job of non-executives to run the bank nor are they or can they be expected to know everything that is going on in the bank.  Their role is an oversight one, to approve strategy and general direction and to be satisfied that there are proper governance structures in place.</blockquote></speech>

Right thank you, just one final question before I move on to Deputy Murphy in that regards, so, is: the loans that went to NAMA were put in place during your tenure, Mr. Burrows.  Were you not surprised at the level of discount that came afterwards?</p></speech>

It was inevitable that there was going to be a discount on the loans to be transferred and frankly, I think the power of negotiation lay more with NAMA than with the banks from which the loans were transferred.</p></speech>

It was necessary for Bank of Ireland to get property loans, which had a questionable value, off its balance sheet to NAMA, if it was to become an investable proposition in order to gain third-party capital and so that was done.  In terms of how the value of the loans was measured at the time, as I say, that can only be I think reviewed when those loans are either paid back or sold on to somebody else.</p></speech>

I went back to Bank of Ireland, I discussed the situation with my chief executive, and we resolved that the right thing to do was to make sure that Government was fully aware of the severity of the situation facing Anglo.  We also felt, and there had been a lot of discussion over prior weeks and weekends in the Central Bank, involving both Allied Irish Banks' executives and our own executives, in relation to other issues in the marketplace and we felt that it could well be that AIB would feel similarly about the severity of the situation and that it therefore might be better if we made a joint approach, rather than an approach on our own.  And so I rang Dermot Gleeson, chairman of AIB, and explained the situation as I saw it, explained that we were going to contact Government and invited him to join us in that approach, which he readily agreed to.</p></speech>

You say in your written opening statement that the immediate funding problems of Anglo could have been dealt with at the time with a guarantee from the Government of the &euro;10 billion in financial support that both you and AIB were willing to give.  That was your view at the time.</p></speech>

If I just go back to the sequence of events that evening, the four of us went to Government Buildings and we were eventually shown in to meet with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and quite a number of other people were there, I can't remember all the names.   And I led on behalf of the four of us, to explain to the Taoiseach and the other members who were present, the reason for seeking the meeting, which was to make sure that they were fully aware of the severity of the situation that could unfold the following morning, and the impact that that could have on the banking situation at large.  And then my other colleagues on that visit made their own interventions with Government, at which point we were then invited to go into an ante-room, whilst the Taoiseach and Minister and the others present conferred, and eventually we were brought back in to meet with the Taoiseach, and at that point Mr. Hurley, who was present, asked if Anglo Irish's default could be covered by Bank of Ireland and AIB providing liquidity in the form of &euro;10 million, &euro;10 billion, the following morning.  Our response to that, and I think it was Brian Goggin who articulated this, was to say that we would be prepared to go away and consider that, but that, given the severity of the situation, given the difficulties which we were all facing, we would need to be guaranteed by Government on that particular loan - not just guaranteed about the loan, but guaranteed that we would actually get the cash back too, after a specific period of time.</p></speech>

It's a complex matter to raise that kind of liquidity in the middle of the night but nonetheless, after some time, they managed to do it and at that point we were called back in to the meeting with Government and we said that, subject to that condition about the loan being guaranteed, we could in fact - and I'm talking for Bank of Ireland - come up with &euro;5 billion, not the following morning but the morning after, is the best of my recollection.  </p>  <p>         At that point and AIB confirmed their participation to the same extent ... at that point we were informed by the Taoiseach that the Government had decided to introduce a guarantee of all deposits for all the Irish banks, and there wasn't any question about six or four or anything else, it was for all the Irish banks, and at that point we left.</p></speech>

I think the Government made reference to the fact that they were going to have to call some kind of a Cabinet meeting in the middle of the night to authorise this, but that it was planned that the creation of the guarantee would be announced first thing the following morning.</p></speech>

My last question, in relation to this area, Mr. Burrows, if you could turn to page 5 of that same document, BOI - C3b, and it's board minutes from 3 October 2008, and it's where the events of that night are recounted to the board.</p></speech>

By "blanket" in that instance, you understand a guarantee of the six institutions?</p></speech>

In these circumstances, the political judgement was that it had to apply to all banks."  So, is there a change there, between what was agreed, or what you understand to be agreed when you said you could provide the &euro;10 billion, and a blanket guarantee?  Could that blanket guarantee refer to the four banks?  That's my question.</p></speech>

In these circumstances [which would seem to indicate different circumstances] the political judgement was that it had to apply to all banks."  There seems to be an inference there that there was a change in the scope of the guarantee.</p></speech>

I guess the fact of the announcement of the guarantee on the morning, which is a matter of record, means that the guarantee was triggered that night.  It was not something which we had asked for.  This was a Government decision.</p></speech>

It also was the year in which I ... I retired as governor.  So I think we believed we were in very good shape at that point.</p></speech>

Bear in mind, I had been part of the board up to that point - it wasn't as if that I arrived new on the scene in 2005.  But I think, as I said earlier, in looking at the strategy of the bank with Brian Goggin, who was then a new CEO in position, we did question very thoroughly the strategy which had been put in place by his predecessor and, in doing that, we brought in quite a number of different external advisers to examine all aspects of the bank's business to make sure that our strategy was robust going forward.  So there was ... there was a period of intense questioning during this period of growth of the business of the bank.</p></speech>

Is this an example of Bank of Ireland changing its business practice to compete with Anglo, Mr. Burrows?</p></speech>

So the creation of that was a response to that.  It was also in the context, bear in mind, of ... of the strong growth that I referred to in my own opening remarks in the economy generally and particularly in the housing and property sector.</p></speech>

If I go back to a kind of normal period, in other words ... years before 2008, I would say that we devoted quite an amount of time, probably of the order of ... of 20% or one fifth of our board time would have been devoted to strategy and strategy matters and reviewing how we were doing against strategy.  Of course, in 2008 and after that the agenda changed very much to ... to a survival mode and so, therefore, it wasn't so much about strategy as it was about day-to-day issues.</p></speech>

And, Mr. Burrows, in 2005, in your opening statement you say when ... on your appointment as chairperson in 2005 ... the bank developed a new strategy and you go on to say that its "correct geographical footprint for Bank of Ireland was Ireland and the UK and these should be the areas of focus for growth and we also recognised that Bank of Ireland did not have a rating that would allow us to undertake mergers or acquisitions and therefore, we would have to rely on organic growth in existing markets which [we were also] ...  were also expanding markets."  What does that mean for the bank in 2005 ... that it didn't have the rating to undertake mergers and acquisitions?</p></speech>

And that meant that our firepower in terms of ... of being able to make realistic approaches to any overseas bank that might have been attractive to us from an acquisition point of view, just wasn't there.  And so, therefore, we had to rely on ... on organic growth.  In other words, growing the business which we were already in.</p></speech>

I ... the statement stands on its own, I think, and that is we ... we looked to organic growth in all of the businesses which we were in as a means of ... of growing the business of the bank overall.

That morning all that had happened was the announcement of the guarantee, which certainly had the desired effect of stabilising things - albeit on a short-term basis.  And in my opening remarks I ... I made the point and I ... I just reinforce it, that the guarantee on its own was not a magic wand.  Given the severity of the situation which was unfolding, it was necessary for recapitalisation and NAMA as component parts.</p></speech>

TILSON: Yes.<br /><br />MICK: Right, and it's ... it is Government guaranteed etc., etc., like all that is doing is essentially shoring up an overly geared balance sheet.<br /><br />MR. TILSON: Absolutely.<br /><br />MICK: So it is giving you money, wholesale money for two and three years, issuing capital, whatever?<br /><br />MR. TILSON: Yes.<br /><br />[MICK]: But you are still left with a balancesheet and we know with bad debts.<br /><br />MR. TILSON: Right.<br /><br />MICK: That are going to come against us.<br /><br />MR. TILSON: Yes, absolutely.<br /><br />MICK: Like, that is kind of almost like a zombie bank.<br /><br />MR. TILSON: Yes, no absolutely.<br /><br />MICK: And it is not dealing with the real issue, as he said, which is capital and bad debts.<br /><br />MR. TILSON: Yes.<br /><br />MICK: [And they are both ... ] And they are both inextricably linked?<br /><br />MR. TILSON: They are.</blockquote> <p>How come that senior people in Bank of Ireland, on the morning of the guarantee, were talking about the issue that this wasn't dealing with the real issue, which is capital and bad debts within the bank, but you as governor, as you mentioned earlier on, were not concerned about those two areas at that time?</p></speech>

I refer to the fact that in July of that year, for example, the board took the decision that we should pass on our interim dividend and that was a very tangible expression of the fact that we were concerned about capital, we were concerned about worsening bad debts, but not at that point, to anything like the degree that subsequently transpired.</p></speech>

And I can only speak from the point of view of Bank of Ireland.  On the night of the guarantee, as far as we were concerned, we were an entirely solvent institution.  Now we would admit that we had great concerns about liquidity for the reasons that I mentioned to you - the closing of the wholesale funding markets.  But on the night of the guarantee, we had some 60 days at least of visibility in relation to our funding position, but at no time at that point were we concerned about solvency.</p></speech>

This was something on which I was briefed by the CEO on a very regular basis as you can imagine in the circumstances that pertained in those days.  So, therefore, I was .. I was very well aware, as was he, of the maturity of wholesale funding, of our difficulty in terms of rolling over of wholesale funding, of the runway, as I referred to it earlier, that we had at any particular time so it was something which was absolutely necessary to know and I am mystified by his evidence.  I can't explain it.</p></speech>

I don't believe so.  I think the rate of growth was occasioned by the very fast economic growth in the markets in which we were participating, namely, in Ireland and in the UK.  Where we got it wrong, of course, was that we were fuelling the growth of the balance sheet by over-reliance on wholesale funding and that was something that I referred to in my opening remarks.</p></speech>

The strategy changed.  As we referred to it earlier, the strategy presented by Mr. Soden when ... after he had been recruited, was for much more ambitious growth than had been the case before and so therefore there was a step change, and that was in response to a feeling that Bank of Ireland was underperforming in terms of the expectations of our shareholders and that's why that strategy was developed and pursued.</p></speech>

Mr. Carswell was here previously.  He gave evidence.

I questioned Mr. Sheehy and I said to him, "Mr. Sheehy, you made the point that the bank took too much risk [in that '01 to '05 period.]"  And Mr. Sheehy said, "I did yes."  I put the same question to Mr. Buckley: "Did the bank take too much risk in your time [the '01 to '05 period]?"  And Mr. Buckley's answer was, "No.  In my view."

In relation to the property lending, that was the big factor that caused us enormous difficulty within Bank of Ireland, which required the Government intervention that we did get.  The fact is that that lending, not all of it would have been put in place in 2008 or anything like that.  It would have been something that would have been built up over the period of time, probably from 2001, because the nature of this lending is that it's going to be there for some time.  So there would have been a build-up of lending through the period that you're referring to and the progression would have continued beyond 2005.  So I don't know whether that answers your question or not but-----</p></speech>

Mr. Burrows it is long considered that a prudent loan-to-deposit ratio for banks should be of the order of 120% or lower.  Why was this target so severely breached in the ... up to 2008, when it reached 176%?</p></speech>

And this was not a situation which was peculiar to Bank of Ireland, this was something which was happening, not just in Ireland but right across the euro-land as banks were availing of wholesale funding in order to engage in their business of lending.</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, one of the big factors was the drying up of wholesale markets in light of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but there were many other financial institutions which came down in that period.  And that led to a closing of the wholesale markets which meant that that liquidity which had been available, was no longer available.  And that was what happened to us and I guess by extension it happened to quite a lot of others too.</p></speech>

I'm not sure which advisers you are referring to, but I can't explain why somebody didn't see the problem.  We didn't see the problem, I take my share of responsibility for that.  We had over-reliance on wholesale funding, as evidenced by the numbers which we have been quoting and we make no bones about that.</p></speech>

An annual real growth rate of 20% is often taken as the trigger.</blockquote>  <p>And that growth rate and greater would have been appropriate or what Bank of Ireland recorded 2004, 2005, 2006.

We weren't paying attention to the risk that attached to those growth levels, and bear in mind, what I said in my opening remarks which was that we were operating in an economy which was itself growing very quickly.  We were operating in a situation of rising employment, rising population and a huge demand for housing.  That was what was occasioning the opportunity to grow the size of the balance sheet.</p></speech>

Mr. Black, who was a regulator and has a huge amount of experience in regulation and in dealing with bank crashes from the late 1980s and 1990s on, but he said a number of ingredients could be guaranteed in a banking system to cause catastrophic loses.  Among those is grow like crazy, make terrible quality loans and employ extreme leverage.  He said that these ingredients would inevitably lead to record profits.  He further said, "Under modern executive compensation the senior leadership [of the banks, that is] will promptly be made wealthy", and then it will result in catastrophic losses.  Do you recognise Bank of Ireland in that scenario which Mr. Black outlines?</p></speech>

And, I have to tell you, and I haven't got the full list of people that we brought in, but we had a very eminent range of advisers coming to talk to us and they did not point to the particular point that you are now talking about, and we didn't have Mr. Black either.</p></speech>

That was something which our shareholders were expecting us to do.  In fact, as I mentioned to you earlier, the rate of growth within Bank of Ireland was causing us to be rated less by the market than our peer group, which was cutting off certain options from us.  So there was built into what we were doing, a need for us to grow the business.  And by growing the business that meant, in banking terms of course, growing the balance sheet and thereby growing the profit and loss account.</p></speech>

It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted on us by an alliance of banks and landowners.<br /><br />Today, in Ireland, the price of the average house is close to ten times the average wage.  This represents an economic failure on the monumental scale.  Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.In 2003, a full four or five years before the bubble finally burst, did Mr. McWilliams get it absolutely right, and should Bank of Ireland and other banks not have seen the same factors?</blockquote></speech>

However, I have to tell you that, as a board, we were entirely satisfied with what we were getting.  At times there were calls from the board to management for additional information, for reports on various things, but there was not a level of dissatisfaction at all at that time.  Now subsequently, of course ... the reporting has been moderated or modified.  I haven't been involved since 2009 so I can't comment on it today.  But that's what I would expect, that after the horse has bolted you slam the stable door and ... and you improve the processes that you have.

And, as has been mentioned a couple of times this morning, Bank of Ireland is a bank that has been in existence for almost two centuries.

It is what it is.  It's ... of course changes are brought in, moving with the times in corporate governance and other areas, but the model ... and of course the market and technology bring in changes.  But, otherwise, nobody has made fundamental changes.</p></speech>

Mr. Burrows and Mr. Crowley, welcome.  Can I go to document Bank of Ireland - Vol. 1, B2, and the page I'm looking at is page 89.  It's effectively to do with stress testing.  It's dated 3 April 2006, addressed to Mr. Liam Barron, who was with the Central Bank.  And the question I suppose I want to ask is that your sensitivity analysis appears to have very much revolved around mortgages versus non-mortgages.  Did ye look at different type of stress testing ... the correlation between property being ... the type of property, whether it was commercial development land, speculative landbanks, and how it was being financed?  And when you're dealing with that, Mr. Burrows, could you also address that on page 90 you speak about the projected ... when you're looking at the general  ... that your sensitivity analysis ... the projections assume capital raising in the years '06-'07, '07-'08 and '08-'09 of the order of about &euro;4.3 billion.  And you said ... if the funding was not raised with "Shock 1 Scenario" that you basically would just be meeting your minimum regulatory capital requirements.  Did ye raise any of that money by way of capital?  And, just the sensitivity analysis ... it doesn't appear to have gone into any great depth.  And what type of reduction in falling property values did ye factor into your sensitivity analysis, in worst case scenario?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.1356" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Burrows" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#W03900"><p>First of all, during that period we were heavily engaged in the implementation of the Basel II regulations, which were the new regulations that required us to have a different approach to assessing the amount of capital required to be appropriately capitalised for the business which we were doing.  And in that ... in that calculation, the mortgage loans were actually the least risky under the Basel II methodology, whereas other loans carried various rates.  So that would have been the background to a lot of the work which was being done in assessing the comparative risk of different elements of the balance sheet.</p>  <p>  If I ... if I go to the second part of your question, we didn't raise fresh capital during the period but of course we were generating capital through the ordinary profit and loss of the ... of the business.  That's the way businesses generally do generate capital where your ... you're earning profits after tax, you're paying part of that as dividend to your shareholders and the remainder you're adding to your capital base within the business.  So when the profitability of the bank improves, so also does your flow of fresh capital.</p></speech>

I want to move on to the issue of Project Atlas for a moment there with you, Mr. Burrows.  It will just be coming up on the screen there in a moment.  This was during your tenure.  The Project Atlas report in summary would demonstrate that large exposures and mothballing of developments and landbanks were highlighted in this report.  It shows them as issues for Bank of Ireland, showing that the ongoing need for the bank to support such clients in the face of loan to values, interest roll-over and availability of further security.   What is your view on PwC's output on this?  Would you agree with that?</p></speech>

Properties were being bought and sold, landbanks were being bought and sold, there was a determination of what market value was.  In the period that we are referring to here, that market had pretty well come to a complete halt.  Therefore, it was extremely difficult, I think, to try and assign value in those circumstances.</p></speech>

This is the CEO of NAMA, the biggest real estate agency in the world or asset management agency on the planet.  What he was saying is that the model was simply like this, is that a developer or builder would come along, they would get a loan from an institution to develop a project, equity would grow in that project during its lifetime, the builder would go for another loan and because of the equity that was in the existing or the previous loan was providing equity to the new loan, there were 100% loans being more or less given out, because of this notional equity that was inside there.  The compound outcome of this practice, of loan upon loan, upon equity growing in the previous loan, upon the previous loan, was this not the inevitable outcome of it?</p></speech>

The reason for the property collapse was because the market dried up, because funding was no longer available and transactions could no longer be done.  As to the issue of how individual developers established their own equity, that's a subjective manner.</p></speech>

And as I said in my opening remarks, I think it was a very important element of the comprehensive approach that Government took to resolving the problem of the Irish banks and it couldn't have worked without NAMA because banks like Bank of Ireland would have been unable to raise fresh capital unless they had been able to transfer the suspect loans in relation to property off their balance sheet.  That brought certainty to any new investor and absent that, you wouldn't have people prepared to put money into a bank.</p></speech>

And then he went on to say:</p><blockquote>If I look now at the level of reporting, understanding that the board has, of credit risk development, concentration risks, a wide range of risks ... if I compare our ICAAP document of 2013 ... to what was provided in the past in the board, the board didn't seek, and the board was not provided with, a sufficient level of information to make informed decisions on the risks that were being taken.</blockquote>  <p>What would you say about that observation that Mr. Boucher made?</p></speech>

If I go to the capital option that you're talking about, I often reflect back on that period.  By the time that that memo was written, it was clear that capital raising in that form or any other form, was going to be pretty nigh impossible, given what had happened with share price, given the unwillingness, I would say, of the market to invest, given the uncertainty of the situation in Bank of Ireland, but was that something we could have looked at much earlier?  Probably yes, but we didn't do that; by the time we came to look at it, clearly, the window had closed.</p></speech>

All right.  Okay.  I just want to move on to the issue of remuneration before I bring in Deputy McGrath, and just bring a slide upon the screen there, if that's possible, it's the top ten payments and options 2004-2008.  And it would appear from this document, Mr. Burrows, that the bonus proposals appear to largely measure performance against growth and earnings per share, EPS, and by comparison with the performance of the bank's peer groups; that's what the bonus programme there would actually indicate.   Can you answer the committee today why there was no effective modifier relating to risk built into the measure used for remuneration and bonuses?</p></speech>

Well, that was just the remuneration policy at the time.  Frankly, I don't know how you'd actually do such a thing, but it didn't exist at the time.</p></speech>

I understand in football teams, to use the football analogies that Senator O'Keeffe mentioned, sometimes centre forwards get paid more than centre halfs, but you do pay both, and sometimes there's bonuses to both.  Your bank would seem to be paying the centre forwards, and not giving any remuneration to the defenders.</p></speech>

We were always at the risk of losing good people, hence the need, not just to pay, but to retain the very best people, and that meant adherence to market norms.</p></speech>

Good afternoon.  Can I ask the secretariat to open up BOI - Vol. 1, B4, page 21.  What I'm referring to there, Mr. Burrows, is extracts from a number of meetings to do with the group risk policy committee, essentially dealing with a review of credit quality, and serious issues were raised regarding ... the level of unsatisfactory business manager and senior business manager reviews, doubled, for example, in the year to the end of March 2006.  The examples were cited about the management of excesses, drawdown of facilities, reporting of accounts to the business, banking credit etc.  Issues are raised about the legal services unit, coding with the bookkeeping system etc.  Were these issues brought to the attention of the board over, over the course of those years from 2002 to 2008, these review of credit qualities by that committee and internal audit?</p></speech>

And what remedial action would have been taken then, in the event of ... of these specific issues being identified, where certain business managers would not have met the standards which were set by the bank?</p></speech>

That's ... that's the process which was in place at the time, with ... with the step-up where ... where difficulties were incurred ... or encountered at one level of credit committee, the matter was then referred to the next highest level in order for resolution.  So, it wasn't a question of waiting until matters got to the board before any remedial action would have been taken.  That would have been a matter for management dealing with it as and when it came before them on the agenda.</p></speech>

Can I ask, Mr. Burrows, as ... as a member of the board, would you have access to all documents that you might seek?  Would you be able to seek any document, for example, the minutes of any committee meeting from the ... within the bank?</p></speech>

For example, any matters to do with clients, anything like that, I would have no access.  To minutes of meetings, if I, if I requested the chief executive to give me the minutes of a meeting it would be a very strange thing if he didn't comply with that.</p></speech>

That is a group risk policy committee meeting on 13 December 2007 and I suppose, just to put this in context, you ... you have pointed out a number of times today your view that one of the problems was the quantum of lending to the property-related sector, and you don't believe that it grew disproportionately over the years in which you were governor, is ... is that the case?</p></speech>

[44%] The levels of property exposure ... within our book are increasing at a faster rate than other sectors.  Figure 1 below it shows, our exposure has grown from &euro;29.5 [billion] in March 07 to &euro;33.5 [billion] in September 07 and from 23% of the book to 25%.</blockquote>  <p>If you move on to page 97, there's a reference to Moody's, the rating agency, looking at the sectoral concentration methodology:</p><blockquote>Under this measure, property and construction is growing in significance more rapidly than other sectors. ... Construction &amp;amp; Property ... accounted for 359% of our Tier 1 Capital at the end of September [']07, up from 345% three months earlier and 275% at March 06.</blockquote>  <p>By any measure, is that not rapid growth?</p></speech>

But the conclusion that you would draw from that immediately is that the other parts of the loan book were also growing quite fast at that time.</p></speech>

I mean, page 98 of the same minutes extract is saying, "While the above statements remain valid, the level of concentration within the book is increasing and the committee is asked to consider if the current level is acceptable and a number of options are set out as to how the concentration could be reduced".  Is that not an admission that there was an over-concentration in proportionate terms to the property and construction sector by the bank in its lending portfolio?</p></speech>

If I just go back ... the night of the guarantee, there was the announcement of the guarantee and we all went home to bed and got into work pretty early the following morning for the announcement.  And in the aftermath of that, then all sorts of questions about how extensive the guarantee was, how long it was going to be in place for, all of these questions that didn't come up the night before started to surface and I certainly recall in the period of that day or the following day, a discussion about the parameters of the guarantee and as to whether bonds, subordinated debt and so on would have been included.  I do remember that, but not on the night and I think the specific question that you're asking is on the night.</p></speech>

That didn't happen on the night is what you're saying.</p></speech>

Did you know that the guarantee ended up being &euro;133 billion for Bank of Ireland, that was your share of the guarantee, that &euro;5.2 billion of dated subordinated debt was included in the guarantee in respect of Bank of Ireland?  Did you have that detail on the night?</p></speech>

I mean, as I said to you, that was a pretty complex thing to put in place at that hour of the night with that kind of urgency.  So, yes, there was a lot of contact but that was the focus of what was going on and it wasn't until after we had satisfied ourselves that we could answer that question to Government along with AIB, that the question of the guarantee ever came on the table as part of the announcement.  The response from Government to us that night was that, "Thank you very much, we're going to, in fact, go for a guarantee".</p></speech>

The final question I want to raise is and I'll take you to BOI - Vol. 1, B2, page 99.  I'll give a moment for that to come up.  Just to put it in context again, it's an extract from a group risk policy committee meeting of 17 April 2008 and I understand you wouldn't have been at the meeting but I just want to raise the issue with you because the lending limits were clearly set out in respect of the landbank book, for example, which was very, very close to the limit and against the advice of the head of group credit, a decision was taken to increase the lending limit in respect of landbank by &euro;100 million.  Now, would that have been brought to the attention of the board, for example?</p></speech>

And the reason for it, by the way, was simply that we had loans to the owners of these landbanks.  They were in development and it was a question of following our original loan with an additional loan to enable whatever work was in progress to take place.  So, it wasn't new lending in that sense.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, gentlemen.  I've only ten minutes so, thank you.  I noticed the questioning times had changed a little and I'd ask you to be as brief as you can maybe in response.  All of my references are to core document C3b and I want to start on page 40 which is the last page of that where there are several references to Bank ... several references on that page, the end of the third last paragraph, "Bank of Ireland should approach the Government for capital"; the last paragraph, "Consideration was given to an immediate contact with the Government"; but I think that that wasn't followed up on because in the following sentence it said that the budget, the Exchequer budget, was imminent.  On page 16 of the same document - the last sentence on that page - it's stated that "Mr. Goggin was going to explore a capital injection by the State".  When did Bank of Ireland first explore the idea of a capital injection by the taxpayers?  And I might also ask you that at the time, the stated position of the bank publicly, through Mr. Goggin and possibly others, was that no such consideration was happening and that Bank of Ireland did not need taxpayer funding?</p></speech>

In any public statement, if you're in a situation looking for capital, the last thing you want to do is to start talking about that publicly because that just engenders a great deal of uncertainty and loss of confidence in an institution.  It's like a central banker or Minister for Finance not talking about a devaluation before he does it; he can't because you almost make the situation worse-----</p></speech>

Almost a full month after the previous references that I've given, on 19 November 2008, Mr. Cowen, in the D&aacute;il, it's on the D&aacute;il record, stated that he expected covered institutions to explore the potential for meeting these capital needs through "raising private capital and the disposal of appropriate assets".  He gave no mention of the taxpayer bailout, which was to come in February.  Do you believe ... well, I suppose you have suggested at least, and ... the best of you recollection, that you were having those discussion with him before the end of 2008.  Why was he not making reference to it, in light of the fact that that capital injection did come in February?  On the record of the D&aacute;il, he said something different.</p></speech>

So that all had to happen before, realistically, you could talk to external investors.  Notwithstanding that, there were a number of interested parties moving around who were engaging us in conversations about capital.  They came to nothing.</p></speech>

I want to turn to page 5 of the same document now; I'll give it a moment for it to come up on the screen.  It's paragraph one, two, three, four, five, the bottom of it, where there is a direct quotation, page 5 of C3b.  I'll put the quotation to you anyway.  It said that  "No indication of Anglo's specific needs was given [this is a court minute again] except that it was due to repay &euro;1.5 [billion] on Tuesday to a German bank and may need a further &euro;4 [billion] later in the week."  First of all, do you recall which German bank was ... that liability was due to on the Tuesday?  And do you believe it likely, in your experience as a banker, that that particular German bank would have been making the position known to either authorities in Germany or Europe or, dare I say, even potentially Irish authorities, that this potential liability was falling due and might not be met on the Tuesday?</p></speech>

I want to refer, Deputy McGrath spoke about the night of the guarantee and Mr. Goggin having proffered the view here ... I think the quote or the phrase that he used when he made the suggestion about subordinated, certain dated subordinated debt, was that there was a potential overlap with senior debt and potentially with sovereign.  How was it possible that your chief executive at the time can give evidence to the inquiry to the effect that he made that suggestion on the night on behalf of Bank of Ireland and its shareholders and everyone concerned and that you, as chairman, say that that suggestion didn't happen or you've no recollection of that suggestion?</p></speech>

My final question is again in relation to the evidence given by Mr. Goggin to the inquiry.  In answer to a question from me, he said:</p><blockquote>You'll recall that when I was describing the events of 29 September, a few days earlier than this, the governor of the Bank of Ireland [yourself] met with the Governor of the Central Bank to assist me in my unsuccessful attempts to have the ECB collateral rules expanded.  The Governor of the Central Bank told the governor of the Bank of Ireland at that meeting that there was nothing further he could do.</blockquote>  <p>I want you to talk about those unsuccessful attempts, or any discussions you had with Mr. Hurley, who was the then Governor of the Central Bank, in relation to his attempts either to gain additional funding for the Irish banking sector or to change the collateral rules of the ECB at the time.  And do you believe that if those collateral rules had to have been changed, and they were changed two weeks subsequent to the guarantee, that the guarantee may not have been, as constituted, necessary, if the changes had occurred before its announcement?</p></speech>

The guarantee was primarily to stop a deposit run the following day.  The wholesale funding or the ECB funding on collateralised security was a different thing entirely.  Let me say this: I don't remember the exact detail of the conversations which we had with Mr. Hurley about that but I can tell you that we always found in Mr. Hurley a very sympathetic ear in terms of taking the issues as we saw them in Ireland to the ECB and so therefore I'm quite sure that he explored every possible avenue to give us what we wanted, but clearly was up against the authority of the ECB and that's what he was reporting to us.</p></speech>

Now, could I ask that CIF, page 99, Vol. 1, be put on the screen, please?  Now, it's from the presentation of Mr. Simon Carswell, Chairman, on 26 February, and the third paragraph on page 99 reads:</p><blockquote>In 2006 the Financial Regulator started to consider the introduction of compliance statements for directors of banks.  This would allow the regulator to force the management and the boards of banks to stick by assurances they gave, for example agreeing to reduce their lending into one particular area, and would give the regulator an important tool to exert greater control over the activities of banks.  After intensive lobbying by the financial services industry the Department of Finance asked the Financial Regulator to drop the process of consultation, and it was shelved.</blockquote>  <p>Was Bank of Ireland part of that lobby?</p></speech>

Because, you know, there's part of the earlier matter that we discussed, the letter of 2 April 2007 to the regulator saying the Bank of Ireland was comfortable exceeding the 200% limit.  It looks like the regulator tried to do something about it, and the industry lobbied, but not the Bank of Ireland; is that ...?</p></speech>

Could I also say in relation to regulation, if we bring up document R3b?  And this was ... it's the minutes, it's page 7, it's the minutes, Chairman, of a meeting of the group risk policy committee where they were asked by the regulator to address failures to adequately verify the income or the source of the borrower deposit.  That was the regulator's concern.  And the reply is on the following page 8.  They say that they would only do so, the Bank of Ireland would only do so in exceptional defined circumstances.  And they'd already written to the Central Bank twice in 2001 and 2002 to notify them of that.  And then they go on and say, "...we were fully compliant with our stated procedures...".  In other words, they didn't want to do the degree of income verification that the regulator had recommended, but they found 21 instances in which there was an insufficient or no evidence of the balance of the funding.  So, as well as on the asset issue that we discussed, it seemed like you didn't want to comply with income verification either when requested by the regulator?  You were more or less told, "We told you already two years ago that we don't do it."  And, you know, this was a situation which led to &euro;64 billion, you know, being required of taxpayers because banks, you know, have this reluctance, I suppose, to comply with the regulator.</p></speech>

Does it not indicate that, to say the least, you were a hard company to regulate in the attitude to the regulator, or do you say you maybe ... perhaps you were an easy company to regulate?  But it does seem strange that not verifying the income of the borrowers should become an issue between the regulator and the bank.</p></speech>

There's a ... this is from the regulator to the bank: "[Bank of Ireland] is to advise the Financial Regulator as to whether it is satisfied that the concerns expressed at the Group Credit Committee meeting on 30 August 2007 have been addressed."  And that communication is dated March 2008, so there appears that something that arose in 2007 had not been satisfactorily replied to, Chairman, by the following March 2008.  Again, what ... just to ask our visitors: why does there seem to be such delays in dealing with regulatory issues?</p></speech>

Just two broad areas I want to just briefly touch upon, if I may, and the evidence document is BOI - B2, page 56, for the first area, and it's regarding exceptions to credit policy on lending.  This is a document that we got back from the Bank of Ireland actually, looking at the period 2004 to 2008.  The average exception rate for buy-to-let mortgages was 17%, almost one in five.  And when we look at what went to NAMA from Bank of Ireland, 191 connections were transferred, and policy exceptions were identified in 73% of those connections.  Mr Burrows, would you regard those exception rates as high?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.1733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Burrows" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#DD04300"><p>No, I wouldn't, and I think I covered the matter earlier in relation to the way in which credit policy and lending policies were drawn within Bank of Ireland, which was to draw them very tightly, so that that, in any ordinary course of business, would give rise to exceptions.  That's the purpose of drawing a very tight perimeter, that exceptions are forced into a situation where there has to be consultation with a higher authority, whether that's a more superior credit committee or a senior executive before being resolved.  So I think it's not unusual, in my opinion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.1734" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#DD04400"><p>So just to clarify then, a high level of exceptions like we see there means that there is greater scrutiny of what's going on with each of those lending decisions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.1735" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Burrows" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#EE00100"><p>It means that people are operating the policies to the letter and making sure that anything that is outside of the policy is recorded as an exception and is then dealt with properly.</p></speech>

So there isn't a correlation the between, say 73% of those connections in terms of what was transferred to NAMA and the write-down in NAMA loans?</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Okay.  And this afternoon's session is a public hearing with Mr. Terence O'Rourke, former managing director, KPMG, and Mr. Paul Dobey, partner, KPMG Financial Services.  The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  Today, we continue our hearings with senior auditors who had roles during and after the crisis.  This afternoon, we will hear from witnesses from KPMG: Mr. Terence O'Rourke, former managing director at KPMG and Mr. Paul Dobey, partner, KPMG Financial Services.</p><p>Terence O'Rourke was managing partner at KPMG from 2006 until his retirement in April 2013.  He was a member of KPMG's global board, global executive team and EMA board from 2007 to 2013, head of audit, KPMG, from 2003 to 2006, and audit partner from 1988.  Mr. O'Rourke was appointed chairman of Enterprise Ireland in August 2013.  Mr. Dobey is a partner in KPMG Financial Services.  He has been with KPMG since 1987 and became an audit partner in 1998.  He is currently the AIB audit partner in KPMG.</p><p>Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Dobey, you're both welcome before the inquiry this afternoon.  And before I commence proceedings, I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, those documents will be displayed on the screen to your left and right, and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and that they should not publish any of these documents so displayed.  The witnesses have been directed to attend the meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to you.</p></speech>

As managing partner of KPMG from 2006 to 2013, I welcome this opportunity of discussing with you the role of KMPG as auditors in the period you're looking at.  I have provided a written ... a detailed written witness statement in response to the themes identified by the committee.  These themes include the integrity of financial reporting and the impact of prevailing standards in recognising risks.  In this brief opening oral statement I will deal with a number of matters in that witness statement, specifically the role of an audit, the purpose of financial reporting and the basis of the accounting standards used in financial reporting, the going concern issue when preparing accounts, and, finally, I'll speak briefly about changes in these areas since 2008, which might have contributed to the avoidance of the crisis like the one we've gone through.</p>  <p>  Personally, I've spent all my professional life in KPMG since joining in 1975.  I was a partner from May 1988 to April 2013.  I was head of audit from May 2004 to December 2006, which also involved participation in a number of financial institution audits, including a role on the AIB audit.  I held the position of managing partner from December 2006 to April 2013.  I've not held an active role within KPMG since retiring as managing partner in April 2013 but the firm has provided support and assistance to me in preparing for today, and I confirm that, in particular, I have consulted with, and received input from, Mr. Paul Dobey, who's also here today, and who was the lead partner on the AIB audit.</p>  <p>  I'd, firstly, like to discuss the purpose of financial statements and the role of the external auditor, as there can be misunderstandings in relation to what an audit actually is and what certain commentators think or would like it to be, particularly in relation to the strategy and risk appetite of an entity.  The management of an entity is responsible for the preparation of its financial statements.  The overall responsibility for financial statements rests with the board.  The role of the audit is to provide a report to shareholders on those financial statements.  In reporting on whether the accounts present a true and fair view, auditors do an extensive amount of work in checking and verifying the systems producing the accounts as well as the financial information that is presented.  Those who prepare the accounts and the auditors who audit the statements must comply with an extensive framework of technical rules known as financial reporting standards and auditing standards.  These standards are set by independent international bodies, apply currently in some 280 jurisdictions, and are underpinned by national and by EU regulation.  The objective of having clearly defined financial reporting and auditing frameworks, standards and rules is to provide uniformity, consistency and transparency to the users of financial statements.  Without such rules, it would be very difficult to ensure the level playing field ... to ensure a level playing field in comparing the results and financial positions of companies across the world and the quality of audit reports on the accounts of those companies.  As far as KPMG is concerned, our work was carried out in accordance with our quality control framework for performing high quality audits and we believe that the accounts of the financial institutions we audited were prepared in compliance with the relevant international standards and that KPMG audited those accounts in accordance with their statutory duty and the auditing rules.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I'd make the following two points.  Financial statements are a point-in-time record of financial information of an entity, including its results.  By definition, financial statements are a record of past financial performance and do not seek to forecast or predict future performance.  An audit opinion, which deals with whether accounts give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS, does not assure, for example, the long-term success or sustainability of the business model of an entity nor the effectiveness with which management has conducted its affairs.  </p>  <p>         This responsibility rests with the management and boards of the entity.</p> <p> I would like briefly to discuss the accounting rules which make up the financial reporting framework.  From 2005 onwards, the rules that applied to Irish financial institutions was the set of international financial reporting standards known by the acronym IFRS.  The IFRS was developed by the International Accounting Standards Board, IASB, through a formal system of due process and broad international consultation involving the accounting profession, investors, governments, regulators and other interested parties.  IFRS seeks to ensure that financial statements provide consistent information about the financial position, past performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to those making economic decisions.  The adoption of IFRS in 2002 across the EU was endorsed with an overwhelming majority vote in the European Parliament and IFRS has force of law in Ireland by way of statutory instrument.</p> <p> The auditing framework applicable to the audits of the financial statements of Irish institutions was the auditing and assurance pronouncement issued by the UK's Financial Reporting Council, a body independent of the auditing profession.  The use of this framework is part of the statutory licensing regime for auditors in Ireland.  The directors of our financial institutions which audit clients thus had responsibility for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS from 2005 onwards.  It was, and remains, KPMG&rsquo;s view that the financial reporting of the relevant institutions was conducted in accordance with the requirements of IFRS.</p> <p> The KPMG teams performing bank audits during the relevant period were experienced in the application of auditing standards in IFRS and had an in-depth understanding of the banking sector.  These teams monitored emerging best practice through their connection with fellow KPMG firms in Europe and the US.  These audit teams had particularly close ties with our UK firm and were, therefore, familiar with best practice in the UK market and how the accounting and auditing standards were being applied there.</p> <p> One of the most significant accounting standards impacting the Irish institutions was IAS 39, and its requirements regarding the recognition of provisions for loan losses.  My colleague, Paul Dobey, will deal with the issues arising from the fact that IAS 39 is based on an incurred rather than an expected loss model.</p> <p> I said earlier that accounts were a point in time, and that the numbers that auditors reported on were historic and thus backward looking.  There is one matter however that falls to be considered in preparing a set of accounts that is forward looking, and that is the going concern basis of preparation.  This means that every year, when preparing the annual accounts, the directors of the company or a bank are required to consider whether they believe the entity will be in operational existence for at least one further year.  Typically directors make that assessment based on forecasts, budgets and an evaluation of the risks that the business faces.  Auditors are then required to assess whether directors' judgments and conclusions are reasonable and whether it is appropriate for the accounts to be prepared on the going concern basis.</p> <p> Up to and including 2006 year end, the assessment of our audit teams, based on the economic assessments and forecasts of respected bodies, was that the going concern basis of preparation of the banks&rsquo; financial statements was appropriate.  The additional steps taken by our audit teams in respect of the subsequent years, in light of the unprecedented economic conditions, will be dealt with by Mr. Dobey.</p> <p> KPMG is very conscious of and acknowledges the significant adverse impact which the banking crisis has had on our society, our people and our clients.  We recognise the important work of the joint committee in looking at the systemic issues involved in the crisis and more important, in identifying steps that might be taken to avoid a repeat.  KPMG is committed to and is assisting in this process, in particular in relation to further developing audit and corporate and financial reporting standards to reflect the lessons learned from the crisis.</p> <p> And so the final issue I want to address are the changes in financial and reporting standards since 2008.  In light of the global financial crisis the International Accounting Standards Board, the IASB, completed a review of what changes might need to be made to accounting standards.  This review considered the lessons learned across more than 100 jurisdictions in which the IFRS had applied by 2008.  The IASB's post-crisis review confirmed the important role of financial reporting in providing unbiased, transparent and relevant information.  However, it also recognised that only so much can be expected of accounting.  The IASB noted, and I cite the IASB chairman who said, that accounting standards could contribute to financial stability, but they should not be expected to provide a veneer of stability by ignoring volatility when it is really there.</p> <p> The most important conclusion of the review, however, was probably that there should be a more forward looking impairment model for loan loss provisions.  It is only recently, after much debate and lots of transatlantic dialogue, that the IASB has agreed a new revised loan loss provisioning model that specified an expected rather than incurred loss model for loan loss provisioning.  This standard should permit the earlier recognition of loan losses.  As a result, it will be possible to recognise expected losses in the downturn when there is evidence of expected impairment.</p> <p> Apart from the issue of how losses are recognised, a more wide ranging debate is also under way globally regarding how corporate reporting can be improved.  One body, the International Integrated Reporting Counsel, a global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standards setters and the accounting profession, is examining ways in which to better set out in an integrated report what is happening in a business in more than just financial terms.  Such an integrated report would be a concise communication about how an organisational strategy, governance, performance and prospects in the context of an external environment, is intended to lead to the creation of value in the short, medium and long term.</p> <p> To conclude, I have sought to give the committee an overview of the context of which financial statements are prepared and audited, the legal framework within which that work is done and some developments in standards since the crisis.  Mr. Dobey will address now, in more detail, how these principles and standards were applied now in the case of AIB.  Thank you.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.1790" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Dobey" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#JJ00200"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  And thank you for the opportunity to give evidence to assist the committee in its very important work.  I am here specifically in view of my role as lead partner on the AIB audit from 2005 to 2008.  I'll make some high level comments on the lines of inquiry dealt with in detail in my witness statement.  Specifically, I will explain why it is KPMG's view that the AIB financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and Irish law.</p>  <p>  KPMG audited AIB in accordance with our statutory duty and the auditing rules.  The AIB accounts gave a true and fair view and the accounting rules and related laws were not a contributing factors to the banking crisis in Ireland.  Notwithstanding this, there are important lessons to be learned for the accounting profession from the crisis.</p>  <p>  AIB was a large and complex organisation with over 25,000 employees in 2008 operating in Ireland, the UK, Poland and the US.  AIB had a very experienced board of directors, and an audit committee drawn from a wide range of disciplines.  The board oversaw the implementation of the strategy.  The audit committee oversaw the internal control and financial reporting of the bank.  The AIB accounts are very complex and expertise was required to make sure the transactions, balances and disclosures in these accounts were complete and the accounting was in accordance with IFRS.</p>  <p>  The KPMG audit team, which comprised approximately 20 partners and over 200 managers and staff, had the expertise to deal with these matters.  The team applied the best practice auditing and accounting standards to the bank's published accounts.  A quality review partner for KPMG UK and an SEC reviewing partner from our US firm was also involved in the AIB audit, bringing a further international perspective.</p>  <p>  As Mr. O' Rourke has outlined, AIB was required by EU and Irish law to comply with the IFRS accounting rules.  Similarly, KPMG was required to carry out its statutory duties as auditors in accordance with Irish law and the relevant auditing rules which were international standards on auditing.  The AIB team took all the necessary steps to form an opinion that the AIB accounts gave a true and fair view.</p>  <p>  The financial statements set out AIB's exposure to each sector, including the property and construction lending.  KPMG is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately disclosed the banks property related lending exposures.  AIB was aware of the risks arising from these business strategies, but like other financial institutions, did not anticipate the scale of the adverse circumstances which would give rise to unprecedented loses.</p>  <p>  AIB had an extensive risk infrastructure and semi-annual risk reports were presented to the AIB board by the chief risk officer.  These reports dealt with the top ten risks facing AIB, including credit risk, operational risk, market risk and liquidity risk.  The risk relating to credit and liquidity featured with increasing prominence in these reports in the period from 2005 to 2008.  As Mr. O'Rourke has mentioned, there is a common misunderstanding in relation to the role that an auditor plays regarding the strategy and risk appetite.  For KPMG to have sought to determine AIB's business strategies would have been beyond our role and expertise as auditors, and would undermine our ability to give an independent auditor's report on the financial statements of our audit clients.</p>  <p>  What KPMG did do, was to identify and report the risks to the AIB audit committee in the context of our audit work in order to ensure that the financial reporting implications were properly reflected in the financial statements.  Our consideration of these risks, and the audit findings on other communications with the AIB audit committee, were circulated to the Financial Regulator at the end of each audit.</p>  <p>  Turning, if I may, to the integrity of financial reporting.  The most relevant standard for loan loss provisioning was IAS 39 which required the use of an incurred loss model.  This model has been criticised because, in order to avoid smoothing of profits which was and is considered undesirable, it did not allow banks to create or hold general provisions in the good years to offset problems in the bad years.  It is the view of KPMG that the operation of IAS 39 was not a contributing factor to the issues which AIB faced in 2008.  I am not saying that IAS 39 was perfect, we have learned from the crisis that it needs to be changed and Mr. O'Rourke has outlined some of the steps being taken in this regard.  The major shortcoming of IAS 39 was that it delayed the recognition of the loan loss provisions when the downturn came in 2008.  </p>  <p>         It was always acknowledged that IAS 39 was pro-cyclical and would give rise to significant additional provisions in a downturn.  The scale of these additional provisions would reflect the scale of the downturn as it occurred.  When the downturn came in 2008, AIB was not permitted by IAS 39 to make impairment provisions for all of the losses it was forecasting for subsequent years.  It was for this reason that AIB disclosed to the market in its investor presentation in February 2009 that it expected to book further losses of between &euro;4.6 billion, base case, and &euro;6.7 billion, stress case, in 2009 and 2010 as the Irish economy further contracted and property prices further declined.  These estimates were based on models and assumed a contraction of the economy in 2009 of between 5.5% and 7% and a peak-to-trough decline in property values of between 20% to 50%, excluding land, and 30% to 80% for land.  It is now known that the economy contracted by over 10% in 2009 and certain categories of property such as land became almost worthless.  As a result, the actual losses recorded by AIB in 2009 and 2010 were much greater than the forecasts.  Finally on this issue, I would add that financial regulators can require banks to hold additional capital to absorb losses that could arise in a downturn.  This was done in some jurisdictions such as Spain and Canada.  Regulators may also do this in the downturn to reinforce confidence, and that was done in Ireland in 2011.  </p> <p> Chairman, I'd just like to make a few comments on the liquidity and solvency of AIB in 2007 and 2008.  At each year end, our audit team was required to consider whether the going concern basis of AIB's financial statements was appropriate.  In performing the 2007 year-end audit in early 2008, we were concerned about the effect of worsening financial markets on the liquidity and funding position of the bank.  AIB prepared a detailed going concern paper in early 2008, and based on this and AIB's liquidity plans, KPMG was satisfied with the going concern basis.  One year later, when it came to our 2008 year-end audit, our audit team had very significant concerns in relation to both liquidity and solvency of the bank.  These concerns arose for a number of, from a number of factors.  There was great uncertainty in Ireland and the economy was contracting rapidly, AIB was forecasting losses of up to &euro;8.5 billion between 2008 and 2010.  It had agreed to take &euro;3.5 billion from the Government in preference shares.  The position in relation to the availability of emergency liquidity access from the Central Bank and the euro system was not at all clear.  In early 2009, we informed AIB that we needed to take additional steps on the going concern issue and engage with the regulator, the Central Bank and the Government as part of our 2008 year-end audit completion process.  Confirmation and clarification was sought of our understanding of the public statements made by the Minister for Finance in relation to the Government's support for AIB.  This was provided to the AIB audit team at meetings held in February 2009 with the head of banking supervision of the Financial Regulator, with the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and the assistant secretary general of the Department of Finance.</p> <p> The onset of the global financial crisis was a shock to all of us.  The worldwide financial system broke down and regulators and Governments were forced to take unprecedented steps in response.  In my role as lead audit partner in AIB, I experienced some of these challenges first hand.  From mid-2008, the KPMG team knew that the 2008 audit of AIB was going to be the most difficult we had ever done.  Based on the Irish and international environment at the time, there were factors at play on this audit that were without precedent.  In the face of these challenging circumstances, our audit team and AIB, in late 2008 and early 2009, worked tirelessly to deal with those issues.  We brought all of the global expertise and local expertise of KPMG to bring to bear, and all of our personal energies to bear, in completing and ensuring that the audit was in compliance with the required standards, both for the bank and for us.</p> <p> Chairman, to conclude my opening statements I would reiterate that the AIB financial statements in each of the years, relevant years, was prepared in accordance with IFRS and Irish law.  KPMG audited AIB in accordance with our statutory duty and auditing rules.  The directors of AIB had a legal obligation to prepare accounts that gave a true and fair view and fulfilled this obligation.  We formed an audit opinion that AIB's accounts gave a true and fair view.  The accounting rules and the related laws did not, in our view, contribute to the banking crisis in Ireland.  However, as I said at the outset, there are important lessons to be learned by the accounting profession from the crisis and I would be happy to give my views on some of these to the committee if it considers it helpful in its questioning.  Thank you.</p></speech>

Firstly, we are registered with the PCAOB in relation to our SEC registrants, and AIB was a SEC registrant.  The accounts of AIB were reviewed regularly by the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US and they would have looked at the detailed application of accounting policies, including IFRS.  They looked at fair value accounting in 2008, they looked at credit risk disclosures in 2007, they looked at compliance with IAS 39 in 2005 and they looked at the M&amp;T accounting in 2005.</p></speech>

CARB reviewed our AIB audit for 2007, and that was completed in early 2009 with no negative findings.  You may also be aware that there was a review carried out by CARB in relation to the 2008 audit for all the covered banks, and that work is not complete but we ... we have spoken to CARB and have asked them what we can say to the committee.</p>  <p>  And if I may just read out some of what CARB have said we can say.  Our firm is registered as a statutory audit firm by CARB.  CARB is subject to oversight by IAASA. CARB, as part of its regulatory responsibilities, carried out inspections of the firm's compliance with auditing standards.  CARB, as part of its ongoing regulatory responsibilities, is reviewing the audits of the covered institutions for the financial years ending 2008 and, where relevant, 2009.  The purpose of these reviews was to determine whether the auditors applied appropriate procedures and complied with relevant standards in the audit work carried out on the provisions for impairment as part of the firm's audit of the financial statements as a whole.  CARB's review is not yet concluded.  On their conclusion, CARB will prepare and issue a public report, in accordance with its governance procedures, which will outline the overall results of the reviews conducted without naming specific firms.  Conclusion has been reached in relation to our firm and we have received a report on AIB.  And I note what CARB have said is, audit work of the firm in relation to all of its financial institution audits complied with relevant auditing standards.  While there are a number of instances where improvements were recommended, these are not material.  Should further questions arise, for example, regarding improvements required, these are set out in detail in the firm's responses to the quality assurance committee.  The report arising from the review could be sought by the committee but it should be sought directly through CARB. </p></speech>

Can I ask, of the issues that have been highlighted, has there been lessons learned ... from the, you've got the report from CARB from the look at your 2008 and 2007 audits of AIB, in particular, or other financial institutions?  And are there lessons, with the benefit of hindsight, that they've raised and that you've taken action to remedy?</p></speech>

As you know, when regulators do a review, they would have findings.  The findings in relation to our audits, as CARB had said, were not material.  There was a couple of matters in relation to documentation ... there was, specifically,  we had a consultation in the firm in February ... sorry, in January 2009 in relation to the going concern basis of preparation and that involved the partner I mentioned earlier from the UK firm, myself, Terence and our risk management partner.  I prepared a detailed agenda for that meeting with some actions suggested which we subsequently took.  I think CARB would prefer it if we documented that better; I think the actions were clear.  We also communicated with the regulator in writing and it's in the pack on 29 April.  </p>  <p>         Given the matters raised ... our concerns in relation to going concern and liquidity, we engaged with the Financial Regulator and had meetings with them - that I mentioned during my opening statement - in February.  I think CARB would have preferred if that ... the letter that we sent on 29 April had gone in earlier and there were some other minor documentation matters but nothing of substance.</p></speech>

When we looked at each individual loan in our sample, we looked at what the security was, what the circumstances of the borrower was and we looked at the collateral value as well.  In most instances, certainly for the large cases, AIB sought valuations.  However, as we moved into late 2008 and early 2009, valuations were not very reliable so we were applying haircuts, as were AIB, of between 20% to 30% in the latter part of 2009 ... sorry, the latter part of 2008.  And when we got to 2009, our view was that the haircuts that needed to be applied were 40%, particularly for land, and maybe 30% for property.</p></speech>

NAMA was acquiring the loans on a very specified basis.  They went through that process and all the audits that have been done of NAMA since have not shown anything to show that that valuation ... on that special basis ... it was a particular basis that NAMA took over the loans on ... and it seemed that they acquired the loans on that basis, properly.</p></speech>

AIB, you know, took ... so from the point of view of our audit of AIB, all we could do is accept the values that AIB got and that was it.

As I mentioned in my opening statement, when AIB announced to the market in early 2009 that they expected through ... they expected to take additional provisions in 2009 and '10.  And those provisions ... and they were some &euro;6.2 billion I believe ... those provisions were based on this investor presentation from AIB that's ... that contained this information.  It's still on the AIB website.  But it assumed certain declines in values.  So, for example, it assumed, on a base case ... a base case declining values of ... for residential property between 20% and 40% in a base case and 50% on a stress case for zoned land.  </p>  <p>         A base case with a decline of values of 25% to 50% and a stress case of 70%.  So ... and ... so broadly, declines on a stress scenario were between 50% and 70%.  So, in that light, there would've been equity in a number of the transactions that were transferred to NAMA so the 60% ... the 56% discount isn't a particular surprise in the context of the numbers that AIB issued to the market in 2009.  They wouldn't have planned to ... AIB would've planned at the time to hold these loans to the cycle.  What happened, with the benefit of hindsight, is these loans were transferred to NAMA at the bottom of the cycle.</p></speech>

In the KPMG report to the audit committee of 23 July 2008, it outlines: "We expect the increasing arrears across the bank's books and sectors will continue to feature in the second half of 2008 and into 2009 as the worsening economic conditions in Ireland and the UK take hold."  Given the market environment, did KPMG express an opinion on the planned dividend payment to shareholders?</p></speech>

We did do some audit-related work, particularly in relation to the SOX project, which was a very significant project for AIB and was very important to AIB in the context of its securities listing on the US markets.  And we did some relatively small amounts of tax work, so the lion's share of the work that we did for AIB was audit work and audit-related work in that period ... in the period I was involved anyway.</p></speech>

It's documented in the minutes.  There was a dialogue.  AIB took a decision to declare that dividend, I believe, in July and then it was paid subsequently in September and I think the view is, it was committed from July to pay that dividend and, ultimately, paid it in September.  There was a lot of dialogue within AIB and at the board of AIB and I do recall having a discussion with the, certainly the finance director and the chief executive in relation to the dividend, and I understand the reasons why it was done.</p></speech>

In July 2006, the bank's exposures to the broad property and building construction sector amounted to 260% of all funds when the Central Bank's limit was 250%.  The bank continued to breach these limits and such lending reached a level as high as 390% at September 2008.  Did KPMG ever analyse the risk level associated with the percentage share of the property-related lending?</p></speech>

In the accounts of AIB, the sectoral exposure is set out in great detail and was set out in great detail for all of the years.  If you go back to 2004, we would've been highlighting a concentration of credit risk in property and construction, also in 2005, 6 and 7, as a matter that needed to be considered in the context of disclosures in the financial statements.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, AIB were setting the strategy but we were concerned to make sure that the risks associated with those strategies were set out in the financial statements and they were very clearly set out in the financial statements ... set out all the exposures to the property lending and the exposure to the Irish economy in particular.  And the breaches were addressed.  The breaches first started to happen in June 2006.  We had ... we attended all of the AIB audit committee meetings and we would've read the AIB board minutes.  And we read the board minutes of 27 July, which are in the pack, which set out a dialogue that the management of AIB were having with IFSRA at the time.  It was discussed subsequently at a board ... at an audit committee meeting, I remember it being discussed.  It was probably either at the meeting just after ... just before ... around that time in July 2006.  And we were very happy that that dialogue was happening at the board level, as, you know ... there was an open dialogue at the board level, there was an open dialogue at the audit committee, there was a discussion with the regulator, there was-----</p></speech>

In terms of ... just on page 47 of ... is it page 47 of the evidence book?  It shows an individual worth &euro;3.2 billion ... total bank borrowing of circa &euro;1.8 billion comprising residential and commercial developments and investment properties.  It had a peak underwrite of facilities of &euro;790 million with AIB in September 2007.  So the top 30 exposures of AIB accounted for &euro;8.8 billion or 29% of the total portfolio.  Was there ever concerns raised by KPMG about group large exposure policy limits?</p></speech>

And the reason why those limits exist is when the exposures get larger, you want to make sure that there's a fair amount of distance between the lender ... the lending ... the relationship person and the borrower.  So there's a process of going through approvals.  This would've come through the AIB ROI credit committee and it, ultimately, came to the board.  I believe this document is a summary that went to the chairman's committee and there was a very large document that supported this, that analysed it in very great detail that went to the chairman and would've been considered by the group credit committee.  So there was a process by which AIB considered this loan.  It elevated it up through those processes and, ultimately, it was approved by the board.  So when I mentioned in my opening statement AIB board set the strategy, their strategy was, in relation to this lender, to advance more on the basis of what they thought was a very good LTV position or they believed it was a very good LTV-----</p></speech>

In those circumstances, where there was any request for a change in audit team, we would take that very seriously because obviously, that's an issue in terms of audit independence.  If an audit partner, for example, is causing too much trouble, we need to be very sure that the request for any changes are ... is well-founded and all the rest.  So we will take any such requests to a separate group on the firm and any such issues would've been referred to a group, including myself as managing partner, the head of audit and the head of risk.  We would've looked to the issues and we would've tried to understand the circumstances that were going on and we would have sought to make sure that the independent position of the firm was unaffected.  And that if, you know, we can see life is life and personalities don't get on sometimes and it is a matter if there's somebody, you know, not liking the way somebody sat or looked at you or something like that, then we will accede to requests but if a person was doing the right thing, and the client was not liking the way they were doing the right thing, well then we would do the right thing and we wouldn't change an audit partner for that.  </p>  <p>         Any such decision would involve us, the client didn't request ... we would appoint any replacement partner, we decided who the right person was to reflect the skills required and the experience ... and the client didn't have any choice as to who they got.  We decided who the partner would be in those ... and, as I say, it's very rarely happened over my life as managing partner.</p></speech>

So the client will tell us it's personality and all the rest and the audit partner might say "Well, I'm not sure of that, I think I was just doing a good job".  So we'd have to sit back and say "What's going on here?"  No, the right thing is that for us to do our job properly, we've got to have an effective audit relationship.  We've got to have people who can walk in, get full co-operation with the client, have respect for the client, lead the team, apply the judgments, get things done - that's the most important thing for us.</p></speech>

I just want to deal with the dividend issue there before I move into Senator D'Arcy, and just bring you to core document ... page 33, it's the minutes of the board's meeting of AIB in December 2008, and, Mr. Dobey, you were speaking to Senator MacSharry there a while ago, with regard to the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the view of AIB on this.  Can I just ask you ... if you look at paragraph three in that ... Mr. Sheehy reported that investors were expressing concerns with respect to capital adequacy and dividend policy.  He considered the capital position to be satisfactory and did not foresee a need to go to the market for equity.  With respect to dividend, he advised that, in due course, management was likely to recommend a 10% increase in the interim dividend.  Some directors expressed reservations in relation to such an increase.  Now, in your own comment there earlier, you said that your interpretation of this is ... was that it was a show of strength.  Now, a show of strength can be a real show of strength or an implied show of strength.  Which do you think it was?</p></speech>

I believe Mr. Gleeson has addressed this in his evidence and has expressed his view on it now.</p></speech>

AIB had raised capital, I think it's referred to earlier in the minutes, it has raised tier 2 capital, around that time, so the capital markets were still open to AIB at that time.  And ... we didn't have to form a view, as auditor, as to whether that opinion ... that dividend was appropriate.  The circumstances where an auditor would get involved in whether a dividend was appropriate would be as part of our year-end audit, if there's a distribution made that is illegal or is beyond ... brings them beyond the capital distributed reserves, then that's an issue.  But at that time, AIB's belief was that they had distributed reserves and based on our previous audit -we hadn't done an audit at the half-year but we had done some work - the AIB financial statements were still showing very significant distributed reserves.</p></speech>

The fact that AIB was predicting ... had taken loan loss provisions of &euro;1.8 billion in 2008 and was predicting a further &euro;6.2 [billion], I believe, on a stress case, was ... important in our consideration of the going concern and yes, it was important, and we engaged.  So we were concerned in 2009 about liquidity and we spoke to the deputy governor of the Central Bank around the availability of ELA, and we got assurances in relation to that matter.  We were also concerned, in 2009, about the capital of the bank and solvency, if I can put it that way.  They had agreed ... the Government had agreed to put capital into the bank of &euro;3.5 billion.  That came in Q2.  We weren't sure whether that was enough and we spoke to the Department of Finance ... to the assistant secretary general of the Department of Finance in February 2009 to get assurances that if more capital was required it would be made available.</p></speech>

So I think the most effective way is to get somebody in, and, typically, when somebody's taking over they would probably be shadowing the year before they take over to get an understanding of it, so they come in ... so it's ... it's an extensive process, and I think five years is about right to get familiarity and in-depth knowledge, but not too long to be over-familiar, and not to be fresh in your approach to it.</p></speech>

I'm going to qualify that now, Chairman.  In evidence, Mr. Donal Forde, when asked, "Did you understand the flaw in [the] standard when it was introduced?", he replied, "I had a view that it wasn't an appropriate formula".  That view was held by all the senior people in AIB.  Subsequently, in Mr. Eugene Sheehy's evidence, he stated, "It's a totally nonsensical accounting standard from a banking point of view", and "We discussed whether we should go to the regulator with our concerns".  Could you offer your view, for both gentleman, in relation to those statements from those very senior banking officials within AIB?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.1962" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Dobey" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#OO02900"><p>The first thing to say is I don't believe that AIB senior management held a view that the accounts reflecting IAS 39 didn't give a true and fair view, and that's very important to me because the primary responsibility for the true and fair view, given by the accounts, rests with the directors.  And indeed, the directors, including the chairman, and the directors, signed the financial statements and approved them in the belief, I believe, that they gave a true and fair view.  So, the first part of your question, I don't believe that the application of IFRS negated the true and fair view.  In actual fact I believe the true and fair view was informed by IFRS, and our opinions state that the accounts give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS, which is an explanation of what the true and fair view is.  The true and fair view must be informed by some rules because, your true and fair view and my true and fair view ... they'd be a different true and fair view by individuals, it's a pretty broad term.  So it's ... it's explained by reference to accounting standards.  So that's the first and very important, point.  And ... and if I believed that AIB were saying that they didn't believe the accounts gave ... gave a true and fair view that would be something, that would be significant.  I don't believe that's the case.  I'm aware, though, of the views of AIB in relation to IFRS, and I was aware at the time.  There was an extensive dialogue in AIB around the application of IFRS.  One of the issues in IFRS ... the reason why IAS 39 was introduced in relation to loan loss provision was to stop income smoothing.  And there was a very significant debate around income smoothing in, in the US actually, in 1998, when chairman Levitt of the SEC outlawed earnings management.  And there was a very significant dialogue between the SEC and the Fed in the US, that went on for ... for three years until it eventually resolved in 2001, what, yes, 2001, that the incurred loss model prevailed.  And the issue here was, that the Federal Reserve, like regulators, for example, would like to have significant buffers in their general provisions, by general provisions to enable banks, maybe, to report less volatile earnings.  The Fed might like that there would be more buffers and provisions to smooth earnings, because that encouraged confidence, it avoided volatility.  What the SEC were very focused on was to make sure there wasn't earnings management.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Rourke, in your opinion, did KPMG feel it was the right standard to adopt, IAS 39?</p></speech>

The benefits of accounting standards is that they are objective and what .... IAS 39 was certainly a very objective standard.  It tried to remove any subjectivity, in other words, people deciding, well, it's ... we'll put away this amount this year, and this amount another year.  And the problem beforehand was that people were putting away different amounts in different places, so analysts, in trying, and investors trying to understand the financial statements of banks were coming up with different answers.  When IAS 39 came along, the benefit was you knew that the only things that were provided for were incurred losses.  Now, there is , I mean, there is, we grew up with the concept of prudence in banking and prudence was this concept of putting away more money but there is another side to the coin, which is the objective, and it's good to have objectivity as well.  I think what ... this debate has now moved on, the IASB are moving towards an expected loss model.  But it was one of the things about an expected loss model, is you only provide for expected losses, you don't provide for unexpected losses.  It's still got to be done on the basis of evidence of credit deterioration.  So, expected loss is not providing for unexpected loss then, it's not back to the old general provisioning, we just put away whatever we think we should put away.  And, therefore, I think there, there was definitely merit in IAS 39 and I think where we're getting to now is probably a more sensible situation.</p></speech>

I mean, the financial statements tell the story of numbers based on certain rules but there are other things to be taken into account and the Financial Regulator has other weapons and other methods of assuring and I mean, banks have a way of making sure that they have enough capital.  I mean, putting aside additional audit provisions is one way of doing it but there are other ways of doing it as well.

In 2008, we took steps to obtain assurances from the Financial Regulator and that was to address just what ... make sure they were aware of what the Financial Regulator was aware of.  We spoke to the Central Bank because we wanted to understand ELA and the information ... what dialogue was going on between the Central Bank and the euro system.  And we did that in 2008 and we got the assurances we need from the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and we also spoke to the Department in relation to capital.  Now, when we came along ... and we, therefore, concluded that those banks were going concerns, that there wasn't a significant ... there wasn't a matter that cast a significant doubt on their ability to continue as a going concern because if we had concluded that there was such a matter, we would have included an emphasis of matter in our reports.  When we got out to 2010, we sought ... sorry, in 2009 we got the same assurances, we had the same concerns and when we got out to 2010, I think, maybe we were just after an election ... there wasn't a Minister for Finance in place and we didn't get the assurances that we required and we did put an emphasis of matter paragraph into the accounts for a number of banks ... that we audited.</p></speech>

They would have other security that they might have liked to have.   When the downturn hit, there was that issue that you've referred to of multiple borrowers having borrowed from multiple banks and that was very, very difficult for the banks to resolve because each bank then was scrambling to strengthen its security position and, actually, I think, in that regard, NAMA was very helpful because NAMA could get all of those borrowers under one roof and resolve the security package together.  So, there was that issue in relation to resolving the position in relation to borrowers but AIB would have known exactly what securities it had, it just mightn't ... might have liked to have more ... as the position in the economy deteriorated and there was a scramble for security.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.1980" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terence O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#PP01100"><p>Well, a couple of things have already happened.  I mean, one of the things, I think, more dialogue with the regulator along the way through.  I mean, we did report every year to the regulator as required but the new protocols now of the regulator are to meet more regularly to have dialogue with the regulator and to discuss ... make sure each side knew the other.  The regulator is also constrained.  In some meetings we did have with the regulator, the regulator was unable to tell us things.  We'd tell the regulator something and they said, "We can't tell you anything back because we're constrained by confidentiality".  Now some of those confidentiality rules have been lifted, so there's a more open dialogue now between regulator and auditor which, I think, is important.</p>  <p>  A couple of other things, one is the going concern basis and the basis on which banks decide that they are a going concern, there is now agreement there should be extensive disclosures of what the issues the directors took into consideration when they're making those things.  The guidance, for example, previously would have focused on liquidity and now it's very clear that going concern decisions should be based both on liquidity and solvency.  Also, the previous guidance on going concern was more about a point-in-time, intermittent, "Are we a going concern today when we do our accounts?".  And now the view is that this should be a matter of constant ... under constant attention by a company and they should be looking to make sure they're a going concern at all times.  So, those things are helpful.</p>  <p>  And finally, I would say in audit reporting, we now see that audit reports which are boilerplate ... they were beforehand, there was a lot of things we had to say but they were pretty much the same things we said to everybody.  Now, auditors are required to identify the major risks that they have identified, so that in their published audit report to shareholders to say, "These are the things that we think could give rise to most risk of the accounts being wrong and this is why we think those things are the biggest risks."   We also ... Auditors also use materiality, in other words, we don't audit every last penny because we'd be there forever if we .... so we take a material ... and make sure everything is materially right, whether the balance sheet is &euro;100 million or &euro;99.9 million, it doesn't make much difference but if it was &euro;90 million it would be a big difference, so there's a materiality aspect and auditors now have got to disclose in their audit report what materiality judgments they use.  And, finally, auditors have got to now to say in their audit report in a bespoke way what they've done in terms of the major risks they identified - so, what audit work have they done to work on the major risks.  So, those are now published and are in the audit reports of public interest entities and are a new feature which was not there in the crisis.  So, all those are helpful, I think, for readers----</p></speech>

You've caught me by surprise there.  Gentlemen, I've a general question at the start about risk assessment and maybe it's more appropriate for Mr. Dobey, but feel free to answer, Mr. O'Rourke, if you wish.  With regards to the preparation of the firm's annual audit plan, and the risk assessment underpinning it, did the risk assessment approach adopted change to meet the prevailing, challenging environment in the period which we're discussing and if you can maybe outline if it did change and how it did change?  And, furthermore, did the firm conduct their own independent assessment of the bank's credit risk methodology to satisfy themselves that the principles and processes adopted by AIB were appropriate?</p></speech>

I think, as I've mentioned in my opening statement, what was underestimated by AIB was the extent and scale of the downturn and the implications it would have, but we didn't have the concern about their detailed processes.  As I mentioned also there was a very detailed risk assessment process within AIB that identified all of the risks.  They were aware of all of the risks.  They may have underestimated the consequences of some of those risks but they were aware of them.  Maybe to answer the first part of your question if I may, and I don't wish to go on for too long, but we did a very detailed assessment and I can take you through, if you wish, some of the comments that we would have been making-----</p></speech>

I'll try.  So, in 2004, we would have been talking about strong credit in the economy.  We would have been talking about economic conditions and competitive pressures that could exacerbate profitability caused by increased competition and falling margins.</p>  <p>  In 2005, we talked about continued credit growth and demand in AIB's markets, particularly in Ireland.  We talked about a risk that credits might deteriorate post-approval and policies are not reviewed to reflect the changes in economic environment which could adversely affect credit quality.  Also in 2005, we highlighted the level of exposure to different economies and sectors.</p>  <p>  In 2006, we highlighted significant and continued growth in the new business volumes and increased credit concentrations in the property sector.  At that time, there was increasing ECB interest rates and we were concerned about its impact on the Irish economy; that didn't end up being a big issue.  We talked about the competitive environment and we made a comment on the aggressive new entrants to the local market with an established infrastructure.  We talked about competition to secure long-term capital funding and we talked about the integrity of management information and financial reporting which was dependent on the effectiveness of internal control systems and the tension between that and the drive to maintain EPS momentum and control costs.</p>  <p>  In 2007, things were getting a little more difficult.  We talked about the provisioning assumptions will require continuous monitoring and appropriate revision as credit grading policies and procedures develop.  The favourable credit environment in AIB's markets is reflected in the current provisioning levels.  However, as interest rate rises take effect and additional information becomes available, the provisioning may need to be updated to take account of the impact of any deterioration in the credit environment.  That was in late 2006, in the context of our 2007 audit.  We talked about underwriting in the current environment and breaches of underwriting limits.  We talked about the deterioration of credits post-underwriting approval, including the impact of current market turmoil.  We talked about credit rating and liquidity positions to support growth aspirations, the significance of the Irish economy to the group and its impact on generating sustainable growth, and we talked about the natural tension between maintaining the integrity of management information versus the ongoing drive to maintain EPS momentum.</p>  <p>  And I can continue, if you wish.</p></speech>

I want to put a quote to you from Mr. Fitzpatrick from yesterday.  I asked him whether ... he's the head of audit in Deloitte ... whether they do bank auditing differently now than they did when they were auditing Ulster Bank prior to the collapse and in light of the findings of the Nyberg report.  His response was:</p><blockquote>I wouldn't ... I wouldn't say we've done it differently.  I think that ... that the emphasis around our whole organisation about the importance of scepticism is reinforced and maybe more so reinforced which is that idea of constantly reinforcing that view of the sceptical mind.</blockquote>  <p>Do you do your bank auditing differently as a result of what you've learned from the crash or, indeed, in light of the findings of the Nyberg report?</p></speech>

I've given you some examples, as we've talked ... I've just given you some and I've talked to you about the going concern assessment that we ... and steps we had to take in 2007 and 2008 and we were quite concerned about AIB in 2008 and for us to take those steps and talk to the Government was unprecedented actually, so that reflected the scepticism.

I suppose what we would say in relation to the AIB audits is we were very thorough.  We did a very thorough review of all of the loans' exposures when the downturn happened.  We were looking at those beforehand, but we weren't overly concerned about the recoverability because of the strength of the economy and the elevated property prices.  We need to be sceptical, and maintaining that scepticism is important and having that expertise within our firm is important.  Having the international ... the dialogue with our international colleagues is important.  We were doing that in 2007, we've continued to do it.  Obviously, audits need to evolve to reflect the changing environment.  I would say our bank audits ... there's much more dialogue with Government and regulators now and that's important.</p></speech>

Finally, earlier, very early, much earlier in our inquiry, Professor William Black was here.  He was an American ex-regulator and under questioning from me he made the following quote, he ... in relation to auditors:</p><blockquote>The straightforward answer is not to allow the bankers to pick the auditors.  There should instead be a panel of qualified auditors that are assigned to them, and we should track the performance of those auditors.  It would be like relegation.  If someone had a record of screwing up, they get yanked from the panel, assuming what they did was not criminal.  If it was criminal, they are driven out of business, but if it was just inept, they get relegated.</blockquote>  <p>Firstly, and to use his phrase, do you regard any of the audit practices of KPMG in relation to AIB as being &quot;inept&quot;?  And that's his ... his word, not mine.  And, secondly, would you care to comment on his view that banks shouldn't be choosing their own auditors, and that such a system of relegation would apply for auditors who are shown, maybe, to have not performed their duties correctly?</p></speech>

We did very high quality audit on the AIB, I'm quite sure of that.  Secondly, in relation to the other matter, the auditors are chosen by, these days, the non-executive directors.  The audit committee are the people who choose it on behalf of shareholders.  We are the shareholders' auditors and they're chosen by representatives of the shareholders, who are the non-executive directors.  Also, our work is reviewed by regulators, so if we were, you know, inept, or if there was auditors who weren't doing what they're doing, the regulators would be calling them out.  And that's the way, I think, that the system should work.</p></speech>

I thought he questioned the integrity of auditors generally, and there was a generalisation made that I didn't recognise in his evidence, particularly in so far as it relates to Ireland.  I'm not sure what experience he had in the savings and loans process in the US.  And maybe ... I think if there was ... somebody was doing inept ... an inept job in our firm - that very rarely happens - but we would be absolutely comfortable that person should be yanked from whatever role they were fulfilling.</p></speech>

So would you have come across this problem when you were then auditing - in 2002 - the year 2001?</p></speech>

There was a very extensive programme put in place between 2002 and 2007, particularly in relation to the ROI division.  We called it Project Alpha.  And that was designed to facilitate better information flows and particularly in relation to customer information.  And would have also facilitated things like credit provisioning  But AIB had a lot of manual processes, this was a suggestion that their needed to be more ... better systems and more systemised processes.  There was also a very active dialogue in AIB... well, sorry, this predated the Rusnak fraud, which was before our time.  But post-Rusnak, there was very detailed work done in AIB to change all of its processes.  I think they talked ... the AIB people who came before you talked about the very extensive processes they went through.  John Hyman did some work with them, Deloittes did a review of all their credit processes and there was also, in that time, some change to their risk infrastructure.  They were a very decentralised organisation prior to the Rusnak crisis, post that they put in certain ... they centralised risk and they centralised finance over time.  And I think that was what ... this was the genesis of that.</p></speech>

And you talked, Mr. Dobey, in your opening statement about the effective communications of risks between KPMG and AIB.  And here we have, in relation to credit control and credit provisioning, an observation in the second paragraph on the left hand side, "During the course of our audit, we noticed 11 significant provisions raised in December 2004, nine of which were without the prior approval of the relevant credit committee."  So, is that an example of you as auditors catching something that AIB itself weren't aware of?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2070" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Dobey" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#VV01000"><p>I'm not sure if AIB weren't aware of it, but there was a process in AIB where, towards the end of the year, they would process their loan loss provisions.  We would've preferred that they did it throughout the year, but it was done towards the end of the year.  There was a number of reasons why this was a practice we didn't ... we weren't particularly keen on.  Firstly, as I've mentioned earlier, in a bank, the closer the relationship manager is to the loan, the greater the risk.  So, in this instance, and the way ... the way banks manage that is by having approval processes and credit committees.  In this case, we would have liked to have seen where loans were being written off, and I'm not saying there was a fraud, but there is an increased risk of fraud between the borrower and the lender ... the lending ... the relationship manager ... and the bank's controls on that was to have all write-offs or provisions go through a credit committee.  There was obviously, I would say, a lot of work done towards the end of this particular year and credit provisions were processed.  We would've been happy that they were processed timely but we would have preferred if they'd gone through the credit provisioning process ... the credit committee process.  And one of the key... it's on the right hand side of that page ... one of the key matters ... what's really important about when credit provisions are taken is that there is learnings from that loan loss.  So, if you advance a loan and then you have to take a provision against it, the most critical thing from the bank's perspective is that you learn the lessons from that loan.  What was the problem?  Why did this loan go bad?  Was it the underwriting decision that was wrong?  Was it the management of the loan over the period or whatever, right?  So, as I said, the main purpose of the markup is to analyse the cause of the loss and to learn from our loss experience, in addition to confirming the appropriates of the provision.  So it was those two things that we were pointing out.  So you're absolutely right, this was something that we were, sort of, picking up and ... and improvements that we thought AIB could make.</p></speech>

And in our management letters, when we raise management letter points, we'd raise them in one year, the following year we'd look, if the matter came up again we'd highlight it again.  If there was an action from the previous year that wasn't dealt with, we'd capture that as an action that wasn't dealt with, and the chairman of the AIB audit committee at the time was very focused on items getting resolved on a timely basis.  So one of his key metrics as chair of the audit committee was; how many items did internal audit raise, how many items did external audit raise ... and is management dealing with those matters on a timely basis?  And that would have been, you know, about an appropriate control environment.</p></speech>

He talked about the big auditing institutions having access to warning signs, and it was unexpected, he said, that the international experience that big auditing firms had was not used more.

One of the things, I'm not an expert in Spanish law, but it's different than Irish law.  So when the EU ... IFRS regulation was brought into Irish law it was brought in fully with no carve-outs, and we didn't have the option of having that carve-out that was available in Irish law, sorry, that was available in Spanish law, and I have to say I don't understand all the details around Spanish law.  I can say that the audit firms in Spain qualified the accounts of the Spanish banks to say that they were not in compliance with IFRS.  Now for AIB, given that it had access to ... European capital markets and US capital markets, it wanted to apply IFRS and wanted that opinion from its auditors and the market would have demanded its opinion from its auditors in relation to IFRS.</p>  <p>  The other thing I can say is while what was called dynamic provisioning was operated in Spain, it was only operated in relation to a small portion of its book and it was there for a particular reason, which I think was to do with holdings that Spanish banks held in Spanish companies.  And,all I can say as an observation is that the additional provisions that were set aside as a result of that were, were not sufficient to save the Spanish banks from the, the, the ... very significant issues that they faced. </p></speech>

If a bank thinks it needs more capital, it can hold capital.  It can decide not to pay dividends, we had that discussion earlier on.  It can decide to raise capital in the markets.  If the regulator thinks there's greater risk in the banks than they would like to see, they can specify that greater capital should be held against those risks.  So IFRS accounting is only one small piece in the picture here, and the other thing I should say to you; when general provisions are set aside by banks, they're not necessarily a buffer against capital because the capital adequacy rules, under the CRD are such that those loan loss general provisions get added back to capital.  So they're not available always as buffer.  Now they get ... it's technical but they get added back to tier 2 capital.  But they do get added back to capital and it's not necessarily a buffer against loss in that circumstance.</p></speech>

I mean, the regulators do various different things in different countries and we would look at, you know, in Canada they did something different.  </p>  <p>         In Germany they do something different and there is a college of regulators that gets together across the EU where they would discuss those matters and I assume they were aware of what other regulators are doing; there is a forum for them to do that.  But we wouldn't have discussed this with the regulator and we wouldn't have viewed it as our role to set the capital for the banks.  That was the role of the regulator.</p></speech>

You are very welcome, Mr. Dobey and Mr. O'Rourke.  Just for disclosure purposes, Chair, I worked with KPMG in Cork from 1997 to 2001 where I trained and qualified but did not work in any financial services audits, just to put it on the record.  Can I start by asking Mr. O'Rourke if any legal action was taken or threatened against KPMG in respect of your audits of AIB over the last number of years?</p></speech>

It's a number but it's small part of our total audit ... total revenues.  And the ethical guidance of auditors that was set by international standards is that, if you get more than 10% of your audit fees from a client, then you begin to get risk situations and you get to get questions about auditor's independence, but the levels at AIB was far below that.</p></speech>

And there are 18 pages dealing with risk management and there isn't a single reference to property and construction.  And if I can just put the question in some context, I suppose, for Mr. Dobey, for example, in that year, total loans and receivables to customers were &euro;127.6 billion, of which construction and property, which we can see on ... in one of the notes of the accounts, was &euro;46.4 billion, so about 36% of the total loans and receivables.  And if you stripped out home mortgages, which were just over &euro;30 billion, then construction and property accounted for 48% of the loans which were due to AIB.  Now, do you believe it is appropriate that, in 18 pages dealing with risk management, that there wouldn't be a reference to the exposure of the bank to the construction and property sector?</p></speech>

I mean, the 2008 financial statements would've been agreed and published in early 2009, so that would've been after the bank guarantee and after the crash, for want of a better phrase, in September 2008.  The issue I'm raising is, you know, people who would've been relying on financial statements for 2005, 2006, 2007 ... yes, in the note dealing with loans owed to the bank, there is a breakdown by sector and you can see construction and property is there, but there is no commentary around it.

I would've believed that there was disclosures in the accounts setting out the property in relation to disclosures.

Property was obviously an issue but property prices were reasonably elevated at that point also.</p></speech>

In 2008, we added very significant going concern disclosures, so while the accounts are the preserve of the directors, our opinion is on the financial statements, and if there's something that should be in the accounts that we think is not, we will put it in.

And ... the credit markets froze in August 2007, as you're probably aware, and some of these securities that AIB held that were used previously as part of its liquidity now became very difficult to value.  Again, we spoke to the regulator about that in late 200... sorry, early 2008, and we looked for additional disclosures in the AIB financial statements, and they were put in.  I can think, going back to, on transition to IFRS, we were very involved in the dialogue around what additional disclosures should go in the financial statements, and we would have been looking at, I remember at the time we would look at the RBS financial statements, the National Australia Bank financial statements, the HBOS financial statements, and make sure that best practice was being applied by AIB -so there was an iterative process.  And it isn't a case of just, we take the financial statements, we do a two-page audit opinion and we move on.  There's a very detailed dialogue around what we believe should go into the financial statements, and our audit findings document with the audit committee would set out those views also.</p></speech>

In terms of your communications with the AIB audit committee, and you referred to this in your opening, your witness statement, page 7, that between 2004 and 2007, those communications would have included the identification of risks relating to, or arising from, property funding and liquidity, and I assume that the extracts you read out there to Deputy Phelan a few moments ago were from those communications to the audit committee.  When was the first reference made by KPMG to the AIB audit committee in respect of the concentration risk relating to exposure to property and construction?  In your commentary a while ago, it appeared to be 2006 that the first specific reference to that risk, concentration risk, in property and construction.</p></speech>

Credit markets ... the first Bear Stearns fund went down in June 2007, the capital markets froze in August 2007 for certain securities.  I believe Bear Stearns was taken over by JP Morgan in late 2007.  There were certain securities that were held in AIB's traded credit book that were difficult to value.  We had concerns, as I've mentioned.  We raised those concerns with AIB.  They did the work they needed to do to get us satisfied and we were happy.</p></speech>

I need to answer that question with a little bit more context.  If we hadn't got the assurances we looked for from the Department of Finance in relation to capital, the Central Bank in relation to availability of ELA when we met them in February 2009, we would have had an emphasis of matter ... sorry, we could have because I don't know what else we would have done.</p></speech>

My understanding, and I don't have a perfect understanding because I didn't talk to the Government at the time, was when the guarantee was given, there was a desire on the part of the various parties to avoid Ireland using emergency liquidity access ... assistance rather.

So, if a company is ... has borrowed from the bank and it is trading fine for a while and then it loses its biggest customer, right, the event ... that ... and the cash flows dry up, the event that drives a loss for the bank is that ... the loss is that customer, right?  So, if the company has, for example, cash on its books and it can continue to pay interest and principal, it may take six months for it ... not ... it to default on the loan.  That's IBNR and what you've got to work out, in IFRS terms, is what is the period in which losses have been incurred but not reported and over what period do they emerge.</p>  <p>  The other thing that's set out in IFRS, and again this is ... IFRS is pretty complicated in this matter ... is if you have ... IFRS asks you to look at historic loss rates in relation to your IBNR, but if you know you're in a more difficult environment now than the history reflects, you're allowed to take account of an adjustment factor.  We, and it's in our detailed communications with the audit committee that ... or with the committee, we had a huge debate with AIB in relation to this matter in 2008.  As we talked earlier about the paper we did on 3 November which dealt with the specific provisions and we were ... we would have ... we were encouraging AIB to take more IBNR and actually, when they got towards the end of the audit, they did take IBNR, a significant IBNR to deal with that downside risk.</p></speech>

It allows you to take account of losses, events that have already happened which will emerge in the future, if I can put it that way.  Right?

I also would point you to some of the comments we've made earlier on in relation to the risks we were highlighting over the period and also the dialogue we were having with the Financial Regulator, particularly in 2007 and 2008.  And if you're asking me did I have a crystal ball in 2004, I'm afraid I didn't.</p></speech>

Well, let's pursue it a little bit.  Maybe Mr. O'Rourke, with yourself.  In your opening written statement, or ... that you provided us, you said: "One of the key steps in an audit is to assess the risks arising from the business model and strategies followed."  Right?  An audit is to assess the risks arising from the business model and strategies followed.  </p>  <p>               You then went on and you said, ''[The auditor] is required to form an opinion as to whether the consequences of those strategies and models are properly reflected in the financial statements in accordance with [regulations, essentially].  Now, you go on, "While it is now clear that the business models and property-related lending strategies of the Irish institutions led to large losses being incurred, it was only when it became likely that property prices would decrease and that the economy would contract that the consequences of these were permitted to be reflected in the financial statements."  Now, does that suggest, Mr. O'Rourke, that you would ... you could have seen, and perhaps you did see, risks arising from the business models and strategies that you could have had perhaps serious concerns about those but that there was no mechanism for reporting that in a significant way?</p></speech>

I mean risk has got two issues.  One of the elements you have to understand is what is likelihood of the risk occurring and then, secondly, what the impact of the risk occurring would be.  And the risks that turned out to be occurred, as we now know from the losses which you have described, they were not seen to be as likely risks.  They were seen as remote risks ... in the terms of it.</p>  <p>  Well, the issue for me ... for us, as auditors is to make sure the banks very clearly assess those risks professionally, thoroughly, getting best information that they could as to whether ... what the likelihood of the risks occurring ... in arising out of things like property loans about concentration.  All of those things were on the table.  They were debated and discussed at the banks.  They got the best information that they could and then we stood back and we took our independent view of whether those risks were properly evaluated and whether they took into account the likelihood of those risks occurring and whether, in terms of the financial statements whether they reflected the likelihood of the risks occurring.  And we were happy with that process and happy that the likelihood was properly assessed, based on the best information.  And it turns out that best information did not accurately predict the future.  We had a very extreme event occurring which nobody foresaw, virtually nobody foresaw.</p></speech>

I was trying to come up with an analogy, perhaps.  It's ... if I just put this to you and ask you to comment.  That you were asked to do a mechanical audit on a juggernaut.  So the engine is okay, the wheels are fine, the suspension and body work okay.  The truck is overloaded a bit but the ... you tell the driver that.  And the driver knows this.  So you pass the vehicle.  Now, you know the road ahead goes downhill, that it has precipices on each side, that the brake won't be able to check the extra weight.  But you're not allowed to flag that in a significant way until the truck goes over the precipice.  Is that any way of relating to the rules that you are bound by?</p></speech>

So our job is in relation to financial statements - do the financial statements accurately portray the way that that ... the way the financial position of that entity?  So in terms of the audit of the banks, the audit of AIB, do people reading those accounts do hey understand how much money they have lent to the property sector?  Do they understand how much the loan book has grown?  Do they understand how that's financed?  Are all those issues clear on the accounts?  The answer is "Yes".</p>  <p>  So that's the main issue that those issues were clearly reported in the accounts and that everybody to make their own judgments on that.  Our judgment was - have management made the right decision in terms of financial reporting as a consequence of those risks, as a consequence of the way the balance sheet is?  And the management did make the right decision at the time, based on the best information they could get.</p></speech>

Why did your organisation not, and other organisations, indeed, not learn from those and understand it was eminently repeatable when the same circumstances were being created in Ireland?</p></speech>

In terms of the audit work, what the auditors have got to do in terms of the risk, they've got to look out for ... that was very clear.  We've got the training in it on all the kind of things that can go wrong in banks.  But you know ... for every a hundred times people ... and one person says this is going to happen, and 99 people say that's going to happen - you go with the 99 people, not the one, because at the end of the day you've got to go with objective evidence of what's most likely to happen.  And the evidence overwhelmingly - from ESRI, from IMF, from the financial stability report Central Bank - was that the Irish economy was facing into a soft landing.  So that was the basis on which we made our judgments.</p></speech>

Why wasn't a red flag flown high?</p></speech>

None of us saw that.  And why is it?  One of the other issues of bubbles is that people always are able to rationalise it.  I went to many discussions by prominent and eminent economists who told us why the Irish economy was going to go to a soft landing and would not be heading into crash because there were demographics, because of our FDI and for lots of other reasons why the Irish economy would be okay.  And that was ... we looked for the best evidence, and that's our job, as auditors, to get the best evidence we can with the experts.  We're not economists, we're auditors, we're are applying rules and we need to take the best evidence we can and the best evidence we can was that ... that there was a risk, and everybody ... we identified the risk - if property prices decline there will be big loss in the banks.  We said that and the issue for us was ... for management, have they assessed whether that risk is likely or not and, for us, have they properly reflected the likelihood of that risk.  And the best evidence we had was that they had properly assessed the likelihood of that risk.</p></speech>

I haven't time to give a quote in detail, but he referred to what he himself said in October 2003, which was early enough in the process.  He is referring to property but particularly to housing.  "The Irish housing market is a scam ... [a] financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt ... [and it's a] confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and the landowners."</p></speech>

Alan Ahearne, in evidence told us of a study in 2005 - that he published - about 44 booms and busts internationally in many countries where you operate I've no doubt.  So a view could be put that really it should have been seen and it should have been stopped in advance.  And just ... my very last question, Chairman, is this.  In relation to Allied Irish Banks in particular, you made the point, I think, Mr. Dobey, it was yourself, that it was very difficult to get in accurate information the extent of the exposure, etc., when you were trying to do that ... let me just finish the question because he's going to cut me off here.  In your opinion, did the bank's management and board structure ... in Allied Irish Banks, impede the provision of good governance within the bank or what impact did that have, if any?</p></speech>

I'm not sure if I was incorrect earlier but what I was trying to say was that trying to get a grip on the losses in 2008 was extremely difficult.

I mean if you look at what happened in late 2008 and early 2009, there was a huge contraction in the economy.  We had Lehman's, we had the TARP, we had the guarantee, we had foreign markets froze, we had secret loans - if I can put it that way - in the UK, we had ... there was bank mergers every ... in Europe and in the US.  We were in hugely uncertain times and trying - and I could take you through the economic forecasts that were there at the time and what ultimately transpired - we were trying to assess in a very, very difficult time, the loan loss provisions for AIB.  </p>  <p>         That involved a huge amount of work, and we kept going until we got to the very end, and we were absolutely comfortable when we got to the end, because if we didn't ... if we weren't absolutely comfortable, we wouldn't have signed the audit opinion.</p></speech>

You're not alone and we've had many witnesses before the committee who also failed to see the property bubble bursting.  They took the opportunity here to apologise to the Irish public or maybe in your regard you may want to offer an apology to the shareholders of AIB, or maybe you do not, but do you want this opportunity to apologise or do you believe that you have anything to apologise for on behalf of KPMG?</p></speech>

Of course, it's regrettable that the crash occurred.  Of course, it is terrible for the Irish people that we face what we into.

AIB reported to the market in its interim management statement on 4 November that it believed there would be &euro;950 million of loan loss provisions for that year.  That was ... at that time, AIB was carrying out its work, it had a criticised loan process it was going through, it had allocated... very many people from the front line into assessing the loan loss provisions.  And it came up with the &euro;950 million.</p></speech>

You'd be aware in terms of the NAMA test ... NAMA testimony and what's transcribed from the transfer of known loans to NAMA, hat there were &euro;811 million of loans that were transferred to NAMA across the financial institutions that had unenforceable securities.  From AIB's point of view, it made up &euro;164.6 million and that was the price that NAMA paid for them, which was an average of 77% reduction.  If you were to apply that, what the loan value would be, you'd be well over &euro;400 million.  Did KPMG come to any estimation that it was in that region that, for example NAMA, the transfer to loans from AIB to NAMA, for every &euro;57 of loans that were transferred, one loan... &euro;1 had an unenforced security, was not enforceable.  Did KPMG recognise that, did KPMG audit those loans, audit the documentation?</p></speech>

We audited a portion of those loans to get ourselves comfortable with the processes that AIB had gone through.  As I mentioned earlier, we found certain issues with those loans.  And when we found issues with those loans, we extrapolated that across the whole portfolio and certain additional provisions were taken.  We didn't look at every single loan, I can only imagine that that extrapolation would have dealt with some of the issues that you have mentioned but I couldn't specify for sure that it did.</p></speech>

And I know the Law Society looked at this, and I know that whole system has been reformed.  But, at the time, we are saying, as in terms of audit work, we could see that there were solicitor's undertakings there as good security, we relied on those solicitor's undertaking, as AIB's processes were, they had a process of getting ... top tier or second tier law firms to give those undertakings and it turns out that in retrospect that that ... those solicitor's undertakings didn't always come good.  But I think it was reasonable for us at the time to say, "Solicitor's undertaking will get us there in terms of the security."</p></speech>

So of the &euro;9 million that were transferred to NAMA, the fact that... &euro;9 billion sorry.  The fact that &euro;164 million was unenforceable, that ... is that not a very large percentage of that loan book, and was significant focus put on that in relation to the audit?

As I mentioned earlier in response to Deputy O'Donnell's question, there was a lot of issues in the system at the time.  There was, obviously imperfection, imperfect security.  We... there was an IBNR taken to deal with those issues in AIB.  These are things that might emerge that we didn't know about yet.  And that number was in the region of &euro;800 million, so in our view that would have been caught up.  These type of issues would have been caught up in that IBNR provision.</p></speech>

In the paper we referred to earlier, the 3 November paper, it set out the fact that there were issues we needed to face, and the loans we needed to deal with in the context of the audit.

Oh, I have it here.  The assurances we got from the ... sorry, firstly, I need to go back a bit.  We were unsure, as I said in my opening statement, as to whether AIB would need additional capital or not.  But there was a lot of uncertainty  at the time, and to address part of your question, we were aware of the declines in values and we were estimating that there'd be a 30% or 40% decline in property values in doing our audit.  We sought assurances from the Central Bank in relation to liquidity, and from the Department of Finance in relation to potentially would capital be made available.  To answer your question, that was a verbal assurance that we got; it wasn't a written assurance and it confirmed the statements of support that had been given by the Minister for Finance. </p></speech>

That was one assurance we got.</p><blockquote>He also noted the Government would be reluctant to step in with additional investment or to nationalise AIB unless there was <i>force majeure</i>.  He noted that the Government had no interest in managing or controlling the banks but the properly functioning banking system was of critical importance to the country.  He did note, however, that the Department would seek to influence credit, remuneration, and regulatory and risk policies in the bank, and that some of this was already happening under the Government's bank guarantee scheme.</blockquote>  <p>There was ... I was concerned about M&amp;amp;T, and I had a discussion with him in relation to M&amp;amp;T, because we were carrying goodwill on the financial statements of AIB.  And I asked whether AIB could be forced to dispose of M&amp;amp;T, and that would have been one of the ways that AIB could have raised capital, or they could have disposed of Poland:</p><blockquote>KC [that's Kevin Cardiff] did note that these business interests [that's Poland and M&amp;amp;T] had generated good diversity and potentially growth of earnings for AIB.  He noted that it was unlikely that the Government would support significant growth in AIB's overseas business or emerging businesses at the expense of providing funding to the consumer, mortgage or SME sector in Ireland [which obviously was the priority for the Government].</blockquote>  <p>  </p>  <p>         There was some discussion around the state of the banking system in Ireland, including some positive comments from Kevin Cardiff regarding the Government support for six banks, subject to the Government guarantee.  Kevin Cardiff did not give any assurance on the extension of the Government guarantee beyond its two-year end date of September 2010 and noted this was one option open to the Government.  And then we had a discussion around emergency liquidity assistance funding from the ECB.  So they were the assurances we got from the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

But was there nobody in the Department that you could meet to give you similar assurances?</p></speech>

In 2011, as I recall, we looked for those assurances.  The Government guarantee was not there any more or was about to expire.  We did have the eligible securities guarantee.  We looked for assurances around liquidity and we spoke to the deputy governor in the Central Bank at that time and he did give us some assurances.  They weren't as fulsome as we would have liked.  Then we went and spoke to the then Secretary General of the Department of Finance at the time and she was not in a position to give us the assurance because she did not have a Minister.</p></speech>

Sorry, firstly, there is always room for professional judgment and for scepticism and we were exercising professional judgement and scepticism at this time.  Deputy O'Donnell has quite rightly identified and importantly identified that there is room for an IBNR to be taken, and that judgment can be applied in making that IBNR.  I talked about adjustment factors, so that is when the historic loss rates might not be ... that the bank was using to determine its IBNR might no longer be appropriate.  That was the conclusion we reached in 2008, and we had extensive discussion with AIB in relation to taking additional provisions.  They were looking at it also to deal with that issue.</p></speech>

You only make an actual provision where there is actually a loss or default, so the fact that a security might have been missing on a good loan does not make that loan bad or does not need a provision against it.</p></speech>

I have mentioned already the dialogue we had in January 2008.  We had a dialogue with the regulator on 21 November 2008 as well and at that meeting, we were starting to have concerns around uncertainties in the system at that point and we spoke to the deputy governor, the deputy governor attended that meeting actually.  We had a good dialogue with the regulator in that period and that dialogue was important, particularly in the latter years, the latter part of that period.  However, I would say section 16 of the Central Bank Act 1942 sets out some very clear restrictions in relation to confidentiality requirements for employees of the Central Bank.  I do not have all the details as to what their contracts say in relation to confidentiality but it was very difficult at that time for us to have a two-way dialogue.  So we tended to go in, have a discussion, raise issues and we weren't really getting much back.  Indeed, I think at that meeting, in February 2008, we were ... there seemed to be a little bit of resistance in relation to giving us assurances.  Now, I understood why that was later, when we spoke to them in January 2009, because effectively it was the monetary authority we needed to speak to in relation to liquidity and not the regulator.</p></speech>

I should've clarified, the analogy was too simple, right.  We were keeping the score in relation to historic financial statements and as Mr. O'Rourke said earlier, we also had a responsibility to assess whether the going concern based on preparation of financial statements was appropriate.  It was in the context of the going concern based on the financial statements which was a future looking thing and maybe that's not keeping the score, right?  That's assessing what the score might be at the end of the game, right?  And we're only at half-time.  We had to go and make an assessment and get assurances from the system, if I put it that way, the Department, the regulator, the Central Bank, around the going concern basis of preparation.</p></speech>

We made sure that our audit opinion in 2007, we were very comfortable with it, but there were issues in AIB at the time.  We talked about it in relation to the traded credit book.  However, if you go back, in 2007 the economy grew by 5.7%, right, so I was thinking about, this could ... there could be issues here, they haven't happened yet.  I was satisfied with the 2007 financial statements.  I was looking forward in relation to going concern.  We got happy that AIB had &euro;30 billion of liquidity and could have raised additional capital itself; it was still accessing the capital markets.  I was happy.</p></speech>

I was merely going to say that the group's criticised loans, including watch, vulnerable and impaired loans, are graded eight to ten.  These are "loans which exhibit weaknesses, where payment is in jeopardy, or where there's objective evidence of impairment.  In addition a portion of the group's criticised loans are included in grade seven", and it goes on then to give the detail of how much money, how many of the loans were tied up.  So this was at a point, this was well before your January-February conversations with the Financial Regulator.  You'd already seen in 2007, 2008, that things were not going well, and that you'd already had to ask for contingency liquidity plans.  You were now in a position where you could see this, and whatever else you could see yourselves.  I am finally coming to it, so I'm just concerned to know how at that point you would end up in all those negotiations, giving, if you like, the assurance, that as a going concern you could let the bank carry on, you could actually sign off on the going concern, given all the things that had gone on?</p></speech>

AIB reported, "We've taken &euro;1.8 billion this year, we've another &euro;6 billion to come in cycle.  We've got lots of losses coming, and there was a risk there could be more". That was said as well.  So what we did was, we said, well, if those risks come to pass, will AIB be there?  And the answer was yes, because the Government had told us they would support the pillar banks.  So, on that basis, it was reasonable for AIB to say, "That's our accounts, we will continue in existence".  So it was a reasonable judgment for us to make, we felt.</p></speech>

Does that correspond at all to a definition of "going concern", knowing that senior people, from the client, were in Government Buildings, you know, looking for money on the 29 September, and that it ended up 98% in public ownership?  That's not a going concern, I think in the views of how most people would define "going concern".  And as you say, there had to be verbal undertakings and letters of comfort, which the Committee of Public Accounts here isn't very wild about ... it's very ... it's a very elastic definition of "going concern".</p></speech>

There needs to be ... I need to put some perspective on this.  The ... the reason we look at going concern is because financial statements are prepared on a basis that assumes the company, or the bank, is going to continue as a going concern.  If you were assume it wasn't going to continue as a going concern, then you would record the assets at mark to market value, we record addition ... liabilities associated, wind-up ... you'd effectively account for the bank on liquidation basis.  So the reason we look at going concern is to assess, one, whether going concern is appropriate, and if it's not, you ... you measure the assets and liabilities on a totally different basis, that's the first point.  The second point is, if you believe there to be an uncertainty around going concern, a significant uncertainty, that may cast doubt on that basis of preparation, then you're required to put an emphasis of matter, and if you disagree with the going concern basis of preparation you ... you qualify your opinion.  I think your ... I'd make a distinction between is it appropriate to ... that the financial statements be prepared on the going concern basis from ... does this entity need more capital?  Which it obvious did need from the Government, but we got assurances around that.  But, based on the assurances we got, the, it would not be allowed to fall over assurance, if I can put it that way, we were satisfied that it was appropriate to ... that the accounts would be prepared on a going concern basis.</p></speech>

But the institute ...  profession ... worked out ... said there are things you can do to make the compliance statement work better and the industry ... well the industry of the industry took for themselves but they also made representations to the regulator and to the Department and, I mean, they're now there, they're now in the current legislation.

And the working assumption at that time was the discounts may be 20%, a little bit later the working assumption was that they may be as much as 35% and, ultimately, they were 56%.  When you go back to the statements that AIB made to the market around the declines in value and they announced that to the market in 2009 based on their stress test, it's not terribly surprising that the NAMA losses were at the level that they were at.  Because, as I said earlier, AIB would have planned to hold those loans through the cycle if it could have, but it didn't for reasons we all know and, ultimately, they were disposed of to NAMA at what, with the benefit of hindsight, was the bottom of the cycle.</p></speech>

That was done in good faith, I believe, and I wasn't ... it wasn't a feature of our engagement with AIB that they were non-compliant if I can put it that way.

In terms of the crash that happened, go back to what I've said earlier.  What happened was ... did the accounts reflect the right numbers and the ... the accounts were accurate.  They reflected the loans given, they reflected the sectoral concentration, they reflected the funding make-up.  All those items were disclosed.  The issue then is whether the accounts should have provided for losses which subsequently happened and the answer is the accounts, obviously, didn't provide for those losses because they were not foreseen and the answer is because to make provisions for losses you need to be able on an objective basis for saying these losses are going to occur and there was no objective evidence, in any time we did our audits before the crash happened, that those losses were going to occur.</p></speech>

So, maybe if ... to wrap that up again, has ... what has actually changed since the crisis period and can bank audit accounts now predict the risk of bank failure, in your opinion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2512" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terence O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#PPP03800"><p>Well, there'd be a number of things, a lot of things done internationally, because it wasn't just in Ireland that banks failed, that is a global issue and there's been a lot of work done by a number of groups saying, "How can we enhance corporate reporting?"  And one of the issues I said earlier that the chairman of the IASB said is that financial numbers only tell so much about a company.  There's other things you need about a company, other than what its assets and liabilities are, what its income and expenditure are.  </p>  <p>         You need to know its business models more, you need to know its risks.  You need to be able in some way to measure the environmental impact of a company.  You need to be able to measure the social impact of a company.  And therefore there's a lot of work being done on can we develop corporate reporting on top of a very sound basis of the numbers being done in a certain way, can we give other information to people that'll help them better understand a business and the risks it face?  That work is being done by the international integrated reporting council I talked about.  It's being done by the financial stability board of the bank of international ... or the BIS in Basel, which are coming out, enhanced disclosure task force, which again has got a lot of work done on the additional disclosures that banks should make of the risks they're running.  And there's now a fairly broad set of additional risk disclosures which are being developed and are being trialled with banks to see can they produce this information in an understandable and consistent manner.  And that work is going ahead very well.  I think in the future you'll see that banks will report a wider range of things, more than just the numbers.  So that looking back on the crisis you'll say, "We believe the numbers were properly prepared in accordance with the rules that were there.  The issue was: that was not enough for people to understand what was going on."  We need a wider picture, which can't all be captured in numbers.  They need to be captured in more narrative, telling the story in a broader sense.  And what ... to have that consistent so we compare Bank A with Bank B in different countries and different situations, there needs to be a fairly comprehensive set of things that banks can and can't do, and that work is ongoing at the moment.</p></speech>

Just a final question to both of you so, in your opinion, or in the firm's opinion, did the external audit fulfil its role or not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2515" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terence O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015051400002#QQQ00300"><p>We fulfilled our role in terms of the job that we were given.  In terms of the reasonable question, which has been put to me a number of times today, should we not have foreseen it coming?  Did Irish people not expect?  And that goes back to that issue.  I think that the information that's contained in accounts, people expect the accounts to tell the whole story, and there's probably more stories to be told than are ... than can be told in a set of financial numbers.  And, therefore, the financial numbers, about which the auditors are saying, "These were properly prepared in accordance with the rules," that story, as being told by the financial numbers, was not sufficient to understand what was going on.</p></speech>

It is a great pleasure to be here this afternoon.  I acknowledge the members of the diplomatic corps who are here this afternoon and who always have great engagement in the operations of the committee.</p> <p>  As the Vice Chairman correctly stated, I will brief the committee on the agenda for next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council, GAC.  I will also touch on the country-specific recommendations, which were published by the Commission yesterday.  Finally, as it is of particular interest to the committee, I will say a few words about the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p> <p>  First, I will turn to the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 19 May.  Ministers will consider two key issues: follow-up to the special European Council meeting of 23 April on migration; and initial preparations for the next meeting of the European Council, which takes place on 25-26 June.  In addition, Ministers will receive an update on a report on EMU reform, which is being prepared by the Presidents of the Commission, Euro summit, the ECB and the Eurogroup &ndash; the so-called four Presidents &ndash; and which is scheduled for presentation to the June European Council.</p> <p>  The first item on the GAC agenda is follow-up to the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in April.  As the committee will be aware, that meeting was convened in response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean, which has seen so many migrants lose their lives in tragic circumstances.  I am aware this committee held a special session on migration the following week, which was attended by the Italian ambassador, the UN Special Representative for Migration and International Development and the chief executive of the Immigrant Council of Ireland and that it is following these events closely.  Across the Union also, people have been shocked and horrified by the loss of life as migrants risk everything to reach European shores.  The immediate priority for the EU, its member states and third countries must be to better protect those in need and to save innocent lives.</p> <p>  The EU has acted swiftly since the situation began to worsen a month ago.  The first step was a special joint session of the Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils on 20 April, at which Ministers endorsed a ten-point action plan in response to the crisis.  This meeting was attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  Three days later, Heads of State and Government assembled in Brussels for a special meeting of the European Council.  At this meeting, a statement was adopted which set out commitments to try to stop human smugglers, strengthen the EU's naval presence in the Mediterranean, prevent illegal migration and reinforce solidarity and responsibility within the Union.  Shortly afterwards, the European Parliament adopted a strong resolution of its own, in which MEPs underlined the need for the Union to do more.  Clearly, there is real unity of purpose across the Union when it comes to tackling serious problems with respect to migration.  The focus now is on ensuring that the commitments set out at the European Council are backed by concrete action.  The General Affairs Council will review progress so far and look ahead to the next steps.</p> <p>  One key priority is the ramping-up of search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean, in accordance with the welcome commitment made by member states to triple the budget for naval operations run by the EU's border agency, Frontex.  Another is targeting and dismantling criminal smuggling networks that operate in and around north Africa, and which are directly responsible for so much of the misery and suffering.  There is also a pressing need, as highlighted by the European Council, to enhance our co-operation with third states.</p><p>The Commission and Latvian EU Presidency are together monitoring implementation of the commitments set out in the European Council statement and will jointly update Ministers at the General Affairs Council meeting.  The Commission yesterday also adopted an ambitious European agenda on migration and I expect this will also contribute to a discussion at the General Affairs Council.  We will need time to study this document but I am sure it will provide an important input.<br/><br/>Let me briefly draw attention also to two particular national contributions Ireland is making to the humanitarian effort.  First, the Government has agreed this week to deploy an Irish naval vessel, the <i>LE Eithne</i>, to the Mediterranean to assist the Italian authorities in humanitarian search and rescue operations.  Secondly, we have pledged additional financial assistance of &euro;2 million to support those affected by the crisis in Syria, where a large percentage of refugees and migrants originate.  This brings the Government&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis to &euro;41 million over the past four years.<br/><br/>There is no easy solution to the hardship and human suffering we are witnessing on Europe&rsquo;s southern shores.  However, with the special meeting of the European Council in April and the issue scheduled for discussion by the European Council again in June, it is clear that migration is now at the top of the Union&rsquo;s political agenda.  I can assure members that Ireland will continue to play an active and determined role in the EU response.<br/><br/>The second issue to be considered by the General Affairs Council will be preparations for the June meeting of the European Council, with a focus on the draft agenda.  At first glance, the agenda of the June European Council might seem reasonably compact with just two items - security challenges and economic issues.  However, in reality, this disguises what is likely to be one of the fullest European Council agendas for some time.<br/><br/>I turn first to the security challenges.  A key priority for Heads of State and Government will be to review implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  Previous orientations provided by the European Council in December 2013 addressed three key areas: increasing the effectiveness of CSDP; the development and provision of capabilities to support CSDP; and improving the ability of EU industry to provide those capabilities.<br/><br/>Next month&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council will review progress in implementing the December 2013 conclusions.  Good progress has been achieved on many fronts.  A maritime security strategy and action plan for its implementation was agreed in 2014, as was an EU cyber defence policy framework.  In the context of the European Defence Agency, a policy framework for long-term and systematic co-operation was approved by Ministers.  Since December 2013, four new CSDP operations have been launched: one in Ukraine, two in the Central African Republic and one in Mali.<br/><br/>The European Council is also expected to address areas where further progress is required, such as financing of EU missions and operations, development of military capabilities, and the further development of the EU&rsquo;s partnership policy with multilateral organisations, including the UN, NATO and OSCE.  It is also anticipated that High Representative<font color="#222222">,</font>Federica Mogherini, will seek approval from Heads of State and Government to begin preparing a new European security strategy.  The new strategy will assess the impact of the changing nature of the global environment on the EU, as well as threats posed by international terrorism, serious and organised crime, human trafficking and cyber security.<br/><br/>The European Council will return to address the latest developments in Ukraine and, specifically, to consider whether to extend the timeframe for existing economic sanctions against Russia.  Some of these sanctions are due to expire in July.  At the March European Council, it was agreed that the duration of the current sanctions should be clearly linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements, which is foreseen by 31 December 2015.<br/><br/>Tragic events since the start of the year have also focused the attention of the European Council on threats within the European Union&rsquo;s own borders.  The European Council will review progress on implementation of the EU&rsquo;s counter-terrorism agenda.  This includes a number of different strands, such as tackling the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters, countering terrorist content on the Internet, improving international co-operation and information sharing, including through the operation of an EU passenger name record directive, and constructive engagement with third states, notably, Turkey, which is the main gateway for foreign fighters into Syria.  As previously referenced, migration will also feature prominently in European Council discussions, with Heads of State and Government reviewing progress and considering further steps.<br/><br/>The agenda item on economic issues provides an equal diversity of topics for the European Council to consider.  Very welcome from an Irish perspective will be a focus on the digital single market, with the European Council expected to outline next steps following presentation of the Commission&rsquo;s strategy on 6 May.  The strategy sets out 16 key actions to be delivered by the end of 2016 under three key pillars: simplifying access for consumers and business, creating the right conditions for digital networks and services to flourish, and maximising the growth potential of the digital economy.  Ireland supports a high level of ambition for a fully functioning digital single market that is both open and competitive.  This would represent a win-win proposition for both consumers and SMEs, who will benefit more than multinationals in these circumstances.<br/><br/>The European Council will also be invited to endorse country-specific recommendations, CSRs,<b></b>published yesterday,<b></b>to guide member states in their structural reforms, employment policies and national budgets.  I will say a few words about Ireland&rsquo;s CSRs shortly.<br/><br/>The European Council will return to the question of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, and review progress since its most recent discussion in March.  The ninth round of negotiations took place in late April in New York with technical discussions on tariffs and procurement.  Discussions on other barriers to trade have been advancing and the basis architecture of the agreement is developing.  Both sides have affirmed their commitment to reaching an ambitious agreement as soon as possible, noting that TTIP will create jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Also under economic issues, the European Council will consider the report to be presented by the four Presidents on better economic governance in the euro area.  Member state perspectives have been shared via official-level representatives of Heads of State and Government &ndash; the Sherpa network &ndash; and Ministers will take stock of developments at next week&rsquo;s General Affairs Council.  While a limited number of member states would prefer a more ambitious report, pointing, for example, towards common institutions, an EU fiscal capacity or binding reform contracts, Ireland and many other member states have underlined the importance of first fully implementing all existing EU instruments.  This includes the existing economic governance framework, including the macroeconomic imbalances procedure and banking union. <br/><br/>Finally on the June European Council, I would flag the possibility of Prime Minister Cameron setting out his thinking on aspects of the UK relationship with the EU, including where he will wish to target reforms.  His intentions in this regard may become clearer in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>Overall, Ireland is pleased with the draft agenda for the European Council as currently presented.  It addresses many issues of strategic importance for Ireland and for the Union as a whole.  Ireland will, as always, contribute actively and constructively to the preparations for the European Council, and I look forward to my own role in this regard, both at next week&rsquo;s General Affairs Council and again at the June General Affairs Council.</p><p> The committee asked for a brief update following the publication yesterday of proposed country-specific recommendations.  The Commission is generally proposing fewer, more focused CSRs when compared to last year.  Ireland has been given four draft CSRs, covering the areas of public finances, health care reforms, work intensity of households, and sustainable mortgage and SME debt solutions.  The committee will note the continuity with issues highlighted by the Commission last year.  There were no surprises when the CSRs were published yesterday.  As I said, we were given four CSRs instead of seven.  Officials from relevant Departments are now giving careful consideration to the four draft CSRs and the underlying analysis with a view to providing a response to the Commission.  For the semester process to be effective, it is important that it be based on sound analysis and that there be a real partnership between the member states and the Commission.  The draft CSRs will be considered in the coming weeks by relevant Councils before endorsement at the June European Council.</p><p> I should add that Commissioner Moscovici will be in Dublin on 26 May and is due to meet the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, under the chairmanship of Deputy Liam Twomey, to discuss the European Semester issues.  Earlier that day, I will be joining the Commissioner at an Institute of International and European Affairs event focused on the Irish CSRs.  I am, of course, happy to hear any views the committee might have on the draft CSRs at any stage. </p><p> Before concluding, I would like to turn to the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  This issue was raised by the committee at our meeting before the March General Affairs Council, and I have since written to the Chairman on the subject.  I can confirm that the April General Affairs Council adopted conclusions expressing grave concern regarding the deteriorating situation in the country, particularly in the area of rule of law, fundamental rights and freedom of the media.  The Council also urged all sides to constructively engage to restart political dialogue and restore trust in the institutions.  I was deeply disturbed by developments in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia last weekend, which saw heavily armed militants clash with the police and army and, sadly, more than 22 people killed.  The events took place in Kumanovo, which is near the border with Kosovo and Serbia.  Commissioner Hahn made a statement in the immediate aftermath of the events, calling on &ldquo;the authorities and all political and community leaders to cooperate, to restore calm and fully investigate the events in an objective and transparent manner&rdquo;.  I fully support that call.  I can also assure the committee that the EU will continue to encourage all efforts to bring about stability in the region.</p><p> We have a busy few weeks ahead in the run-up to what is likely to be a pivotal meeting of the European Council in June.  I look forward to bringing the committee up to date on the preparations and on Irish Government perspectives when we meet again next month.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their time.</p></speech>

He can be assured that the joint committee fully supports his call on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  We do not want to see turmoil there.</p> <p>  I acknowledge his comments with regard to the possibility that the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, will set out his thinking on the EU-UK relationship.  As he knows, we have deliberated on the implications of a possible UK withdrawal from the EU, and our report will be published shortly.  A delegation from the committee will travel to Germany to discuss the possible implications for the EU of a UK withdrawal.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan has had to go to an emergency meeting of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, but he hopes to be back.  A number of members are absent because a delegation from the committee are travelling to Warsaw.  However, we have two esteemed members.</p></speech>

I thought it was apt that the Minister of State welcomed the members of the diplomatic corps.</p><p>Initially, I wish to address the humanitarian issue, but I will then deal with economic matters that have implications not only for Ireland but also for the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which I have the privilege of representing.  Migration is the major humanitarian crisis.  People who lost their homes have paid their life savings into the hands of people who, having no care for their welfare, have herded them onto ships and put them in real danger.  There has been significant loss of life.  It is good that the EU has worked on this and set out a programme to deal with the gangsters and police the area.  Obviously, it is policy to share the burden among European states.  It is a very complex and difficult matter.  I am happy that we are providing the naval vessel <i>LE Eithne</i>to help with policing as well as an additional &euro;2 million in funding.  We must play our part.  All EU countries will have to play their part, which will demand a high level of co-ordination.  Each country will be required by agreement to make an input in a structured way, instead of<i>ad hoc </i>charity, and to take a share of the migrants.  It cannot be left to Italy or Spain to deal with the problem.  Will the Minister of State inform the committee of how it is proposed to co-ordinate the efforts of individual countries so that each country will carry a burden proportionate to its size, population and resources?  No country has a greater sensitivity to this crisis than Ireland.  Any Irish person with a sense of history could only have a real empathy for these people. </p><p>I was happy to hear a reference to the forthcoming discussion on the digital economy.  This is an area of tremendous growth in Ireland both in terms of inward investment and domestic developments.  It offers great career potential and economic and social opportunities for our people.  The great weakness in our infrastructure is the lack of a universal high-speed broadband service.</p><p>There is patchiness and in areas with dispersed populations there are difficulties in this regard.  I am aware of the national broadband plan and its objectives are welcome because it is of critical importance that every home in every area of the country has high speed broadband.  It is the modern equivalent of rural electrification.  Is there anything further the Minister of State thinks can be done at European level to assist and even speed up our domestic efforts in this area as people are fed up with the delays?  How does he assess the opportunity to provide for further investment?  Large areas of my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, especially the smaller villages and dispersed rural populations, do not have access to quality broadband and, in many cases, to any broadband service at all.  That needs correction as it is an injustice.  A divide is developing in the country and, while I know it is because of topography and the lack of commercial viability, intervention is needed.  I know that an intervention is planned, but this issue is very urgent.  It is a real issue in Cavan-Monaghan.</p><p> Another issue in our area is the weakness of the euro relative to sterling, which presents a tremendous opportunity to secure Internet sales and engage in marketing in the sterling area, including Northern Ireland.  There is a tremendous business opportunity in the Border region, specifically Cavan-Monaghan which I represent.  To take advantage of it, traders need to have confidence and an awareness of the potential, but they also need broadband to support it.  Will the Minister of State comment on this opportunity for people in my area and suggest what we can do to assist?</p><p> The next issue the Minister of State addressed, which is relevant to my constituency and the country, was the TTIP negotiations.  Will he look into his crystal ball and say how he sees it panning out in the coming weeks, months and years?  Will he publicly assure me and the people I represent that Ireland will bat for the domestic agriculture industry in the context of the TTIP?  Cavan-Monaghan is unique in having a huge dependence on primary production, with farmers, agribusiness and food processing.  Agrifood related jobs account for the vast bulk of all jobs in the area; therefore, anything that threatens agriculture will devastate the economy of the region.</p><p> The Chairman spoke about the possible exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  Personally I do not believe it will happen but that rationality will prevail and people's business and economic sense will tell them the importance of inward investment and the potential of the markets within the European Union.  The debate the United Kingdom will hold on the subject will change minds in favour of jobs and livelihoods and I believe sanity will prevail.  Nevertheless, we have to address the risks involved.  My concern is from a national perspective, but the implications of a British withdrawal would be aggravated in Cavan-Monaghan and right along the Border because of the prospect of customs control, the need for passports and the impact on businesses.  Will the Minister of State give us an assurance that Ireland will maintain a strong watching brief and that we will engage in bilateral initiatives with the Commission and the UK Government to protect Irish interests?  We need to try to prevent the breakaway, but in the event that we fail to do so, we need to have a contingency plan to protect Irish interests, which means the Irish economy and especially the economy of the Border region.  It would be remiss of a representative of a Border constituency to attend this meeting and not to emphasise the devastating impact if people such as the Minister of State did not make the necessary interventions to prevent the worst effects of a British withdrawal from the European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015051400002#E00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials and wish him well in his deliberations in Brussels.  I also welcome members of the diplomatic corps and their representatives.  It is an opportunity for all of us, as members of the European Union, to exchange thoughts.  It is a pity that they cannot participate in the meeting, but we will meet at their various receptions and I appreciate their regular invitations to meet their ambassador and officials.</p><p>Deputy Joe O'Reilly is the leader of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe.  He does significant work and has been very involved in dealing with the tragedy of what is happening in the Middle East.  It was precipitated by the actions of the Bush-Blair amalgamation in Iraq and elsewhere, for which a price is now being paid.</p><p><i>RMS</i><i>Lusitania</i>went down 100 years ago with 1,190 people on board, while <i>Titanic</i>went down more than 100 years ago.  Both were human tragedies which it is right to remember, but some weeks ago 1,500 people went down off the coast of Italy and I do not read much about that tragedy in any newspaper now.  That shows the level of concern and the lack of acceptance of responsibility in the West, a point Mr. Peter Sutherland made very well when he spoke at a recent meeting of the joint committee.  No country suffered more than Ireland, with its 1 million emigrants, in the coffin ships which got into trouble off the coasts of Canada, America and Britain, all of whom helped us at the time.  It was right that Britain helped us because it had responsibility for the Irish Famine, but we will not go into that issue today as we have to try to forgive and forget.  We might forgive, but we will not forget.</p><p>On the negotiations with the United States of America, will the Minister of State outline the implications for the TTIP negotiations of the Senate voting against the trade Bill on Tuesday last?  I am not sure exactly how serious it is because the Bill has not been completed.  A deal with the United States of America should not be pursued at any cost and there should be no cost to the Irish economy, especially in the case of the agriculture sector.  We cannot allow hormone-fed beef into the Republic of Ireland at any cost to compete with our grass-fed, high-quality and often organic beef which we are exporting to the United States of America.  That has to be the bottom line for this country and we must veto any agreement which would affect our fundamental and basic industry.  During the difficulties faced by the building industry the economy was sustained by farming and agriculture.  That is a fact.</p><p>On the possible departure of Britain from the European Union, people should read Mr. Dan O'Brien's article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent.</i></p><p>He made interesting points in his article when he stated:</p><blockquote>The only upside to a British departure is that Ireland will become a relatively more attractive place for businesses seeking guarantees and unfettered access to the EU single market, still the biggest market in the world.  That is because there is a very considerable uncertainty over the kind of economic relationship Britain would have with the EU as a non-member.  Many members already ask why they should give one country all the benefits of membership (ie full access to the single market) without having the costs of playing by the rules.</blockquote><p>I agree with Deputy O'Reilly on the chances of Britain leaving the Union but in our negotiations as one of the 27 members it cannot be that Britain will not stay in the Union at any price.  If it is Britain's wish to leave the Union it must not be at any price to this country as far as the negotiations are concerned.  Members of this committee have been over to the UK.  With 56 Scottish MPs having been elected, if Britain decides to defect from the Union, Scotland will follow with independence.  As sure as night follows day, there is no doubt about that.  We may find the repercussions of what Britain does will result not long after that in the break-up of the United Kingdom for once and for all with perhaps our having a United Ireland because the Six Counties would be unviable in that situation.  All I know from my experience of working with those in Britain is that all we can do is congratulate the Prime Minister on his reappointment as Prime Minister.  Fair play to him.  It was a democratic election and he won fair and square.  UKIP is out of the picture.  He had to put certain ideas forward to win back votes and he was successful.  He will honour his commitment to have a referendum.  I think he will recommend that Britain stays in the Union.<br/><br/>While Britain has a friend in Ireland and we want it to stay in the Union, the Minister of State in his discussions and negotiations with the British Government must point out that it cannot be at any price or at a cost to the Republic of Ireland.  If Britain departs from the Union, we will have to play hardball with regard to the EU in terms of any repercussions that would have for this country.  We will be entering those negotiations not as a harmless or fearful player but as a determined one.  We will support and help Britain but, as a former Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I emphasise that we cannot do it at any cost to this country.</p></speech>

On the country-specific recommendations, I welcome the fact that they have been reduced from seven to four.  Will he agree that the specific recommendations are areas on which the Government is already working?  As he said, there are no great surprises in this respect as these are issues on which the Government has been focusing.  What opportunities does the Minister of State envisage there will be for Ireland if a digital single market is created?</p> <p>  I appreciate that the migration issue was discussed previously and that it will be discussed again at an EU Council meeting.  What is the Minister of State's view of the quota proposal?  I am sure he would have seen the letter from the committee to An Taoiseach a few weeks ago following our meeting with various guests, including the Italian ambassador, who gave an update on the situation, including in his home country.</p> <p>  On the UK situation, is there a firm indication that the Prime Minister will lay out his stall on the occasion of the next European Council meeting?  From talking to his counterparts across Europe, what is his view on what could possibly be agreed to in treaty negotiations in terms of changes with respect to some of the opt-out provisions from clauses about which  the UK has concerns?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015051400002#F00300"><p>Detailed questions covering a number of areas have been raised.  I will start by responding to the measures taken to deal with the migration and the humanitarian crisis.  We would all acknowledge the loss of life in this crisis and Senator Leyden contrasted such loss to the centenary commemoration of the loss of life on the <i>Lusitania</i>in Cork last week, and we had the recent centenary commemorations of the loss of life on the <i>Titanic</i>.  A clear comparison can be made between those events.  Given the different circumstances of those two tragic events so long ago, the reality with respect to the events in the Mediterranean is that the European Union has a very important role to play to work towards reducing, to the absolute minimum, the number of people who will find themselves in circumstances where their lives are at great peril or ultimately lost.  Several factors feed into that.  At the most basic, there is a requirement to assist states that have arrived at a point, through conflict, bad governance or a broad range of issues, some economic and some religious, that have allowed people be of the view that while there is a risk to their lives in migrating, there is a greater risk to their lives in not migrating.  This involves not only the European Union but countries of the developed world and the developing world working together.  We have had meetings recently of the joint Council, involving justice and home affairs and foreign affairs Ministers, which was followed up by discussions at the General Affairs Council the following day, which I attended, and at the European Council meeting two days later.</p><p>This item is at the top of Europe's agenda.  Deputy O'Reilly requested that there would be a co-ordinated approach to dealing with this issue, and this is happening.  An Irish naval vessel will be deployed hopefully on Saturday.  We have contributed significant moneys and, as the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, said last evening, we will be taking in an additional 300 refugees.  There are different elements to and objectives within the proposal that has been made with respect to the next few months but members can be assured that Ireland, and the other member states, will continue to work to achieve some respite to the crisis.  As I said, a ten-point plan was agreed on 20 April and it will be discussed again in great detail next week.</p><p>I am taking the points raised in order and am moving from the serious humanitarian crisis just discussed to the question the Vice Chairman raised about the digital single market and the potential opportunities it will present for Ireland.  As he will be aware, significant moneys are being committed under the national broadband strategy.  The digital single market has three key areas.  To answer the Vice Chairman's question directly, the reason we can benefit from this single market is that we have 29 of the top 30 digital companies based in Ireland.  I wear another hat as the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection.  If one goes through a list of these companies, one will find they are nearly all large American companies.  That reminds us that in the broader digital economy, Europe has not managed to produce or to be significantly innovative.  The development of the digital single market along with the services single market presents an opportunity for Europe to regain the competitive advantage it has lost and continues to lose.  The digital single market strategy targets include simplifying access for consumers and businesses such as through harmonised consumer and contract rules, more efficient and affordable parcel delivery, tackling geo-blocking of digital services, further copyright modernisations and simplifying VAT rules.  Another target of the strategy is shaping the environment for digital networks and services to flourish such as reviewing telecoms and media rules to encourage investment in next generation infrastructure, management of the wireless spectrum and reviewing the role of online platforms such as illegal content and a review of e-privacy issues and, finally, maximising the growth of potential of the digital economy.</p><p>That includes having the right regulatory standards for big data and cloud computing and ensuring interoperability of e-services for the consumer, including through e-government and e-health services and also strengthening digital skills.  There is huge potential for every European country but Ireland perhaps is better placed than most in that regard.</p><p> I will briefly come to another area, namely, the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  The vote on Tuesday night should send the positive result we in Ireland would like to see, and  I believe they will be voting again today.  President Obama has personally engaged with this issue.  When the Taoiseach visited Washington on St. Patrick's Day it was at the top of the agenda and they discussed the issue in great detail.  We are absolutely resolute with respect to the protection of our agricultural industry.</p></speech>

We must all take every opportunity to point out when we talk about the dangers of lower standards being associated with TTIP that in no way is it going to be or allowed to be a vehicle for lower standards to be introduced in either direction.  In fact, TTIP gives the opportunity for the European Union and the United States of America, collectively, to set the bar and establish worldwide standards across food and other sectors.  This opportunity must be grasped.  In the beef sector we do have concerns and they are being addressed at the very highest level.  On the broader issue, TTIP is potentially of more benefit to Ireland than many other countries but all countries can benefit.  Given the GDP growth of somewhere between 1% and 2% for both jurisdictions, and given how hard we have struggled over the past five years plus to have any growth in GDP in the European Union, we should look very carefully at the potential of TTIP, in particular bearing in mind that the European Single Market itself was such a benefit.</p></speech>

If Britain decides to opt out of the European Union, this deal dies as far as Britain is concerned.  It would have to negotiate a separate deal with the United States of America.  If it is out of the 28 then it would not benefit from the TTIP negotiations that are currently ongoing.  That is an interesting point.</p></speech>

I have not forgotten that all members asked about the United Kingdom.  I might come to that next.  Up to last week we had two questions.  First, who would govern in the United Kingdom and how the election would evolve.  We now know that.  I congratulate David Cameron on the achievement of his re-election as Prime Minister.  We were all interested in watching events evolve, but that was a matter for the people of the UK.  The second question is what is the position of the United Kingdom.  Members asked specifically about our engagement.  The Taoiseach will have a bilateral meeting in the coming weeks with David Cameron.  I do not have the exact date.  I compliment the committee on the work it has already done in meeting with a broad variety of groups in the United Kingdom.  We had a discussion on the matter raised by Senator Leyden.  We also had a very interesting debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in recent weeks.</p></speech>

What we are aware of is that in some initial commentary that has come from the United Kingdom, we share their concerns on many areas.  In terms of ease of business, regulation and growth, in the past 12 months we have seen significant progress, in particular through quantitative easing, the Juncker package of &euro;320 billion, and especially the commentary from First Vice President, Frans Timmermans, on the need for Europe to have regulations that work for citizens and businesses alike.  We will be very engaged.</p> <p>  Members will be aware that the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments, including the Department of Finance, are looking at the potential effects of various outcomes that may emerge from this process from the point of view of the United Kingdom.  We are very clear that we want the European Union to stay united as 28 member states, which obviously includes the UK.  It will however be a matter for the people of the United Kingdom to decide themselves in the referendum which will now take place at some time in the future.  Ireland will of course ensure in any steps that are taken that our national interest will be to the forefront of our deliberations, as it always is in all respects and negotiations.  We are still very much waiting to see what the proposals are.  The matter raised in the specific question on the June European Council is not on the agenda but I am aware that David Cameron will have a number of bilateral meetings with the Presidents of the Commission and the Council, and other Prime Ministers, including the Taoiseach in the coming months.  We look forward to seeing what-----</p></speech>

I am certain that the UK and its relationship with Europe will be mentioned again at this committee in the future.  We will wait and see what happens.</p> <p>  It is very important for Ireland that the Government continues to focus on this country and what we can achieve for ourselves within the European Union in terms of continuing to create jobs and employment.  To an extent, currently, this issue is a matter on which we are bystanders but at every opportunity I will make the point to my colleagues in the United Kingdom that countries in Europe, collectively, including the UK have done very well as members of the European Union.  We have had a very safe and secure Continent, when one considers what went on in previous generations.  There are many areas where we can champion what at times is an imperfect European Union but the benefits vastly outweigh the so-called disadvantages some may perceive.</p></speech>

We also welcome the fact that the Commission seems to have had a far more concise approach generally to the recommendations.  Your analysis, Vice Chairman, is accurate.  We did not foresee any surprises.  There are no surprises in our recommendations and they relate to the four areas of which we are already fully aware.  The fact sometimes gets lost in some of the narrative about the country-specific recommendations and their purpose, that they sometimes restate what a Government already knows.  It is not designed to be unhelpful, it is a simple statement of fact.  We have had a very difficult number of years economically and therefore in the area of health care, in particular in jobless households, we are aware that while we have reduced unemployment from 15.1% to below 10% currently, there are too many households where we need to assist people.  We must continue to foster an environment where jobs can be created.</p><p>The broad thrust of the CSRs, in Ireland's case, reflects the fact that this economy is being well run and is performing well.  It is certainly my intention, as a Minister of State, to ensure we continue to do that.  We will be working towards addressing all the country-specific recommendations which, ultimately, are to the benefit of our citizens.</p></speech>

It is reassuring to know that all countries will be working to ensure that the issues of migration and the tragedies that have occurred in recent months are to the fore at EU Council level.  We welcome the reassurance in respect of Senator Terry Leyden's question on agriculture, which is hugely important to this country, and that it must be to the fore in terms of TTIP.  I expect this issue of whether the UK will exit the European Union will be debated for a number of years.  That issue will be to the fore of this committee's concerns and deliberations, and rightly so.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015051400002#B00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and members of the committee for the invitation to attend.  I am joined by Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer, Ms Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary in my Department, Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, director general of the HSE, and members of his leadership team.  Members will recall that at the start of the year, the Minister of State and I set out our work programme for 2015.  It contained 25 actions under five major themes.  I will touch on each of them briefly and record some of the progress being made.</p> <p>  The first theme is Healthy Ireland.  We need to improve our health as individuals and as a nation.  This is the best way to ensure we live long and healthy lives and the most effective way to prevent illness and reduce health costs in the long term.</p><p>The legislation brought forward by the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, on plain packaging on tobacco was signed into law by the President on 10 March and my Department is currently drafting regulations on the prescribed aspects of the Act.  It is, as members know, subject to legal challenge.  </p><p> The general scheme of the public health (alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on 10 February.  I intend to publish it before the summer recess.  As it has already been subject of a dedicated committee meeting, I will not say any more on it today.  Provisions under the Public Health (Sunbeds) Act 2014 requiring health information, warning signs, prohibitions on certain marketing practices, health claims, notification requirements, fee and fixed penalty notices were commenced in February and March.  This will discourage younger people in particular from using sunbeds, while imposing stricter regulation on providers.  It will reduce skin cancer prevalence and save lives.</p><p> Recent statistics reveal that 61% of Irish adults and one in four primary school children are now overweight or obese.  My Department held a major stakeholder consultation at the end of April on what we need to do collectively to address the challenge of overweight and obesity.  The consultation brought together key stakeholders to prioritise the actions which Government and other sectors need to take over the next ten years to tackle overweight and obesity.  A new obesity policy and action plan will be finalised this year and brought to Government for approval.  While some comments and reports on the matter in recent weeks were sensationalised and not evidence-based, which serves no good, it is a real personal and public health issue and needs to be taken as seriously in the future as tobacco in the recent past and alcohol now.  </p><p> The second theme is patient outcomes and patient safety.  As members know, I have taken a personal interest in emergency department overcrowding.  Overcrowding in our hospitals has eased since January and is trending downwards.  Progress is being made but it still remains higher than at this point last year.  Similarly, the number of delayed discharges has fallen from a peak of 850, but remains at about 680.  At the beginning of April the Government approved additional funds of &euro;74 million to reduce delayed discharges by providing &euro;44 million to the fair deal scheme resulting in an additional 1,600 places, and &euro;30 million to provide an extra 250 convalescent and rehabilitation beds in community and district hospitals.  The implementation of these measures has now begun but will take about eight weeks to fully implement.</p><p> As of 30 April there were 575 people on the fair deal waiting list with an average wait time of four weeks from the date of approval, down from 11 weeks at the start of the year.  More than half of the additional community and district hospital beds are now open.  The emergency department task force report needs to be fully implemented and I will personally drive this.  There will always be surges in demand, and all health services have patients on trolleys from time to time, but trolley waits of nine, 12 and 24 hours represent a real patient safety risk and need to be reduced considerably.  I have mandated the HSE to ensure than nobody is waiting more than 18 months for a surgical procedure or outpatient appointment by July, and no more than 15 months by the end of the year.  I know that may not seem very ambitious, and it is not, but within current resources it is realistic and achievable in all but a small number of sub-specialties.  While the numbers on waiting lists are likely to continue to rise as demand rises, I want to make sure that those who are waiting are not waiting as long.  </p><p> On patient safety, we are continuing to develop and monitor the implementation of the national clinical effectiveness guidelines, of which there are six to date with a further two currently in development, namely, the national paediatric early warning system and the clinical handover for acute services, and we are continuing to develop better implementation of HIQA recommendations.  The HSE's joint open disclosure policy with the State Claims Agency is now being used in 47 acute hospitals and five PCCC areas, up from 15 hospitals and one PCCC area in 2013.</p><p> The third theme is universal health.  Agreement was reached with the IMO in April on GP care without fees for the under-sixes and over-70s and on the introduction of an asthma cycle of care for children and a diabetes cycle of care for medical card or GP visit card holders who have type 2 diabetes.  This represents the first step in the phased introduction of a universal GP service and will benefit over 300,000 senior citizens and children this summer.  On universal health insurance, I firmly believe that we need to make health insurance more affordable before we can make it universal.  At the end of 2014 I announced a number of actions to achieve this.  These include a reduction in risk equalisation stamp duty, a reduction in the HIA levy, no further diminution of tax relief, discounts for young adults and, last month, the introduction of lifetime community rating.  As a result some premiums have been reduced, others frozen and new affordable products are on offer.  The number of people with health insurance is rising again and initial indications suggest that a very large number of people signed up in the past few weeks to beat the LCR deadline.  I have learned this morning, in fact, that 74,000 additional people signed up in the past few weeks and the figure for the year so far is 80,000.</p><p> The fourth theme is reform, including greater investment in IT, which saw a 30% increase in budget this year to &euro;55 million in capital.  Key IT projects include e-referral, so that GPs can make referrals to hospitals online; electronic patient records, a move from paper to electronic records which we hope will be fully in place by the end of the decade, so that the moment a person gets into the back of an ambulance a paramedic can access their medical records on an i-Pad; and the issuing of the first individual health identifiers later this year - a sort of PPS number for health.  I would encourage the committee to invite Mr. Richard Corbridge, chief information officer for the HSE, to come in to brief you on these very exciting plans.</p><p> The fifth theme is investment in modern infrastructure and facilities.  The most important of these is the new children's hospital, the biggest single health infrastructure project ever in the history of the State.  The planning application for the hospital will be lodged this summer and, subject to An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision, we could have planning permission by Christmas or early in the new year with construction commencing soon after.  I visited Great Ormond Street Hospital in London this week and I can assure the committee that the new children's hospital we have planned will be more modern and have more beds and operating theatres than any children's hospital in the United Kingdom.</p><p> On the overall financial position of the health service, the latest figures from the HSE demonstrate the significant challenge facing us as a result of the changing demographics in Ireland.  Over the next few years, the population aged 65 and over will increase by approximately 20,000 per year, placing increased pressure on our acute hospital, community, and social care sectors.  We will continue to work to develop safe quality services for patients, while at the same time looking for ways to reduce costs.  While it is difficult at this stage to draw conclusions as to the year-end position based on data from January and February, due to a number of factors including the exceptionally high level of delayed discharges during these two months, the new measures recommended by the ED task force and agreed by Government, along with the ongoing reform of practices and processes in hospitals, are beginning to show results.  Current expenditure projections are preliminary in nature, and my Department and the HSE are working together to understand the deficit to date and the likely full year impact of this variance and emerging and known funding pressures.  The HSE is moving to reduce overspending and is working closely with the Department to mitigate the projected deficit to the greatest degree possible.  Mr. Tony O'Brien will speak on this further if members wish.</p><p> I want to turn now to maternity services and, in particular, to the recently published HIQA report on Portlaoise hospital.  Many aspects of the HIQA report disturb me, as I am sure they do committee members.  I am ashamed at the manner in which patients were treated without respect, care and compassion when they most needed it by members of my own profession and other professions.  Many did not receive the quality of care we should expect from a modern health service in the developed world.  Patients and their families were treated dreadfully and at times inhumanely.  As I have said previously, it is not all about resources and we should challenge those who seek to make resources the excuse for all failings.  If we allow it to be an excuse it will always be the default excuse.  That in itself is a threat to patient safety.  It costs nothing to care.  Honesty costs nothing - and in fact it probably saves money - and neither does compassion.  Adherence to professional standards and being properly trained and accredited to do one's job should be a given.  Too often, it is not.</p><p> The report highlights the urgent need to embed a patient safety culture right throughout the health service.  I intend that this should not just be another report.  It should be a watershed report.  Patient safety, outcomes and quality must never come second to institutional, corporate, staff or local political interests.  Decisions made on resource allocation and service location must be made on the basis of what is best for patients in terms of safety or outcomes, not financial savings or votes.  Having met some former patients and there families last night, I am more convinced than ever that a patient advocacy service should be established and it will be fully independent of the Health Service Executive.</p><p> All mistakes are not medical negligence and mistakes and misjudgments will always happen - that is the nature of medicine.  All complaints will not be valid or upheld.  But we need to move to a new culture when complaints are welcomed and seen as a tool to guide us in improving services and patient satisfaction.  Too often and for too long the health service has been defensive in dealing with complaints and fails to deal with them in a timely manner and therefore adds insult to injury and hurt on hurt.  An independent patient advocacy service will be crucial in supporting patients and changing that culture.  I accept the HIQA report in full and thank the investigation team for its work.  The four recommendations made to my Department will be implemented.  The HSE has confirmed that it too will implement the four recommendations made to it.  I expect the HSE to implement an action plan to address the findings of the report without delay, and certainly by the end of the year.  </p><p> Improvements have been, and will continue to be made at Portlaoise hospital, which I had the opportunity to visit yesterday.  New management and governance structures, both clinical and operational, are in place, including a new hospital manager and a director of midwifery for the first time, as well as an on-site risk manager.</p><p>Appointments have been made to key posts of concern in both the maternity and general services.  This includes additional consultants in anaesthetics, surgery, emergency medicine, paediatrics and obstetrics.  Sixteen additional midwives have been appointed and approval has been given for further midwifery posts to include shift leaders and posts in diabetics and ultra-sonography.  An ambulance by-pass protocol is in place for serious paediatric and trauma cases.  For the record, it is important to point out that since the Government came to office the number of midwives employed in the public health service has increased from 1,100 to 1,400 and the number of consultant obstetricians is at an all-time high.  It is certainly nowhere near where it needs to be and it is not up to international standards but it does show that during a period of cutbacks the Government did prioritise front-line services in particular in this area.</p><p> Structural change has begun, with Portlaoise hospital now forming part of the Dublin-Midlands hospital group.  Governance of the maternity service will transfer to the Coombe in line with a memorandum of understanding agreed already.  At the end of April, I appointed a steering group chaired by Ms Sylda Langford, former director general of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to prepare a new maternity strategy for Ireland.  In doing so, I am implementing one of the recommendations of the HIQA report into the care of Ms Savita Halappanavar.</p><p> The new maternity strategy will put the needs of mothers, babies and their families at its centre.  The focus will be on maximising patient safety, quality of care, and clinical outcomes as well as the desirability of greater patient choice, the move towards more services in the community, and a renewed focus on prevention and well-being.  I have asked the group to report to me by the end of the year.  As committee members are aware, ten years ago cancer care in Ireland was below standard and fragmented, and we did not collect data properly.  Today, it is well organised and survival rates are improving all the time.  I want to adopt the same programmatic approach that was adopted to cancer to women's and infant health in the next decade.</p><p> There are a number of other initiatives and developments on which I would be happy to update the committee but I know my time is limited and committee members will also want to hear from the director general and to ask questions, so I will conclude at this point.  I will be happy to respond to queries that arise.</p></speech>

I am joined by a number of my colleagues: Ms Laverne McGuinness, deputy director general, Mr. Liam Woods, national director of the acute hospital division, Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, national director of clinical strategy and programmes, Mr. Pat Healy, national director of the social care division, and Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, national director of the mental health division.</p> <p>  The committee requested information and replies on a number of specific issues prior to this meeting and members will have received a written response to each of them.  In my opening remarks I would like to update the committee on a number of issues.  The first relates to the HIQA report concerning the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, MRHP.</p> <p>  The HSE on Friday last received the final report of the investigation into the quality, safety and standards of services provided by the HSE to patients at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The HSE welcomes the conclusion of the HIQA investigation, accepts all of the recommendations of this report and acknowledges that their implementation will contribute to improving the quality and standard of services delivered in Portlaoise hospital and similar hospitals.  The HSE has already taken objective steps to improve the quality and safety of services in Portlaoise over the past two years.  These important steps are included within many of the HIQA recommendations.  As a consequence of the measures taken, the HSE is confident that MRHP provides a safe level of service to its patients in the midlands today, although there are undoubtedly questions of sustainability to be addressed.</p> <p>  The HSE has already acknowledged that there have been failings at Portlaoise over the years.  The HSE has in the past apologised for these failures and the suffering and distress that they caused to the families concerned, and I reiterate that apology once again today.  Last year in the context of some of the very distressing reports, I wrote to every health service staff member about this and that letter is appended to the printed version of my statement.</p> <p>  The hospital in Portlaoise provides extremely important services to the midland counties and is a very busy hospital today.  For example, it is expected that there will be approximately 1,900 births in its maternity unit this year.  I am also very conscious of the potential of negative publicity surrounding this report to undermine the confidence of some of the patients who use the hospital's services.  Any negative publicity is also likely to impact on the hard working and dedicated staff who have been putting their hearts and souls into their work in the hospital in very trying circumstances, where demand for services is increasing and resources continue to remain limited.  I wish to emphasise that any failings relating to the past either have now been or are being rectified and that Portlaoise hospital is now on a path to being an excellent hospital as part of a wider group.  Significant improvements have been, and continue to be, implemented in both maternity and general services at the hospital, which is overseen by a joint steering group comprised of representatives from Portlaoise and other hospitals in the Dublin-Midlands hospital group, including the recently appointed chief executive officer of the group, Dr. Susan O'Reilly.</p> <p>  An important improvement is the introduction of an expanded and new management and governance structure, both clinical and operational, for the maternity unit and the general hospital.  This new structure allows for strengthened management at local level and clearer reporting relationships within the Dublin-Midlands hospital group.  Central to these new arrangements is the formalisation of existing pathways between the maternity unit and the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.  In this regard a clinical director for integration has been appointed.  Furthermore, existing relationships between Portlaoise and Tullamore, Tallaght, Naas and St. James's hospitals are being further developed and strengthened particularly in the areas of emergency medicine, ICU, surgery and bed capacity.</p> <p>  An area of concern, raised in a number of reports over the recent past, has been in relation to staffing levels.  The staffing moratorium across the public service over the past five years has impeded a full resolution of this situation up to recent times, as a consequence of a much reduced health budget arising from the financial emergency.  A considerable number of staff have been, and continue to be, appointed to key posts of concern in both the maternity and general services.  This includes a number of additional consultant posts in anaesthetics, surgery, emergency medicine, paediatrics, obstetrics, and physician posts.  In relation to midwifery posts, 16 additional midwives have been appointed and are in place.  Approval has been given for further midwifery posts to include shift leaders in delivery, and posts in diabetics and ultra-sonography.  Additional general nursing posts are also in progress.  A full review has been conducted of the structures and processes of quality, safety and risk in both the maternity unit and the general hospital.  Following this review a significant number of improvements have taken place.</p> <p>  The appointment of quality and patient safety, QPS, managers for both the maternity unit and the general hospital will considerably strengthen the QPS function.  The management of complaints has also been examined and improved.  Following the national patient safety culture survey, conducted by the quality improvement division of the HSE in 2013 and 2014, a report of the results from the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise has been produced and disseminated to all relevant parties.  Among the many other improvements in Portlaoise hospital, patients, following triage in the emergency department, are now under the care and accountability of a named consultant at all times.  Portlaoise hospital has also fully implemented the national open disclosure policy, the national consent policy and national bereavement care guidelines.</p> <p>  Additionally, the maternity unit has implemented the national early warning score, NEWS, and the Irish maternity early warning score, IMEWS.  Furthermore, all midwifery staff in the maternity unit have received training in cardiotocograph, CTG, and additional online training facilities have been introduced.  In light of this report I have taken the decision to bring in an external investigator in accordance with our disciplinary procedure to look at issues of concern.  Many issues were escalated but they did not always find their way to the right decision making levels and that must be investigated in accordance with fair procedures  Many of the issues which arise in Portlaoise hospital are not just about resources or the quality of clinical care but about the human and compassionate care that was or was not provided.  Accordingly, a separate examination will examine this matter.  The names of the investigators and terms of reference will be published shortly.</p> <p>  It is important, starting in the maternity unit in Portlaoise hospital and the wider hospital and other maternity hospitals, that we have a thorough programme of empowering nursing and midwifery leadership and interdisciplinary leaders to drive compassion in care.  Following the lead of the NHS in England and Scotland, respectively, we intend to implement the Florence Nightingale Foundation&rsquo;s leading for compassion programme and the caring behaviours assurance system, CBAS, programme throughout the health service.</p> <p>  Turning to the national service plan, members are aware that each month performance against our national service plan targets and deliverables is monitored and measured.  The latest published performance report shows that in February 2015 there were 185,688 emergency attendances for the first two months of the year.  While the average daily attendance is up 5%, or 177 per day on January, the overall attendances are 2.1% less than the same period for 2014.  The number of delayed discharges has fallen from a peak of 850 on 4 January to 705 at the end of February.  Additional funding of &euro;74 million, provided by the Government, has assisted in alleviating pressures in acute hospitals by providing additional nursing home placements.</p><p>The two most recent delayed discharge reports of 28 April and 5 May 2015 recorded fewer than 700 delayed discharges for the first time since September 2014 and the trajectory is now downwards.</p><p> The national plan prioritises a reduction in waiting times for hospital care with a focus on those waiting the longest so that nobody will wait longer than 18 months at the end of June or 15 months by year end.  In February, 98% of adults were seen within this timeframe for an inpatient or day case procedure and 82% of patient were waiting less than 52 weeks for an outpatient appointment.  Plans are being finalised to ensure the June target of no patient waiting longer than 18 months is achieved.</p><p> With regard to emergency ambulances, the percentage calls responded to within eight minutes and 59 seconds by ECHO reached 78% and by DELTA reached 65% during the month.  A total of 82% of referrals accepted by child and adolescent mental health teams were offered a first appointment within 12 weeks against a target of 78%.  A total of 13,407 people were in receipt of a home care package during February, which is 10.5% more than the same time last year.  In mental health services, difficulty in filling staff vacancies remains a significant challenge to providing timely and appropriate care.  A number of recruitment campaigns are under way to address this.</p><p> In primary care, work is progressing on improving access to primary services through the extension of GP care free at the point of delivery to all children under six and all adults over 70.  Contracts have now been issued to GPs for signing following agreement with the IMO on the details, and public registrations are due to commence from June 2015.  This service enhancement due to commence from July will provide GP access, wellness health checks and asthma care for children, and care for patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care in accordance with the models of best practice for the management of chronic medical conditions.</p><p> The investigation into &Aacute;ras Attracta and the disciplinary procedure is progressing on schedule, having received clearance from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to recommence its work.  The aim is to have the investigation work completed by the end of May or early June, with findings and a final report completed by the end of July.  Dr. Kevin McCoy's assurance review is progressing well, having met residents, family members, staff and management.  In addition to recommending specific plans for each centre in &Aacute;ras Attracta, the output from the review team will help to inform our system-wide programme of improvement.  A new governance structure is being implemented, with a new director of service post advertised.  Under the leadership of the new director, three discrete centres will operate in the campus, each centre specialising on the particular needs of service users.  A residents' council is being established as part of the national volunteer advocacy programme.</p><p> The new policy &ldquo;Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse&rdquo; is being fully implemented with nine safeguarding and protection teams being established, one per community health care organisation.  The recruitment of 20 additional social work posts has commenced.  The quality improvement enablement teams are in place and are focused on supporting our centres, in transferring HIQA standards into good practice in front-line services.  The initial phase has prioritised HSE residential centres, with the team visiting more than 50 centres delivering services to 448 people, representing almost 25% of HSE residential services.  In addition, a confidential recipient, Leigh Gath, has been appointed, who is independent in her functions with the authority to examine concerns and to hear of issues and complaints in a totally confidential manner.</p><p> There have been recent media reports on the accessibility of mental health services for children and adolescents.  The HSE is committed to ensuring that all aspects of child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion regardless of where in the country the service is accessed .  A number of measures have been put in place to improve access to and quality of these specialist services.  These include a CAMHS service improvement project established to review and improve, where necessary, performance relating to both inpatient and community CAMHS.</p><p> I am also pleased to advise the committee that seven new suicide prevention officers have been recruited and they will take up duty shortly.  It is also anticipated that additional suicide prevention resource officers will be recruited later this year through the 2015 mental health development funding.</p><p> Despite the progress being made in our mental health services I am particularly concerned at the significant challenges posed by the recruitment of nursing and medical grades, which are now impacting on service delivery.  The mental health division is working closely with HR and the national recruitment service to progress overseas recruitment initiatives to address this issue.</p><p> Primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, commonly known as coronary angioplasty or simply angioplasty, is a non-surgical procedure used to treat the stenotic, or narrowed, coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease.  In November, the acute hospitals division of the HSE requested the national clinical programme for acute coronary syndrome, ACS, programme to review the current configuration of PPCI services in Dublin, having regard to the requirement to deliver safe, sustainable services on the designated sites.  The model of care produced by the ACS programme was informed by advice from the principals involved in centres in the UK and other European countries.  The programme was also informed by models of care from the United States and Australia.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24-7 requirements of this service.</p><p> Based on this comprehensive review, the HSE took the decision to consolidate the service in Dublin into two centres, which reflects the international trend towards the consolidation of such specialised services on a smaller number of sites to allow for the concentration of volume and expertise.  Since 17 April there are two 24-7 PPCI centres for Dublin, located in the Mater hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  These centres now accept all ambulance transfers of Dublin patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI.</p><p> In the wider context of percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI services, a review of these services is under way and will be completed shortly.  Once complete, PCI capacity nationally, including Waterford, will be examined.  This review will look at the further provision of PCI services nationally in the best interest of patients and on evidence on the volume of clinical need, the quality and safety of the service that can be provided, the ability to staff it safely and the resources available.</p><p> This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues we will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

We accept we will have a meeting next week with the HSE to discuss the findings of the Portlaoise report, but it is important while the Minister and the director general of the HSE are before us to raise some points which are of huge concern about the report and any interpretation to be put on it.</p> <p>  Why we have the report in the first place makes for very sad and debilitating reading.  When we see the testimony and listen to the families involved, the huge resistance put up by the HSE to engaging with them even on finding out basic and general information and trying to elicit the truth seems to be the culture and normal practice.  To speak about freedom of information in general, this is extending throughout many Departments.  I will make the political point that it is getting more and more difficult for citizens, be they Members of the Opposition or anybody else, to get information from the State.  We must be very honest.  We speak about open disclosure in the context of medicine and clinical decisions, but there must be open disclosure across the full remit of the State.  In this context the HSE has much to do.</p> <p>  The service priorities for the 2015 service plan include improved quality and patient safety, with a focus on service user experience, the development of a culture of learning and improvement, patient, service users and staff engagement, medication management, health care associated infections, serious incidents and reportable offence, complaints and compliments, implementing quality patient safety and an enablement programme.  We can only hope that on foot of the report into Portlaoise and its recommendations that we will act upon the opening statement of the HSE's service plan.</p> <p>  I read the letter Mr. O'Brien sent to all members of staff of the HSE after the "Prime Time" report.  It calls for people to engage with patients, more openness and asking the staff in general to make the best efforts possible.  It mentions an apparently unfeeling bureaucracy and excessive defensiveness in a way which appears only to serve self-interest.  Much of this is explained.  It was important to send the letter to the staff after the "Prime Time" report.</p><p>However, when I read the report it appears that even the person signed the letter on behalf of the HSE, Mr. O'Brien, did not even act on the recommendations of the CMO.<br/><br/>The HIQA report stated:</p><blockquote>In his report, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer said two previous HSE reviews published in 2008 into breast cancer misdiagnosis cases at Portlaoise Hospital should have provided a very strong case for &lsquo;external oversight and support to Portlaoise Hospital as it dealt with the legacy of those issues&rsquo;...<br /><br />Six previous investigations into hospital care in Ireland have been carried out by the Authority [that is HIQA] between 2007 and 2013.  These have made a number of important findings and recommendations which were intended to be used by all healthcare services to inform and improve practice.  Had the relevance of these investigation findings been reviewed in the context of Portlaoise Hospital and the aligned recommendations been subsequently implemented, the Authority is of the opinion this could have vastly reduced the identified risks in the services being provided to patients.</blockquote><p>We have had the Tania McCabe tragedy in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, we have had the Savita Halappanavar case, and we have had the investigations into Mallow and Ennis hospitals.  There seems to be no ability for the organisation to take the best practice from within the system.  More important, when recommendations are made, there seems to be a complete inability to follow through on those.<br/><br/>This is an issue for the Minister as well.  Representatives of HIQA appeared before the committee yesterday.  They made the point that the regulator should not be the body overseeing the implementation of the recommendations.  Equally the organisation that is requested to implement the recommendations should not also be overseeing it.<br/><br/>Without being overly hostile to the HSE, any reading of this Portlaoise report would seem to indicate that almost nothing has been learned from the previous seven reports and, if it has, it has not been implemented.  In the context of a patient safety advocacy group, we should consider establishing some form of commission to oversee the implementation of recommendations of a regulator.<br/><br/>The report also states: &quot;At the time of reporting in May 2015 &ndash; some 13 months after the publication of this recommendation by the Chief Medical Officer &ndash; these arrangements were still not in place.&quot;  Those arrangements were that in the interim Portlaoise hospital would continue:</p><blockquote>to operate in the absence of formal systems enabling clinical cooperation and communication between it and some of the larger training hospitals that are to be involved in the group.  The Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s report made a specific recommendation about ensuring the networking of senior clinical leadership between the larger Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital in Dublin and the maternity unit within the smaller Portlaoise Hospital.</blockquote><p>I find it extraordinary that that had not been fully implemented in the context of the Chief Medical Officer's report that was published 13 months ago.<br/><br/>We can go into further detail on this in Tuesday, but I really need an explanation of this one.  Page 12 of the report states:</p><blockquote>The pivotal appointment of a director of midwifery to a maternity department located within a general hospital is unique to Portlaoise Hospital.  This role has had a very positive influence in terms of assessing and improving the standard of midwifery care, enhancing multidisciplinary working relationships, improving staff morale and re-energising a patient-centred approach to care.</blockquote><p>As with much of this report the next word is &quot;however&quot;:</p><blockquote>However, at the time of writing, a senior obstetric lead had not been appointed to the Maternity Department to provide independent senior experienced obstetric clinical leadership.  This is despite a direct request by the Authority [that is, HIQA, again] to the Director General [that is, Mr. O'Brien] of the HSE in September 2014 to do so because of the investigation team&rsquo;s concerns about the absence of adequate clinical leadership within the maternity unit and the failure to progress the development of a clinical network with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.</blockquote><p>I know that a memorandum of understanding has since been signed with the Coombe hospital.  However, I find it extraordinary that more effort was not made.<br/><br/>The Minister's contribution did not really refer to the major crisis that is facing us with outpatient waiting lists.  Some 412,000 people are waiting for an outpatient appointment and it is getting worse.  At some stage the Minister will have to accept they cannot do it themselves.  It will be necessary to re-engage the National Treatment Purchase Fund and admit that the system is not working.  We need to engage with the private sector at least to allow patients a chance of being seen and getting treatment in a reasonable time.<br/><br/>May I come back again later?</p></speech>

Last week the Minister announced the appointment of a steering group to help prepare a national maternity strategy.  Yesterday, speaking to the media in Portlaoise, he speculated on the closure of a number of smaller so-called maternity units.  It is very premature to talk in those terms when any number of measures that would warrant consideration should be examined before such a serious step would even be contemplated.  I would have liked to have heard him acknowledge the inadequate staffing provision leading to an impossible situation for many who provide excellent maternity services across our 19 maternity units.  We need to recognise that there were 33 unfilled vacancies at Portlaoise hospital.  The recruitment to fill these positions is only now being seriously addressed.  It is very premature and I am very concerned because it only fuels the upset and confusion.  The director general spoke about negative publicity.  Again, suggesting more closures is a negative step.  It is not dealing with the problem at all.  Women do not want to be displaced and herded into factory production in over-centralised settings which clearly lack the compassion, care, time and attention they deserve in these situations.  The overwhelming number of them are not sick; they are having a child.</p> <p>  The director general said that the HSE received the final report of the investigation into Portlaoise hospital on Friday.  What differences were there between the final report and the report that gave rise to his very strong intervention that went so far as to threaten legal action to injunct the publication of that draft report?  What was the difference between the draft report and the final one, when apparently, from what the director general has said and the Minister has indicated, the HSE is accepting all the recommendations that directly impact on the HSE?  What was the difference?  What gave rise to his first reaction and his more accepting stance to the report in its final presentation?</p> <p>  I will not continue to address the Portlaoise report at this point, knowing that we have the debate on Tuesday.  I do not want the issues I had highlighted for quarterly address to be completely lost.</p><p>They merited it and I would like to refer to it.  The first concerned question No. 9, in which I raised the issue of vulnerable adults and their safe care in a variety of settings.  We are talking about aged and vulnerable adults who are unable to articulate and represent themselves.  &Aacute;ras Attracta might be a backdrop to the question, although I am not specifically or solely addressing that setting.  The Minister's reply states that under the policy, that is, the safeguarding of vulnerable persons at risk of abuse national policy procedures, all service providers are required to have a publicly stated no-tolerance approach to abuse.  What does "no tolerance" mean?  Could the Minister translate that for me?  Despite all the public attention and the expos&eacute; on national television, I am not convinced that this issue has been satisfactorily addressed.  The fears and concerns still remain.</p><p> I note that at the end of the subsequent paragraph the Minister states that in cases of suspected sexual abuse, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would always be notified.  Why would the Garda not always be notified in cases of physical abuse and assault?  Why does the answer refer specifically only to cases of suspected sexual abuse?  Would cases of suspected or actual physical abuse and assault not always be notified to the Garda?  If this has not been the case, will the Minister give us an assurance that it is now and always will be in the future?  Abuse of an elderly person or a vulnerable adult should always carry both criminal and civil penalties and strong legislation is required in this area.  Elderly persons and dependent adults are a disadvantaged section of society.  I have such adults in my immediate family and I am sure many others in this room can identify and empathise with this critically important situation.  I want to see the very best guarantees enshrined in legislation.  I do not ever again want to wake up to new revelations of elder abuse or the abuse of dependent adults.</p><p> My question No. 10 concerns the vaccine for meningitis B.  We have seen examples of the impact of meningitis, and meningitis B accounts for the majority of cases in Ireland.  We have the highest incidence of meningococcal disease in Europe and there was a significant increase of up to 25% in cases in 2013.  Children under five are the highest risk age group.  I am very concerned about the response to my question, which states that the introduction of any new vaccine into the primary childhood immunisation schedule will be considered in the context of recommendations from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, the outcome of cost-effectiveness analysis, the conclusions of the review of the HSE vaccination services currently being carried out, and resource availability.  This is not an answer.  The issue is not being actively and seriously considered.  I am anxious to know if it will be revisited.  Is it the case that only parents who can afford to buy the vaccine will be able to protect their children from meningococcal disease?</p><p> My question No. 11 raises access to emergency dental general anaesthetic services in Dublin city.  Those services were withdrawn last year, yet the Minister's answer states that a protocol is now in place requiring this service remain under regular review.  Heaven protect us all.  What is being done to ensure a public service of a high standard is in place which children who are dependent on the public service and require an anaesthetic for extractions will be able to access?  The service was in place in St. James's Hospital until it ceased last year.  The consequences are very serious for the families who are directly impacted.</p></speech>

As we will have dedicated time for this as a committee, I would now like to focus on some of the questions I raised, which are of critical importance.</p> <p>  My question No. 14 concerns the children and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS.  I raised this because of a report produced in March 2015 by Dr. Helen Buckley, chair of the national review panel on children who died in the care of the State.  The report was about 26 vulnerable children and stated that three out of four teenage girls who died by suicide were known to our child protection services and, for lengthy periods before their deaths, were on waiting lists for psychological services.  According to the individual reports on the circumstances surrounding 12 of the deaths, at one point before taking her life, one of the girls, called Jennifer in the report, had been on a waiting list for psychological services for two years.  Her mother had tried to access mental health services the week before she died.  This happened last year.  It is not something historical.  Another case concerns a teenage girl, named Zoe in the report, who had been in and out of State care in childhood.  Her case with the social work department had been closed months before she died by suicide.</p> <p>  I am hearing more and more that there is an urgency to close cases rather than being absolutely assured that the child is getting the services she or he needs.  Dr. Helen Buckley states that mental health difficulty is very prevalent among people and their parents.  Referring to waiting lists, she states that two years is the treatment time she is seeing in the cases she is looking at.  She further states that young people in critical conditions are often receiving very limited treatment.  This is echoed by the child care law reporting project led by Dr. Carol Coulter and her team, which gives us an insight into child care proceedings in the courts.  This project reports on very recent cases and the characteristics and demographics mirror all those interplaying factors identified by Dr. Buckley.</p> <p>  I am frustrated by the lack of urgency within our mental health services.  We know from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland that by age 13, one in three young people is likely to have experienced some type of mental disorder.  By the age of 24 that has increased to one in two.  How we deal with it at that age frames how we deal with it for life.  Getting it right at that age is critical for our lives.  When I talk to community-based organisations on the ground, they say the pathways for getting to the services are extremely difficult.  For example, I was talking to a person in Tallaght who told me that although Jigsaw and Headstrong employ a consultant psychiatrist, they cannot refer directly to CAMHS but have to refer the young person to a GP who can then refer them on.  It does not make sense when they have a consultant psychiatrist who specialises in the field.  They say to me they do not have a waiting list because they do not tolerate a policy of any waiting list.  For someone who is experiencing severe mental health issues, even 12 weeks seems a long time in that critical phase.</p> <p>  I could make the same speech on this issue as I made four years ago.  From talking to the organisations on the ground, I do not know where it is going, particularly in respect of services outside the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. period.  What are youth workers to do and how can they get help for a young person?  The issue needs more attention.</p> <p>  On question No. 12 regarding the hospice friendly hospitals programme, I am surprised there is no mention of the HSE palliative care co-ordinators.  This was in the joint committee's report on end-of-life care.  We had a really good engagement with the HSE on that report and I am surprised it has not been mentioned.  Perhaps we could have more detail on that.</p><p> I was very disappointed by the answer to question No. 13 and I believe a more detailed answer will come.  It gives the impression that things are happening but, sadly, they are not.  We only have seven months left in four-year policy programme to get to our implementation plan.  The programme has been there for four years and we have seven months left but we still do not have the implementation plan.  This is about stroke survivors and rehabilitation care.  It is totally unacceptable that we do not have that yet.  I agree that health service funding can be part of the problem but much of what is required could be delivered through reorganisation.  We must do much more about this, as we have seen a deterioration in service in the lifetime of this Government rather than an improvement.  This area needs extra focus but I will await a further answer.</p><p> I ask the Minister about the children's hospital.  I welcome his statement and his visit to Great Ormond Street Hospital.  In the media there is a very strong focus on the geographical location but this committee's understanding, having visited the site, is there is an idea of satellites, consistency of services and outreach.  It has not really been conveyed to the public.  Has there been a decision on the maternity hospital, as it is important to consider the site and the services in play?  I repeat my welcome for free GP care for those under six; it is a prevention and early intervention step, and it is a very positive move to a rights-based approach to health care.  I want to see all children getting the health care they need when they need it.  The health checks have been required for a long time.  I hope we can get to the children who are in abusive cases or neglected much earlier in life.  That is a critical issue.</p><p> I also welcome the HSE statement on alcohol-related harm.  A policy is being developed where there will be no interaction with the drinks industry, which is welcome.  I hope the Departments of Health and Education and Science, as well as other Departments and the Child and Family Agency, will follow suit with a similar statement.</p></speech>

With regard to vulnerable adults, Mr Pat Healy is here and he might take up that matter.  I must go as the statements on the national dementia strategy will shortly be taken in the D&aacute;il.  I hope to get back here.  We are in negotiations about a range of vaccines and I know Deputy Conway has also put down a question on that.  As the negotiations are ongoing, we should allow them to happen.  That should not take forever.</p> <p>  There was mention of the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, and I share those concerns.  We must remember that CAMHS is for people who are acutely unwell and outside of that, we should be able to take a deeper look at the waiting list - we have been doing that - to see where exactly people can be dealt with.  Perhaps it could be at the very early stages, as was suggested, so that people do not necessarily have to go to CAMHS.  We have much difficulty with recruitment.  I spoke to the director this morning and we have not been very successful in the recruitment process.  She can fill in the committee on that as well.  We are very conscious of the need for pathways to be clearer and access to be more immediate.  There is a programme being worked on because we can do much better.  When there are glaring gaps like we have had with personnel within the service, it is very difficult to deliver on our very high expectation.  We have reduced waiting times and are getting on top for the first time with bed allocation and inappropriate placement.  We have far more information on that now, which we did not have before.  I must go but I will do my best to return.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher asked about the oversight implementation and recommendations.  It is a very pertinent question.  One of the specific eight recommendations made in the HIQA Portlaoise report is that the Department would set up a steering group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of that report.  I can commit that it will be done; there is a commitment led by the Department to oversee the implementation of all eight recommendations in the report.  This applies not just to the recommendations made to the Department but also those made to the HSE.</p> <p>  What is particularly helpful and strong about this report is the fact there are eight recommendations.  They are specific, measurable, achievable and realistic.  They can be time-bound.  What can be difficult with other reports, not just from HIQA but from other bodies in the past, is that there may be 70 or 200 recommendations that are not very specific or time-bound.  Sometimes they are not achievable.  That would put anybody in a very difficult position as it is arguable as to whether they could ever be implemented.  HIQA have set down a good marker by having eight very clear and doable recommendations that we can implement.  The truth is that, on occasion, sometimes HIQA has made recommendations that cannot be done.  With respect to ambulances, it specifically made a recommendation that would be in contravention of European law, and we would have to tender the ambulance to do what it recommends.  That is obviously not something we intend to do.  Sometimes the recommendations cannot be achieved because of financial limitations, and that is particularly the case with accident and emergency departments.  We are building a new accident and emergency department every year in Ireland because we can only afford to do that.  I wish we could build 20 new departments but we cannot.  That is the reason we are certainly behind on some of those recommendations regarding the emergency department in Tallaght that could be applied across the country.</p> <p>  There may also be problems with recruitment and sometimes it is hard to recruit people in filling certain posts, no matter how hard we try.  The fact that recommendations are not necessarily implemented does not mean they are being ignored.  Sometimes we are still working at trying to implement them.  We need to move to an approach of "comply and explain" with HIQA recommendations.  I have asked the Department to go through and audit all recommendations made over the past number of years and have a rolling programme of checking every couple of months where we are in implementing them.</p></speech>

My plan is for it to be chaired by a Department official but I am open to views on that.  There should be independent input, particularly a patient representation.</p> <p>  I touched on the outpatient appointment issue.  There are 412,000 people now waiting for their first appointment with a consultant, although there could be a fair bit of double counting.  We will let the committee know about that.  It is always important with waiting list figures to drill down and 170,000 of those people are waiting less than 12 weeks.  In some cases they are waiting a few days.  That refers to anybody, in effect, who has been referred by their GP to a consultant.  It is not the case that they are all waiting inordinate lengths of time.  The figures may be confusing.  With the surgical area, the number of people waiting less than three months for a procedure is going up, for example, but the number of people waiting a long time is going up.  People are being seen quickly by efficient services that are turning people over quickly, leading to improvement, but particular sub-specialties have lists that are getting longer.  When I speak with people on waiting lists, they are not all that interested in whether they are number 100,000 or 106 on the list but rather how long they will have to wait.  That is why the focus is not so much on getting the numbers down, as every time a new service is established, there is a new waiting list for it.  There are waiting lists now in areas that did not exist two years ago.</p><p>My focus is on reducing waiting times so that people do not have to wait too long to see somebody.  That is why we have set these maximum tolerable limits - which should not be tolerable, but unfortunately, they are - of 18 months by June and 15 month by December.  I agree that we will need some help from the private sector and potentially even overseas in order to address some of those targets.  That will be expensive but it needs to be done.  It can be done through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which was used to eliminate the long waits for urgent colonoscopy procedures at the end of last year.  I have no problem doing that again if the budget is available to do so.  However, it does not necessarily have to be done by the NTPF in the old way as it can also be done directly by hospitals and groups which are already using the private sector to pick up some of their work.</p><p> For example, I refer to the very long waiting list for scoliosis operations for children which I find personally to be extremely worrying.  That is why we have allocated an extra &euro;1 million this year for this procedure.  We have had to use the Blackrock Clinic as well as Cappagh to deal with some of those cases.  However, there are limitations in that there are only so many theatres and so many surgeons.  We are putting a whole new theatre into Crumlin hospital even though it will be out of use in three years.  A constraining factor is the theatre space and the number of consultants who are trained to do the operations and this has caused us serious trouble.  We may need to send some cases overseas for these operations.</p><p> There is a bigger picture with regard to waiting times for appointments.  We need to reduce the number of referrals because, quite frankly, too many people are being referred to specialists.  The best way we can reduce referrals is to support GPs, have more referrals to generalists, build up primary care in particular and also have GPs taking a special interest in areas such as dermatology and ENT.  They can be trained up to deal with these areas of medicine.  This would allow for inter-practice referrals as is the case in other countries.  The e-referral system will mean better referrals.  It is really disheartening to hear of patients who wait a year to see a consultant and the consultant tells them he did not need to see them.  Better quality referrals using e-referrals, photograph referrals and video conferencing can all help.</p><p> We need proper adherence to chronological order and that is not always being done.  It is supposed to be urgent cases first and then all routine cases in order but that does not happen.  We need better IT systems in particular to ensure this does not happen.  We need to change the ratio of reviews to new patients.  At the moment in any clinic there is approximately one new patient for every three seen, or one to about 2.6 patients.  If that ratio is changed slightly, there would not be a need for more clinics.  More new patients would be seen and instead of a review every six months, it would be done every seven months or patients could be discharged back to their GP.  A slight change in the ratio with existing resources could actually transform the waiting list.  However, making that happen in every hospital and clinic in the country is very difficult, in particular when one is working from headquarters.  We need more consultants in many areas, in particular in some of the specialties such as dermatology, ENT, orthopaedics and others.  If it was a case of just having more consultants, the problem would have been solved a long time ago.  We have more consultants than ever in the health service.  However, it is a bigger piece that needs to be addressed; it has never been addressed properly and we are doing our best in that regard.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the closure of maternity units and he said it was premature to be discussing that issue.  It is probably premature to be talking about it and I accept that criticism.  However, I wish to make it clear that it is not ruled out in that it is part of what needs to be considered.  It is important to underline that this is not just a question of staffing; adequate patient numbers are required.  For example, if a unit has 2,000 births a year, that is three or four births a day.  When that one in a thousand case arrives, that unit probably has not seen such a case before and it is not sure what to do.  The nature of specialisation is that smaller centres can give more personal care but bigger centres are more used to dealing with those rare cases, those one in a thousand cases or those one in ten thousand cases.  Sometimes these cases can be picked up in advance and referred to the specialist centre but sometimes they are not picked up and that is the inherent nature of a smaller unit when it comes to a specialist service.  The same applies to emergency departments, to cancer treatment in the past and to many other conditions.</p><p> If I were to explain it very simply, 20 years ago medicine was very safe, very simple and it was not very effective.  Now it is very effective, very complex and potentially dangerous.  A person having a heart attack 20 years ago would have gone to the local hospital where they would probably not have been able to do very much for the person and any doctor could do it.  Now it is totally different.  For example, a particular type of heart attack, a STEMI, means a patient is taken by ambulance to a specialist centre where a specialist does primary PCI or else the patient is taken by helicopter in some cases.  If it is not that type of heart attack, the patient goes to a different centre which specialises in thrombolycis, a treatment that cannot be done in every hospital and never was or could be done in every hospital.  That is why there has to be a lot of changes.  Our job as politicians is to explain to people why the best care is not necessarily the nearest care and that it might be better to travel an hour or two to the right place rather than to have local care that is not up to standard.  </p><p> Another aspect to remember is that staff can become de-skilled, and this issue was raised in the HIQA report on surgery in Portlaoise.  If the surgeons are not doing complex surgery every day, they will not be as good at it.  It is the case that one will be better at something one does every day rather than what one does only once a week.  That is often the problem with smaller centres; it is often not lack of staff but rather lack of patients with those particular conditions and needs. </p><p> It must be borne in mind that even where there are staffing issues, the recruitment of skilled professionals is very difficult.  There is an international shortage of doctors, consultants, midwives and specialist nurses.  As a result they generally want to work in big centres attached to universities and centres of research.  There is a struggle to recruit to peripheral centres and this applies not only in Ireland.  It is not just a question of money; there are many reasons.  It will come to the point where we must ask if it is desirable that we are only keeping services open by staffing them with locums and agency workers who work for a week or two.  These are the questions we need to tackle as a country.  This was the situation with regard to cancer and it will be the case in other areas.  </p><p> On the question of maternity models, the strategy group will examine this in the round.  In my view there is a lot more space for midwife-led care and midwife-led units and a lot more space for the domino system which means mothers go home early from hospital.  There is more room for home births, within reason, if these can be done safely.  Therefore, there would be fewer hospital-based births and as the birth rate falls, we would need fewer hospital units.  It will not be possible to have the two systems.  More midwife-led care, birthing centres, community care and home births, along with fewer births overall, will mean we will hardly need the same number of maternity units.  That is just common sense and we need to be upfront about that.  </p><p> On the question about vaccines, no country in Europe as yet vaccinates its entire population or child population for meningitis B.  The UK will be the first country to do so later this year.  It is under consideration as part of the service plan for 2016 but it is not under consideration on its own in that other vaccines are available to be considered.  I refer to HPV for boys and men.  The rotovirus vaccine is not given in Ireland but it is given in other countries.  We must also consider the BCG vaccine because it has now been recommended by the experts that we no longer vaccinate everyone for TB and that only high-risk groups are vaccinated.  We will look at all the vaccines rather than one at a time in order to develop a package for the service plan for 2016.</p><p> Senator van Turnhout spoke about the satellite centres and I agree with her.  The planning permission for the children's hospital satellite centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght will be submitted at the same time, which is this summer.  If planning permission is granted, they will be open in 2017, so the satellite centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght will be open before the main hospital opens.  There will be a national network so every paediatric ward in the country will be linked into the children's hospital using the same IT system.  The satellite centres will be ambulatory.  For example, the Blanchardstown centre is a big three-storey building with a walk-in emergency department, outpatient department and other facilities.  The Tallaght centre will be similar.  In general, people will bring their children to these centres if a child has a bad chest or an injury and they will not go to the main campus because that will be the specialist centre, by and large.  </p><p> There are four stand-alone maternity hospitals, Holles Street, the Coombe, the Rotunda and St. Munchin's in Limerick.  The plan is to co-locate these hospitals with adult hospitals.  This can only be done one hospital at a time and Holles Street will be the first.  The planning application to move to the campus of St. Vincent's hospital will be submitted this summer.  The hospital will be on the campus but it will be separate from St. Vincent's hospital.  A decision remains to be made on where the Coombe, the Rotunda and St. Munchin's will go but that decision will be made in a matter of weeks.  The locations are obvious but we have to ensure that the decisions stand up, are supported by data and are not based on any political considerations.  We cannot have any allegations that decisions were taken on that basis.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Liam Woods to comment on outpatient care and waiting lists generally.</p><p>Mr. Pat Healy will speak on the safeguarding policy and community rehabilitation, Ms Anne O'Connor on mental health services and Ms Laverne McGuinness on dental services and palliative care.  In response to the questions on maternity services and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s concern about the nature of care in large maternity units, approximately 40% of the babies born last year were born in large maternity units.  The three Dublin units are not associated with an absence of compassionate care.  They are associated with very high standards of care.  There should not be a suggestion that if there were to be a centralisation into larger units, it would be equated with a downgrading of the level of compassion and care.  That correlation does not exist at all.</p><p> In response to Deputy Kelleher, who reminded me of the commitments made in the 2014 service plan, the quality and patient safety enablement programme identified has been established.  It intends to ensure there are differential focuses on quality improvement on the one hand and quality assurance and verification on the other.  That is having a significant impact on the system which all those who interact with it have recognised.  He also mentioned the issue of health care acquired infections.  When the latest performance assurance report is published shortly it will show for example that in Clostridium difficile, C. diff, we have the lowest recorded incidence at 2.1.  There are areas where progress is being made.</p><p> The Deputy asked specifically about the response to the publication of the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s report last February.  On the day of its publication a new manager and a new director of midwifery were installed in the maternity services in Portlaoise.  They are judged in the HIQA report to have made a very significant impact on the improvements that have occurred there, so much so, that, although it was described as a slightly innovative approach, HIQA has recommended the approach in general hospitals that have maternity services and that having a separate director of midwifery should be replicated.  That is a sign of confidence that initiative went through.  Two obstetricians have been appointed.  The Irish maternity early warning system, IMEWS, has been implemented on site.  In regard to the Dublin Mid-Leinster hospital group, in order to bring the strongest managerial focus I could to the group, I moved one of the most senior leaders in the HSE, Dr. Susan O&rsquo;Reilly, who was brought to this country to head the national cancer control programme, into that group, specifically to ensure it had the type of managerial and clinical leadership focus required to address the issues there.  That is also bearing considerable fruit.</p><p> The institution of a serious reportable events recommendation that the chief medical officer included in his report was implemented by my direction throughout the system from that day forward and it has since evolved, has been strengthened and is being audited.  There has been a significant response.  None of that of course is intended by me to take away from the fact that there were prior events from which there was insufficient learning and Deputy Kelleher referred to one of them.  The letter to staff I issued was a reflection of my reaction to the particular unbelievable experiences of patients, their families and bereaved parents in terms of how they were responded to at their time of greatest need.  It was intended to send a clear signal, which it did, that we can all, each of the 100,000 in the health service, do better than that. </p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked me in particular about my position on the HIQA report.  In terms of anything that went before, I had not seen, because it is not the practice that one would see, the recommendations of the HIQA report as part of a draft sent for fact checking and verification.  That is not how it is done.  Any comments I made about the report were not about the recommendations because I had not seen them.  I was briefed verbally on those recommendations this day last week and received them when I received the full copy.  I had and have absolutely no hesitation in agreeing with, supporting and committing to the implementation of the recommendations because I believe they will contribute to an improvement.</p><p> The issue I raised previously with HIQA was characterised here as threatening to injunct it, which I did not do.  I did raise the prospect of a judicial review in circumstances where I had been asked to provide feedback on a draft report, without sufficient information to enable me to do so.  I had on five occasions attempted to reach an engagement with those involved in order to overcome an impasse.  Ultimately, at my appeal, the Department of Health was able to facilitate an engagement where we overcame some of those issues, appropriate time was allowed and a comprehensive submission made to the HSE.  As to the extent of change, I do not think this is the time for that discussion.  At the moment it is appropriate to focus on the report itself.  My acceptance of the recommendation does not mean that I agree with every line in the report but that is not for now.</p></speech>

There are just over 900,000 new appointments for outpatients every year and approximately 3.2 million total appointments.  Managing that number and getting it right is very important.  The length of wait is impacting on the new to return ratio.  There are some things we may be able to do to work on that.</p> <p>  On the inpatient day case side we are 94% compliant with the 18-month target the Minister set, based on the expected work to be completed.  That includes in-sourcing within the public sector that hospitals will help one another complete their workloads and extra clinics being run within hospitals, and some outsourcing.  We are already in dialogue with the private sector on those issues.  We are also progressing well on outpatients.  The point made about the latest data showing just under 400,000 total outpatients is of concern.  We are progressing well toward the conclusion of the 18 month target.  At the moment we are getting near 60% and are working on that.  There are some specialties where there will be a residual challenge within the last 6%, relating to areas such as scoliosis and sleep apnoea.  We are looking for further options in the private market to address those.</p></speech>

Child protection arrangements are also in place.  Much has been done to develop this front, but there was a lacuna, in that vulnerable or disabled adults who were not elderly were not covered.  Following the establishment of the social care division, one of our first actions was to develop a safeguarding policy, which was published last December and is being rolled out.</p> <p>  The reference to a no-tolerance policy relates to the need for a change in culture.  There is a basic expectation that staff at all levels, be they in residential centres or communities, would engage compassionately and appropriately in terms of the care and support provided to the people with whom they engage.  However, we have learned and continue to learn that this is not always the case.  The no-tolerance policy is meant to drive home to providers and staff across the sector as well as to the public that there is an intention to change.  We are not just supporting this with the implementation of the safeguarding policy, which will see safeguarding teams across the nine community health care organisations.  Twenty additional social workers are being recruited for these teams, as are some of the principal social workers who will head them up, with the others already in post.  We will also support the no-tolerance policy through a six-step change programme and a volunteer advocacy programme, under which we will have residential counsels in our residential centres.  The idea is to open up our centres so that people can come in from the outside and there can be a general sense of engagement.</p> <p>  There is a dedicated team for the quality improvement programme.  As the director general stated, the team has visited 50 of our centres, representing 25% of the HSE's services.  We have prioritised our services because they tend to be found in large congregated settings.  The roll-out of the programme is significant and there have been two national summits attended by the Minister and others, including all of the stakeholders.  The summits have provided the HSE and the national task force an opportunity to report on progress and others with an opportunity to feed into that process.  More summits are planned for the summer and autumn.  We will continue reporting.</p> <p>  Regarding community rehabilitation, my colleagues, Mr. John Hennessy, the national director for primary care, and Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, and I wrote a more comprehensive answer that did not find its way to this meeting.  We will send it to Senator van Turnhout and engage directly with her on the matter.</p></speech>

The report into child deaths raises a number of issues in terms of psychological services, not all of which are provided by the mental health services.  The first early intervention piece is access to psychology at primary care level.  We are working with the primary care division to examine this matter.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding that, there are a number of challenges for the specialist services.  The service improvement project is under way to improve access to and quality of CAMHS.  We have waiting lists, with a number of areas challenged in terms of children waiting for longer than 12 months.  We are addressing this issue with those areas.  However, a number of factors have an impact, for example, our capacity to recruit.  In terms of staffing, more than 50% of our CAMHS teams are working with less than 50% of what A Vision for Change recommended.  We are significantly challenged in terms of recruiting consultant psychiatrists.  Only in the past week have we heard that, of the three CAMHS and three mental health of intellectual disability, MHID, service posts advertised by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, not a single application was received.  This is concerning because we have services with no CAMHS consultants.  We must try to address this issue.</p> <p>  The CAMHS validation exercise has told us that approximately 20% of children referred to CAMHS and on waiting lists could be seen by primary care.  We have legacy issues to address in terms of how things work in areas.  For example, to access services, they come through CAMHS, which is unnecessary.  There are children sitting on waiting lists for educational assessments who do not need CAMHS.  We are trying to unpick all of this and to determine where children and young people need to be seen.</p> <p>  A specific point to make about the children referenced in those reports and the at-risk young people who are in the care of the State is that we are seeking to develop a CAMHS forensic team from the 2015 development funding.  We are awaiting approval.  We are working closely with Tusla.  A small number of children have complex cases and take up a great deal of Tusla and the mental health service's time.</p></speech>

We are also working with the justice system.</p> <p>  A number of initiatives are under way as part of the improvement project, including to address the Senator's points about on-call liaisons for CAMHS so that, when a young person presents at an emergency department, he or she can be assessed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  These initiatives are in train and I hope that the response the committee received set some of them out for it.</p></speech>

That service was provided in St. James's Hospital until last year when the accommodation was no longer suitable under health and safety standards.  There is a short to medium-term solution, but the medium to long-term solution is for the new service to be provided in the new children's hospital.  The children who need it currently have been provided a private service, with up to 300 children having been referred.  The plan is to re-examine the location at St. James's Hospital with a view to upgrading it so that the facility can be re-opened for general anaesthetic services for children.</p> <p>  We will get Senator van Turnhout more comprehensive information on the palliative care co-ordination as it relates to the hospice-friendly hospitals.</p></speech>

Yesterday, there were 42 patients on trolleys in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  It was the second highest number in the country.  What plans are in place to reduce these numbers?  The Minister monitors the trolley situation on a daily basis, but the problem in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is serious.</p> <p>  At the beginning of April, the Minister's Department approved additional funding of &euro;74 million to reduce delays in discharges.  That was welcome.  Some &euro;44 million was provided for the fair deal scheme, which the Minister stated would result in an additional 1,600 places, and &euro;30 million was allocated to provide 250 rehabilitative beds in community and district hospitals.  I welcome the decrease in the fair deal waiting list from 11 weeks to an average of four weeks.  I am pleased to see that County Louth's two hospitals - Our Lady of Lourdes and Louth County Hospital - are working closely together, sharing facilities and opening up roads to help alleviate the problem at the former.  We must see some kind of improvement in the trolley situation at Drogheda.  I have spoken to patients and doctors.  All reports are that the services and staff are good, but that they need more beds.</p> <p>  I am delighted that the issue of obesity will be addressed in the same stance as tobacco and alcohol.  "Obesity" is the medical term used to describe the state of being overweight and in bad health.  Obesity is a timebomb that is ready to explode.  Nearly two thirds of us are obese or overweight.  It is putting our children at risk.  We lack self-awareness of body size.  It is costing us millions of euro and increasing the risk of cancers, including bowel, kidney, womb and breast to name but a few.  It is causing heart and diabetes problems, damaging our joints and increasing the likelihood of developing varicose veins.  It gives one a sense of being unattractive and reduces one's self-confidence.  I plead with the Minister to intervene in the obesity issue.  I am the committee's rapporteur on obesity.  We will do anything to help.</p> <p>  The situation is getting out of control.  Ireland's is one of the worst in Europe, perhaps even in the world.  This is an important issue.  In fairness to the Minister, he has done a fantastic job since entering office.  I like that he is open, honest and says things like he sees them.  The situation is very serious.  For the past four or five years, all I have seen is people promising, promising and promising.  Deputy Varadkar is the type of Minister who does not make false promises.  I ask him for a full commitment to help combat obesity.</p></speech>

I will touch on the Portlaoise report briefly.  There are 19 maternity units around the country.  Is information available on the perinatal mortality rate for all 19 units?</p><p>It is important to reassure people.  There are 19 units and there are people working who are concerned and it is important that the information is put out there.  The second issue raised in the Portlaoise report was that the State Claims Agency was aware of concerns at Portlaoise hospital, but there seems to have been no mechanism between the agency and the Department to ensure there was a response to those growing concerns.  Is there now a mechanism in place should a situation arise in another hospital facing a large number of claims?  What are we doing where one agency knows there is a problem, but another is not reacting?  Is there a mechanism to allow the former to go directly to the Department?</p><p> The second issue I raise relates to the Cork-Kerry area.  I have been made aware in the last few days that there was an agreement that 30 vacancies in relation to public health nurses and community nurses would be filled.  I have also been made aware in the last two days that this has been put back and long-fingered.  Can that be clarified?  It may not be possible to do so today, but I ask it be done.  We need these people out there in the community.  They do very good work, but there are more than 30 vacancies in the Cork-Kerry region which have been open for some time notwithstanding the agreement that they be filled.</p><p> The third issue is the response to my fifth question, which was on junior doctors.  I have been raising this issue for four years, but we have not made a huge amount of progress.  The response to my question states that there are 2,943 doctors on structured training programmes.  While they may be on structured training programmes, they are not on contracts as such.  A number of junior doctors are still moving around on training programmes and six month contracts and are on emergency tax every six months.  We seem to have made no progress in the last four years in real terms.  I also raise the issue concerning junior doctors in Cork University Hospital of the absence of Internet access in the doctors' residence.  The library access is insufficient for them.  They are studying and training and providing a service, but we cannot provide a simple service to them notwithstanding that we want them to stay in the country.  We are not making a great deal of progress.  We need these people.  We need good people to stay here but we are not putting the incentives in place.  We have now had two reports from MacCraith and another lot of reports is being put on a shelf to be dealt with at some stage in the future.  We are not making enough progress.  Now is the time to start dealing with this issue so that when someone is on a five-year programme, he or she has a contract and does not go onto emergency tax.  It should not be a case of six-month contracts.  It is something with which we need to deal if we want to make serious progress on the retention of very good people in the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2603" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015051400002#M00200"><p>I want to say something on Portlaoise hospital.  I listened to media reports this morning on what I understand was a long and emotive meeting last night between the Minister and the families.  One comment struck me which was that the Minister heard from families whose cases date back to the 1980s.  That is alarming.  The Minister stated in his opening remarks that to care costs nothing.  I am not trying to pre-empt anything, but it sounds to me that there is an appalling culture in the hospital.  It is as we have seen in all of the expos&eacute;s of recent months, be it child care services or &Aacute;ras Attracta.  A culture emerges and is somehow approved by a failure to speak up.  If we do anything as a Government, we must break that kind of culture that starts to embed itself in organisations and places where often vulnerable people - and pregnant women are very vulnerable - go as a place of safety.  It is alarming in that regard to think that we are talking about cases dating back over 30 years.  I will leave it there as we are to have another meeting on Tuesday to discuss this.</p> <p>  I was interested in Mr. O'Brien's opening remarks on PPCI services.  There is an ongoing PPCI national capacity study, which includes Waterford.  We are told it is due to be completed shortly.  How long more are we going to have to wait on this?  If Mr. O'Brien could provide us with a timeline, I would greatly appreciate it.  As he understands, the lack of a 24-7 cardiology service at University Hospital Waterford is of huge concern, not just to people in Waterford but throughout the south east due to our geography and issues of proximity to other PPCI centres.</p> <p>  I am very disappointed in the reply to my question on academic appointments for University Hospital Waterford.  The response states that the Higgins report does not indicate the introduction of these posts at the hospital.  However, I have a press release from the HSE's website dated 16 May 2014 in which the former Minister, Deputy James Reilly, in renaming the hospital in the presence of Ambrose McLoughlin, the then Secretary General, and, I understand, the President of UCC, Dr. Michael Murphy, stated that five academic posts would be provided at University Hospital Waterford.  We have heard from other colleagues about the importance of ensuring that our junior hospital doctors and trainee medical students have all they need to ensure they are trained and get the utmost from their placements and internships in our hospitals.  Frankly, I am beginning to think University Hospital Waterford was just a name change.  It means nothing unless we get our academic posts that were agreed on and promised by Ambrose McLoughlin, Deputy Reilly and the President of UCC.</p> <p>  My last question is on speech and language services.  It has come to my attention from encounters with a great many people that when children reach age six, their access to speech and language therapy changes.  If the child is lucky enough to be a member of an early years service, he or she has access.  Once the child turns six, however, he or she reverts to the community care service.  The numbers are alarming given how few speech and language therapists we have in Waterford in comparison to neighbouring areas like Carlow-Kilkenny and Wexford.  That is despite the fact that we have the highest number of patients waiting to be seen by therapists.  In Carlow-Kilkenny, there are 11.7 therapists who are working with 907 people.  In Waterford, we have 9.8 whole-time equivalents but 2,361 people, often young people, who are waiting to be seen.  In Wexford, there are 18 posts with only 2,246 people.  It is a huge disparity.  What is happening in that regard?  Children are coming through the early intervention teams and by the time they get to school, they regress because the services are no longer there.  It is not something we can stand over.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015051400002#M00300"><p>I want to pick up on what Deputy Ciara Conway said about speech and language therapy.  I have asked on a number of occasions over the years for the Minister for Health to look at this and deliver a service through our national primary school network.  What is happening is that parents get appointments which they cancel or fail to turn up for and the child may not be seen again for six months.  If the therapist arrived at the school, the principal will be there and can ensure the child gets the therapy.  It would be a huge improvement for children.</p> <p>  I congratulate the Minister on the scheme he has launched to bring nurses home.</p><p>I have been asked to raise as issue that is causing major worry in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  One nursing home had to close last week because it could not find qualified nurses.  Nursing homes recruit nurses from abroad, but when they gain experience, hospitals take them on.  The nursing home in question is back at square one, having to recruit more nurses.  Nursing homes have identified a solution to the problem - fast-tracking registration.  It takes a long time - I have been 12 months - for nurses from abroad to get onto the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, register and obtain their PIN from An Bord Altranais, the Irish nursing board.  It would help if that process was fast-tracked.</p><p> I am delighted with the Minister's proposed action plan to tackle obesity.  Perhaps he might have a word with the Minister for Finance about introducing a sugar tax, with the revenue raised to be ringfenced to treat people with diabetes and other problems associated with obesity.  </p><p> The treatment of junior doctors is disgraceful.  These highly educated qualified doctors must attend for interview every six months and have to move around the country.  Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of their being put on emergency tax.  They are treated with disdain.  As they have to move around the country, they cannot make any family decision.  I do not know of any other group of qualified professionals who are treated as badly as junior doctors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2606" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015051400002#N00200"><p>I know that I have the opportunity to talk about the Midlands Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, but looking at it from a clinician's perspective, it looks like the basic interchange between two entities, with one administrative organisation criticising the other for what its perceives as an inadequate administrative response.  I do not think that is a high priority.  The problem is not unique to Portlaoise; it is emblematic of a set of broader problems in the health service which require fundamental structural change.  I know that I sound like a broken record, but a big chunk of the problem is due to the number of specialists involved.  I am grateful for the detailed answer to my question.  According to the numbers, we have probably the lowest number of career level obstetricians per head of population of any country in the western world.  Some 10% of obstetrician jobs, according to the figures provided today, are occupied by locums.  This understates the disproportionate distribution of the problem.  I suspect there are very few locums in the three Dublin hospitals and in the hospitals in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  I could be wrong, but I suspect that in smaller units there is a disproportionate utilisation of locum services.  No matter how well trained locums are, it is not as satisfactory an arrangement as having somebody who is providing for continuity of care throughout the entire course and trajectory of a pregnancy and in the provision of after care.  Those who go on to have a number of children may want to have a consultant who is aware of their obstetrical problems from prior pregnancies.  It is not a good arrangement.</p> <p>  The Minister comes very close to identifying the problem when he states it appears to him that some units are so unattractive to Irish graduates who are training, by and large, in international centres of excellence that they cannot recruit them to work and that as a result the jobs are being filled by locums, which is leading to the conclusion that perhaps the units might not be viable.  I would like the Minister to think of an alternative explanation because there is one.  The basic currency, for want of a better word, that determines the viability of an obstetrical unit is the number of births.  The question is whether there are units which deal with an insufficient number of births that it is not possible to have sufficient obstetric, paediatric, midwifery and ICU resources to provide modern 21st century care and, if so, whether these units should be closed down.  It is that simple.  If that is the logic of what the Minister is saying, I would absolutely support him in gutting the number of units in the country and closing them down.  However, it is not true.  There were approximately 2,000 births in Portlaoise last year, or about six every day, which is enough to support a well staffed unit with enough obstetricians to provide attractive jobs for those who want to come back from the leading centres of excellence and with their own paediatric special care baby unit and on-site 24 hour intensivist paediatrician.  This is not a remote part of rural British Columbia where people are spread over thousands of miles.  This is a concentrated area in which there is a large number of births and which should have its own proper modern obstetric service.  If we cannot attract good people to it, it is not because there are not enough births but because we have made a decision that the unit will not be adequately staffed. </p> <p>  I asked a question about medical schools and I am a little less happy with the quality of the answer I have been given.  I am very interested in knowing how many are actually employed full time by medical schools working as academics at consultant level in the clinical specialties of internal medicine.  The figures I have been given are not reflective of this but reflect people who have health service jobs because their job is based in a teaching hospital and have a degree of entitlement as "academics".  The numbers I have been given do not add up.  I will not go into all of the details today, but I believe the number of doctors employed in medical schools as full-time academics with dominant clinical academic components to their jobs is very small.  We need to get to the bottom of this issue.  It is hard to justify giving priority to reforming the medical school sector when there is no major constituency for this reform.  Therefore, it is hard for politicians to see it as a high priority at a time when people have to wait for two years on a waiting list and deaf children sit at the back of the class and are not able to have their ears tested for six months at a time.  We have six medical schools; we have twice as many per head of population as the European average and three times as many per head of population as in the United States, with an entirely inadequate level of staff.  I have to be careful about how I say this, but I suspect that a very rigorous scrutiny by external agencies of the education service provided in these medical schools might result in greater urgency to fix them.  </p> <p>  I am very grateful to Mr. O'Brien for clarifying the issues in respect of percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention.  He needs to know a little about the hospital group idea.  A hospital group is a good idea if we get the reforms right; however, it is not if we do not.  It appears to have been ignored in the way services are being organised in Dublin.  The Mater hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital made a proposal to form one hospital group, with one university and one medical school.  The very large cohort of cardiologists in the two hospitals who are very good and very experienced decided that they wanted to be seen as one entity for transluminal coronary interventions.  They would work a 24 hour, seven day a week and weekend rota, but they were turned down.  They are a little confused and cannot quite understand the reason for this.  For hospitals which have not traditionally worked well together, becoming involved in hospital groups involves a certain degree of compromise.  They believe this compromise is not being rewarded in dealing with the specifics of this issue and that it is not laid out as logically as it should be.</p></speech>

Will the Minister and the director general of the HSE set out what they see as the short-term and medium to long-term future of the accident and emergency unit in Navan hospital?  It seems that there are mixed messages.  One day it is proposed that the unit will remain open and the next that it be turned into a minor injuries unit.  We know what the overall plan is.  A related question is whether a regional hospital for the north east is on the agenda of the Government and the HSE.</p> <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have responsibility for the provision of SNAs in preschools in County Meath.  Funding is an issue in this respect and the usual fight to retain funding was partially successful.  What was said to one of the parents involved was that if the HSE continued to fund SNAs in preschools in County Meath, a child who was sick or dying would have to be turned down for a home care package.  This immediately brought to mind what the HSE had stated openly that somebody else would have to lose out because of the allocation of resources to a person who needed Soliris.</p><p>The parents who heard this were very upset and it has caused consternation.  They certainly do not want to see one child being pitted against another.  I thought it was a terrible way to deal with matters.  There are resource allocation issues but this was not a new funding stream; it was a continuation of a previous funding stream in an era where we were told the cutbacks had ended.</p><p> I would also appreciate a comment from the Minister on lifetime community rating and age related penalties and how they interact with the provision of universal health insurance.  There seems to be confusion about this and the Department is saying this will not apply in the event of universal health insurance.  Does this policy, which is seen as necessary to prop up the current system, indicate that universal health insurance is less likely?</p></speech>

At a time of unprecedented public concern about suicide rates, the Reach Out national suicide prevention strategy seems to have expired.  In March 2014, this committee was told that a new policy framework would be in place by November 2014.  We are now into the fifth month of 2015 which makes the framework strategy seven months late.  Could the Minister give the committee an update on the progress of this?</p></speech>

We had a very interesting session with HIQA yesterday.  I come to this from a personal point of view because I have met the families in Portlaoise.  After the "Prime Time Investigates" broadcast, I brought Roisin and Mark Molloy to meet members of the health committee in January 2014.  At the time I was eight months pregnant.  When I had my baby, I had precisely the same experience as the Molloys - a very difficult labour with the baby's heart rate dropping.  I was under the care of Professor Mick Foley and an amazing team in Holles Street, but all that went through my mind during that experience was, "Thank God I am in Holles Street".  When things went seriously wrong, the staff, the care and the attention to detail saved my baby's life.  If the families in Portlaoise had received the level of care I did, their babies would also be alive.  That is a stark reality which I find deeply upsetting.  I take the Minister at his word and hope this will not be another report which sits on a shelf.  There have been so many reports over recent years relating to the health service and maternity services that it is difficult to have the confidence that anything will be different on this occasion.</p> <p>  The perinatal mortality statistics are completely inaccurate.  Dr. Tony Holohan's report made that finding last year.  Could the Minister let the committee know what precise plans are in place to make the reporting of baby deaths in maternity services mandatory and will there be criminal liability for hospitals and individuals who do not report? A voluntary system does not work.  I note that the policy on open disclosure is now being rolled out through a substantial number of hospitals, but it is still a voluntary process.  What does the Minister envisage for the mandatory nature of that?  What will the sanctions be for those who do not participate fully and openly in the process and when will the legislation appear?</p> <p>  It is cause for concern that many of these issues were raised by parents directly with senior individuals within the HSE throughout 2012.  There was no real satisfactory response.  What is the role of the national incident management team?  It expressed concern internally in November and December 2012 and that was not acted upon.  Letters were written by parents, and in particular by Mark and Roisin Molloy, to Mr. Tony O'Brien, the director general of the HSE.  These received vague responses and nothing was done until after the "Prime Time" documentary.  It is frustrating that those responsible for the care of citizens can abdicate responsibility until the scandal is unearthed on an RTE programme.  There is public humiliation of the services and then people own up and express remorse.  The committee discussed this scandal with HIQA.  Failures were identified locally, regionally and nationally.  Four members of staff at a hospital are to be referred for disciplinary sanction, but who is responsible at regional and national level?  Is Mr. O'Brien responsible?  Does he intend to fall on his sword and be answerable for what has happened?  Repeated letters and requests for meetings by the families were ignored until the "Prime Time Investigates" documentary.  Somebody has to answer, at a national level, for a dysfunctional and negligent system which encourages cover-up rather than transparency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2613" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015051400002#O00700"><p>I will ask the director general to speak about the information sharing between the HSE and the State Claims Agency which is important.  I will ask the chief medical officer to discuss the plans for open disclosure and the decision made between mandatory and protected disclosure.  He will also expand on the issue of figures for perinatal mortality rates, which unfortunately give false reassurance.</p> <p>  Based on figures from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, there were 42 patients on trolleys yesterday morning or 35 based on the SDU figures.  As the nurses' union's own website confirms, their figures include people who are not on trolleys - people in beds, in day wards or surgical wards - patients who may not be in the right ward but are certainly not on a trolley.  Nonetheless, 35 based on our figures is still unacceptable.  By 8 p.m. last night, that figure was down to 16, of whom only eight had been on a trolley for more than nine hours, so it does change during the day, and that is the nature of an emergency department.</p> <p>  Beds have been opened in Moorehall nursing home and patients from the Louth hospitals have been moved there.  Navan and Dundalk have been used also to relieve Drogheda.  There are the additional fair deal places, but even where there is funding for fair deal, the shortage of nursing homes in the Louth-Meath area is a problem.  We need more nursing homes built, but that will not be done quickly.  They are also getting additional home care packages which allows more patients to go home.  In June or July 2015, a new modular ward will provide an additional 20 beds for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  In a logical world, if there are 35 patients on trolleys in the morning and 16 by the evening, an extra 20 beds should mean it will be down to 15 in the morning and none in the evening.  That is not going to happen and it is a concern that one can add more and more bed capacity to a hospital and it does not bring down the numbers on trolleys - there are so many other dynamics.  Admission rates vary and in some hospitals one is twice as likely to be admitted as in others, even though they are similar hospitals.  The duration of a hospital stay can vary between hospitals.  Often, when there are no people waiting on trolleys, there is less pressure to get tests done quickly or to discharge patients quickly.  People may be brought in unnecessarily on some occasions.  I have been there - I have been a doctor in the hospital where we were encouraged to admit everyone and also in the hospital where we were discouraged from admitting unnecessarily.  There are many factors and I do not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion that we just need more beds.</p><p>If it was just down to that, the problem would have been solved a long time ago.  We have started a programme in Tallaght called the Irish hospital redesign programme which applies management techniques such as lean six sigma to hospitals.  The programme is starting to work in Tallaght and if it proves successful, Drogheda might be one of the sites to which we will extend it next.  It is all about patient pathways and making better use of what we already have before we add an extra 1,000 beds because if the beds are not used correctly they will never be enough.</p><p> I have to prioritise the public health (alcohol) Bill 2015 but we intend to prepare a new action plan on obesity by the end of the year.  Two weeks ago we had a good discussion on this issue in Farmleigh with Professor Donal O'Shea and staff from McKinsey who carried out international research, among others.  The message I took from the discussion is that no single action will work.  The list is topped by issues like portion size reformulation but taxes are far down it.  We will require a cross-sectoral action plan which includes policies on physical education and snacks in schools.  Health policy will clearly be a major element, however.  Children who are signed up for GP care for under six year olds will receive two obesity checks per year.  It will be important that we put in place referral systems so that something can be done if obesity is identified.  We will need to introduce legislation on calory posting, marketing and product placement.  The jury is still out on the sugar tax, however.  Mexico has introduced such a tax and several other countries are completing research into whether it works.  If it works, we should introduce it but if it does not there are more efficient ways to raise revenue.</p><p> Deputy Conway asked about the meeting I attended last night.  As this was a private meeting and I assured people of confidentiality, I will not recount anything that they might have said.  I commend those who attended on their courage and strength and thank them for sharing their experiences with me, the Chief Medical Officer, the new CEO of the hospital group and my departmental officials so that we might learn from them.  It was a valuable exercise for that reason.  Some of the issues raised were specific to Portlaoise and they are being addressed.  However, other issues were more systemic.  If we were to go back 20 years to meet 100 patients who had bad experiences in Waterford or Blanchardstown hospital, the discussion might have been very similar because people have bad experiences in all hospitals, including tertiary referral and national specialist centres.  Much of the discussion concerned the quality of care received but equally there was concern about the way people were treated afterwards, both in terms of how professionals communicated with them initially and how their complaints were dealt with by management subsequently.  This is why I think an independent patient advocacy service would make a huge difference.  Somebody would be available to listen to patients, take their side and guide them through a difficult process laden with unnecessary officialdom, medical jargon and defensiveness.  That could drive a change of culture in our health service to make it more focused on patient experience.  This is something I want to achieve in the next couple of months.</p><p> Deputy Conway also asked about the five additional academic posts in University Hospital Waterford.  The Department is keen to support linkages between the hospital groups and their academic partners and careful consideration is being given to any service implications that might arise from these posts in the context of the strategic plan currently being prepared by the south and south west hospital group.  The cost of the five posts is &euro;1.4 million per year.  That amount of money would allow us to staff the new Waterford hospice for the best part of a year.</p></speech>

These are the kinds of decisions that have to be made in the health service.  We are always trying to choose between one child and the other but if a commitment is made, it should be honoured as soon as it can be funded.  An issue also remains outstanding in respect of academic contracts, however.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. O'Brien to address the issue of speech and language therapy.  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's suggestion that we should assign speech and language therapists to schools should be seriously considered.</p> <p>  The chief nursing officer's office is engaging with Nursing Homes Ireland to develop solutions on the shortage of nurses.  When it comes to nursing, everyone is poaching from each other.  The hospitals poach from the nursing homes and I even hear advertisements from Beacon Hospital offering hello money to nurses if they come to work for it.  That is a general symptom of the shortage of nurses in the country.  I will be investing considerable effort into the UK recruitment campaign in the coming months, as well as developing a package of measures to encourage this year's graduate class to stay here.  It is a good thing that people go overseas for a year or two to get experience but we want more to stay this year than was the case last year.</p> <p>  Senator Crown is correct that 2,000 births per year is an adequate volume to provide safe care in low to moderate risk pregnancies.  Some units are below that threshold.  However, it is not an adequate figure for tertiary or national specialty units.  Recruitment remains a struggle for smaller units.  The solution for Portlaoise is to put it under the governance of the Coombe, which allows joint appointments to be made.  I am not sure if a joint appointment has been made yet but we have given approval for two joint appointments in obstetrics and two joint appointments in paediatrics.  As the Coombe is only an hour away from Portlaoise by road, they are feasible as a joint appointment.  NCHDs will also rotate between the two hospitals, which means that if somebody has a two-year post in the Coombe, he or she might spend six months of it in Portlaoise.  The Coombe has been very helpful in this regard and I thank the master of the Coombe, Dr. Sharon Sheehan, and the board of the hospital for taking this on.  If it is successful, it might become a model for other smaller units.</p> <p>  I do not want to dwell on the primary percutaneous coronary intervention issue but I understand that St. Vincent's proposed to work together with the Mater to provide a 24-7 hour rota between the two sites.  The ambulance service had a problem with this aspect of the proposal in particular because of the risk that confusion would arise as to where patients should be brought on a particular day of the week.  This is why the decision was made to operate from two sites in the greater Dublin area, St. James's and the Mater.</p> <p>  There are no plans at present to end 24-7 emergency department services from Navan hospital but the hospital groups will need to develop strategic plans for reconfigured services in the future.  A regional hospital in the north east only makes sense if the five existing hospitals are closed or downgraded.  That would be a politically difficult and controversial decision but it would also be questionable given that we are investing considerable resources into Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  One would wonder if it is a good idea to build a regional hospital in Navan if it means downgrading or closing Our Lady of Lourdes.  There is no funding in the budget for such a proposal but it has not been ruled out as a possibility in the future.</p> <p>  The number of people with health insurance increased by 80,000 so far this year, including 76,000 who signed up in the past few weeks.  We have received the results of the HIA's initial work on universal health insurance but I do not yet have a report from the ESRI, although I am due to receive it shortly.  Regardless of whether universal health insurance is in place, loadings can still apply.  One could argue, on the one hand, that as universal health insurance is compulsory there should be no loadings or, on the other, loadings can be applied to those who did not have health insurance for a period of time before its introduction in order to reward those who have already paid into the system.</p></speech>

That decision remains to be made.  Senator Gilroy asked about the suicide strategy.  The strategy is being led by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It has been considered by the Cabinet sub-committee and we intend to bring it to Cabinet in the next week or two, following which the Minister of State will publish it at a time of her choosing.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Brien to address the specific questions on Portlaoise.  Deputy Creighton said that she found it difficult to have confidence in reports which end up being left on the shelf.  I understand her scepticism about the potential for HIQA reports making any difference.</p><p>However, they do make a difference.  The report on cancer misdiagnosis has made a major difference and totally changed cancer diagnosis.  We have reduced the number of centres from 30 to eight and are achieving much better, and constantly improving, outcomes.  The reports on the nursing homes, particularly on Leas Cross made a difference.  While standards in our nursing homes are far from perfect, they are much better than they were five or six years ago when we were hearing horror stories about nursing homes all the time.  We are hearing about the disability care homes only now because HIQA regulations started in 2013.  These problems did not begin in 2013.  The problems in our care homes and the way residents have been treated must have been going on for decades.  The difference now is that HIQA goes in, produces and publishes reports and the system is forced to act.  It will result in a major improvement in the quality and standards in the coming years.</p><p> The hygiene reports make a major difference.  MRSA rates are at their lowest ever recorded, although this is not just down to HIQA hygiene reports.  The report on the ambulance service is making a difference and is the reason there is an extra &euro;5 million for ambulances this year, there are three new ambulance bases and we are centralising control in Tallaght, which will be fully up and running within months.  While I understand the scepticism due to the failure to implement some recommendations, which happens, let us not ignore the enormous amount of work being done by those who are implementing recommendations in ambulance services, hygiene, hospital acquired infections and nursing homes.  It has made an enormous difference, and it should be recognised.  Although it was not the Deputy's intention, we should not discount or denigrate all the work done by those people who have taken HIQA recommendations on board and made a significant difference for patients.</p></speech>

Deputy Creighton mentioned the work we did last year on perinatal statistics.  We have discovered that perinatal outcomes and deaths are reported through four mechanisms, namely, the national perinatal reporting system, which was with the Central Statistics Office and has moved to the HSE; the HSE's National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre, which was recently established following the Lourdes inquiry and which is based in Cork; the CSO, which reports on statistics; and the General Register Office, GRO.  Not surprisingly, with four different systems, we get four different answers, for reasons that are complex but explicable.  They relate to the variations between the systems, how they get their data and the mandatory nature of the reporting.</p> <p>  Among the recommendations we made as a consequence of some of the analysis we did last year was to make mandatory the notification of early neonatal deaths, which was not a requirement under the Civil Registration Act.  The Department of Social Protection amended the Act in 2014 as a consequence of this piece of work, and a set of regulations is to be commenced to bring the provision into force.  There is a recommendation on standardising a single, common definition of perinatal death.  If we end up with different reporting systems each producing what appears to be a different answer to the same question, it undermines public confidence in our collective ability to describe.  The one outstanding one remains for the HSE regarding the bringing together of the national perinatal reporting system and the NPEC which use different processes and methods and have different answers on perinatal mortality levels.</p> <p>  I would like to strike a note of caution regarding the interpretation of perinatal mortality statistics.  The statistics have a value, which is reassuring, especially at national level, where they show that we stand up well in comparison with other countries, notwithstanding what I said about the variations between the reporting methods.  When one examines smaller units and hospital level data, the numbers on which it is based are much smaller and the variation between centres is not picked up in a way that will show statistical significance.  This can lead to an over-reliance on clinical staff and undue reassurance being taken from a rate when there were many other issues that might have suggested there were problems that were not being taken into account.  I encountered this in Portlaoise.</p> <p>  The perinatal mortality rate should be seen as an alarm, not a description of a standard of care.  It tells us we should look further.  A perinatal mortality rate which is reassuring in the context of a series of so-called never events and a rise in adverse events, etc. is like saying the fire alarm is not ringing and ignoring the evidence that there is a fire.  Undue reliance on perinatal mortality statistics can lead to a situation in which people are not as open as they might be to the possibility that things are not as reassuring as the perinatal mortality rates might suggest.  This is why we made a recommendation around so-called patient safety statements in order that on a monthly basis some of the kinds of information about which I have spoken, including increases in adverse incidents, staff numbers, increased numbers of births, which happened in Portlaoise, and a range of other information, can be examined as means of quickly identifying safety problems rather than relying, particularly at the small unit level, on data that are produced only once a year in arrears.</p></speech>

It would be helpful if people had access to information that is reasonably positive about most units throughout the country.  This is a problem about which patients and staff are concerned.  The coverage is very negative, although there is some positive information from the units.</p></speech>

It is a very good policy, and stands up to the standard of policies around open disclosure to be found anywhere.  The question that arises is the extent to which any additional benefit arises from mandating open disclosure.  Our expectations should be that, through the open disclosure policies, staff will always deal in an appropriate way with patients and be honest and open when things go wrong.  Patient safety depends on creating the kind of environment in which professionals will be honest and open with patients in the first instance when things go wrong, explain it to them and deal with them appropriately.  It does not always happen.  Part of this is creating an environment in which health professionals can feel supported in participating in a range of activities that can improve quality and patient safety, including clinical audit, other quality assurance arrangements, adverse event reporting and open disclosure.  We intend to build into our health information Bill, which is part of our set of proposals, when it is published shortly, protections from access to this kind of information through freedom of information and data protection that will give health professionals an assurance that if they participate honestly and openly in these processes, the information will not be used against them in freedom of information.  It is about creating the sense of a culture which is not about imposing requirements on professionals and mandating them to do things but giving them a sense that they are supported in doing the right thing, which in this case is being set out in the open disclosure policy in the HSE.</p></speech>

The decision was based on a substantial review and clinical input through the clinical programme in the area.  The co-operation between the Mater and St. Vincent's, which are members of the group, is bearing fruit, as it can in other areas.  In this instance, the decision was made, based on clinical input and wide consultation, to locate the service in Dublin in St. James's and the Mater.  Some decisions will arise, particularly around the Dublin area, that are potentially above group level in terms of organisation of service.  As the clinical programmes proceed and we make further health care decisions, the groups will require guidance as part of their preparation of their strategic plans, which were referred to earlier, which will be above group level.</p></speech>

We are trying to develop an integrated approach which takes account of school services, voluntary service provision and the service provided by the Health Service Executive.  These are the progressing disability services for children and young people aged from birth to 18 years.  The governance for this programme has been introduced following extensive consultation over the past year.  Additional posts will be provided in the current year.  This year, the south east will receive a proportion of the 120 additional posts to which I referred because the programme is ready to proceed.  While we have not yet settled on an exact number, Waterford will receive additional posts in the current year.  We are working jointly with the Department of Education and Skills and making progress across the disability and primary care areas.</p> <p>  One of the challenges, particularly in the area of disability, has been the tendency among special schools or classes which have access to services to hold the service for the children to whom it is being provided.  This leaves others waiting for a service.  What we are trying to do in the progressing disability service is to have an agreed position, protocols and so forth across schools and the health, primary care and disability services.  Children will then be referred on an agreed basis and will receive a service on the basis of need, rather than having to depend on the service available to their school.  A proper referral pathway will be provided.  This service will require additional resources.  It is a positive development that 80 posts were provided in 2014.  Waterford and the south east will secure some of the 120 additional posts to be created this year.</p></speech>

Based on information we have received by text, as it were, we believe the Senator's understanding of the matter to be incorrect.  We are currently replacing vacant nurse posts in that region and the current number of nurses is the same as last year.  Increased throughput in our national recruitment service means the time required to replace such posts has been reduced.  We will provide the Senator with a written response as the information I have provided is based on a response to a brief inquiry we made.</p> <p>  My understanding is that it is now the norm to provide non-consultant hospital doctors with contracts of 12 months' duration.

Deputy Creighton is correct that information entered the public domain indicating that four health professionals are subject to referral to their respective health regulators.  In my opening remarks, I also made reference to the commencement or initiation of formal investigations in accordance with the HSE disciplinary procedure.  This will examine two distinct issues, the first of which is what could be broadly described as the administrative side of the process, namely, the escalation of issues and the response thereto.  The second relates to issues of care, which will be pursued in accordance with the disciplinary process.

The acute sector experienced particular pressures in January and February - these continue to some extent - versus objectives around cost containment which would have seen us converting more agency cost into permanent cost.  This pressure coincided with the time when we needed to retain a degree of agency employment to cope with particular demand.  In the social care sector, costs are being generated by regulatory compliance, although they are not exclusively in that area.  At this stage in the year, it is too early for me to speculate as to where we will land later in the year.  However, we will do so in due course.</p> <p>  Outside of these factors, there are pressures in demand-led schemes.  Although the economic recovery is leading to some reduction in the numbers of people needing ordinary medical cards, the number of discretionary medical cards has increased and the costs of drugs and so forth are an ongoing pressure.  It is far from being a challenge-free year financially and in fact this year will be very difficult for the health service financially.</p></speech>

It is a privilege.  In my opening remarks I will draw the committee's attention to the process by which Ireland generally ratifies UN human rights treaties, with reference to some of the core treaties Ireland has ratified over the years, and what we can learn from this process as we move forward to prepare to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.</p> <p>  It is important to outline the legal status of UN treaty ratification for Ireland.  When Ireland signs a human rights treaty at the UN, it does not agree to be bound by that treaty, but is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty, according to the Vienna Convention.  According to the same convention, states are deemed to have ratified a treaty when the state&rsquo;s representative deposits the instruments of ratification with the UN.  Many UN human rights conventions also have an associated optional protocol, which usually facilitates individual rights holders from states parties to make complaints directly to the UN if they feel their human rights under the particular convention have been violated by the state.</p> <p>  All states, including Ireland, are free to determine their own internal process to prepare for the ratification of a UN treaty or optional protocol.  In Ireland, generally the procedure when signing or ratifying a UN treaty is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade brings a proposal to Government.  The Minister and the Government will often seek legal advice from the Attorney General on whether there is any legal or constitutional impediment to ratification.</p> <p>  While it is the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring forward a proposal for ratification, individual Departments can request the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to expedite this process.  This approach has been taken successfully to a number of treaties, for example, with regard to Ireland's ratification of the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  In that case, in 2000 the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform requested the advice of the Attorney General and was satisfied that no legal or constitutional impediment existed to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of this protocol.</p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality requested that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade expedite the process to ratify the optional protocol and ratification occurred the same year, 2000.</p><p> Once the proposal for ratification has been approved by the Minister and by the Government, Ireland's representatives at the UN can then deposit the necessary instruments of ratification.  Following ratification, Article 29.5 of the Constitution provides that every international agreement to which the State becomes a party, should be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In effect, the Parliament is only involved in the process once the Executive - the Minister and the Government - has decided that a treaty will be ratified.  It is the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure all international agreements to which the State is a party are laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann promptly.  This has been expedited in recent years.  Since 2004, the target is for all international agreements which have entered into force for Ireland in a given calendar year to be laid before the D&aacute;il no later than the end of the following calendar year.</p><p> From the process I have outlined, it is clear that the Oireachtas does not play a significant role in determining whether Ireland should ratify any particular international agreement and there is only an opportunity for parliamentary debate on the matter once the Government has already made the decision to ratify.  The Council of Europe has developed an Assembly Resolution 1823 (2011) which states that national parliaments should play a greater role in the implementation of international human rights norms at national level and that this can be done, for example, through their involvement in the ratification of international human rights treaties.</p><p> In the past, Ireland has tended to sign many UN human rights treaties shortly after their adoption, but in most cases Ireland has not speedily ratified these conventions.  For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, were adopted by the UN in 1966, signed by Ireland in 1973 but not ratified until 1990.  The Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was also adopted by the UN in 1966 and signed by Ireland in 1968 but not ratified until 2001.  I could list many other examples but it is important to note that Ireland has improved its timeframe for ratification of UN conventions in recent years, in particular, between 1990 and 2002, when Ireland ratified the majority of the UN conventions.  This might be attributed to a growing awareness of human rights in Ireland during that timeframe with Ireland's incorporation into domestic law of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Therefore, while it took Ireland longer to ratify some of the older UN human rights conventions from the 1960s and 1970s, the current climate of human rights awareness in Ireland means that ratification of newer UN human rights conventions should be smoother and also speedier.  A good example is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which was adopted by the UN in 1989 and ratified by Ireland in 1992.  The entire process, from the UN concluding that convention to Ireland's ratification, took a mere three years.</p><p> While it is up to each individual state to determine when it is ready to ratify a particular human rights convention, Ireland has taken the approach that it does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary, as stated by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in the D&aacute;il in 2014 in response to questions as to when Ireland might ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  However, the determination of whether Ireland is in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty, tends to vary.  For example, when Ireland ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1986, rape within marriage was not prohibited by the criminal law.  In my view, Ireland was not at that time in a position to comply with the convention's provisions on ensuring women had full reproductive autonomy.  Nevertheless, Ireland ratified the convention without any reservations on these issues.  Similarly, Ireland ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child long before the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution which now explicitly recognises the rights of the child.</p><p> According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the requisite standard for states to be in a position to ratify human rights treaties is not that the state is compliant with all the provisions of the convention, which is a very ambitious and perhaps unattainable standard, but rather that the state&rsquo;s laws are in conformity with the object and purpose of the convention.  This approach recognises that the process of achieving full compliance with a convention&rsquo;s provisions takes time and that states can benefit from the guidance of UN treaty bodies and from dialogue with other states in order to achieve this goal.  Without ratification, states are not required to report to the UN treaty bodies for those conventions and therefore do not get feedback on their progress and neither do they have opportunities to be formally involved in conferences of states parties to a particular convention, where they might be able to share their experiences with other states and exchange examples of good practice.</p><p> With specific reference to the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has recommended that states considering ratification should review national legislation and policies for compliance with the convention.  The office also clarifies that any pre-ratification review should be part of a process that continues in the implementation phase to review existing and proposed legislation.  From these statements it seems clear that the expectation by the UN is that not all issues of compliance will be resolved prior to ratification but that the process of ensuring compliance is an ongoing one to carry on into the implementation phase.  The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights strongly urges states to engage in a meaningful consultation process to prepare for ratification and that those processes should involve parliaments as well as non-governmental stakeholders and in particular, in this context, the representative organisations of persons with disabilities.  The UN also recommends states should publicly launch the process of ratification, make publicly available a plan that includes timelines and opportunities for consultation, and invite civil society and organisations of persons with disabilities to make submissions presenting their views on the opportunities, implications and challenges of ratification.  To date, responses to parliamentary questions on Ireland&rsquo;s preparations to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, have been made by both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, disability, mental health and older people.  The Ministers in their responses have generally referred to the fact that Ireland does not ratify conventions until it is sure that it is in a position to comply.  It has also referenced the fact there are various Departments working on issues to determine whether any actions are required to address the issues in advance of ratification.  An interdepartmental committee is working on these issues.  Each Department has been identifying areas of concern prior to ratification.  In the answers to parliamentary questions provided by Ministers to date, the only key legal reform being discussed explicitly is the idea of an acting capacity legislation.  We are aware that the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will be considering the Committee Stage of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill shortly.</p><p> Last April the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has made available some information on the work of this interdepartmental committee and identified some further areas of reform beyond the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill which, in its view, may need to be addressed prior to ratification.  Those areas include sexual offences legislation, mental health legislation and various miscellaneous amendments, including a constitutional issue around the definition of "reasonable accommodation" contained in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has committed to publishing a roadmap to ratification once all Departments with responsibility in these areas have reverted to the interdepartmental working committee with information on how they will progress actions required under their remits to enable ratification and once the Government has approved the actions to be taken.</p><p> In light of the lessons from Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of previous UN human rights treaties, I could make a number of suggestions for how the ratification process for the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other new conventions that might emerge from the UN can be strengthened in Ireland.  It would be crucial to strengthen the role of the Oireachtas in providing input and feedback on the proposed roadmap to ratification.  Many other countries in their processes of ratifying this convention have demonstrated how the involvement of parliamentarians in providing input and feedback on the ratification challenges has strengthened the implementation of the convention post-ratification.  It is also vital to engage in a meaningful participatory process with civil society to debate the issues for ratification.  This should include the national human rights institution which is the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and especially the representative organisations of people with disabilities.</p><p>A clear plan of action for eliminating remaining obstacles to ratification should be published, along with an agreed timeframe for completion of these actions.  There are many allies in the Government, Oireachtas and civil society who are more than happy to work together to find solutions to the remaining obstacles to the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but there is a need for transparency and accountability to be increased to move this work forward.</p></speech>

It was very helpful to the sub-committee in its consideration.  Dr. Flynn pointed out that the role of the Oireachtas is crucial and that other countries have demonstrated how parliaments can engage in the ratification process to strengthen it and so forth.  What sorts of examples does Dr. Flynn have of practices in other countries where parliaments have done this work?  How can we assist here in this regard?  Dr. Flynn stated the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is committed to publishing a roadmap for ratification.  Should we await the publication of the roadmap before we take on hearings with civil society stakeholders, for example?  Alternatively, should we begin to engage now in advance of publication?  What would be the most effective way for this sub-committee to engage?  Has Dr. Flynn any lessons for us from other countries?  I hope those questions are not too difficult.</p></speech>

I suppose the best examples are from civil law countries where parliaments are usually formally involved in the ratification process because of their different legal systems.  For example, in Spain, Hungary, Croatia and many other countries, the parliament actually debated whether the convention should be ratified.  It is not a decision of the Executive in those countries but a decision of the Legislature.  That is due to the different legal systems so there is not much that can be done about that.  In New Zealand and Australia, for example, the parliaments were involved, although not formally, in making the decision on whether those countries should ratify.  Joint parliamentary committees held hearings, received submissions from people with disabilities and their representative organisations and debated the merits of speedy ratification in those two countries.  They were both in favour of ratifying quite quickly to show leadership in that area.</p> <p>  With regard to what could be done here, I certainly do not believe there is any disadvantage to beginning now to open discussion on these issues.  I know from dialogue with many organisations representing people with disabilities that there is increasing frustration over the fact that the process of determining the obstacles to ratification is not one into which they can be seen to have an input.  While they might have some solutions or suggestions on how we can overcome the reasonable accommodation question, there is simply no forum for them in which to present their views, apart from making submissions privately to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Justice and Equality or wherever else these issues are being debated.  However, they are not formally involved in the work of the interdepartmental committee in respect of each of the Departments that is reviewing legislation and policy under the convention.</p> <p>  Another step that could be taken would be to better integrate the work that is ongoing on monitoring Ireland's national disability strategy and to join that work up with that of the interdepartmental working committee on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Right now, there are two separate processes although they involve many of the same actors.  However, civil society has the opportunity to have a formal input into the disability strategy monitoring process whereas, to date, it has not had the opportunity to have a formal input into questions on whether Ireland should ratify the convention.</p></speech>

However, that does not really address the reasonableness criterion associated with the concept of reasonable accommodation, so in my view, it does not constitute an attack on the right to private property because one is not required to accommodate a person as one's employee in all circumstances.  Consider the circumstances of an employer who runs a very small business where an employee needs some very sophisticated type of technology or complete revamp of the office space that is not feasible.  It was never intended to apply to this.  In that case, the Supreme Court rejected the standard that had been suggested in the employment equality legislation regarding reasonable accommodation.  The definition included the criterion that one had to reasonably accommodate a person unless doing so represented a disproportionate or undue burden.  In response, when the Parliament legislated again, it came up with the much less stringent criterion whereby one had to reasonably accommodate a person with a disability unless it cost more than a nominal cost.  Most costs are higher than a nominal cost.</p> <p>  However, since that time, of course, the EU has legislated on this with its framework directive on employment.  The EU has reimposed the standard of the disproportionate or undue burden.  Notwithstanding the Supreme Court's decision, Ireland has changed its laws to reflect the EU position.  However, that applies only to employment, of course, and not to goods and services.  In the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the standard of reasonable accommodation is the same.  It is a matter of a disproportionate or undue burden, regardless of whether one is an employer or a provider of goods and services.  The concern is that we could have a constitutional barrier.  Does it require an amendment to the Constitution for Ireland to be able to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?  I hope it does not because that would delay the ratification process quite significantly.  Perhaps we would not be in a position to ratify at the end of that process.</p></speech>

However, we have always felt that it is best to examine this issue in the context of a concrete example.  That is why this process is so helpful.</p> <p>  Dr. Flynn initially presented us with guidance, both from the Council of Europe and the United Nations, on how countries might go about ratification.  It was suggested parliaments could be, or ought to be, involved in the process.  The OHCHR requirement is not necessarily that the state be compliant with all the provisions but that it be able to demonstrate it is in conformity with the object and purpose of the convention.  Dr. Flynn presented us with the Council of Europe and UN standards or guidelines for going through the ratification process.  I presume our Government is influenced by these.  Has this ever been examined publicly in any way, or has there been any explication of how we actually go through the process of ratifying a treaty, apart from the convention about which Dr. Flynn is speaking?</p></speech>

Those questions are still being asked not only in respect of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but on the optional protocol to the convention against torture and other issues.  Those questions are still coming up but the same approach has been taken in the responses, which is that it is the decision of the Executive, that the Government agrees that it is important to ratify human rights conventions but it takes the position that it should not do it too lightly and so on.  I did not find there was any great exploration of the issues but perhaps I am not aware of that and there were more extensive public consultations on UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  Certainly it is not easy to find information about that in the public sphere.</p></speech>

That was probably always the approach but various Ministers in successive Governments at different times interpreted whether we were in a position to comply differently.  I do not believe anyone would have suggested that in 1986 there were no issues about discrimination against women in Ireland.  It is not that we were perfect.  With respect to human rights conventions, it is not expected that states will have reached a point where there are no issues for compliance.  There are always emerging issues that states must address.  It is more a question of a subjective value judgment as to whether we are compliant or ready to ratify a convention but for this specific convention, a very strict approach has been taken to that, which perhaps was not always the approach taken with previous conventions.</p></speech>

That sets off alarm bells for me, as I sure it does for people who have been active in the sector, as to what ultimately it means and what must be done to ratify the convention.  In light of what is happening in this process, one would wonder when it would come to an end.  Does Dr. Flynn understand it to be a dual process with the roadmap being one element and identifying key issues that have to be addressed being another element?  It is a twin-track process in which the committee is involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-14a.2682" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JU22015051400002#D00700"><p>To take the Senator's second question first, they are still identifying the areas but once they have identified all the areas and got agreement from Government that those are the areas where action is required, those areas become the roadmap.  That is my understanding of the process.  We now have more detail and the discussion about reasonable accommodation was in background for a long time but now it is explicitly named as one of the issues.</p> <p>  In terms of the other main issues they have identified, which are sexual offences legislation and mental health law, I would be reasonably confident about what they mean with regard to what needs to be done there.  Work has been done on this area, and the Senator produced a Private Members' Bill on the reform of sexual offences legislation.  There is a sense that our current sexual offences legislation discriminates against certain people with disabilities and that needs to be addressed.  I am speaking in regard to section 5 of the 1993 Act which makes it an offence for a person to have sexual intercourse with a person with a mental impairment.  That is an issue and consent is not a defence to that offence, as we know, which is problematic.</p> <p>  In terms of mental health law, the UN convention requires that disability should never be a justification for a deprivation of liberty.  For example, the fact that a person can be involuntarily detained and treated against one's will without one's consent under Ireland's Mental Health Act would be viewed, certainly by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as a problem with respect to article 14 of the convention.  That is certainly an issue and perhaps that is what it means when it states that mental health law is in need of reform.  However, those kinds of reforms take time and our experience with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill has shown how long that process had taken and it is still not concluded but it is important to get it right.  We would want to reform those areas of law.  The question is whether the issues are of such significance that they require reform now prior to ratification, or whether they are issues that could be addressed post-ratification in the implementation of the convention.  That is a judgment call and it is the Executive's role to make it but it would be valuable to inform that view with the experiences and voices of people with disabilities.</p></speech>

That is the position, as Dr. Flynn has clearly laid out.  She pointed out that the impact of the lack of ratification means we are not in a process of being monitored or supported by an international body that would examine how we are meeting our obligations under the treaty.  That is a key impact of the lack of ratification.  Dr. Flynn's response to those various issues demonstrates the importance of ultimately being much clearer and perhaps even having a policy or an overall roadmap of how we would go about ratifying conventions.  It seems the process could take for ever, depending on the judgment calls along the way.</p> <p>  It also strikes me, and Dr. Flynn will be aware of this, that, more generally, the rationale for the setting up of the sub-committee was to find a way to begin to have Oireachtas involvement and oversight of human rights issues, and this is a key one for us, but we are doing it within the context of the mandate of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  It further strikes me that in this regard the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is the Department that has overall responsibility for ratification but it may be useful, as we examine how to proceed and move forward on this, that if the issue concerns a treaty related to the mandate of a particular committee that it could be involved with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in that process of ratification and the roadmap.</p> <p>  Senator Bacik already asked about comparative jurisdictions.  It would help us to examine that in more detail in terms of how other jurisdictions that are aligned to our process have gone through ratification of treaties, even, for example, the treaty on people with disabilities.  Does Dr. Flynn have any suggestions, which she can indicate now or later, as to who we might contact to help us with that?  Could she also suggest how the committee might proceed with the issue we are discussing?</p></speech>

I believe the report was published in 2009 which was quite early in the process of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but none the less at that point they were able to point to a number of different approaches.  They sent survey questions to all the countries that had ratified at that point asking them about their process, what they found beneficial and how they went about it.  In that process also many of those countries, including Australia and New Zealand, produced national interest analysis of the impact of the convention on national law and also its financial impact and the impact it might have on the lives of people with disabilities.  That is quite a good exercise and one in which the Oireachtas and this sub-committee could play a role.  The Senator's suggestion of involving the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or this sub-committee in working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in whatever process it engages in would be a valuable one and that would reflect approaches that have been taken in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

Perhaps some type of similar system could be set up, either under the auspices of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p><p>That would enable all members of the Oireachtas, including members of civil society, to contribute and have a full debate because there will be members of both Houses who will not have an opportunity to give their input.  Perhaps we could look at setting something up and sending a report to the Taoiseach about it.  That could be useful.</p></speech>
