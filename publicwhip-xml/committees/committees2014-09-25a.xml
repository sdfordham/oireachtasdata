Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.  On matters arising from the minutes, on the issue raised by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald about the use by subcontractors of workers in the black economy, at our last meeting we asked the Clerk to engage in a scoping exercise.  I ask him to brief us on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014092500003#B00300"><p>I started with those involved in the school building programme in the Department of Education and Skills.  I spoke to them and provided a note for committee members yesterday evening.  It lists some of the controls that have been put in place, including requiring declaration of a tax free certificate.  They also have a company carrying out random audits which refers any case of malpractice to the appropriate authorities - Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  There is a problem in the school building sector owing to the fact that registered employment agreements can no longer be enforced.  This is causing difficulty because some are only paying minimum wage which may contribute to bringing other issues back into the system.</p><p>  I propose that, in order to have a meeting on the issue, we seek a detailed note from each Department, including the Department of Social Protection, Revenue, the NRA and NERA and then bring in all of these groups for a meeting with the committee which would focus on the black economy in regard to public sector contracts.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014092500003#B00900"><p>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014092500003#B01000"><p>What has been outlined by the Department of Education and Skills demonstrates that it has a reasonably thorough monitoring process in place.  It has taken various steps to deal with the issue by requiring a tax clearance certificate, declarations of compliance and having an online complaints system, etc.  What we need is information on the outputs of that process.  However, we need to do the same with all of the Departments involved, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which is in the business of procuring contracts for house building.  What we should be concerned with is the procurement system for contracts and the monitoring of the employment and social welfare systems because we regularly hear about irregularities in the manner in which contracting and subcontracting takes place.  The issue of subcontracts may well be part of the main problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014092500003#B01100"><p>As this is mainly a social welfare issue, if officials of the Department of Social Protection are to come before the committee, they must provide information on certain matters.  The Department must inform us of how many fraud investigators it has on its books who are carrying out inspections, particularly in the construction sector.  Fraud within the social welfare system is something ordinary people want to have investigated.  We want people to receive their social welfare entitlements, but fraud also needs to be stamped out.  Therefore, in looking at this issue, the Department needs to provide us with a comprehensive, overall view of the position and indicate the number of fraud officers it has.</p></speech>

We need to take a specific period and ask for the information from all Departments who were involved in public sector contracts.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014092500004#C00300"><p>Yes.  We will proceed.  I proceed to correspondence received since our meeting on 18 September 2014.  3B.1, correspondence, dated 3 September 2014, from the Acting Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding reply to query on outsourcing of speed cameras, to be noted and a copy forwarded to Deputy Niall Collins who worked with the committee on that issue.</p><p>  3B.2, correspondence, dated 23 July 2014 from Mr. Gerry Naughton regarding Ward of Court Service and Revenue Commissioners, to be noted.  Both the Revenue Commissioners and the High Court are unlikely to deal with the Committee of Public Accounts on individual  cases.  However, the issues raised by Mr. Naughton point to systemic failures on the part of both the Wards of Court and the Revenue.  The matter to be referred to both the Courts Service and Revenue to follow up as appropriate and also to send the committee a note on the issues involved.  The committee will examine the issue of the protection of Wards of Court when the Court Service is before us in November.</p><p>  3B.3, correspondence, dated 13 September 2014 from Eleanor Leahy re issues with the HSE, to be noted.  We will have to get more details from Ms Leahy in order to follow up on the matter with the HSE.  I ask the clerk to contact her and obtain the documentation of which she speaks. </p><p>  3B.4, correspondence, dated 17 September 2014 from the HSE re St. Michael's House, to be noted.  3B.5, correspondence, received from various sources re Tipperary Hostel Project, to be noted.  We can defer this to next week so that the clerk can prepare a note on the issues relating to State expenditure at this Tipperary hostel.  This is an issue we have raised with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  There is a serious issue here as taxpayers' money, in excess of &euro;4 million, was spent on the refurbishment of that building, one part of which lies unfinished while the other part is finished but going into a state of disrepair.  It is a waste of money in terms of doing the work and then leaving it.  The clerk will follow it up.  There is a need for a more constructive response from the Departments involved in order to get to the end of the problem.  We have to continue to remind them of this.  I ask the clerk to get the note. </p></speech>

We can return to it when we get that response.</p><p>  3B.7, correspondence, received from Mr. William Treacy regarding ongoing issues with Horse Racing Ireland, to be noted.  3B.8, correspondence, dated 18 September 2014 from Mr. Tom Moran, Secretary General at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, regarding Charles Farrell, to be noted and a copy forwarded to Mr. Farrell.  Last week I asked the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for a reply on a long outstanding issue relative to the Fleury case.  I understand that matter was before the courts.  After 160 summonses over a period of ten years, and I am sure substantial legal costs, the matter, so far as I am aware, is not being pursued by the Department.  In other words, the case has ended.  I think we should get an idea of the costs involved in this and in the other cases that were mentioned. </p><p>  I refer to the letter re Charles Farrell which is an ongoing issue.  We have asked for the papers relating to that case but we have not got them in full.</p></speech>

It was an issue at the time it was being purchased.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did a report on it probably in 2004 or 2005.  I can ask the Comptroller and Auditor General the position on it and we can get a note from the accounting officer in the Department of Justice and Equality as to where lies the current costs and the current position.  I presume it is lying idle in State ownership in north County Dublin.</p></speech>

We need to take some legal advice.  Can we agree the agenda for Thursday, 2 October which is the accounts of the Irish Sports Council?  Agreed.  Today we have to examine the three draft reports, one of which is on penalty points.  We said at the last meeting that we would wait for the report on the current issues from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but apparently it will not be available for some time.  It is proposed to conclude our work on that issue.  We can return to it by way of our normal work with the Accounting Officer at a future date.</p><p>  The second issue is the medical card review while the third relates to a number of issues: WIT, a particular land swap, the State Pathology Office and payments to the director of the National Gallery.  If Members have anything further to add to the findings and recommendations on any of those reports they may do so now.  I ask the clerk to go through those.</p></speech>

Our report is dealing with a number of these issues, such as lost tickets which accounts for 2%.  The key point in the report is that 70% of fixed charges are paid by people when they get the notice in the post.  Mr. O'Brien, the former superintendent, who gave evidence to the committee said the system is excellent when it comes to dealing with people who pay their fixed charges.  The issue of leaking arises in the 28% of fines that are not paid and is causing significant difficulties.</p><p>  Let us turn to the findings and recommendations.  Findings 2 to 5 deal with data entry on the system.  We are looking to review the system whereby if somebody is stopped on the side of the road, that the Garda who is taking the details has the details on a touch screen and should be able to link in to the driver's identity file that is kept in the RSA.  That would get rid of a great many problems where somebody detects and takes note of a car that is driving at speed and there is a problem that goes back into the system and is not followed up because it becomes statute barred.</p><p>  Second, difficulties have arisen for a long time with drivers of company cars.  I know there will be a change in the law.  One of the issues that came up at our meetings was the photographic evidence which can be used for people who drive company cars and this should be used.</p><p>  The third issue is the non-serving of court summonses, where approximately 50% of summonses are not served.  I know the law has changed but we propose that the summons should be served by registered post, where the onus is on the driver to prove that the summons was not delivered.  The point we are making in the report is that the majority tax their cars online and there is never a problem with the tax disc coming by post.  There should not be problem with this either.</p><p>  The fourth issue relates to the driver who is not present when his or her fine is before the court, which is the situation in the majority of cases, and his or her licence is not being endorsed with the penalty points.  The issue is to capture the driver's licence at an early stage of the process and use the driver's licence number as the unique identifier and the national vehicle and driver's file can be updated almost automatically.</p><p>  The next part deals with the cancellation of penalty points by senior garda&iacute;.  We have seen from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report the problems that existed in that area.  There was no evidence to back up a case.  Superintendents were cancelling fines outside their area.  I know that the procedures have been tightened up by the centralisation of the cancellation process.  We are raising a number of things, such as an annual audit of the process and a report by the fixed charge processing office.  That should deal with the issues in this part.</p><p>  The third area which we looked at was the way complaints are handled and investigated subsequently by the force.  The issue is that the confidential recipient process did not appear to work in the case of Sergeant McCabe and there was never a review.  The final issue is that when a complain is made is there a system capable of adjudicating on it so that the system is independent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014092500005#D00500"><p>As the clerk has indicated, the system operates efficiently and effectively for 70% of cases but in the remaining 30% half of the summonses are not served properly and there is no endorsement on two thirds of the offenders who come before the courts.  That is incredibly ineffective.  I hope that the consolidation and centralisation of the system to which the clerk referred will deal with the problem.  It would require a degree of monitoring and auditing to ensure that it takes place in the short term.</p><p>  I am concerned about vehicles that cross the Border.  The cars may be stopped and intercepted in the Republic but they are under the jurisdiction of the other area.  To what extent can we assess the loss to the Exchequer in respect of cases that are registered in another jurisdiction?  Are there proposals to close that loophole because it is a two way process in regard to the island of Ireland but also in respect of the neighbouring island.</p><p>  I am also concerned about the criticism in regard to the whistleblowers.  The report was very good on the ineffective confidential recipient system.  It was certainly not effective in the case of Sergeant McCabe.  Has the committee made a suggestion on an alternative mechanism for internal complaints to be investigated?  It would seem that GSOC would be the external independent body that should deal with internal complaints.  This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed in the report.  There should be recommendations on this issue.</p><p>  My final point relates to the GoSafe cameras and the GoSafe contracts, which is separate from the Garda in the sense that it is operated by a private company and accounts for 22% of the camera intercepts, which is quite substantial.  The 6.3% rate of cancellation of fines requires attention.  Is it done internally by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the private sector system?  It seems strange that one of the highest rates of cancellations would be in the private sector, GoSafe cameras.  It is not operating effectively, considering that &euro;15.6 million is spent on the system and the return is only &euro;4.6 million, with a loss of &euro;11 million.  As the report states, that &euro;11 million on an annual basis would have been sufficient to refurbish the entire fleet of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and make them more effective and efficient.</p><p>  The future of the GoSafe cameras must be given very serious consideration.  We should be coming up with a recommendation as to whether that should be dealt with on a different basis because it is one of the most expensive mechanisms of dealing with the issue.  It claims that there is 89% to 99% compliance effectiveness where the cameras operate, yet the number of road fatalities has been increasing alarmingly in recent years.</p> <p>There is a certain degree of contradiction that requires further investigation.</p></speech>

For example, we have not touched on the issue of cross-Border offences because it was not included in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and did not come up in the course of the hearings.  The issue of the GoSafe cameras did arise and we have made recommendations there in respect of the contract itself, how it is working and is operated and so on.  All we can do is recommend to the Minister that the recommendations be taken on board for future consideration of that system.  We will look again at the recommendations and findings and determine whether we can tighten up on some of them.</p></speech>

I refer to the comment, I believe it is on page 9, where the committee states it has no problem with the principle of discretion being given to garda&iacute;.  That is glossing over the problem somewhat.  While I understand the reasons for it to be there, the entire problem members are addressing here is a problem of discretion.  Moreover, it is a problem of abuse of discretion and to state the principle is fine but that it is just being abused in 9,400 cases or whatever it is, ducks the issue somewhat.  In view of what happened in this case, I have real problems, as I believe do many others, with the issue of giving garda&iacute; discretion.  It is a fundamental difficulty to which members have not faced up.  The committee must face up to the fact that there was abuse of discretion in so many cases.  The report quite rightly refers to garda&iacute; being vulnerable to the accusation of squaring charges but they obviously used discretion wrongly in more than 9,000 cases.  They pleaded they were on duty when they were not and members should not duck this issue but should ask why they are abusing this discretion.  Moreover, members should ask the radical question as to whether they should be given discretion.  If so many of them are abusing it, why should they have it?</p><p>  The second point I wish to make is there appears to be a reluctance to comment on all the other reports that are going on at present.  I refer specifically to the O'Mahoney report as in my view, what happened in that report is highly questionable.  There is a reluctance to comment on the findings of the O'Mahoney report.  It is questionable because it was soft on the Garda and did not have the same findings as did other reports.  It looks as though the committee should be utterly critical of the principle of an internal report and the Garda should never again be allowed to undertake an internal report.</p><p>  The second one is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, inquiry that is under way at present.  Is there any reason the committee should be mealy-mouthed about its own findings or opinion as to what happened there, where its report overlaps with that inquiry?  I consider these to be substantial points and perhaps I would be better putting them in a memorandum.  I will do this, if the Chairman wishes, for next Tuesday.  However, the committee should face up to this and while the detail here is very well researched, for which I thank the Clerk, I believe this substantial points are ducked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014092500006#E00600"><p>If I might make one point to Deputy Ross on the use of discretion, when the Commissioner appeared before the committee and we had a discussion, at that stage we were talking about discretion on the part of a garda on the side of the road.  For example, if he or she stopped the Deputy to tell him he was driving at 62 km/h and he agreed he was, a garda at that stage would use discretion by not issuing a ticket.  That is the discretion to which I was referring, not the subsequent discretion in respect of a system that is in place whereby a superintendent can cancel a point.  As far as I can see, the problem is that sometimes, they have cancelled the point where the garda already had not used discretion and had issued a ticket.  In such a case, a garda had stopped one for speeding and while one stated one had an excuse, the garda replied that he or she was obliged to give one a ticket and a caution but the ticket in question was cancelled subsequently.  The garda already had used discretion at that stage and I think this is where the fundamental problem lay with discretion.</p><p>  The other problem with discretion was that if penalty points and a fine were cancelled on the PULSE system, there should be an audit in place.  For example, if one petitions somebody to state one was on the way to hospital in an emergency and shows the emergency card, that person would agree this fits the policy and that is fine.  However, this was not in place.  Similarly, somebody might state he or she is a garda who was on duty and was apprehending someone.  In such a case, there is an outcome of a crime that can be backed up somewhere else.  This is the kind of environment in which we in fact were not operating.</p><p>  As for the use of discretion, what the committee was saying, and what I was reflecting, was where a garda stops somebody on the side of the road and decides whether to issue a ticket.  That is discretion that is used by all police forces and probably entails garda&iacute; using common sense on the side of the road.  That is the only discretion to which I was referring and the committee had no difficulty with it.</p></speech>

The initial discretion to which the clerk referring, in which a garda stops somebody on the side of the road, is obviously also open to abuse.  While I take the clerk's point about the distinction, because of the findings we have about it further down the line, members must ask the question about what is happening there as well.  It is clearly open to huge abuse.  If the garda&iacute; stop people to tell them they are driving at 60 km/h but then let them go on, they should answer questions about that.  While I have often heard the point that this is practised overseas, that is no reason for it to be a good thing.  It is clear this also is open to abuse and I am questioning whether, because of the committee's findings here, as well as other findings about the practices of the Garda, we should question the right of garda&iacute; to exercise that sort of powerful discretion, which will be and has been abused as well.</p></speech>

The committee must be careful in its own report to stay within the remit of the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts, which is how the system might have led to a loss of revenue to the State.  This is what members have done all along and consequently, I do not believe they should stray away from that unnecessarily at this point.</p><p>  While the issue of discretion is an interesting and important debate, again I question whether it is one for the Committee of Public Accounts, because the committee must work based on evidence.  Members have examined the use of discretion at the latter end of the process and systems are being changed to correct that, in order that there no longer is the same discretion as there was, where it had been shown there had been a loss of revenue to the State.  Members cannot know about discretion at the front end, that is, at the beginning of the process.  Members cannot make judgments about figures and they cannot possibly know how many garda&iacute; might be abusing discretion in such a way.  As members do not know how many, they must be very careful if they make allegations in that regard.</p><p>  The committee must also accept that garda&iacute; need to be able to exercise their own judgment and to use their common sense because that is important for the integrity of the force and for the maintenance of people's confidence in them.  They are garda&iacute; for a reason and they must be able to act as they perceive to be appropriate given the situation or the circumstances.  Members heard from Sergeant McCabe how discretion was useful and necessary for garda&iacute; at that front end.  Consequently, in changing or attempting to change the report, I would be wary lest the Committee of Public Accounts strays beyond what is its role.  Members should keep in mind what they have heard and learnt to date in the many hearings they have held.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Ross that the day of internal reports or secret reports or reports that are kept secret is over.  Any reports that are conducted privately and produced on this kind of matter, as well as on the loss of revenue to the State, should be publicised.</p> <p>There is an issue in respect of the McCabe report and the evidence we heard at our hearings on the whistleblowers afterwards.  It could be glossed over, but the fact of the matter, in respect of our report, is that the force did not listen to Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  He was treated in a way that was just unacceptable, in particular when he was attempting to do his job and point to the wrongdoing and the loss of revenue.  It took the Committee of Public Accounts to provide the platform in private for him to explain it.  I wonder how much would have been uncovered had we refused him the opportunity to be interviewed in private.  He spent a long time trying to draw attention to this issue in the force.  He raised it in many public forums and with Members of the House, but his superiors did not listen to him.  That must be questioned, not just because he gave evidence here but also because a number of other whistleblowers have come forward, of whom Una Halliday is one.  However, there are others and there is correspondence relating to them for today's meeting.  They are not being listened to.  Somebody in the system must cry "Stop" to the cover up on the issues whistleblowers have been exposing.  We have an opportunity in the report to highlight this relative to Sergeant McCabe and the need for independent reports from outside the system on which the Oireachtas could rely.  The system is simply not working.  We must take into account the fact that after all of the hearings, after everything that has been said, further reports were made to the Commissioner on the abuse of the penalty points system.  I think it happens regularly.  The report will be presented and go to the Minister.  How will it influence the changes that need to take place?  Reform needs to take place.  It is up to us, as Deputy Shane Ross said, to tell it as it is.  That has to be done.  It is about taxpayer's money, governance and how Accounting Officers of Departments manage their affairs.  I would have grave doubts about the respect shown to whistleblowers and the information they bring forward.  That must change.  We can reflect this in the report.</p></speech>

We must be realistic.  To say it is beyond or may not be within our remit is not helpful when we are trying to chase the loss of public money, as the consequences are way beyond the immediate implications.  The point about discretion is fundamental.  If members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are bent, the abuse of their powers means that they are indulging in utterly unacceptable and probably illegal activity.  If they are doing it in one place, they are liable to be doing it at the initial stages.  If we are to funk that issue, we will be doing the wrong thing.  We must be upfront and face the issue, instead of saying it is outside our remit, that we will not touch it and let us bury it.  Let us face the facts about the Garda force.  The clerk addressed the issue by constantly referring to the need for a culture change in the Garda.  I accept that, but a culture change means changing the habits of garda&iacute; who have done these things at all stages.  That means addressing the issue<i>ab initio</i>, at the very first stage.  It also means that the members of the Committee of Public Accounts should address the O'Mahoney report on Sergeant McCabe, the findings of which, after all, as the Chairman said, were very convenient for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whereas the other reports were very uncomfortable for the force.</p></speech>

Second, medical card holders with a high risk profile should be a priority for review.  Third, the HSE should examine ways of extending medical cards automatically.  Fourth, there are the control procedures.  The recommendations are clear.  If there are other matters members want to have reflected in the report, they should contact the clerk.  The findings are outlined in chapter 5 on page 15.</p></speech>

One of the things that really struck me about it - in a sense it reflects some of the worst aspects of the Civil Service - was that one would never have found the office if one did not get good directions.  There was barely a sign on the door to indicate it was an office of the HSE.  It is located behind a garage, just off the M50 as one heads into Finglas.  In a sense, it reflects a frame of mind that one tries to put as much distance between oneself and the public as possible, even though a public service is being provided.  I find this unacceptable.  I know that, as public representatives, we must make representations on medical cards, but in most cases it should not be necessary for the public to come to us; they should be able to deal directly with the HSE and with the same person once they get to talk to a person rather than being sent from one to the other.  While there have been some improvements in how the service has operated, I find the general approach unacceptable.</p></speech>

The Accounting Officer for the Department of Health outlined "the HSE uses its discretion to grant a medical card to a person who is unable without undue hardship to arrange a GP service..."  We should be careful when we are dealing with one report that we do not to an extent contradict recommendations made in another.  Unfortunately, Deputy Shane Ross has left, but he referred to the discretionary powers available to the Garda.  The appropriate body, in the case of medical cards, is the HSE which uses its discretion where normally a medical card would not be available on the grounds of cost.  If we are discussing the question of how the Garda operates in exercising discretion, whatever recommendations we make in the two reports should not vary to the extent that there would be a degree of contradiction.  Sergeant McCabe did not criticise the discretionary powers of the Garda.</p> <p>We did insert powers but not in relation to the operation of discretion in the main by garda&iacute;.  It is not appropriate to come down with a heavy-handed approach on that area and at the same time acknowledge that discretion on the part of the HSE is a very valuable instrument in terms of ensuring that people in need of medical cards receive them.  I point out the possibility that we could produce an anomaly in the manner in which introduce our reports.</p></speech>

On the medical card issue, anomalies were referred to.  It is touched upon in the report but perhaps there should be a few recommendations.</p><p>  There is an inconsistency in the way in which the over-70s are dealt with for discretionary cards compared with the under-70s.  A person over 70 who applies is either granted or not granted a card purely on income grounds, not on medical grounds.  People can appeal on income grounds, but not on medical grounds.  People who wish to apply on medical grounds have to make a completely fresh application and they lose the card before they can make that application.  Those under 70 who have a card that is up for review can appeal and hold the medical card for the duration of the review.</p><p>  The system needs to be streamlined whereby people over 70 can apply for the normal over-70s card and the discretionary card at the same time and be able to hold their card until both applications have been processed.  At the moment I am finding that the over-70s are losing their medical card and it can take a significant period of time before they get it back on discretionary grounds.</p><p>  Another small anomaly is for people over 80 years of age.  They get an extra &euro;10 a week in their social welfare and can find that they qualify for a medical card at 79 but no longer qualify at 80, when one would expect their health might deteriorate, because they are getting an extra &euro;10 a week.</p><p>  There is a need for consistency within the system.  On the over-70s card, there should be some transition measure for people turning 80.  In addition, people over 70 should be entitled to apply for a discretionary card at the same time they apply for a normal over-70s card, which is purely income-based.  Like everybody who is under 70, they should retain their card until both applications are processed.  I have no doubt the Chairman would be aware of this in practice on the ground.  It is an issue that concerns that age group.</p></speech>

We move on to the composite reports on four meeting, the first of which deals with Waterford Institute of Technology.</p></speech>

Much the report is based on the roles of the Higher Education Authority, the governing bodies and the internal audit in order that this kind of thing does not happen again.  What happened in WIT was that the major focus was on developing the university status and it lost sight of the control mechanism.  We need to ensure that does not happen again.  There are a number of recommendations on the governing bodies, the size, the need for the internal audit to review propriety spending, and the need to develop a whistleblowers' charter.  It is much the same stuff that is coming back in.  It is about making sure that this cascade of responsibility, which they referred to at the meeting, actually works because it did not work in the Waterford situation.  They did not know what was going on.  That is it in a nutshell.</p></speech>

It is similar and the same recommendations could be made for CIT.  We noted that audit and maybe we should not have noted it because a report was provided through this committee to the Department that raised serious concerns about a range of issues in CIT.  There is a problem in the whole education sector with how they are made accountable, how transparent they are and so on.  At the end of the hearing with WIT, we got our information and it was obvious what we concluded from it.  Then similar circumstances prevailed in CIT.  We have still not received the report on that from the Department of Education and Skills.  Too much time elapses between the committee hearing evidence, getting information or getting reports from anonymous sources and getting a reply from the Department.  We can learn from WIT, but we need to ask the Department for a speedy response to all the issues raised in the context of that report we received about CIT.</p><p>  We move on to the land swap.</p></speech>

What we are talking about is that where one enters a contract, one should make sure there are no doubts and have better co-ordination between Government agencies.  Again we see this a lot where public bodies end up in court and they incur costs of approximately &euro;1 million.  That should not happen.</p><p>  The other issue in this respect is better risk sharing.  At the start of the process the developer had carried a lot of the risk, but it transferred back to the State because the house prices that had to be paid in 2012 were reflective of 2006.  Those are just a few recommendations that carry across Departments about avoiding court cases and having better co-ordination.</p></speech>

When Departments are dealing with money, they must look on it as if it were their money because it is taxpayers&rsquo; money, or money paid by the taxpayer.  This needs to be clearly fixed in the mindset of the public sector in terms of how it operates.  It is operating with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  I often find this does not appear to come through.</p><p>  In the context in question, a sum of &euro;4 million was spoken about.  Many schools in my constituency are looking for &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million to construct classrooms.  The &euro;4 million would more than contribute towards this.  In isolation, each sum of money is significant but when added up they comprise a tremendous amount.  The State operates on a cashflow basis.  Therefore, if the &euro;30 million that has gone to NAMA were not in NAMA, it would be put to far more constructive use in the short term in terms of the delivery of services on the ground, which is the role of the Government.  We collect money from the citizens and taxpayers, including people who pay VAT, right across the spectrum and they are entitled to be certain their money will be spent in the most prudent manner.  That is the role of this committee.</p><p>  With this particular report, we need to put in place a structure, particularly in respect of lead authorities and proper due diligence, which is many cases is not applied.  Applying due diligence is the normal process to ensure the circumstances under discussion do not arise.  In this particular case, that of the land swap, the State or Departments were left off the hook by the establishment of NAMA, which is still resulting in a cashflow delay as money is going into NAMA and not to people on the ground.  We should be very strong on this issue.</p></speech>

That this could have happened and that someone could have made a decision knowing full well that the property would not be available for swapping for a considerable period, and knowing also that we were in a bubble in the development market and that prices were going out of control in 2006, mean a lot of questions have to be answered.  Having a lead agency and somebody responsible for any proposed future swap in the future would be highly important.  Is it also a fact that, through a fluke, more or less, NAMA has done well out of it?  Is it the case that while the original value was &euro;77 million, the houses built by the developer, thereby fulfilling his part of the deal, were sold for &euro;46 million, and the compensation amounted to only &euro;31 million, the State, by default more or less, did not end up being a loser?</p></speech>

Much of this relates to project management and one State authority being challenged before An Bord Plean&aacute;la by another State authority.  Two public authorities, Dublin City Council and the Department, used the wrong tender form, which set the project back by approximately two years.  Despite the D&aacute;il approving the Estimates for the Department in 2007 and 2008 and providing adequate money for the project, the funding was not available in 2012 and the building was knocked down.</p><p>  The key point arising from this case is that many of the Departments that become involved in building projects do not have expertise in this area.  The Department of Education and Skills is an exception as it has expertise in the area of school building projects.  For this reason, the Department of Justice and Equality should transfer responsibility for building projects to the Office of Public Works, which is the expert in handling these matters.  It is crazy to have public bodies engaging in a dispute before the courts or An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

The Department should remain involved in the process and it should be difficult to write off money.  Where it is written off, a detailed process should apply.</p></speech>

Fiona is very welcome to the committee.</p><p>  Also on behalf of the committee, I welcome the new Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy.  The Minister of State was for a time a member of this committee and served as Vice Chairman.  In my tenure as Chairman, I have seen the departure of not just one, but two vice chairmen.  To lose one is a misfortune, but to lose two is an education.  The lesson is that if one wants to get on in this world, become the Vice Chairman of this committee.  We do not have a Vice Chairman as yet as one has not been appointed.  I ask my colleagues in Fine Gael to ensure we get one as soon as possible to allow for the correct and proper functioning of the committee.  If they could bring that back, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

I know the members personally and very well.</p> <p>This is an excellent committee, which functions with a strong sense of agreement.  I wish Fiona well in her new job and thank the many members of the diplomatic corps who are here today for the support they have given during my first few weeks in office.  With regard to the position of Vice Chairman, I feel reasonably secure in this job while there is no Vice Chairman in place, but perhaps the Chairman might take the job himself if it seems to be the only way possible.  </p><p> Chairman and members, I am pleased to have this opportunity - my first - to brief the joint committee ahead of the next General Affairs Council, which takes place in Brussels Monday 29 September.  I will also take the opportunity to update the committee on the previous General Affairs Council on 23 July and the informal meeting of EU foreign affairs Ministers in Milan on 28 and 29 August.</p><p> First, I would like to say a few words about the renewal in our European Union institutions.  Since my predecessor last met with this committee, a new European Parliament has been elected, opening a new legislative cycle.  Activity was slow over the last few months and in the run-up to the European elections.  Jean-Claude Juncker was elected President of the European Commission and has since announced his intentions with regard to the membership and structure of the new Commission, which is expected to take office on 1 November.  Meanwhile, at the European Council meeting on 30 August, Donald Tusk was elected President of the European Council.  He will assume his position on 1 December.  </p><p> Phil Hogan's designation as Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development is extremely welcome.  Agriculture, as we are all aware in this country and as the committee is certainly aware, accounts for 40% of the European Union's budget.  As well as testifying to Mr. Hogan's own abilities and experience, the designation reflected Mr. Juncker's appreciation of the huge contribution that Ireland has made to EU policy generally and in particular to the CAP reform package that was implemented last year.</p><p> Interestingly, while unveiling his new team, Mr. Juncker announced several important changes to the structure of the European Commission.  Chief amongst those is the introduction of project teams led by Commission Vice Presidents.  These teams will reflect the priorities of the Juncker Commission and the strategic agenda set out at the European Council in June.  The structure is intended to bring a greater focus and a more collaborative approach to the work of the Commission.</p><p> Mr. Juncker has also announced the creation of a new post of First Vice President, which will be filled by the vastly experienced Dutch foreign Minister, Mr. Frans Timmermans.  This is a new post and he will be responsible for better regulation, inter-institutional relations, the rule of law and the charter of fundamental rights.  We were saying yesterday at our meeting that he could perhaps be described as a Chief Whip type of character for the President.  He will also play an important role in ensuring that the Commission proposals respect the principles  of proportionality and subsidiarity, which are important to us.  These and other changes announced by the President-elect will take effect when the new Commission takes office in November and their full impact will only become clear after that.  Alongside other members of the Government, I look forward to meeting the new members of the Commission and working constructively with them in the years ahead.</p><p> I will now turn to the forthcoming General Affairs Council.  One of the principal items for discussion at that is the preparation of the agenda for the next meeting of the European Council on 24 and 25 October.  The main focus of the European Council will be on climate change and energy policy; as the Chairman will be aware, the Council is now broadly known as the climate change council.  Following discussions at the June European Council, the October European Council is due to take a final decision on the new Climate and Energy Policy Framework for 2030.  Headline targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions and the share of renewable energy for energy efficiency are expected to be agreed.  The European Council will also decide on further measures aimed at enhancing Europe's energy security and on specific 2030 interconnection objectives.    </p><p>The discussion at the General Affairs Council - and also at the informal meeting of energy and environment Ministers in Milan on 6 October - will be key opportunities for member states to state their positions in the run-up to the October European Council.  In parallel, high-level meetings at official level have taken place in Brussels in recent weeks in order to identify the building blocks for agreement in October.  The aim of agreeing these targets in October is to allow the European Union to take the key leadership role in agreeing global climate change targets at the UN in next year's crunch conference in Paris.  </p><p> Ireland is committed to working with other member states, the Commission, and President Van Rompuy to find our way to the shared EU objective of ambitious climate and energy targets.  This objective was clearly articulated yesterday by the Taoiseach in New York.  The targets agreed by the EU must be on the basis of a workable consensus that is fair and affordable for all.  Therefore, a key issue for the European Council will be to decide on the issue of burden-sharing - in other words, how member states' contributions to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that do not come under the emissions trading scheme, ETS, are distributed.  We can come to that later; it is a technical difference.  Ireland is highly unusual among member states in that emissions from agriculture amount to 40% of our non-ETS emissions.  That is significantly higher than any other European Union country.  The scope for reduction in this sector is limited because Irish agriculture is already extremely carbon-efficient due to the predominantly grass-based nature of our beef and dairy production.  In fact, Ireland is a world leader in climate-change-efficient agriculture.  </p><p> We firmly believe that the European Union must develop a coherent and cost-effective approach to reconciling its goals in relation to global food security and sustainable food production on one hand and climate change mitigation and adaptation on the other.  Thanks in significant part to Ireland's consistent stressing of the importance of the agriculture issue, there is now a growing appreciation of the need within the European Union for a holistic approach to agriculture and land use.  We will continue to press for such an approach.</p><p> The agenda for the October European Council will also include economic issues, allowing Heads of State and Government to assess the current economic situation and to review measures to stimulate growth and job creation.  Recent data suggests that downside risks to growth have materialised and that economic recovery has stalled in the euro area.  There is a considerable variation in the situations in different member states, and on the positive side, a number of the periphery member states are showing signs of recovery, ourselves included.  The need for flexibility within the European Union's fiscal rules to boost potential growth is likely to be considered by European Union leaders.</p> <p> The Italian Presidency will be hosting a conference on employment on 8 October to consider how the European Union can stimulate job creation, particularly with regard to the vexatious issue of youth unemployment and how it can be addressed.  Following discussion of the agenda for the European Council, the General Affairs Council will move on to consider the implementation of the strategic agenda for the Union in times of change.  The committee will be aware that the strategic agenda, which was agreed at the June European Council, identifies five overarching priorities for the Union in the coming years.  First, stronger economies with more jobs; second, societies enabled to empower and protect; third, a secure energy and climate future; fourth, a trusted area of fundamental freedoms; and fifth, effective joint action in the world, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, is engaged in.  Discussions will focus specifically on follow-up to the first chapter of the strategic agenda, a Union of jobs, growth and competitiveness.  Ministers are expected to review initiatives undertaken in this area since the launch of the compact for growth and jobs in 2012 and examine aspects such as economic policy co-ordination, investment, employment, trade and the Internal Market.  It is then intended by the Presidency and the Council that it will consider if and how there might be scope to improve follow-up on those at national and European Union level.</p><p> The Government welcomes the unambiguous commitment in the strategic agenda to strengthening the economic recovery that is now under way throughout Europe, although it remains fragile.  We believe more can and must be done through the work of the new EU institutions to respond to the unacceptably high level of unemployment.  As the Taoiseach indicated after the June European Council, this will mean restoring normal lending conditions through a fit-for-purpose financial sector and maintaining the strong momentum on the Single Market and external trade agendas.  These will shape a regulatory environment that is more supportive of entrepreneurship and addressing investment bottlenecks more generally, including the crucial areas of transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure, which is of particular relevance to Ireland.  We are keen to ensure that we are preparing our economies for the future.</p><p> In particular, Ireland welcomes the explicit acknowledgement of the important role of the European Investment Bank within the strategic agenda.  There has already been an increase in EIB support to Ireland in recent years, and we see the potential for further development of the project pipeline in the period ahead.  This will be particularly crucial in the area of financing small and medium-sized enterprises that will create most of the new jobs that we seek to create.  This agenda item is a response to the agreement reached at the July General Affairs Council.</p><p> My commentary is a little longer than normal because it covers three Council meetings.  I hope the Chairman and committee members will indulge me in this regard.  I am covering three meetings whereas normally it would be one.  In response to the agreement reached at the July General Affairs Council, it has been decided that to more effectively discharge its duties under the Lisbon treaty the General Affairs Council will hold a monthly thematic discussion on the strategic agenda priorities.  This will be the first such thematic discussion.  I am pleased that the first discussion will be focused on the area which is clearly of most importance to Europe - that is, the area of jobs and growth.</p><p> Of lesser significance for Ireland, perhaps, but also on the agenda is the adoption of conclusions in respect of the EU strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian region.  This strategy covers eight countries, including Croatia, Greece, Italy and Slovenia from the European Union and Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia on the non-EU side.  This is the first time one of these strategic groups has involved non-EU countries.  While we are not in this group, there are several members from within the European Union, and this is the first time a strategy for a region involving EU and non-EU countries has emerged.  This is very much to be welcomed.</p><p> Under any other business, the General Affairs Council will also receive an update from the Presidency on the Friends of the Presidency group, which is meeting today.  This is an official-level working group at the initiative of the Italian Presidency.  Against the background of the strategic agenda agreed by the European Council, it will examine a range of issues linked to the functioning of the European Union system.  Ireland is represented at senior official level in the group.  Our view is that the Friends of the Presidency group must focus on identifying and agreeing practical ways in which the Council and the European Union institutions can work more effectively together.  We believe this consideration should be within existing parameters.  Now is not the time for Europe to get distracted by excessive bureaucratic decisions.</p><p> I will set out a brief update on the Europe 2020 strategy following the July meeting of the General Affairs Council.  The July meeting noted an Italian Presidency roadmap towards the Europe 2020 strategy mid-term review, scheduled for the 2015 spring European Council.  This sets out a series of important political exchanges which will take place across relevant Council formations in the coming months.  In turn, these will feed in to a summary report which the Italian Presidency will prepare for endorsement by the General Affairs Council on 16 December prior to presentation to the European Council on 18 and 19 December.</p><p> As the committee is aware, Europe 2020 is the EU strategy to support growth in a smart, sustainable and inclusive way.  This ten-year plan, which was adopted four years ago in 2010, is based around five key headline targets in the areas of employment, innovation, climate and energy, education and social inclusion.  These are translated into specific goals for each member state, and progress is monitored through the European semester.  It is clear that performance against these five areas has been rather mixed and has been overshadowed by the financial crisis.  For the EU as a whole, the climate and energy and education targets are broadly on track.  The innovation target is unlikely to be met based on current projections.  Sadly, we have seen a deterioration on the employment and social inclusion targets, as we now have fewer people at work and more people at risk of social exclusion than when the targets were set in 2010.</p><p> The Government strongly welcomes the Italian Presidency roadmap and agrees that it is now time to renew engagement with Europe's post-crisis growth strategy.  It is clear that unemployment remains unacceptably high, and we need to unlock a new wave of EU-wide investment supporting growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive.  The mid-term review will also be informed by the public consultation launched by the committee on 5 May, which will remain open until 31 October.</p><p> I was here when the Secretary General of the Commission, Catherine Day, appeared before the committee in January.  She emphasised the importance of strong stakeholder engagement and public consultation, including from national parliaments.  I commend the Chairman and the committee on the initiative it has taken in inviting public submissions to inform deliberations in this regard.  I understand the committee will also be lining up more public sessions next month and I look forward to being kept abreast of these.</p><p> The July General Affairs Council included a presentation from the Italian Presidency on its work programme.  This was very welcome, particularly in respect of its focus on jobs and growth.</p><p> On 28 August I participated in an informal meeting of Ministers with responsibility for European affairs in Milan.  This meeting was exclusively focused on institutional themes relating to the function of the Italian Presidency.  The informal meeting also discussed ideas for a radical reorganisation of Council configurations.</p> <p>However, while member states were open to looking at modifications to the existing arrangements, there was little support for the more radical ideas suggested.</p><p> I met the German Minister with responsibility for European affairs, and strengthening ties with key European partners is a priority for me.  I look forward to working with the committee in continuing to develop these relations.  I apologise for the length of my submission which covered a number of meetings.  I am very happy to take any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

We appreciate that a number of meetings have taken place.  As a former member of the committee, the Minister of State was well abreast of what was going on and his knowledge and experience shines through.  His contribution today was very impressive, if I may say so.  I have a number of questions and I will begin with the economic issues.  As the Minister of State is aware, the article 13 conference established to monitor performance of the fiscal compact will take place next Monday and Tuesday in Rome.  There will be an attendee from the committee and from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  ECB policies will be discussed and I also expect a discussion on Prime Minister Renzi's proposal that capital investment might be treated outside normal deficit procedures.  Has the Minister of State come across discussions on this?  How is the discussion evolving at European level?</p><p>  My next question is on the rule of law.  From his time as a member of the committee, the Minister of State is aware we started a number of discussions on this area.  In recent weeks and months some European countries have started to question the European model of democracy, suggesting the democratic model pursued by European countries is too liberal and that we should look at a more illiberal democratic regime.  Do we have thoughts on this?  What discussions on this are taking place at European level?</p><p>  With regard to the strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian region, I am glad to hear it covers the countries mentioned by the Minister of State.  The committee visited Bosnia-Herzegovina last year and this year it visited Albania and Montenegro.  We were very impressed with the performance of these countries and the steps being taken to improve their relations with the European Union.  The Minister of State mentioned that he met the German Minister with responsibility for European Union affairs recently.  I am aware the German government decided asylum seekers from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and former Yugoslav countries which are non-EU members will no longer be entitled to asylum because the situation in their homelands has become peaceful.  Is this view shared at European level?  Are all countries, including Ireland, moving towards this model?  I ask Minister of State to shed some light on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014092500006#F00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, and congratulate him on his appointment.  I wish him well.  I agree with the Chairman's remarks on the extremely impressive quality of his report to us, which is appreciated.  I agree with the Minister of State's remarks that an item at the top of the agenda will be to strengthen relationships with his counterparts in other countries.  It is important that we continue to build and solidify strategic relationships and areas of mutual interest.  I salute this.</p><p>  It would be inappropriate to let today pass without congratulating our Irish Commissioner-designate, Mr. Hogan, on the fact that he is Commissioner-designate for agriculture and rural development, which is a hugely important appointment for the country.  It reflects very well on his renowned abilities and enormous political experience and on the standing of the country in the European community.  It is heartening for all of us and we are very pleased.  It merits recognition on this occasion.</p><p>  With regard to the Minister of State's remarks on climate change, he is correct that it is important that Europe shows a lead and that we agree on targets and a strategy.  As the Minister of State is acutely aware, the big issue is to bring India and China on board.  We must provide moral leadership and coax and encourage.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response on this.  Money spent on innovation and research is critical.  We must accept that nuclear power must be a major part of the solution.  We must all accept the recent UN reports on climate change.  If one accepts the gravity of the situation and the imminent danger to our people, and if we believe what we are being told, when my 13 year old son is my age he will have catastrophic climatic and food conditions.  This is how imminent, graphic and serious the matter is, and with this in mind, there is no way we can resolve the issue without nuclear power being part of the solution.  There has been much development in nuclear fusion, nuclear power has become a much safer option and the waste matter is being dealt with.  What are the views of the Minister of State on this issue?  How are we looking at it?  The nuclear dimension cannot be left out if we are to resolve the problem, although perhaps it is not politically correct.  There have been big developments and innovation in the area and it must be examined.</p><p>  This country is a shockingly bad example of the not in my back yard, NIMBY, factor.  We must get over this with regard to issues such as wind turbines.  We must become much more courageous and patriotic with a greater sense of posterity.  We can no longer use the NIMBY syndrome to deny a generation already born a proper living and proper environmental conditions.  We cannot continue to block progress with affectations and fanciful objections to every development in the country.  We must bite the bullet on this, as it must be bitten throughout Europe.</p><p>  This country has huge potential for wave energy, which is an underexplored resource for dealing with climate change.  Will the Minister of State comment on this? To what degree do we have an input in the area?  Climate change is such a serious matter it merits emphasis.  We must consider the nuclear option and examine it comprehensively without inhibition.  In my view there is no avoiding it.  We must also examine the NIMBY syndrome and whatever planning changes must occur so that jumped-up individuals with affectations can no longer stop progress which will save a future generation.  This can no longer be allowed and we must stand up to it.  This country must show leadership.  We must also examine wave energy, and other energy sources such as solar, as natural ways to deal with the issue.</p><p>  The Minister of State made the point we have grassland agricultural production and that we must balance the climatic appalling vista - to use the hackneyed clich&eacute; - with feeding our people.  The Minister of State's point on grassland production was relevant and I agree with him.</p> <p>We need a holistic approach.</p><p> The second major theme of the Minister of State&rsquo;s address was the greatest moral imperative, apart from climate change, confronting the Minister of State and this and every committee of the House, namely, joblessness throughout Europe.  Would the Minister of State accept that we need stimulus packages across mainland Europe and a Keynesian solution to create jobs?  Would he agree that we need the initiative, suggested by Mr. Lorenzo, about keeping capital expenditure on infrastructural development that would lead to job creation outside normal budgetary arithmetic so that it would not be subject to the strictures of the fiscal compact, as our esteemed Chairman stated?  It is very important.  We need this measure and the stimulus.</p><p> The Minister of State&rsquo;s opening statement, report and priorities are very impressive.  He and the Government have two jobs to get done in Europe, namely, action on climate change and job creation.  Every job we create gives dignity to a person and his or her family, saves on welfare, makes more money available to those in need, and creates a better society.  I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s point about stalling, and that is why we need a stimulus package.  It is nonsense to do a bookkeeping exercise that does not have job creation at its centre.  The barometer of whether we are succeeding at European level is the number of people working and, particularly, youth unemployment, which is a travesty.  Where are we regarding the Youth Guarantee scheme and the initiative that was meant to be taken?  While it is happening to some degree, we need greater input.  I commend the Minister of State on an extraordinarily impressive start.</p></speech>

I hope I do not repeat anything he said or anything in Deputy O'Reilly&rsquo;s lengthy contribution.  I will try to furrow a new path of questions.  I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in his new job.  He gave us a lengthy report and I have some questions that do not necessarily flow with his presentation.  It is often repeated that for Europe to develop, grow and work its way out of the crisis, we must strengthen its competitiveness.  Although I read it regularly, I do not fully understand what it means.  Could the Minister of State explain it to me?  While we all understand what it means to be competitive, in which areas is Europe uncompetitive?  What are we trying to achieve by way of competitiveness?  Where are we failing to compete with other markets?  Could the Minister of State give some examples?</p><p>  On fiscal matters, I was impressed when I heard the Italian Presidency speak of flexibility in fiscal prudence, that we could possibly borrow more outside the strict constraints with a view to injecting the funds into job creation.  The Irish Government may have given some sort of tacit support to that statement.  What are the Minister of State's personal views on it?  We have come through an horrendous time here and are coming out the other end.  The performance of 17 EU countries has been monitored and worries were expressed about the French and Slovenian economies that there was a risk of non-compliance with the budgetary targets.  Are we to be reassured by anything more recent that the French are on target?  We had heard terrible things about Slovenia, that they were going to go for a bailout.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014092500007#G00400"><p>It was decided to monitor 17 EU countries and come up with country-specific recommendations.  Part of the review was to deal with the fiscal obligations under the excessive deficit procedure, and the Commission was worried by the figures from France and Slovenia that they may not be in compliance with the budgetary targets that were set.  We heard about Slovenia supposedly going for a bailout, which did not happen.  Are matters improving?  Could the Minister of State give us his views on those two countries and whether they have overcome these observations by the Commission?</p><p>  One of the key areas, which the Minister of State mentioned, is energy security.  Europe has taken a position on Russia, and rightly so.  Russia is a major supplier of energy resources for Europe.  Is the Minister of State happy that the balancing act of sanctions against Russia and the net counter-effect on Europe has been fully worked out?  Now that the Russians have refused to allow imports of European agricultural produce, there is a very worrying trend in Europe that we are hurting ourselves more than we are hurting the Russian economy.  Does the Minister of State have any views on it?</p><p>  I concur with what the Chairman said about the Adriatic and Ionian regions.  The Minister of State knows I am fanatically supportive of Albania's progress.  When we were there, we saw them breaking their hearts to comply with expected standards.  They did that and jumped a very important hurdle.  I ask that the Minister of State continue to give Albania, Montenegro and the other countries further support.</p><p>  It is great that we are on track regarding the climate, energy and educational issues.  The most significant tragedy and challenge for Europe and, by implication, Ireland is our failure to meet poverty reduction goals.  Europe is slipping in this field.  Social inclusion is a very important issue.  We hear about it in Ireland in terms of social housing, homelessness, drug addiction, street sleepers and beggars.  These are the visual symptoms of a country that has not managed its social inclusion measures properly and where poverty reduction goals are not being reached.  It is wonderful to see children celebrating their exam results and doing phenomenally well.  Access to university is at an all-time high, educational qualification standards have risen immensely, and it is wonderful.  I worry, however, that if we do not tackle the other end of the scale, much of the good work will be undone because no society can develop a proper economic, social infrastructure if it allows the growth of social alienation, disadvantage, homelessness and drug addiction to continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014092500007#G00500"><p>I will do my best, using some fancy footwork, not to repeat the three excellent contributions that have been made.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his elevation to office and wish him well.  We in this committee will do everything we can to be supportive, and even inspirational from time to time, in the important work he must do.</p> <p> I have four questions which necessitate something of a preamble.  The European institutions have learned one thing from the banking, financial and fiscal crisis that Europe has just come through, and that is the need for decisiveness.  From economic, fiscal and speculative points of view, decisiveness and the expectation of a quick and standing decision will always stabilise everything around, markets in particular.  I recall the European Central Bank president, Mr. Mario Draghi, made an intervention at a crucial time by saying that whatever needed to be done would be done.  That was a clincher.  That was not what had happened previously.  A great deal of doubtful, negative speculation had followed every crisis, along with a great deal of criticism levelled at the European Union.  The euro was supposed to be in decline or dead.  Several economies, including the Irish one, were supposed to be in decline or dead.  The European institutions were supposedly broken.  We got advice from all centres around the table in this very room, as the Chairman will recall.</p></speech>

We were told that the economic policies being pursued in this country were wrong, that they would not work, and various economists worldwide were quoted and quoted themselves regularly, all of whom were wrong.  Thanks to Mr. Draghi, that intervention at a crucial time was a decision, and decisiveness counts.  On the same basis, the next challenge is European recovery.  Ireland has done its bit in that area. We have shown that we are capable and the people of Ireland have shown by their sacrifices that they are willing to withstand great hardship to achieve a particular objective.  All credit is due to the political leaders and to the people of this country for the sacrifices they made and the risks they took.  We hope future generations will appreciate that.</p><p>  The next question concerns economic recovery for the rest of Europe.  Might it be possible for the European institutions to carry out an audit of the infrastructural deficits throughout the European Union that might inhibit rapid economic recovery and would also dramatically affect the future development of the European Union's ability to employ and generate economic impact?</p></speech>

It does not require rocket science to carry out such an audit.  The information should be readily available.  On foot of that we should take into account that interest rates throughout Europe are now at an all-time low.  During the economic boom in this country we were regularly informed that interest rates were at an all-time low.  Why was the economy not progressing?  It was simply because the moneys were used for speculative purposes in non-essential areas and in a way which created inflation in the housing sector in particular.  Why not harness the current low interest rates, given that it is appreciably more valuable to invest in something that will give a greater return than to invest in a lending institution at the moment?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014092500008#H00700"><p>This is the thing I am coming to.  That is correct.  It should be possible for the European institutions to invent a structure whereby it would be more attractive for investors of all kinds - savers, strategic investors, venture capitalists - to invest in areas that will create long and short-term employment.  It should also be possible to identify the projects that are most likely to produce results in a rapid fashion.  That is what is required.  It is a no-brainer.  I know what the European institutions will say, that the member state governments cannot show these things on their balance sheets and so on.  They do not have to show them on their balance sheets.  If they create the right structure, they will do it right.  That is my second question, whether the European institutions together can come to a conclusion on this.</p><p>  I wish to return briefly to my colleague's reference to energy.  Climate change is of great importance.  It can be a double-edged sword.  It can backfire on those with the best intentions depending on how we go about it.  I agree entirely with the Minister and my colleagues, who have identified this as a key area.  We should be very careful to recognise that our major industry is agriculture along with the pharmaceutical industry and the IT sector.  This was the mainstay of our economic recovery in recent years.  If we had not had those three areas, we would be as stagnant as the rest of the eurozone is at the moment.  That is not saying we have achieved all of our objectives, but it follows that we need to be very careful in our selection of our options.  We need to recognise, as do other European countries, that in 15 or 20 years from now there will be a greater dependence on energy supplies that are non-carbon-creating.  How we generate electricity is going to be important.  I do not happen to agree with my colleague in relation to the nuclear sector.  That is just my personal opinion.  We have to make a choice.  There is not a chance on this earth that this country is going to be able to provide for its own energy requirements unless we do something major in the very near future.  I reject emphatically the notion in some quarters that we are adequately supplied already.  We are not.  We do not have security of supply.  There are many internal and external factors that will dramatically affect our objectives in that area.</p><p>  If we are to achieve the kind of employment levels that we require over the next few years, we require a similar strategy here in Ireland to the one I have suggested for identifying infrastructural deficits across Europe.  This involves energy, communications, air, sea and land transport and access to same for all the people in Europe, thereby attempting to bring them all together.  There is great potential for achievement if this can be done.</p><p>  I favour wind energy as a first option for ourselves.  I have always held that view.  I believe in recognising the aesthetics of the area and in having good planning policies along with due deference to all health issues that must be complied with.  My problem with the nuclear sector is that notwithstanding scientific advances in that area, there is no known way yet to dispose of nuclear waste.  Unfortunately, it was found with the Fukushima reactor not long ago that no matter how much technology one has, if the fracture occurs there are problems.</p><p>  I was so saddened, as I am sure were many people, when I saw that relatives of the victims of the Dutch air disaster were prevented from collecting their dead and visiting the scene of the crash in the Ukraine.  They were prevented by a number of hooded, masked men purporting to be soldiers and defending something that I am not too sure about.  In my knowledge of history I have never known there to be a situation, even in a war, where people were prevented from collecting their dead.  It is very important that the institutions of the European Union fully recognise the message contained in the prevention of European people from attending the scene of their personal trauma. There was no retribution and no way in which they could overcome the situation that was laid before them.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister of State, bearing the time in mind, could probably answer the questions he deems most relevant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014092500009#J00300"><p>I will take guidance from the Chair and start with his question.  I thank the members for their detailed questions, and if I do not cover everything I would be happy to go through individual questions.  The Chairman's question goes to the core of discussions across the Continent, and he is correct that Italian Prime Minister Renzi has addressed the matter.  It concerns the question of what flexibility exists within existing treaties with respect to capital investment, stimulus and the Stability and Growth Pact, including any preventative arms.</p><p>  We believe there is sufficient flexibility to accommodate additional investment spending.  Some member states are very hawkish in this regard, and it is quite a public debate.  There is provision within the rules for an extension to the deadline when correcting excessive deficits, provided a member state has undertaken the required amount of consolidation.  We also feel very strongly that public spending differs completely from day-to-day expenditure.  We know it is mostly accepted by economists that this gives rise to greater growth within member states.</p><p>  The argument, therefore, is that the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact should be relaxed somewhat in the short term to facilitate productive spending, given the potential we could have. A German Minister of State, Mr. Michael Roth, recently visited Ireland, and the German Government has a very strong position on the rule of law.  I discussed this with the Minister of State, Mr. Roth, and we support the German Government in that regard.  We will assist Germany, which is driving the issue with a couple of other countries very strongly.  This links to Deputy Durkan's question regarding the Keynesian type of injection required within our Continent.</p><p>  I share Deputy Joe O'Reilly's views with respect to Deputy Phil Hogan.  The Deputy focused on wind energy.  It is interesting that the European Investment Bank, which is stepping into the stimulus area, as the Chairman mentioned, has already invested in Ireland within the wind energy sector.  It is noteworthy that following the incident in Japan, the largest economy in Europe, Germany, is moving from nuclear energy.</p><p>  Many members discussed climate change.  With regard to carbon emission targets, credits can be applied by virtue of how much renewable energy we have.  While we maintain and argue strongly that agricultural emissions are different from industrial emissions, by virtue of the importance of food security and so on, equally, we can and must strive to use renewable energy as a source not just of our own energy security but also to help achieve the sort of climate targets we must meet.  The Deputy is right in that we want to meet the targets not just to achieve a European target but to maintain the sustainability of our environment for future generations.  The Deputy is spot on with his reference to India and China.  There will be a big push at the next European Council meeting to agree targets within Europe so we can take a leadership role for the Paris negotiations.  Europe does not wish to follow, trying to sort out its own position before talking to the rest of the world.  We want to agree our position first so that the European Union can take that leadership role.</p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne would probably be very pleased with some of the early commitments we have from President Juncker.  He has spoken about the mobilisation of an extra &euro;300 billion in the next three years to make better use of the European budgets and the European Investment Bank.  This is really to try to address the key areas where we have failed.  The Deputy asked about competitiveness.  Europe will always find it hard in this area with respect to wages, as we have a well-paid and well-functioning economy that supports a very strong social protection network.  Half of social protection money in the world is spent within Europe, and that is something we want to protect.</p><p>  When we speak of competition, we must consider innovation and the research and development space.  We compete by virtue of the education of citizens, their training and the degree to which Europe can be a market leader across a broad range of areas.  In this country, for example, we have the greenest, cleanest and best production of agricultural products, and other countries in the European Union have their own specialties.  The research and development space is very important, and we also need to deal with other key competitive areas such as tax.</p><p>  I share Deputy Durkan's views about oil and gas targets, including the degree to which we will have to be fully aware of the requirements over the next number of years.  There has been much talk - including today - about the focus over the last number of years on jobs and investment.  Although there may be a dispute within the European Union about the way investment stimulus can get into the economy, given the weakness of growth and low inflation across such a large proportion of the Union, that voice is starting to be heard in a more urgent fashion.</p><p>  I have covered the broader points.  The Chairman is free to jump in if there is anything else that must be dealt with.</p></speech>

At that stage I hope we will be able to present some of the work we have done recently.  We are awaiting publication of the report that the committee is doing on voting rights, resulting from the criticism by the Commission approximately six months ago.  We are also awaiting the report on the future of Europe, which we hope to publish in approximately three weeks.</p><p>  We are all delighted to see the progress made by the former Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and we wish him well in his new job.

The North West Gateway Initiative is hugely important to the future of the north west.  Last May, the North West Region Cross Border Group was invited to submit a response to the north-west gateway initiative consultation.  We are here today to advise the committee of our response which was endorsed by all member councils and the wider stakeholder group.  We were asked four questions: How far have the original objectives been advanced?  To what extent has the co-operation become an integral part of the work of local government bodies and Departments?  What are the north-west gateway future priorities?  What is the most appropriate framework to pursue those priorities?</p><p>  On the question of how far the original projects have been advanced, we agreed that some progress had been made, examples being the radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin, the infrastructure at Eglinton Airport.  However, at a number of levels the initiatives have not been delivered.  Much remains to be done to fully develop the extension of the north-west gateway initiative and the implementation of its objectives.  On the question of to what extent has the co-operation become an integral part of the work of local government bodies and Departments, progress between the Departments has been positive and should be commended.  However, the extent of the co-operation is unclear to those working at local authority level.  I refer to strong collaboration at local authority level, particularly through PEACE and INTERREG projects.  </p><p>  The North West Gateway Initiative list of future priorities include connectivity, access and infrastructure, which are vital to the north west region, enterprise, employment and education, health, community and quality living environment.  The recommended most appropriate framework to pursue these priorities are a strategic development framework document agreed by the two governments to clarify the objectives for the region; an interdepartmental steering group to plan, oversee and drive the implementation; and ongoing consultation on the framework within the region, thus ensuring ownership and buy-in from the regional agencies and the stakeholders. </p></speech>

The north west is the most peripheral area in respect of Dublin, Belfast and the mainland of the UK.  One of the difficulties for us is that even though we have the will to work and are willing to work, we tend not to see the amount of infrastructure and money put into other parts of Northern Ireland in particular permeating down to us.  It is not secret and it is fair to say that the north west is probably one of the most deprived areas when it comes to investment and infrastructure.</p><p>  In terms of the north west as a gateway, we have had the gateway for the past seven years.  It has delivered in some areas.  It delivered in respect of the institute of technology in Letterkenny and the science park at Fort George and it delivered to some extent in respect of Altnagelvin.  We are looking forward to the completion of the Altnagelvin radiotherapy unit.  The Good Friday Agreement is only a paper exercise if we do not embrace the spirit of it.  We would like to see a proper assessment of the needs of the north west.  When I talk about the north west, I am talking about the North West Gateway Initiative and the north west corridor.  We have concerns about the A5 to which the Irish Government has made a commitment and which we hope will go ahead.  On a recent visit to Stormont, we met with Danny Kennedy, MLA, who told us that it had been delayed but not postponed.  Obviously, there are things that need to be done and one must follow legal rules in respect of one's country to ensure that one get to a point of starting.  Our expectation is that the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly will come up trumps and ensure that we have a road which will give us access in terms of a greater economic input to our area.  </p><p>  I do not want to dwell too long because I understand the members have received our submission and will have the opportunity to read through it.  The most important thing for us is that the committee sees the way forward to ensuring that the north west is given the same priority as Dublin, Galway or Limerick and that the committee sees its way to investing in our area.  I will give an example where there were 1,000 applicants for one job advertised.  This is an area where people want to work.  I told Mr. Canning last night that when one creates a void and the void is unemployment, it is a serious matter because something comes about to fill the void and so one gets anti-social behaviour or extreme activity which then demotes the area and people say they cannot go there.  The main issues for us are the A5, the railway link with Belfast, the opportunity for the railway to move forward, the A6 towards Belfast and the corridor road from Letterkenny straight into the city.  The road there is not bad but it needs to go on through and bring with it some industry.  We came up the A5 last night and we have seen the amount of traffic on it.  It is no longer fit for purpose and it is very important that we get the opportunity to complete the process that has been set in motion.  From that perspective, we want the members of this committee to be our champions in terms of driving this forward and allowing us as councillors and representatives of the north west to see that our young people are involved in worthwhile activity including worthwhile economic activity, do not see themselves as extremists and do not join extreme organisations.  We want the committee to be a champion for us.</p></speech>

It is very interesting to hear what they have to say.  As somebody from Monaghan, I know that we have similar issues on the Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh borders.  I am very interested in how the witnesses have come together as councillors in the north west because I would like to see the same level of interaction between ourselves.  It seems to be further advanced in the north west but the area still has the problems in terms of connectivity between Lifford, Letterkenny and Strabane and between Strabane and Derry.  What have been the major roadblocks because the witnesses are very well organised as councils?  What have been the major problems in terms of getting co-operation between road services in Northern Ireland and the county council in Donegal or other organisations to ensure that the peace dividend does exist for ordinary people and that we can get better co-operation between our respective jurisdictions in terms of road infrastructure, health care or education provision to ensure that ordinary people's lives are improved by the process?  Where do the real problems exist? Is it a case of lack of willpower at government in both the UK and the Northern Ireland Assembly and here?  What are the main blocks to further integration?</p></speech>

It is good to hear from it.  We heard submissions here about the A5 in July.  The committee is active in pursuing that with the Government.  I know it is not directly part of the presentation today.</p><p>  My questions are similar to those of Deputy Conlan.  What have been the blockages?  In the past five or six years during the recession in the South, attention has probably been drawn away from cross-Border issues and co-operation and there has been a focus on the 26 counties rather than on the all-island approach.  I think this has been detrimental to Donegal and the entire region.  We must try to get that back on track and get the Government to focus more on the Border areas.  </p><p>  The witnesses say that the objectives have not been delivered.  Is there is a list of other objectives that are outstanding?  Could the witnesses expand on those in terms of the gateway initiative?  How will the reorganisation of the councils in the six counties affect the work of the cross-Border group?  Will it expand the area?  The presentation stated that the extent of co-operation was unclear to those working at local authority level.  What is the group doing to tackle that as well because it is important across all the councils to make sure that people are fully aware of what is happening in terms of co-operation?  I have no doubt that the committee will be quite happy to do whatever it can to raise awareness and get the strategic framework accepted and implemented both North and South and at Government level here in the South.</p></speech>

In respect of the A5, given that the Northern Executive has stated it would ring-fence the money for when the project would be in a position to come online and that the Irish Government has stated it will revisit the question of the funding in 2015, what dialogue has the North West Region Cross Border Group had with both the Executive and the Irish Government about their commitment to the delivery of the A5?  As for the Riverine project, that is, the proposed footbridge between Lifford and Strabane, I have been informed by the Special European Union Programmes Body that it could be revisited under the shared spaces heading, although the submissions must be lodged by both Strabane and Donegal councils by the spring of next year.  Have the witnesses an update on the status of this proposal?  Specifically in respect of the new super councils and the amalgamation of Derry and Strabane councils in particular, what impact will this have on the group's work in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Councillor Paul Canning" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014092500006#E00300"><p>I thank members for the questions and will respond first to Deputy Conlan.  As to where we think the failure lies, first, everyone is aware of the major lack of investment across the entire country.  However, the information that comes down from this committee towards the likes of the North West Region Cross Border Group is shady at times.  We do not know what actually is happening and one hears a lot of fragmented statements because one is working with two Governments.  We wish to focus on a channelled direct route via this committee in respect of what it is implementing and doing.  This information can be fed back to us as a group in order that we can do the dividing at our level.  The cross-Border group is a mixture of councillors from Donegal, Derry, Strabane, Limavady and Magherafelt councils.  It is cross-party and cross-Border and we then are able to divide that.  We can see a focus and can bring that focus.  We also have no problem with reverting to the joint committee and letting members know where we find things are going wrong.  Basically, when we conducted the consultation, we received feedback from everybody and the sort of line was that people did not know what was happening.  Moreover, if one mentioned this delegation was coming before the joint committee, the response was we would only be wasting our time.  We want to come back with a focus and a strategic framework from which to work.  Basically, we need such a document and then we will know where we are going and how we are to go forward.  There also is low investment at present with poor infrastructure in place, including poor broadband but that will come.  However, we must have a focus on the direction in which we are going.</p><p>  This point basically ties into the other questions regarding the make-up of the councils and the present position with regard to the new councils.  At present, we are in a transient state and in fairness to Donegal County Council, we have been working with the areas already.  As it had been broken down into five or six areas anyway, our structures might be ahead of the rest of the country with regard to the Putting People First document and consequently we are okay on that aspect.  I will let Councillor Hastings comment regarding the position in Derry and Strabane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Councillor Hugh Hastings" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014092500006#E00400"><p>As for the merger of Derry and Strabane councils, obviously, a lot of work has been done and much work has been undertaken over the past year.  At present we are in shadow, as it is called, but we are not really a shadow.  We have already identified each of the areas in which we will be working.  We have looked at the staffing and resources and at present, we are considering the transformation of the council in terms of where we wish to be by April 2015, because in March, as the Chairman and Mr. Pat Doherty are aware, the other councils will cease to be.  The existing councils are Derry City Council and Strabane District Council.  As for the North Wwest Gateway Initiative and the North West Region Cross Border Group, the group now is made up mainly from Strabane and Derry.  We have moved forward and while we still will deliver parts of the programme in Limavady and Magherafelt, the main thrust in the future will be from the new Derry City and Strabane District Council.  From that perspective, there is a ready identification there.  There will always be stresses when one is changing things and of course, we are working towards that.  I believe there is a willingness within the councillor group and across the board to see an outcome because we believe we have been elected by the people and are there to serve them and that the people are not there to serve.  I believe this attitude is prevalent.</p><p>  In respect of Deputy Conlan's question regarding the blocks, after this meeting all the joint committee members will have to hand a copy of the document our group has constructed.  We are asking them, as a committee, to support the way forward in respect of the gateway.  The gateway undoubtedly did deliver some things.  As I stated previously, it delivered in respect of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology compound, as well as on the science park and several other items.  However, it has not had the impact we would have expected.  I should note that last week, we attended the launch of the new science park in Fort George and members will be pleased to learn that a target that was set for 2017 has been achieved or in other words, 70% of all the space within the science park has been taken up and other organisations or businesses are waiting to become part of the science park.</p><p>  As for relationships within Derry City and Strabane District Council and of course Donegal County Council, relationships always have been very good.  We have a common purpose, which is to develop the north west.  It does not matter from what part of the north west one comes as we probably perceive Derry city as the city of the north west and as a central hub of activity.  As one develops one's hub, that also helps the outlying areas.  However, we of course would not have been able to have the science park without Letterkenny Institute of Technology's new compound.  It would not have been a runner because that puts in place the cross-Border element.  This project constituted a coming together and we would be happy to state the North West Regional College, Magee College and Letterkenny Institute of Technology actually work in tandem to develop strategies for the future and the way forward for us.  As for what needs to be done, we must revisit the gateway strategy that we have penned and constructed.  There is an opportunity for members to consider it after we have left but as our chairman, Councillor Canning stated, we would like the joint committee to invite us back after the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council to then give us an opportunity to ascertain how our proposals lie with it.</p></speech>

As this was never provided, it is very difficult to measure what was put in place or the level of engagement between Departments.  Communications between the committee and us, and between the North-South Ministerial Council secretariat and us have improved over the past year, and this has led to a great feeling of positivity in the region, which we have disseminated to the councils.  We appreciate the support.  Without a strategic framework, it is difficult to know what the wider objectives were other than to collaborate on certain areas.</p><p> On the super council issue, we have moved within the group and Derry City, Strabane District and Donegal County Councils will come together because Limavady and Magherafelt will no longer exist as an entity.  We have already taken steps to implement the structure.  They are still associate members and for the purposes of funding we will see out the funding with them.  We will keep the good, strong relationships we have with certain members until they get organised and we can establish more formalised relationships again.  It is a time of great change in the North and South and it is very important for us that the north-west gateway initiative is at the top of the agenda because with all the change we could lose the momentum behind it, which we do not want to happen.</p><p> The PEACE and INTERREG programmes have just gone to the European Commission for signing off.  After that has been done, we will go into the full programme activity, which will include preparing pipeline projects.  The Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, will be seeking pipeline projects to be developed by the partners.  One will be a lead partner, possibly Donegal County Council or Strabane-Derry district council, as it will become.  A business case will be generated and submitted through the shared spaces part of the programme for funding.  It would be a particularly strong project in terms of shared space.</p></speech>

Who is responsible for the North West Gateway Initiative consultation?  Is it a Government Department, North and South, or the North-South Ministerial Council?  If it is a Government Department, maybe it would be worthwhile for us to ask the relevant officials to come before the committee and we could question them on their commitment, how soon the consultation process will end and what its clear objective is.  The message I got from the presentation was that the smaller projects funded through PEACE and INTERREG have been successful.  In my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, many worthwhile projects have been funded through those initiatives since the mid-1990s, driven by local statutory organisations and community groups.</p><p>  The A5 is obviously the major deficit regarding access for the north west.  If I were in that region I would highlight it because we all know the value of a good road network.  When one is driving to Letterkenny, going through Counties Tyrone and Donegal is a very slow progress.  When we met the delegates&rsquo; colleagues in Derry, we spoke about the major strengths in education in the north west due to further education colleges including Institute of Technology Sligo, ITS, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT, and Magee College.  When I asked whether the educational resources on both sides of the Border would be maximised in respect of job creation, I was very glad to hear Councillor Hastings mention the major role LYIT had played in the development of the science park.  It is one area the north west should highlight as a major positive point regarding the potential to create jobs and develop the economy.  That does not take away from the challenges there are in other areas, such as road access, which is critical.</p></speech>

For those of us who live in and represent the north west it is frustrating to look at a map showing the motorways going from Dublin to Belfast, Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  There are rail and air connections to most of those locations.  However, there are no connections &ndash; rail, motorway or air &ndash; linking the fourth largest city on the island to Dublin.  There is no motorway or direct rail link from Belfast, although there is what I call a "tourist link" between Derry and Belfast.  There have been some successes in the INTERREG programmes.  The news about the North West Regional Science Park, Fort George and LYIT is welcome and there seems to be good interaction between Magee Campus and LYIT.  The delegates' group is cross-party and cross-council and is probably the best forum for representing the voice of those people.  What can it do to lead the way in the big picture and remedy the clear failure to develop equality in infrastructure in the north west?  What is the vision of the group to lead the charge, bring everybody together and make it happen?</p><p>  There have been some positive developments in tourism.  The Wild Atlantic Way has made an impact.  Derry was the city of culture and a number of events there put a good, positive focus on it, including the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.  What can be done to develop a co-ordinated, cross-Border tourism initiative?  What is the vision for leading it?</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to see them and to have met them yesterday evening.  In the north-west cross-Border group, Donegal is the main stakeholder in the Republic, and has suffered alongside the North over many years due to the lack of joined-up political thinking between the Six Counties and the Border counties.  Unfortunately, it has led to an infrastructural and economic deficit in the north west.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn referred to the fact that we have no motorway or train line.  Unfortunately, the timing of the St. Andrews Agreement in 2006 and the agreement that came with it to fund the A5 happened at the moment when finances on both sides of the Border went downhill.  Before that, when motorways were being built across the rest of the country, the joined-up political thinking and co-operation to build the A5 did not exist.  County Donegal also suffered due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  It is all the more important that, now that things have stabilised and much progress have been made, the work of groups such as the north-west region cross-Border group leads to joined-up thinking between the North and South.  Ms Margey outlined earlier that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the South and OFMDFM in the North are responsible for driving it.</p> <p> In terms of the North West Gateway Initiative and making it happen - as opposed to the projects the North West Region Cross Border Group would lead, which are SEUPB funded, and which give the group a leadership role - and in terms of education and enterprise, connectivity, and health and community, which are strands of the gateway initiative, who is responsible for driving these matters at a political end? Is it happening at both the northern end and the southern end?  It appears from the report, for which the committee is thankful, that there is a lack of drive at an executive level to make the concept underpinning the gateway initiative a reality.  How do we achieve that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1156" speakername="Mary White" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014092500008#G00200"><p>I welcome chairman, Councillor Paul Canning and vice chairman, Councillor Hugh Hastings and Ms Carol Margey, manager.  The cross-Border regions, particularly those along the western areas of the island, faced many economic difficulties.  It is relentlessly on our agenda.  The committee has to exert pressure on both governments to get action.  The mission to promote cross-Border economic development for the benefit of the 400,000 people in the region is even more important today as our economies recover from the recession. We must ensure that the people of the Border areas share in that economic recovery.  It emerges from the group's presentation that there is strong collaboration at local authority level but the extent of commitment and co-operation between government Departments, North and South, is much less evident.  The group's conclusions reflect a lessening of the political commitment by both governments in recent years to cross-Border co-operation and to the economic welfare of the communities along the Border areas.  Councillor Canning lists, as a first priority, connectivity, access and infrastructure.  This committee has championed the case for proceeding urgently with the upgrading of the N2 road from Clontibret to the Border and proceeding urgently with the upgrade of the A5 road and the N14 from Letterkenny to Lifford.  This is the most important infrastructure investment to open up the Border areas and the north west for trade and investment. Yet, it has disappeared off the political radar.  I encourage the group to campaign even more intensely for the investment to proceed and to join with the other cross-Border networks, Irish Central Border Area Network Limited, ICBAN and East Border Region. In so doing, the entire Border area will benefit.</p><p>  I fully support the three conclusions set out by Councillor Hastings.  In particular, the committee should support a renewed focus on the development of the Border area.  Through the group's manager, Ms Carol Margey, the group is actively participating in a more formalised approach to the development of the entire region through the Border development's own corridor concept.  I commend its initiative in hosting a joint conference on 2 October with the central Border network and East Border Region - at this time of great change in local authorities - to focus on more collaboration in the interest of the economic welfare of the 1 million people living in those areas.  It is past time to put cross-Border co-operation and the economic regeneration of the Border areas back on the political radar of both governments, and their respective Departments, and the North-South Ministerial Council.  I support Deputy Smith's call to hear from the relevant government officials on both sides.  That is a sound proposal.  I ask the Chairman and clerk to the committee to arrange for this.  Further to the meeting with the secretariat of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh - the committee pushed this at the meeting - it must be asked was it listening to our concerns?  Will the secretariat impress on the North-South Ministerial Council how important the committee regards these issues?</p></speech>

The committee pointed out what Deputy Mac Lochlainn said.  I presented a map of the entire country and showed how barren is the road network to the north west area.  The rest of the country is well served with roads.  It is denying the human rights of the people in the north west that development of this road has not continued.  When the committee visits the narrow water bridge and goes to County Monaghan it should meet with the county engineer in Monaghan.  That part of the road is part of his mandate.  It would be a good idea to meet him and get his views on it.</p></speech>

We know our priorities and have listed them but we can only take them so far.  It seems to break down at that point.  If we had a link to the committee and the committee was able to tell us how far it was advancing the matter, that information could be fed back to us.  We would like to leave today with a commitment that a framework will be put in place to pursue the priorities we have identified today.  We can work from that.  We have a goal to achieve.  If we had that as a starting point, we can then add to it at a local level.  Currently, we take it to one level.  We have an outstanding and we have delivered on projects.  We have a good working group that is working for the benefit of the north west.  However, we go as far as Omagh and we get stuck.  We want to take it further and we want a light back from the committee. I congratulate the chair on his new position and I would like this to be an item that he pursues for us.</p></speech>

These include funding, regional development and lobbying.  We see raising awareness, improving communication and providing leadership at a regional level as being our vision for the future. However, the development of the region will need a multi-layered approach as referred to by our chairman.  We feel we have our house in order.  There is a lot of work being carried out at the moment by the councils in terms of new structures and putting structures in place to enable this work to continue more efficiently and effectively.  That multi-layered approach requires dedicated people in the departments -  who work with a steering group or as part of the North West Gateway Initiative - who we can reach out to and say we need some help in terms of policy development and funding.  We also need to know how far the committee has been able to advance a particular matter since we last communicated with it.  We need an eco-system where we have ongoing communication between the layers involved.</p></speech>

This is my first time here.  I hope it has been worthwhile.  We deserve development and the support of all members of the committee across the political spectrum.</p> <p>We will do our best to ensure there is co-operation across all the parties in the new councils in Strabane and Donegal and build a coterminous in terms of the way we move forward.  It will be the same for peace and rural development.  Rural development is very important and it played an important role in the past five years in rural Strabane, Derry, Omagh and Limavady.  There is a level of co-operation and a will to win and succeed.  We need the people above us to start thinking in that way as well.  Our vision is for a fully engaged workforce in the north west.  We expect a quality of life right across the board.  We would like this committee as our champions to champion our pursuit of developing the north west region.  In five years time or in two years time, I hope when we look again at the situation we will be able to say that we have made progress on the roads.  </p><p> For the information of the committee, we recently met and were well received by Mr. Tommie Kennedy.  We had people from across the areas the A5 will cover, including County Monaghan.  Mr. Kennedy outlined his commitment and told us the money is ringfenced for this project.  I am smiling because obviously money never stays in one place for very long.  It was not an unwillingness on his part to proceed but he has to await the outcome of the judicial review and obviously he has to listen to what the courts are saying.  We hope the project will move forward in the short term.</p></speech>

I do not think officials from any of the Departments in Stormont have come to our meetings but we should start with our officials.</p><p>  The presentations made by our three visitors have been very good.  I can hear the absolute frustration in Councillor Paul Canning's voice about the delay in getting things done.  The only way we can help is to bring the relevant officials before the committee and we pose the question and put forward proposals.  Obviously we can write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, requesting his support for the project as well.</p><p>  Is there a timeframe for when the consultation process is due to finish?</p></speech>

If members remember the last presentation, Mr. Danny McSorley who is the chief executive of Omagh and Strabane district councils said that all of the technical and environmental issues will be addressed.  From all my dealings with the road service that is the case.  The key point is the money.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has to give us some sense of what the Government will do in terms of revisiting the finances in 2015.  That is the key.</p><p>  Some of the Unionist parties in the Northern Executive are not terribly committed to it.  It is only because of the strength of the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in on the Executive that the money has been ringfenced.  We should be mindful of that.  Mr. Danny Kennedy, MLA, is the Northern Minister concerned but he cannot speak against it because it is an Executive decision and not his decision.  One must remember that his former party Leader was very much against the A5 road.  One must watch that all the time.  The collective position is that the money is ringfenced.  If the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, could give some sense of when the Government money would come forward, then one could have a sense of when it would happen.  All of the engineers say they will be ready to go through the public inquiry and consultation process at the start of 2016.</p></speech>

I endorse Deputy Smith's suggestion on having a session to follow on from a meeting dealing with the progress of the North West Gateway Initiate with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who are responsible for driving the project from the Republic.</p> <p>I also support the suggestion an invitation would issue to representatives from the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to see whether they would be interested in presenting to us because it needs both governments to do it and flows on from the Good Friday Agreement, which this committee in this Parliament is responsible for overseeing.  In light of that, I do not think it would be inappropriate to invite them to come down to give either their views separately or with their departmental officials.  If it is to work, it requires the co-operation, goodwill and faith of both governments to drive it.  It behoves this committee to assess whether this is working and to dig into that to see whether we can drive it and assist the work the North West Region Cross Border Group can do in respect of that.  As I am not a member of the committee, I know it is a matter for committee members to decide.  I endorse Deputy Smith's proposal.  </p><p> We were discussing the A5.  The Irish Government's commitment will be important and the financial commitment post-2015 is important.  Any more clarity we can get on that would be very useful.  The Northern Ireland Executive has a remit in terms of the funding from Westminster but it goes back as far as the St. Andrews Agreement where it was ring-fenced from that point in time.  It was agreed that it would be allocated specifically towards that road.  I know the unfortunate planning situation has delayed it.  After the previous planning permission was granted and before it was knocked down in court, a decision was made to go ahead with the ring-fenced money from Westminster to do two sections of the road.  A timeline was put on that money, which was being drawn down last year and this year.  My understanding is that this money is now being drawn down for the other projects even though it was ring fenced for the road.  It is a Northern Ireland Executive set-up but a crucial factor in respect of beginning the construction of this road is what the arrangements are regarding how the money which was meant for the road and was spent last year and on other projects this year will be put back to commence construction of the road.  I am not sure whether Mr. Doherty would have an update on that but I see that as being particularly crucial in terms of the road actually getting underway.  </p></speech>

An excellent and constructive proposal was made by Ms Margey about dedicated Executive officers and representatives of the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister linking directly with the steering group of the North West Region Cross Border Group.  I urge the committee to write to the two Departments and the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to ask them to provide a direct link and dedicated officers to a steering group so that the North West Region Cross Border Group could be lead on these issues.  Everybody politically in the north-west region is committed to this project and has been fighting for it but I really see the North West Region Cross Border Group as the ideally placed conduit for driving this, which is why I asked the questions.  We all have a job to do here in this Parliament and the North and so on but if as Ms Margey proposes, we had conduits from Departments dedicated to liaising and keeping the information flow going, that could be helpful.  I am suggesting that the committee might write to the governments and endorse the proposal.</p></speech>

As Councillor Hastings said, it is only paper if it is not happening.  North-South development is part of it.  It is a farce.  I have been sitting here through many meetings.  The clerk would say that we have been at this same tune for a while and have made no progress.  The money for Narrow Water Bridge has gone to the Drogheda viaduct or something else.  The money for the road has gone somewhere else.  Looking at it as a business project, it is pathetic and there is something wrong.  It is falling between stones.  We are about the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am embarrassed at this stage that all the county councillors from Donegal and Tyrone and county managers have come here and we have not delivered.</p></speech>

Councillor Hastings spoke about the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, a point Senator White agreed with.  We will do what we can to raise these issues.  The A5 has been raised at this meeting and Senator White and many other members have been very active in raising the issue.  As Chairman, I will pursue this issue to see what is happening.  I have a deep knowledge of the north west.  I come from north Roscommon and represent Roscommon-Leitrim.  I have been in every town and village in Northern Ireland and Donegal so I have a deep knowledge of the north west and the A5 certainly needs to be addressed.  We will do everything in our power to address it.</p><p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank Councillor Canning, Ms Margey and Councillor Hastings for coming here today and giving a very concise and informative synopsis of the situation.

I thank Mr. Jeyes for his engagement with the joint committee on previous occasions.  He has always made himself available to meet the committee for thorough engagements.  We look forward to hearing his report on the work being undertaken by the Child and Family Agency since its establishment.  I thank him and his staff for the work they are doing in this exciting and challenging period and ask him to convey to the staff of the agency the immense gratitude of members for the work they do on behalf of young people.  I also welcome Mr. Jeyes's colleagues, Mr. Fred McBride, chief operating officer, Mr. Pat Smyth, director of finance, Ms Eibhlin Byrne, executive manager, and Mr. Stephen Eglington from the advisory group for aftercare leavers.

The Chairman has already introduced my colleagues who will respond in the event that there are any difficult questions.  I intend to act out of character and keep my presentation brief.  I have tried to highlight each of the issues in which members will be interested in order that they can question us further.  Additional information has been made available in appendices.</p><p>  Tusla was born on 1 January 2014.  It is the first agency solely dedicated to the welfare, protection and nurture of Ireland&rsquo;s children, particularly the most vulnerable.  Among other things, this has greatly enhanced the transparency of taxpayer investment in services for vulnerable children and those in need of care and protection.  A copy of our summary budget is included in appendix I which, among other things, illustrates how inflexible our budget is, an issue we may explore presently.  The summary budget document is accompanied by details of our principal service activity and I have also included a summary of our business plan and progress to date.  My colleagues will be pleased to update or clarify any matters arising in this regard.  We have also provided an overview of monthly national performance activity as at July last.  </p><p>  It was essential that we established a body that is responsive and inclusive.  In saying this, I note that much of the activity in the initial business plan has focused on ensuring we establish reliable routines.  We are a start-up organisation in a difficult period for a country.  Our focus, therefore, is on key elements of service to ensure we work efficiently and effectively.  In addition, work has continued to reform and improves services, building on initiatives in family resource centres, educational welfare services and, specifically, on streamlining our service delivery and emphasising prevention, diversion and building on the strengths of families.</p><p>  Tusla has been created in the demanding circumstances of increased requests for services, budget restrictions and recruitment constraint.  In the face of austerity, it would be easy to be complacent, blame any inaction on limited resources and adopt the position that we are doing okay in the circumstances.  We refuse to settle for such an approach.  In the face of austerity, services are improving and have become more accountable and consistent across the country.  Lessons from the past have been learned and we are providing an increasingly accountable, consistent and transparent service.</p><p>  Appendix V is a summary of comments made in recent inspections carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  These show increasing evidence of a service which is improving.  While much has been done, much remains to be done.  The comments also show an increased clarity of purpose, a sense that there is a plan and a determination to do the best for Ireland&rsquo;s children.  It is important to remember that children are not at risk because they are in the care of the State.  Children are placed in the care of the State because they are at risk.  It is also interesting to note two major concerns expressed by HIQA.  On the first, the impact of maternity cover, following an agreement with trade unions, we are introducing a pool to cover maternity leave.  Cover will be provided immediately as a consequence of Government investment.  In response to a second concern raised by HIQA, colleagues in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Health Service Executive will have 24-7 access to information on children who are in the child protection notification system.</p> <p>Failure to share information is often quoted as a weakness when children are let down by the child protection system.  A consistent approach to child protection is essential.  Information will be shared.  In addition, emergency place-of-safety arrangements are working well and now will be augmented by a duty out-of-hours system.  Communication has improved, and through newsletters, website and training, best practice is identified and shared and practice improved.<br/>Other specific improvements in 2014 include a full review of domestic sexual and gender-based violence services because this is the first time all of those services would be under the one authority - there was a set of funders within the previous health service arrangements.  A roadmap is being developed for these services so that the pernicious effects of domestic violence are everybody's responsibility and specialised services for responding to sexual violence are enhanced.  In addition, family support and family resource centres have been integrated within our working at local level and new synergies have been created within our local area pathways.  Teams around the child and the family have been created and are increasingly effective - the meitheal.  Information is a key requirement in child protection and we are setting up the national child care information system, which is in the last stages of user-acceptance testing.  On improvements, finally, educational welfare is a constituent part of the service delivery and as the committee will see later, we view education as a key component in improving young people's life chances and opportunities.  Work continues to improve attendance, participation and retention and align these functions to other agency work.  School attendance guidelines have been developed to underpin this and work continues on the assessment of and support for education in places other than recognised schools, including at home.<br/>We must act, first, with accountability, across the country.  As I speak to partners, including the courts system, it is clear that there is a straight line of management and lines of accountability.  National policy is discussed, best practice identified and consistency increased.  Staff are clear about their responsibilities and held to that, and we produce monthly information relating to HR, finance and service delivery.<br/>To enhance accountability further, we need to review the funding distribution which can look inconsistent and to develop local partnerships within children services committees.  We have a joint protocol for services with primary care, health and well-being, mental health and services for children affected by disability, but that needs to be strengthened.  Children suffer where there are gaps.  As part of the aspiration to be a responsive service, there is a need to learn more from those who complain and for us to do better in responding within agreed timeframes.  We are improving, but have more to do.  Mechanisms need to be developed in order that the services Tusla shares with the HSE are accountable and recognise Tusla as an independent agency with separate legal status.<br/>The service delivery framework is being rolled out across the country.  Areas have developed multidisciplinary teams around the child emphasising early intervention and partnership working.  Most teams now have a dedicated front door, duty and intake service with response times greatly reduced, and continuity of service enhanced.  Children First arrangements have been strengthened through the child welfare and protection handbook and we have just issued additional guidance relating to the difficult area of section 3 cases where the alleged abuse is extra-familial.  An alternative care handbook, also sharing best Irish practice, has been finalised and will be published shortly, and strong aftercare arrangements are being consolidated.  Early years inspection now runs on a national basis, and the workforce has been enhanced and there is a guarantee of a full inspection at least every three years.  Within the early years inspectorate, a system of registration is being implemented to replace the previous practice of notification and in partnership with others, because we do not have sole responsibility here, the emphasis is on child development as well as ensuring a safe environment.<br/>For adoption services, which we now run on a national basis, within the limited resources, we are making progress on the difficult backlogs of information and tracing and record management.<br/>There has been considerable progress in special care and, as befits a multidisciplinary agency, evidence of that is included, as appendix VI of the presentation, following the newly released junior and leaving certificate results achieved by some of Ireland's most vulnerable children.  These are at-risk children who have been taken into our care on a secure basis because of the way in which they were leading their life.  Through careful nurture and partnership work with education, they have achieved junior certificate results and, perhaps more importantly, leave care with a good attitude to education and learning.  Nearly 98% of six to 16 year old children in care and nearly 90% of 17 year old children in care are in full-time education; both figures represent an increase.  An extremely impressive 60% of young people who have left care are in full-time third level education.  Some 56%, or 474, of young persons over 18 years are still living in State-sponsored and commissioned arrangements with their excellent foster carers.  The equivalent figure in England, where care arrangements stop at age 16, is 3%.  Further development is required to build on this strength, finalising national aftercare standards, foster care support and commissioning arrangements.<br/>In the face of a dynamic and well-planned reform agenda, there are four particular challenges that inhibit the more effective development of Ireland's aspiration for a full range of services for children.  The first is a sustainable budget.  Current budget pressures prevent staffing services reaching full complement and that inhibits service effectiveness despite strong and effective arrangements to prioritise the most important and the most urgent.  Any analysis of HIQA and Ombudsman reports note that the concerns relate to resource or recruitment deficits.  My point in raising this is that all budgets have consequences.  We will deliver services for the taxpayer for the resource available.<br/>Cost-effective support in partnership with HSE is also important.  Tusla would support going further than merely shared services, but to the development of an internal market, so that services relating to finance, HR, estates, ICT and other support are provided on a cost-effective basis and are responsive to a different range of customers.  As reform is completed, Tusla, the community health trusts, hospital trusts and others should each have a shareholding in support services and a monetary value should be given to each shareholding with a view to enhancing the customer experience.  For Tusla, a relatively small State body compared with the HSE, to have a shared service only with the HSE is not a balanced partnership and is difficult to operate.<br/>There can be little doubt that the current time and money spent on legal matters is neither sustainable nor in children's and parents' best interests.  Tusla has embarked on a comprehensive and ongoing process of reform.  Significant attention has been given to increasing our credibility in providing evidence and enable effective and timely judicial decisions.  Training has been increased and new court reporting forms for social work colleagues introduced.<br/>There is detailed oversight of legal budgets since we took it over on 1 January, with a significant reduction in those authorised to engage legal services.  Further reforms are required to move towards greater use of mediation, reform of the important guardian <i>ad litem</i>system and a further review of the way in which we use legal services.<br/>We need to see regulation and registration for the guardians <i>ad litem</i>.</p> <p>The practice of representation of guardians <i>ad litem</i>at both solicitor and counsel level raises questions regarding the use of legal representation in court by expert witnesses who are there to support the court's work.<br/>There is a need to development mediation services and processes.  Increasingly legalistic proceedings at District Court level can result in significant delays as points of law are considered.  Repeated short-term care orders are not conducive to providing stability for children.  Often, paradoxically, they are not fair to parents.<br/>From my experience, having worked in children's services in three jurisdictions, services for children are all too often organised within lines of professional demarcation rather than the needs of children.  This is not in the best interests of children.  Children&rsquo;s education, health and welfare needs are intensely inter-related.  Consequently, effective multi-agency work is crucial and requires scrutiny, support and insistence.<br/>The common theme in all of the serious case reviews of the past ten years has been a lack of joined-up strategy and integrated implementation.  There is a new joint protocol between key HSE services, primary care, services for children affected by disability and mental health issues and the Child and Family Agency.  This protocol needs to be strengthened and great care must be taken to ensure that parallel reforms remain complementary.  If reforms are not synchronised, there is a danger of reinforcing significant service gaps.  In such territory, tragedy can occur.<br/>I was going to leave a blank conclusion, because I felt that was more a matter for the committee, but I will add this.  We are realistic and recognise that the pace of reform has been inhibited by the dictates of austerity.  The fragility of the agency, having been born in such difficult circumstances, is a consequence of its establishment at a time of severe restrictions on the public purse.  Despite all the pressures, there is enthusiasm, commitment and initiative.  There is a plan.Staff deserve great credit for what has been achieved and I thank the Chairman for his opening remarks in that regard.  The issue now is to complete the task, support the commitment and ensure that reform is consolidated and sustained.</p></speech>

He spoke about a sustainable budget and the implications of the current budget on the provision of services.  Will he confirm for us what the carry-over deficit was when the new agency was established on 1 January this year?  In regard to the transfer of staff from the HSE to Tusla, will he confirm that appropriate and necessary staff were transferred and that it does not have an excess of administrative staff to the detriment of staff of front-line services, such as social workers?<br/>Mr. Jeyes mentioned the issue of legal fees.  The legal fees that have been incurred by this section within the HSE previously are nothing short of scandalous.  We read a report in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>two or more years ago which indicated that in one year the legal fees broke the &euro;30 million ceiling.  What steps have been taken to reduce these fees and has there been a downward trajectory in fees over the past number of years which indicates that progress is being made and fees are decreasing steadily?<br/>Mr. Jeyes spoke about multi-agency work and the new joint protocol between key HSE services, but says this needs to be strengthened and care needs to be taken to ensure parallel reforms remain complementary.  When Tusla was established, two of the key areas that the task force recommended be under the control of the agency were public health nurses and child and adult mental health.  We should have robust protocols in place at this stage for these areas.  Mr. Jeyes has said that without this, there is a danger of reinforcing significant service gaps.  I would think that given the recommendation that these areas should come under the remit of the agency from the start, a robust protocol would be in place by now.  Has there been any consultation with the Department of Health and Children in regard to moving these areas over to the Child and Family Agency as recommended?<br/>On the issue of early years education and care, we are all aware of the RTE programme &quot;A Breach of Trust,&quot; which was broadcast over a year ago.  Reform has been disappointingly slow.  I do not know who set the timeframes, but targets set by the Child and Family Agency or the Department have not been met.  One of the recommendations was that all areas of the country should have an inspector, but has that happened?  The agency continues to employ public health nurses to act as inspectors.  Why is that, considering the recommendation that professionals from the early childhood care sector should be able to apply for these positions?  Some Labour Court ruling is often cited as the reason they cannot apply.  Will Mr. Jeyes provide that Labour Court ruling?<br/>The new standards due to be published this summer still have not been published.  Where are they?  In April 2014, Tusla committed to a consultation process on the new registration process, but that has yet to happen.  Why is that?  I raised the matter of the provision of SNAs with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, this morning.  The primary responsibility to ensure children with special educational needs get the necessary supports to get to preschool and be included in the system with all other children remains with the HSE.  Can the witnesses confirm that is the case?  What has the agency done to ensure the necessary supports are put in place and to ensure a uniform approach throughout the country?  The current approach to SNA provision is piecemeal, and provision all depends on where a preschool is located.<br/>I will leave issues such as the lack of social workers to other colleagues to highlight, although I raised the issue with the Minister this morning.</p></speech>

I welcome the team from Tusla.  In his presentation, Mr. Jeyes referred to increased training for social workers.  What is the training budget?  It is vital training is an integral part of the process.  Social work is a registered profession and, as a consequence, social workers are required to continually engage in professional training and development.</p> <p>In light of staff shortages, what is Tusla doing to ensure social workers have access to appropriate training and can develop their skills in-house and externally?<br/>Deputy Troy made reference to the fact that we had engagement with the Minister this morning in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Can Mr. Jeyes confirm that it remains national policy to ensure that every child in care has an allocated social worker?  The allocation of a social worker is an entitlement provided under the Child Care Act 1991.  This morning the Minister, in response to this team of Deputies, talked about high priority items or must-get items, and low priority items - he left the matter hanging - which we can do without. I would like to know, definitively, that the policy I understood to be a national policy remains <i>in situ</i>and there is a commitment by the services to adhere to same.<br/>I understand the financial pressures but I hope they are not resulting in prioritisation of the allocation of social workers.  The Minister referenced high-priority and low-priority items.  Children in care, because they are in care, need a designated social worker.  It is not the case that there will be some who are more deserving or more in need.  They are all in need of a designated social worker, in my opinion.  There is more than anecdotal evidence that some children in long-term foster care are not being assigned a social worker.  I have also heard of foster families not being provided with a link worker.  Has there been a change in national policy on this issue?  I am accepting of budgetary challenges, and the chief executive gave voice to that himself.  <br/>I particularly welcome Mr. Eglington here today.  I ask Mr. Jeyes to comment on the progress of the full roll-out and implementation of the national policy on leaving and aftercare.  Specifically, I ask him to comment on whether aftercare has a ring-fenced budget and whether the resources available are adequate to ensure implementation of national policy.<br/>Let us look at the statistics on social workers.  Over the past eight to nine years the number of children in State care has increased by over 20% and the number of referrals to social work services has almost doubled.  Despite what the Minister again said this morning on the floor of the D&aacute;il Chamber, the reality is that the number of social workers dealing with child protection and welfare has remained largely static.  It is all right to say &quot;We have recruited X,&quot; but there are departures too.  On examination of the figures, the real position is that the numbers have remained largely static over that period.  We have been told there are 9,000 cases awaiting the allocation of a social worker, and that Tusla services, as the chief executive indicated in his address, are operating with only 70% of its ideal workforce numbers.  How are Tusla social workers coping with the significant increase in their workloads?  What assurances can Mr. Jeyes give the committee that children and their families are receiving an adequate service?  It may be difficult for him to answer my questions, and I understand if he cannot.  I am mindful of Tusla's statement yesterday on the report prepared by the Ombudsman for Children about an allegation of abuse at a school in County Kilkenny.  Can the chief executive advise the committee how speedily Tusla will be in a position to address that issue?  It is an historic issue but it has clear contemporary overtones.  The limited commentary that is in the public domain does not satisfy one's concern about the matter.  I would like to know, based on the report prepared by the former Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, how quickly he would hope to address the issues concerned.  Where does he believe the fault lay in cases that Ms Logan said were &quot;not properly investigated&quot;?  Who had responsibility for it at the time?  At whom is she pointing the finger of accusation?<br/>My last couple of questions are on direct provision.  If the chief executive cannot offer information on it this morning then I ask him to furnish us with it later.  Like all Members here, I am very concerned about the circumstances for people who are in what are described as direct provision centres for asylum seekers.  I am particularly concerned about children in these centres who have known, in their memory, no other reality than years of domicile in these particular circumstances.  Can the chief executive advise us of the number of child protection teams in direct provision centres?  What are Tusla's role and responsibilities towards children in such a setting?  <br/>Lastly, can Mr. Jeyes advise us on the requirement for all child care workers to be qualified at least to FETAC level 5 by September of next year?  What will happen to people who are already employed in child care and have enrolled in FETAC courses but will not have completed the FETAC level 5 course by September of next year?  Will there be a period of grace to allow them to complete their qualification and continue on their career path?  I thank Mr. Jeyes for his attention.</p></speech>

Mr. Jeyes mentioned in his presentation that GALs instruct solicitors and barristers.  I seek clarification on whether Tusla ends up paying those bills.<br/>We have had discussions here before on reforming the GAL system and looked at other models of practice.  The matter has also come up from time to time in the Chamber.  When child protection services were hosted in the HSE - Deputies here will be familiar with the matter - when one met one's local area manager it was a case of closing long-term beds in a community hospital versus paying the legal bills.  With the establishment of the new agency, such choices no longer exist for community care local representatives.  However, a balance must be struck in terms of vindication of a child's rights and who is paying for it.  Who are the guardians <i>ad litem</i>?  Are they professionally qualified?  Why do they need additional legal support?  The legal costs are astronomical.  What purpose do they serve?  If we are taking away vital services for vulnerable children just to pay legal costs then we must tackle the issue.<br/>Where are we in terms of inspections of preschools following the &quot;Prime Time&quot; expos&eacute;?  We got figures here before the summer demonstrating that people were still not in post or there was a shortage of inspectors.  HIQA has a small number of inspectors in comparison with Tusla's inspectors for preschool services.  How efficiently are inspection resources being used?</p> <p>There are large areas that are not getting the same level of inspection as others and the children are losing out.</p><p> I ask Mr. Jeyes to talk about the risk with the 9,000 cases that are awaiting allocation.  What kinds of cases are involved?  Are they high risk or low risk?  Have they been assessed in any way?  I am concerned that if we have 9,000 people on a waiting list, what kind of a list are talking about?  Where, geographically, are these cases?  Where are the bottlenecks?  In what geographical areas are the resources lacking?  I have a sense that some parts of the country may not be under as much pressure as other parts, given the population spread throughout the country.</p></speech>

I have a question on children who are getting caught having fallen out of the school system, including even the primary school system.  I am involved with a centre that is looking after 30 young people at the moment.  The Department of Education and Skills has advised me that it is not its responsibility.  I accept we are dealing with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on the matter at the moment.  We had the strange situation that one of the religious orders was providing &euro;90,000 a year to run the centre.  It can no longer provide that funding.  The response from the Department of Education and Skills was that while it was regrettable, these 30 children would now have to go back to the schools from which they came.  The problem is that those schools do not want them back and we are falling between two stools on the matter.</p><p>  Someone in the private sector is willing to put up 50% of the funding to continue running the facility and everyone else is running away from it.  These 30 children would be on the streets only for this facility.  Eleven of the 30 children sat their junior certificate examinations this year.  Some of these children were referred to the centre by the school attendance officers because they were not fitting into the educational structure.</p><p>  How can we deal with that scenario?  We are just going day to day trying to keep the centre open.  We have about 60 people working voluntarily, all of them qualified teachers, and we are providing what is almost one-to-one education.  The Department has claimed it is not its responsibility and, as a result, 30 people may well fall out of the system completely.  How does Tusla deal with that kind of scenario?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.299" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gordon Jeyes" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014092500007#G00300"><p>I will begin with the issue of the deficit, which is perhaps not the most appropriate word.  It was not a case of us inheriting debt, but clearly in certain areas the amount of expenditure and commitments did not match the budget we have been allocated.  This was most obvious in legal services where expenditure in 2013 when it was not within our control was approximately &euro;34 million and the budget allocated to us was &euro;17 million.  As Deputy Troy rightly stated, there is clearly room for reform within that figure, but it is extremely difficult to do straight away.<br/>In addition we have been unable to find all the productivity gains that were sought under the Haddington Road agreement and we have asked to see the workings for how they came to the calculations for deductions from our budget.  Additional hours have been worked right across the board, but translating that into a saving has not been straightforward without, for example, reducing the social work workforce by in excess of 70 posts.  Given the pressures on it, that has not been done and we have not always been successful at finding alternative savings.<br/>Those were the main issues of pressure we inherited as well as the regular ones across Ireland in many services such as demography.  Clearly in the difficult circumstances Ireland has faced I do not expect demography automatically to lead to an increase - it would be the same in education and in health - but it cannot be ignored.  The Chairman has referred to the increased number of children in care.  That has come at a cost over the past five years of &euro;26 million.  Half of that would relate directly to a demographic uplift.  We wish to pay for these foster carers.  It is the right thing to do to take the services forward and we need to find that money from somewhere.  However, account should be taken of it when budgets are being reviewed.  That was the starting point.<br/>The transfer of staff happened smoothly.  One or two ends remain to be tied up in our relationship with the HSE, but it is far from the case that we have an excess of administrative staff.  Eventually the director of finance will be asked to produce reports - we are heading in that direction - through which we will be able to look at costs of each activity and what I call the corporate overhead, including non-productive things such as a chief executive and administrative support.  I fully expect ours to be among the very lowest in Ireland.  We have very few administrative staff and their contribution is greatly appreciated.  While in Galway recently I met a colleague who is on grade 3 and has a 16-hour contract.  She supported three or four separate social work teams and did a magnificent job.  We are stretched there.  Sometimes not having the right support for social work, educational welfare or other professional colleagues can lead to a loss of productivity.<br/>A number of members raised the issue of legal fees which we have been working hard to address.  The HSE is also reforming its system.  We have restricted to the stage that the use of counsel in District Court cases is almost non-existent, which should not have been necessary, and we have had a huge reduction there.  We have greatly reduced and control the number of people, whom we call legal service users, who can instruct.  I can give Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in an example of training.  There is detailed training to be in court.  An inexperienced social worker can find some of Ireland's judges a daunting experience.  One study showed that only in 8% of cases were there more witnesses than the social worker.  There is considerable scrutiny on individual young professionals, and rightly so because these are important decisions.<br/>Of the &euro;34 million, &euro;12 million is spent on guardians <i>ad litem</i>, including their legal cost.  I will ask Ms Eibhlin Byrne to comment further shortly.  Given that an important part of their job is scrutiny for us, it is not a matter we can control.  If that amount of money is taken out, we can see how little is left.  I fully expect and have as a target to reduce that expenditure year on year.  We have done so this year, but it will not show up immediately because we have also inherited a number of historical bills, particularly from counsel that had gone back and forth.  The Child and Family Agency Act made clear that we were responsible for all previous liabilities.<br/>We have made a good start to multi-agency working.  I make no apology for stressing it to this committee because it needs the scrutiny of the committee.  At a time of scant resources people can retreat into their professional silos and leave a gap.  We provide a welfare system.  A mental illness system begins at another point.  We must design systems to ensure there are overlaps.<br/>All the staff, as envisaged in the first phase responding to the task force report, came across, with some discussions still continuing on the area of psychology which will be concluded shortly.  The Government indicated at that point that it would give its response to the rest of the task force in due course, involving public health nurses, speech and language therapists and others.  That is a matter for the Minister and the Department.<br/>A number of members asked about early years.  The progress has been slow at points, which is a function of the resources we have available.  However, reports are now available online.  On staff to full complement, an additional six posts are being added as we speak, with an additional four managers, and run on a national basis so we can respond to inconsistencies and gaps.</p> <p>The average time between inspections was acceptable but there were far too many outliers such that the early years service had been a Cinderella service within the HSE.</p><p> While I defend the skills and qualities of public health nurses and recognise they have a considerable background in child development and an important role to play, I accept we need to move beyond the Labour Court ruling and have a more multidisciplinary force.  As in many countries, the early years sector, covering the years from birth to six, is an emerging and maturing one.  The range of people with appropriate skills and qualifications is just coming forward and I expect it to grow.</p><p> It is very important to emphasise that we have only one contribution to make to this.  There is a lot of work going on but we are not the lead agency.  We are not an improvement service but the regulator.  We need to make sure we are carrying out our role in a responsible and timely way.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in should note that we are certainly aware of social work training and the importance of continuing professional development.  We have had discussions with CORU and will shortly be publishing a continuing professional development strategy to ensure all colleagues are aware of their responsibilities and stay up to date.  We are providing opportunities for them.  We have a training service that is run on a national basis, and courses are being made available to ensure there is equitable access.  In a time of recession, training can get squeezed so we need to move towards our protected budget.  However, there will be an annual training plan on which we need to be held to account.</p><p> I confirm that it remains national policy for any child in care to be allocated a social worker.  I hope the committee will sense my unease over having the Minister quoted to me so regularly this morning.  He said something recently of which the committee is aware and I am not.  We will leave that to one side.</p></speech>

I am in the same place as Ireland's children, and for them I will continue to speak out.  There is a longer debate to be had on prioritisation.  Issues arise in this regard.  There are children in stable foster care arrangements and all the evidence shows that loving boundaries are set.  This occurs continually.  There are link workers and the foster family has an allocated social worker.  We know every relevant child should have a social worker allocated.  That is the regulation.  There is a longer debate to be had on how the regulation could be more nuanced, but the regulation is as it stands.  There has even been a slight dip in the figure, and it is openly reported to the Deputies in the appendix.  The difficulty can arise in turnover through posts changing and maternity leave.  Not all benefit from an allocation all the time.  We are adding to that in that I expect all children in the child protection notification system &ndash; this might be even more important &ndash; to have a social worker allocated.  In most areas, that is the case.  We will publish that as a statistic in due course.<br/>We need to rethink some of our practice, even in terms of regulation, as to how we work with children who are in relative or kinship care.  It is an important relationship and an important service, but it is different.  Perhaps we should not have the same sorts of rules.<br/>We did press the pause button on aftercare arrangements to make sure that what we were proposing was fair and equitable and not just focused on those for whom third level was suitable.  The latter get a good range of options, but there are others who need educational opportunities of a more practical nature, and we must support them.  Equally, we must not become a proxy service for health, education or housing.  Rather, we must advocate on behalf of young people to ensure they are getting access to the benefits and supports they deserve.  Our role is to prop up the system and ensure it is fair.  It is true there will be a ring-fenced budget and I expect consistent arrangements to be implemented by early 2015.  The ring-fenced budget will be in the order of &euro;16 million, and I expect to grow that.<br/>There has been an increase in the number of social workers.  The Deputy is quite right that there is fluctuation at present, but that is after the increase of 220 following the Ryan report.  Looking back five or six years, there will have been an increase of approximately 300 social workers.  It is a question of the multidisciplinary nature of the service and not just about social workers.<br/>I do not know where the figure of 70% came from.  At any given time there are approximately 160 of 1,200 posts vacant.  Some 50% of those vacancies are filled by agency staff because the pressures are too great.  That has decreased recently because 38 of the maternity posts are being filled through substantive contracts because this is more efficient.  We welcome the agreement with the unions on that.<br/>I cannot comment on the Ombudsman for Children's report.  It is important.  There are important historical and cultural issues to be considered.  I could not possibly offer a view on the reference to the matter not being properly investigated and on where the difference came from.  It seems that issues of a physical nature arise and, therefore, it may have cultural significance.  We only received the report in draft to comment on it at the same time as it went to the press, so it is as difficult for us to comment at the moment as it is for the members.  It is being examined and we will treat it with due seriousness.<br/>On direct provision, we have child protection responsibilities and hold child protection inquiries, and there is currently a HIQA investigation into the matter.  The improvements for unaccompanied asylum seekers, the majority of whom go to foster carers on being received in the country, are to Ireland's credit.  These asylum seekers are dispersed throughout the country and receive a good service.  Children who are received with their parents and who enter direct provision are, perhaps rightly, receiving attention.  It is a matter for the Government and the D&aacute;il because there can be no more important issue than how a country defines and defends its boundaries.  We will play our part within that guidance.<br/>I invite Ms Eibhlin Byrne to make some comments about guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  Following that, Mr. Fred McBride will talk about prioritisation and the 9,000 cases, as reported.</p></speech>

Every euro we spend on legal costs is one euro less available to us to spend on children's services.  None of us wants to spend less on them.  The reality is that the current system is broken and becoming increasingly adversarial.  In the absence of any mediation service, it is a very difficult space that is inhabited by children and families.  Operating within that system are social workers and the guardians <i>ad litem</i>.<br/>I will outline some of the steps we have taken.  One must bear in mind that the court is not a place where young social workers are comfortable.  For many of them, it is a very unpleasant place to work.  We have tried to assist, first by producing a new court report which outlines more clearly for judges the background to the case and what we are recommending.  Thus we are speaking the legal language required in a courtroom.  We have offered training to social workers to assist them in court.  We have reduced the number of legal service users authorised from more than 1,000 to fewer than 100, so people looking for legal services within our organisation are much more able to command such a service.  We have developed an in-house team of solicitors to deal with some of the work ourselves.<br/>We have spent &euro;6.2 million on solicitors to June 2014.  We have increased the competition by inviting in more firms.  In the time of austerity, when property and other areas became less fashionable, quite a few solicitors decided child care was an interest for them.  We are trying to control that market.  Where there are specific issues such as the Brussels II regulation or adoption, we are using centralised services.<br/>With regard to engaging counsel, which is a major cause of concern for us and which results in a very expensive legal fee, we spent &euro;934,000 on counsel up to June 2014.</p> <p>Only the chief executive or the executive manager can authorise counsel.  To June this year we only engaged on 25 occasions with senior counsel and 50 occasions with junior counsel.  These are largely either very complex cases or special care cases where we are taking a child into care and depriving them of liberty, meaning it is very important that all legal advice is sought.<br/>The guardians <i>ad litem</i>operate in that system and one must note there are some highly qualified, dedicated and devoted people working in that system; it is the system itself that is broken.  To June this year, the cost of guardians <i>ad litem </i>was &euro;3 million.  That takes in expenditure for travel, time and professional fees.  One must add to that &euro;2.69 million for solicitor fees and &euro;501,000 for senior counsel fees to June this year.  Very often, guardians <i>ad litem</i>in cases are calling on solicitors and barristers, sometimes in contested cases and other times not.  There are a number of issues with the guardian <i>ad litem </i>process.  There are costs associated with the system, as well as the expert witnesses very often called by the guardians and the various alternative routes suggested to courts and accepted.  All this adds, under section 47, to various elements which the agency is required to provide for the court.<br/>It is a broken system which absolutely needs a complete overhaul.  The entire legal system needs to be overhauled, as we need earlier intervention and mediation in order that many of the issues facing families can be dealt with before they ever come into court.  Once the parties come to court, it is a lose-lose position for the child and parent.  We need a less adversarial and a more consistent approach to our courts throughout the country and we need some kind of child advocate system to replace the current guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  It is true that although Tusla is the paymaster of the guardians <i>ad litem</i>, they are appointed by the court and we are not really entitled to oversee them, although we have looked at some of the expenses.  We cannot, for example, decide when a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is used, so a guardian <i>ad litem</i>from Donegal or Galway may be invited to take part in a Dublin court.  We pay the expenses and other matters, but we do not have oversight.  In general, there are many very dedicated people working in a system that is ultimately broken, and until the system is fixed, we will continue to pay legal fees.</p></speech>

We must examine mediation and how to keep issues out of court, as the court is no place for children and families to try to sort out family matters.  Judges do their best but they cannot try to solve a life of problems in a couple of hours in a courtroom.  The earlier we can have intervention and mediation, the better.<br/>With regard to guardians <i>ad litem</i>, we need a child advocate system, although this cannot be entirely separate from the child protection and welfare system, as this can lead to an adversarial system with this process.  We need to consider how to implement an advocate system within a mediation process and a properly run court system.  The system must be overhauled.</p></speech>

Before doing so, I might go back to the question raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in about direct provision.  We do not have dedicated child protection teams in each of those centres but we have such teams in each of the areas where the centres are located.  Those children are living with their parents, and we respond to any concerns raised in line with Children First guidelines.  We have also seconded a member of staff to liaise with the direct provision centres for a number of years, and that staff member can provide proactive information about child protection matters, how support can be received and key contacts within agencies.  It is a proactive service.</p><p>  The figures for unallocated cases are correct, with approximately 9,000 such cases up to July this year.  There are roughly 3,000 cases which we would describe as high priority.  These cases are high priority because of a need to allocate to a social worker.  I do not mean to play on words but that is not the same as saying the cases are high risk.  It acknowledges the need for a social worker but it is not to say the risks are either exceptionally high or immediate.  I can give absolute assurances that where we discover the risk is immediate or high, we deal with it immediately.  I am confident that is the case throughout the country.  With cases where it is acknowledged they should be allocated to a social worker, there are often other services and agencies working with the people on an ongoing basis.  We monitor those lists directly through duty and intake teams, and many cases are not in a position where they are not being worked at all.  They would be monitored but it is just they have not, as yet, been allocated to a longer-term social worker.</p><p>  There was a question raised about the numbers of social workers and if they are adequate.  In a number of areas we have recently piloted a detailed and sophisticated workload management system.  After the pilot activity, there were virtually no caseloads in the country deemed to be unmanageable, although one or two, for a temporary period, crept into an unmanageable category.  We took immediate management action, which is what the caseload management system is about, to bring cases back to a manageable category.  Caseloads are at the upper end of the busy category, but they are not unmanageable and we have applied a reasonably scientific system to measure it.  That will be rolled out across the country over the next few months.</p><p>  I emphasise the point made by Mr. Jeyes about children in care.  I accept that children in care are entitled to an allocated social worker, as standards dictate, and in most parts of the country that is the case.  There are one or two parts where it is not so, which brings the national average to between 85% and 90%.  That is a high number in international comparisons, although that does not detract from the fact that every child in care requires an allocated social worker.  A number of children in care are in very settled long-term foster placement, and prioritisation is always at play when children in the community may be in more urgent need of a social worker than somebody in a long-term placement.  We need to look after both types, and we are endeavouring to do so.</p></speech>

He did not indicate whether there was a ring-fenced figure for social worker training but said he had intended that there would be.  Is there currently a ring-fenced training budget for the profession of social worker?  The last point that was not responded to was my question on the FETAC level 5 qualification requirement in terms of child care workers.  There are a number who are affected by the deadline that has been signalled.  It would only be appropriate that some latitude would apply. </p></speech>

So far as training is concerned there will be a ring-fenced budget.  It is always a difficult term.  Areas will all have training budgets and there is a national training service, which is not singled out for any more reductions than the rest of us.  Within our business plans, we should have a target amount of the staffing budget which is allocated to supporting training.  Training is a personal responsibility, particularly for the professional group.  As employer, we have a responsibility to provide opportunities and experiences for training.  The committee should be looking for a specific amount in our budget that we would allocate to training and in respect of which we would be held accountable.</p><p>  I apologise for missing the question on child care workers.  It gives me the opportunity to rehearse again that we play only one small part.  My understanding is that a huge amount of work has taken place as the early years service in Ireland is modernised.  Its oversight rests with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and we play our part as regulator.  There are issues of training, employment of improvement staff, the audit of revenue and capital resources - the last rests with Pobal and the Department of Education and Skills has an interest particularly on the curriculum side.  I am not the best placed to answer the specific question on qualifications as it does not sit within the regulator's remit.  We are still committed to consulting on how we implement the standards, once the standards are confirmed, but as Deputy Troy said they have not yet been issued.  Our commitment is to consult with the sector on how we take that forward.  We are aware we have made that commitment.  As soon as we get that confirmed we will do that.</p><p>  An oversight on my part was that I did not respond to Senator Colm Burke's question.  If parents decide to hand over the education of a child to the State, the responsibility rests with the Department of Education and Skills.  It is our responsibility to make sure that children attend school.  We also have oversight of scrutiny of places when children are educated other than at school.  I do not know the details of the institution to which the Senator referred but I accept that we need a broader range of education facilities.  Not all of us are suited to classroom learning.  Some of us benefit from more practically-based learning.  The results that one sees from our special care establishments are because in the past few years, with our encouragement we have taken a much more practical based approach to getting young people to engage with their learning and to learn through doing.  The legislation confirms that the education welfare service will have the capacity to give guidance to a school, that it has to accept a youngster where buck passing has gone on and to handle that sensitively.  Schools are under pressure in these times of scarce resources but we need to ensure that young people get the education they deserve.  Schools are fully supported and resourced to be inclusive because that is the best type of early intervention. </p></speech>

I wish to deal briefly with psychology services, priority 15.  Am I correct in saying that a strategic plan has been developed and that Tusla is now hoping to complete negotiations with the HSE to take full responsibility for the area?  Is the delegation satisfied the negotiations are progressing because the HSE can often be a difficult organisation with which to negotiate and deal as those of us who have to do so are well aware.  Obviously much concern has been expressed in the past in respect of child and adolescent psychiatric services.  The whole area of psychology services is closely related, in most circumstances but not all, to the psychiatric services.  Has Mr. Jeyes engaged with child and adolescent psychiatry services as there is much concern around some issues in the whole area?  There is no doubt that there are some very good child and adolescent psychiatrists but concern has been expressed, mostly in regard to communications with families on a child's condition and sometimes even after-care with the psychiatrist in respect of the reluctance of some psychiatrists because of a traditional situation to engage the psychological services.  Has Mr. Jeyes plans to promote and develop the service?  I am aware he has strategic plan to develop the psychological services but can he do that without engaging in the plan itself with the child and adolescent psychiatric services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014092500010#K00700"><p>I welcome Mr. Gordon Jeyes and his team.  Tusla is a child protection, early intervention and family support agency.  This year Women's Aid Dundalk almost closed.  It provides services to women and their children who have experienced violence in the context of an intimidating relationship.  The work involves human rights, justice, sexual violence, accommodation, housing and homelessness.  Last year 293 people requesting shelter at Dundalk Women's Aid Refuge had to be refused.  Domestic violence is not a thing of the past.  The housing authority is responsible for its budget.  This year Tusla took over some areas of responsibility in the remit of the HSE, including care costs.  What is the position of Tusla and Women's Aid going forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014092500010#K00800"><p>I welcome the delegation and thank it for its presentations.  It has been reported that there are 160 vacant posts and that Tusla is currently operating at 70% staffing levels.  This morning we heard from the Minister that currently there are 82 people on maternity leave.  Why are there so many vacant posts and what is the impact of the extra workload on staff already under so much strain?  What action is Tusla taking to ensure it has adequate resources to fund the child and family agency?  What is the likelihood of success with the new Meitheal project if it is not adequately resourced and how is it currently being progressed?</p><p>  Will Mr. Jeyes comment on whether after-care has a ring-fenced budget and whether the resources available are adequate to ensure implementation of the national policy?  I understand that supports that were available to care leavers in the past are currently being curtailed due to budget restrictions.  A growing number of young people who leave State child services are becoming homeless when they reach 18 years of age.  Nearly 40% live in circumstances which put them at risk.  Will Mr. Jeyes please comment on that issue?  Mr. Jeyes has already said that the allocation of social workers is an entitlement provided for under the Child Care Act.</p> <p>It is reported that there are currently 9,000 cases awaiting initial social worker assessment.  How long do people have to wait for assessment and what plans are being put in place to prepare for the unexpected rise in the number of referrals to Tusla when the Children First Bill is enacted?  </p><p> Mr. Jeyes stated in his presentation that it is important to remember that children are not at risk because they are in the care of the State but are placed in the care of the State because they are at risk.  How many, if any, children have since the foundation of Tusla reported abuse or maltreatment while in State care and how many children have gone missing from care while under its remit?  </p><p> With regard to the posting of inspection reports on the Pobal website, it is often said that these are difficult to locate.  Are there any plans to fund a new ICT system?  My final question relates to direct provision.  Mr. Jeyes stated in response to an earlier question that there are no dedicated child protection teams in this area.  Has he had meetings on this issue with the Department of Justice and Equality?  If not, does he plan to do so?  Mr. Jeyes also said that direct provision was a matter for Government and the D&aacute;il.  Perhaps he would elaborate on how we can help.</p></speech>

What was the cumulative deficit under each section of the carry-over?  It should be possible to calculate the cumulative deficit if we know the carry-over for each section.  Mr. Jeyes said that he accepts the need for a more multidisciplinary approach to inspections.  In response to an earlier question from me in this regard he cited the Labour Court ruling but failed to cite the number of that ruling.  A lot of people are interested in knowing that number.</p><p>  It was reported in the media a number of weeks ago that Mr. Jeyes believes Tusla, to stand still, will require an additional &euro;45 million next year.  Has he contemplated the implications for the service if that additional &euro;45 million is not provided?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gordon Jeyes" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014092500011#L00300"><p>On Deputy Neville's questions, discussions with the HSE on psychology are constructive.  When I arrived in Ireland I said that I hoped to bring some evidence-based impatience to issues.  Often when negotiating, impatience will do.  It has taken too long.  We now have a much more detailed service level agreement for psychology because of our statutory responsibilities for the remainder of this year.  We need to move to a stage whereby, in partnership with the HSE, there is a national psychology strategy covering all aspects.  Legally, there are three reasons for access to psychology: mental health, which sits with that relevant director in the HSE; services for people and children affected by disability, again the responsibility of the HSE and, as per the Child and Family Agency Act, general access for children and families, which rests with us.  Each should have their cohort of psychologists but should be working together on a national strategy and using primary care where possible as the delivery mechanism.  I am satisfied that current discussions are constructive and I am confident that the Minister has full experience and understanding of these matters and can bring them to a conclusion in 2015.</p><p>  On Deputy McLellan's question regarding vacant posts, there are 160 vacant posts at any one time, 50% of which are filled by agencies.  In other words, at any one time there may be approximately 80 vacant posts.  There are two reasons for this, including, first, that until recently not all maternity leave was immediately covered.  We are now starting to do that.  Second, we need to reform and improve and make more responsive our recruitment processes, which from my perspective are too bureaucratic.  The gap between somebody leaving, even after notice, and another person arriving, even if the system works perfectly, is unacceptably long.  Tusla is a customer of shared services with the HSE.  We have not yet got right that customer orientation.  I often jest that it is a bit like Costa Rica having a shared service agreement with the USA.  Shared services are the way forward but where one agency is tiny and the other is large it can be a difficult process.</p><p>  On resources, resources are tight but services are improving.  The most important cases are being dealt with.  Staff are to be commended in this regard, including Meitheal.  I know from my travels around the country that there are parts of this country where the number of referrals are decreasing because of the excellent partnership working with family resource centres, schools and other community bodies.  It is not true to say that services are not being provided.  They are.  Meitheal is working in terms of ensuring the focus is on meeting the interests of the child. </p><p>  I am surprised to hear that after-care in some areas is being curtailed.  It is a priority area.  If the Deputy is aware of individual cases where this is not the case my colleagues will look into them.  The problem with after-care, as with many of our services, is that previously it was inconsistent.  By international standards, our current after-care arrangements are good.  To let one risk-taking young person down is to let down one too many.  In some parts of the country there was not sufficient support in place.  We need to ring-fence the budget and create specific standards and ensure we not only support those youngsters who remain in education but those who choose to remain in foster care.  We will fund that irrespective of their education arrangements.  Those involved will at that stage be adults and as such there will be no free ride.  We need to broaden the range of experiences and opportunities available.  Mr. Eglington told me only this morning that he is undertaking an internship with a travel agency with the prospect of employment.  That is superb.  We need more of those types of opportunities.</p><p>  In regard to the homelessness figures mentioned, I do not recognise them.  One person homeless is one too many.  There are children who are homeless or who have housing difficulties because of the pressures building on their families.  There are difficulties for young people in after-care because like others on benefits they are being priced out of the rental market in some of Ireland's cities.  We need to look at social protection resources in this regard because many of those concerned are ending up in areas where we do not want them to be.  On the 9,000 cases mentioned, all cases are assessed but some are held at the in-take level before allocation and, as stated by Mr. McBride, given support in other ways.  People are not left aside until we get to them.  There is a process they must go through.  As I said earlier, in some areas referrals are decreasing because services are improving.  We need to get on the front-foot and to work with parents.  We are happy on another occasion to walk members through the service delivery framework.</p><p>  On the number of children missing in care, this varies at any given time.  At the time of my meeting with the Garda Commissioner last week the number for 2014 still missing was one.  That may have changed by now.  In other words, that youngster may well have been found.  More often than not, those concerned drift back to their families or friends or a particular relationship.  On the question regarding early years and Pobal, I agree with Deputy McLellan that while the service being provided is a big step forward it is nowhere near good enough.  We have written to the Department and asked for funding for a new system.  Investment is being made in this area and we want some of it.</p><p>  Direct provision is a difficult issue.</p> <p>Countries do not survive by throwing their boundaries open.  We will play our part, but countries must decide through the justice system what are their arrangements.  We are servants in that respect.  That is what I meant by that.</p><p> Eibhlin Byrne will comment on the issue raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-09-25a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eibhl&iacute;n Byrne" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014092500012#M00200"><p>The development of services for domestic violence around the country has been, at best, inconsistent and sporadic.  That is because refuges were historically built in areas either because capital was available or because local fund-raising enabled the refuge to be built.  Those refuges were often shared as homeless shelters and domestic violence refuges.  The changing arrangements in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, particularly regarding section 10 funding, have led to difficulties.  It has been a difficulty in the instance mentioned by the Deputy.  We are engaged in discussions with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to examine how these refuges will be funded into the future.  We cannot have a situation where the same beds are being used for homelessness and domestic violence incidents because when homelessness becomes long term, there is no longer a bed available for a woman or children who are suffering domestic violence.</p><p>  We have taken a number of steps.  Along with entering discussions with the Department, we have also undertaken a review of the services we are delivering.  The amounts given to these services were traditionally divided among a number of Departments.  Under the Child and Family Agency Act they are all under the remit of Tusla, so approximately &euro;16 million is now available for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.</p><p>  We have undertaken an audit of what the budgets are around the country, so for the first time we now know how much is spent on services throughout the country.  We have also carried out geo-mapping of the locations.  Due the historical nature of how these services developed, there are many in some areas and none in others.  While regionally they might be well balanced, they are not balanced within areas.  Following the geo-mapping, we will carry out a needs analysis and decide how services will be delivered around the country.  It will be based on needs, but we will also look at international best practice.  A domestic violence refuge is no place to bring up children.  Children and families have spent too long in refuges.  It is the policy of Tusla to provide emergency accommodation in the first place, such as in the refuges, but also to look at investing in community supports so that children and families can remain at home or at least in the community, so the refuges are not the only alternative open to them.</p><p>  There are difficulties and section 10 is a particular problem for us.  Renewed and reviewed audits of budgets and locations are necessary and they will be introduced by Tusla in the last quarter of this year, with a new roadmap for services for 2015 to 2017 being provided.</p></speech>

With reference to the question about aftercare, we have approximately 1,600 care leavers per year.  At the end of July, I was made aware of only four who had ended up in hostel accommodation directly after their care placement.  There were explanations for all four of them.  The four had ended up there as a result of a crisis.  Their placement had temporarily broken down and they had ended up there through our out-of-hours service or crisis intervention service.  They were very quickly removed from that hostel accommodation either back into their placement or into an appropriate aftercare placement.</p><p>  I am aware of some information being bandied around by Focus Ireland and others as to there being large numbers in that category.  I have yet to see that substantiated.  When I looked into some of that information, it transpired that some of those young people were well into their 20s, so they were not leaving care.  They might have been termed "care leavers" but they had been away from care for a number of years and thereafter ended up in homeless accommodation.  It is regrettable, but these people were not directly leaving care at 18 years of age.  That point should be made.</p></speech>

Are there figures for the number of children going missing from direct provision centres?</p></speech>

I would have to look into it.  With regard to children in care, particularly residential care, we will soon have a very sophisticated database that will give us real time information about children who may have absconded or who may be missing.  That will come on stream very soon.  I do not have information on the direct provision question.</p></speech>

When I arrived, they did not reconcile but they do now.  There are some issues with young people who might have been children when they went missing historically and who are still on the PULSE system.  That was when there was a large number of unaccompanied asylum seekers.  However, as I reported earlier, when we looked at it two weeks ago the number, including asylum seekers, was one.  We know about that child and expect him to turn up.</p><p>  The director of finance will respond on the financial matters and I will reply to the question about consequences from Deputy Troy.</p></speech>

It received an additional &euro;6.8 million in capital funding.  That is the funding position.  In terms of identifying the areas where efficiencies needed to be made, the CEO has indicated that there were two main areas.  One was the legal spending area where there was a spend of &euro;34 million identified for 2013 and a budget of &euro;17.5 million against that.  Obviously efficiencies and reductions were required in that area to meet that target.  The other area where significant efficiencies were required related to the reductions under the Haddington Road agreement.  A total of &euro;12.7 million efficiencies were required to be made in that year.  As the CEO has pointed out, part of the achievement of that would have been from the reduction in staff of approximately 70 wholetime equivalents, WTEs, relating to the additional times under the Haddington Road agreement.  The rest of it remained efficiencies that had to be met from other areas.</p><p>  In addition to that, we would have projected in 2014 an expected increase of approximately &euro;2 million in the payment of what we refer to as cash allowances, effectively payments for foster care and aftercare.  In total, we identified &euro;31 million in efficiencies that had to be made in 2014.</p></speech>

There was a combination of major services from the HSE, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency, together with the school completion programme.</p></speech>

Appendix 1 of the papers provided to the committee shows the main components of our budget.  I do not believe much further saving can be achieved from paying allowances.  Our administration support is extremely lean and we have noted how vital education welfare officers and social work, social care and family support staff are.  Similarly, foster care is important and the number of children benefiting from foster care support increases each year.  That is a given.  Even a small reduction, therefore, will tend to fall on the other areas.  Reducing private residential and private foster care will also be difficult because the trend is in the other direction.</p> <p>We can turn that around, but not overnight.  We are public servants and we will deliver the top priority and core services efficiently from the budget we are given.  Clearly, if the budget is not in line with our current demands, there will be significant pressure on the grants and supports we can offer to outside agencies and on the work normally categorised as early intervention.  This may or may not have consequences further down the line.  I would argue that our main duty will be to keep safe those children who are at immediate risk.  We will have a budget to continue to do that.</p></speech>

If the budget is not what Mr. Jeyes expects it to be, children in the medium risk and low risk categories will have to move into the high risk category before they are seen.</p></speech>

In light of where Ireland remains in 2014, prioritisation will be required.  Having worked through the boom years when Governments were handing out money, I suggest we should always need to prioritise and make sure we are spending in an efficient and cost-effective way.</p></speech>
