Last month the Minister for Education and Skills referred to the committee the general scheme of the technological universities Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The joint committee agreed to seek written submissions from a list of key stakeholders by 28 March 2014.  To progress the matter further this meeting will hear from eight of the stakeholders.<br/>I welcome Professor Brian Norton from the Dublin Technological University Alliance steering group, which represents DIT, IT Blanchardstown and IT Tallaght; Mr. Paul Hannigan, representing Institutes of Technology Ireland; Mr. Glenn Fitzpatrick, representing DIT students' union in conjunction with the students' unions at IT Blanchardstown and IT Tallaght; Mr. Tony Donohoe, representing IBEC;  Mr John MacGabhann, representing the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI; Mr. Tom Boland, representing the Higher Education Authority; Mr. Ned Costello, representing the Irish Universities Association; and Dr. Padraig Walsh, representing Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI. <br/>Before commencing with the presentations I wish to advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

We are working together to produce a technological university for Dublin, emphasising a practice-based student experience to complement the more research-led experience in traditional universities while continuing to embrace the diversity of students, offering real flexibility in learning and in the pace and place of learning - on campus and online - and retaining the three existing campuses, DIT in Grangegorman, and the campuses in Blanchardstown and Tallaght.  The aim is to create a new type of university graduate who has core skills but is innovative, creative and entrepreneurial.  The institution aims to be a true force for innovation and the international standing of Ireland.</p><p>  We welcome the legislation, which supports the idea of a new frontier for Irish higher education, providing a diversity of institutions that meet different learners' needs and the different needs of society, stakeholders and industry, while also driving forward the quality of talent.</p> <p>Talent is seen as the key driver for economic and cultural success and social inclusion within Ireland.  The general scheme outlines clearly the main objectives of a technological university, with which we are in agreement.  We also are in agreement with the proposal for a very strong model of governance which is based on competency but also rooted in the locality.  An important consideration in bringing together institutions which have particular localities is that they would continue to serve those localities well.  There is a balance to be struck between focusing on the locality and seeking to achieve very strong competence-based governance.</p><p> The legislation makes provision for flexibility in the workplace and in financial management, particularly in respect of supporting new enterprise development.  That is critical.  Indeed, the long tradition within the three institutions of supporting new business development is as important as supports for foreign direct investment.</p><p> Our detailed submission contains a number of technical points to do with the legislation, which I will not go into here.  I will, however, draw members' attention to the point that in respect of the processes to merge institutions before moving forward to seek designation, there is no specific provision during the merged phase for an academic council or senate which would draw from the constituent institutions.  That is an issue we would like to see addressed.</p><p> In broad terms, the proposals could be said to strike too much of a focus around particular numbers of students and so on, which might reduce our flexibility into the future.  We have a commitment to work collaboratively with students, colleagues, social partners and external stakeholders.  It is important that the legislation would enable us to realise a system of higher education delivery that is relevant to Ireland's future needs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hannigan" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014041600004#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before the committee to discuss the draft general scheme of the technological universities Bill.  Institutes of Technology Ireland welcomes the Minister's publication of the document as another milestone in the implementation of the national strategy for higher education.  As we embark on this task, I am sure we all share the view that the overall objective should be a coherent, high-quality, vibrant and nimble higher education system which provides an excellent service to students, society and the economy at the lowest achievable cost.  We have provided a written submission to the committee, some of the main points of which I will touch on in the time available to me.</p><p>  There has been a substantial productivity increase in higher education institutions in recent years, with student numbers increasing by 25,000 and staff numbers reducing by approximately 2,000.  On the budgetary side, in the period 2003 to 2012, real Exchequer expenditure per student in Ireland increased by 16.4% at first level and 11.6% at second level.  At third level, on the other hand, there has been a decrease of 20% in real expenditure per student over the same period.  On the capital side, a devolved grant to higher education institutions has not been made since 2011, which has led to a decline in campus infrastructure and core facilities for students, such as information technology equipment.</p><p>  In regard to governance, we are strongly of the view that defining the reserved and executive responsibilities of the governing body and president, respectively, is a model of good institutional governance.  These provisions were made in the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 and are working well in practice.  We do not agree with the suggested role for an academic council, which would, in our view, compromise the roles of the governing body and president.  We have concerns also about the proposal under head 55 that the Minister would have an unfettered right to impose agreements on higher education institutions to which they are not a party.  Unfortunately, that practice has happened already, notwithstanding legislation to the contrary.  Also under the governance heading, we are proposing that the Higher Education Authority Act, which is now 43 years old, be amended to clarify the respective functions of the authority itself and the executive staff.</p><p>  A significant change we are seeking in the draft general scheme is to have all existing institutes of technology classified as designated awarding bodies.  The institutes have been making their own awards for close to a decade on the basis of an authority originally delegated to them by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, and, latterly, by its successor body, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  The successful operation of delegated authority over this period, which was granted to the institutes following an extensive series of external reviews, attests to the academic maturity of the sector and its unwavering commitment to delivering high-quality taught and research programmes underpinned by robust quality assurance processes which are owned by the institutes themselves.  As we attempt, in line with the national strategy for higher education, to move beyond a simplistic binary notion of a higher education system towards a system of coherent, diverse and collaborating higher education institutes, HEIs, we must recognise the achievement of the institutes in the quality assurance arena and establish their awarding powers on the same footing as their fellow HEIs in order to enhance their capacity for working together. </p><p>   I will conclude by asking the committee to bear the overall objective in mind when considering the draft general scheme and, at a later stage, the Bill itself.  I am happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

These proposals are of profound interest to the student unions because they provide for the merger of our three institutes of technology and, ultimately, the creation of a technological university out of the merger process.  As the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, said around the time of the launch of the heads of Bill, these proposals represent a potentially seismic shift in the delivery of third level education in Ireland.  Given the once-in-a-lifetime nature of the proposals being considered by the committee, we in the three student unions are eager to ensure the final legislation is fit for purpose from a student and wider societal perspective.  In particular, we are anxious that it should accommodate the appropriate and active involvement of all stakeholders, including students, in the governance and day-to-day running of the new institutions on the basis of autonomy, equity and parity of esteem.  In this context, it is important that the legislation facilitates and supports the mergers of the student unions involved in order to ensure strong, independent student input.<br/>We have proposed a number of changes to the heads of Bill that would make the proposed legislation more inclusive and respectful of the rights, responsibilities and autonomy of all stakeholders, particularly students.  In broad terms, the changes we are proposing are to do with important definitional matters, governance structures and processes, and processes through which the technological universities will be created.  There are several definitional issues that need to be amended in the Bill itself to make the legislation more inclusive and fairer from a student perspective.  We are calling for changes to the definition of &quot;student&quot; and &quot;student union&quot; to ensure unions are clearly defined as independent bodies set up and controlled by students and which provide fair and democratic representation for students in a manner that is untrammelled by fear or favour.  In addition, it is important that unions' roles in providing commercial services at reduced rates to students would be reflected in the Bill.<br/>In regard to<b></b>the objectives and functions of a technological university, we are broadly happy with what is proposed in the heads of the Bill.  We recommend, however, that the proposed function in regard to collaboration be broadened to include the staff and students of the technological universities as well as the other interests mentioned.  We are also recommending that the provision on academic freedom be broadened so that students, too, would have the freedom, along with staff, &quot;to question and test received wisdom, put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions&quot; and that they &quot;shall not be disadvantaged for the exercise of that freedom&rdquo;.<br/><i></i>The final definitional issue we wish to raise relates to fees.  In order to ensure transparency and equity, we are proposing that the provision at head 69(1) be amended to include a specific statement that fees can be used to fund an independent student union as well as the other services set out in that provision.<br/>On governance, we in the three student unions are largely in agreement with the overall shape of the governing body proposed for the new institutions.  In particular, we welcome the proposal that a majority of its members be external and representative of broader society.  However, we would like more certainty in terms of the level of representation for the different stakeholders in order to ensure fairness and proportionality between the different interests.  In this context, we would like the legislation to provide for the nomination by the student union of two undergraduate students and one postgraduate student to the governing body.  In addition, we are recommending that provision should be made for the inclusion of at least one local authority representative on the body to ensure linkages with local authorities and the communities within which the institutions are located.<br/>In regard to<b></b>the academic council for the technological universities, we are recommending that its functions be broadened to include approval of all programmes of study, making recommendations for the award of all degrees, and ensuring the university has a quality assurance system that complies with European standards and guidelines.  On the composition of the council, the heads of Bill propose that it include an appropriate number of students.  Unfortunately, common practice in the third level sector is that students comprise only a small minority of such councils, notwithstanding the role of such bodies in addressing issues of fundamental importance to students and their studies.  On the basis of the principle of parity of esteem, we see no reason why students should not comprise up to half the membership of the academic council.<br/>Our final point in regard to governance concerns the provision at head 60 dealing with dispute resolution, including those with the student union.  Based on our own experience in DIT, this provision needs to be streamlined.  As it stands, procedures relating to disputes between management and the student union are established only following consultation with staff representatives, even though the disputes do not involve those staff, thereby delaying the resolution process.  This is not satisfactory.</p> <p>On the process of establishing a technological university, we recommend the proposed criteria that the merged institutes of technology will have to meet be made by including the following: evidence of a high level of engagement of the institute with learners and the wider community as well as the other stakeholders set out in the heads of the Bill; the quality of educational provision of the institute should be informed by the needs of wider society and well as by those of enterprise; and that all<font color="#FF0000"></font>academic staff above assistant lecturer level should have a professional qualification in learning or teaching or will have achieved same within two years of appointment.<br/>The heads of the Bill provides for the appointment by the HEA of a five-person panel to consider an application by an institution for designation as a technological university.  In this context, we feel it is fair and reasonable that there be a student input into this process through Union of Students in Ireland nominating a person to sit on such an the advisory panel.<br/>One other issue we would like to address is a provision to allow the technological universities to put charters in place such as a student charter, a matter that is addressed in the 1997 Universities Act but not in the heads of the Bill.  We recommend that this omission should be addressed.<br/>The creation of the technological universities is one of the most profound changes to take place in the Irish educational landscape.  It is important that the institutions that emerge from this process help to drive forward our economy and society and also provide a template for a new way of doing business - one that is more respectful, democratic and inclusive of all stakeholders and sections of our society than our traditional universities have been.  We hope our submission contributes to this process.  I thank the committee once again for the opportunity to make this presentation and we look forward to engaging with the members further regarding Committee Stage of the Bill. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Donohoe" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014041600005#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it on a important issue for the business sector.  I am here explicitly to talk on behalf of the business sector.  I want to briefly raise some points that are covered in a more detailed submission which has been circulated to committee and I would be pleased to address any issues the members may wish to raise.</p><p>  IBEC believes that the proposed technological university offers considerable scope to improve how business and higher education institutions work together on a range of issues.  These include the development of more work-ready graduates; the provision of employee education and training; more effective knowledge transfer between higher education and business; and a structure that acknowledges the importance of close-to-market research and provides consulting-problem-solving services, particularly for small and medium enterprises.  There are many good examples of the above strengths in the existing institutes of technology.  The sector has a strong regional presence and well-developed links with local businesses.  However, from a business standpoint, it is critical that the proposed technological university designation is not a relabelling exercise of existing institutes of technology.  The proposed change of status should drive improved performance.  It should stimulate the development of a new type of institution with a distinct mission and a character that differentiates it from existing universities.  That is why this Bill is so important.  In order to deliver on these ambitions, the technological universities need to be agile, responsive, engaged with the business community and, most of all, they need to be delivering high quality teaching and research.  Governance plays a critical role in all of this.</p><p>  IBEC welcomes the objectives set out under section 50.  We particularly welcome the emphasis on supporting entrepreneurship, enterprise development and a skilled workforce. The emphasis on collaboration with business and other education institutions is also welcome.  Where we would respectfully suggest the draft Bill could be improved is around its provisions concerning quality and institutional autonomy.  There is very little specific mention of quality in any of the heads of the Bill.  In considering this issue, the joint committee could draw on the work of the technological universities quality framework project which is already under way and doing some excellent work in this regard.  This states that at the heart of the technical universities' mission is the provision of education and training programmes across levels 6 to 10 of national framework of qualification.  The draft Bill does not specifically mention this breadth of provision.</p><p> There is an important related point on funding, on which my colleagues from the institutions have already touched.  During the past six years expenditure per third level student has fallen significantly at a time when competitor countries are increasing investment.  We have reached a tipping point in terms of the impact of these funding cuts on quality.  This message is beginning to reach international audiences and will undermine our efforts to attract mobile investment.  </p><p>  My second substantive point relates to institutional autonomy.  International evidence suggests there is a strong correlation between university performance and self-determination.  At a time when deregulation is regarded as a more efficient way of organising so many other areas of economic activity, the Irish university sector remains highly regulated, particularly in terms of HR management. </p><p>  The suggested provisions in head 55, which provides a directive power to the Minister on remuneration, numbers of public servants and collective agreements, undermine the concept of institutional autonomy.  Higher education institutions need the autonomy to set strategic direction, manage income streams, and manage and reward performance to attract the best teaching and research staff.  With autonomy comes accountability.  The Higher Education Authority is already doing some very worthwhile work with its new performance evaluation framework and the addition of other metrics around employer engagements, students' satisfaction etc. will set a more realistic performance framework through which to direct universities.  </p><p>  IBEC wishes to thank the committee for the opportunity to present its views on this important legislation.  We would suggest its enactment proceeds as speedily as possible.  Five years have passed since the launch of a process to develop a national strategy for higher education.  The technological university is one component.  In the interim, there has been significant uncertainty in the sector which has been exacerbated by the funding cuts that I mentioned.  This legislation will mark an important milestone in the reform process. </p></speech>

This short oral presentation supplements the main union submission which has already been provided to the committee.  We will attempt to address five generic concerns of the TUI in this presentation.  They relate to collective agreement, transfer of undertakings, information and consultation, regional provision and access, and academic freedom and tenure.  By way of context, I should explain that the TUI is the recognised trade union for academic and research staff who work in the institute of technology sector.  More than 4,000 of our members work in the sector and they develop, lecture on and are engaged in research in relation to the full range of higher education programmes on the national framework of qualifications from level 6, which typically would be apprenticeships and professional development courses directly to business, to level 10, which would be doctoral studies.</p><p>  In terms of collective agreement, the members of the TUI voted to accept the Haddington Road agreement in 2013.  We registered this collective agreement with the Labour Relations Commission and this agreement provides both for security of employment and continuity of employment.  There is a possible tension between the provisions of the heads of the Bill for technological universities and the Haddington Road agreement.  The TUI requires and is entitled to expect that the protections of the Haddington Road agreement will prevail and will apply to our members for the full duration of the agreement.  This, as far as we are concerned, is of fundamental importance to any proposed restructuring of the higher education institutions.  </p><p>  Linked to that is a concern we have in regard to the transfer of undertakings, or rather the absence of reference to that in the heads of the Bill.  We are extremely concerned that the statutory instrument, the protection of employees on the transfer of undertakings regulations 2003, is not referenced in the heads of the Bill and we demand that clear provision be made in the Bill relating to the terms of this statutory instrument.  We will vigorously oppose, and make no apology for it, any attempt to transfer our members either to a merged institute or a technological university, which is further down the line, unless the terms of the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations, TUPE, essentially apply.</p> <p> We are unequivocal in insisting that the terms of collective agreements on remuneration, terms of employment, conditions of service and pensions will continue in cases where a transfer might occur.  We will also insist that all our members are transferred to the new entity.  We do not accept as valid the provision in the heads of the Bill that on "establishment day" of a merged entity or a technological university, staff could be arbitrarily transferred to other public sector bodies other than the merged entity or technological university.  An attempt to effect such transfers on such an arbitrary and quixotic basis will be opposed, if necessary my means of industrial action, as we are a trade union.</p><p> I must be frank in respect to information and consultation as there are differences of approach in respect of some of the proposed amalgamations that are emerging, some of which are better by a distance than others.  The TUI considers that, broadly speaking, there is an unacceptable absence from the heads of the Bill of robust provisions for real and meaningful consultation with trade unions - and therefore the staff they represent - and the provision of full, relevant information prior to any decision to either merge or apply for university designation.  We believe that the heads of the Bill must expressly reference the terms of the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006.  We have raised these concerns with institutes of technology already that have not engaged in adequate consultation and have not provided the required information relating to plans to merge with other institutes.  We have formally stated that where consultation and information are not fully provided for, we will utilise whatever options and mechanisms are available to us to protect the interests of members.  I should in fairness say that the level of engagement with the Dublin Technological University, DTU, has been markedly better than has been the case in respect of some of the amalgamations that are being proposed, for example, in Munster - loosely referred to as MTU, Munster Technological University - and in Connacht.  However, the depth of the engagement does not suffice.</p><p> In terms of regional provision we are very concerned that the heads of the Bill, if implemented as currently drafted, could lead to a dramatic reduction in regional provision of programmes and a corresponding inequity in respect of access to higher education.  The root of our concern is that this could become simply a means to rationalisation.  Of itself, rationalisation may occasionally have merit but it can equally do huge damage to the regional provision.  The institutes of technology, IOT, sector is charged with and renowned for the regional provision of programmes which meet the needs of local industry, enterprise and communities.  Local provision also directly enhances access to higher education programmes, particularly for students whose family income would not allow them to study away from home.  That has become more pronounced in recent years.  A regional provision has also greatly reduced inequality based on income level.  That is borne out by the fact that enrolments in the IOT sector are broadly speaking on a par with enrolments in the university sector.  Also, because of our concern about increasing inequity, which we see manifest, the TUI is opposed to the heads of the Bill allowing the Higher Education Authority and new technological universities to introduce new student fees or essentially increase student fees.</p><p> The TUI fully supports the traditional principle of academic freedom.  That is a prerequisite for university status throughout the world and has, arguably, greater significance now than ever before given what we perceive as an ideological drift towards privatisation.  We make a clear distinction between academic freedom and institutional autonomy.  We regard the former - academic freedom - as being the absolute prerequisite.  In practical terms, academic freedom is inextricably linked to security of tenure.  The heads of the Bill seeks to reduce security of tenure by removing, for example, the need for a ministerial inquiry in the case of dismissal.  I admit that is an extreme example.  The TUI is opposed to that and is concerned about the impact such a change would have on academic freedom and the quality it assures.  Without tenure of employment the principle of academic freedom is merely window dressing.  We insist that tenured employment must be set at an appropriate proportion of the academic population.  We suggest it should be in the region of 95% for academic and research staff.  We are very concerned in this regard therefore about the casualisation of the academic workforce which has occurred in recent years, not exclusively as a result of the recession.  We are particularly concerned about the continued use of precarious employment contracts, including the odious zero hours or variable hours contracts.  Such contracts frequently purport to create flexibility or "teaching only" positions but in our view the very concept of a teaching-only provision in the academic context at third level is itself a contradiction in terms and is entirely inappropriate to the democratic functioning of higher education institutions.</p></speech>

This reform is focussed on consolidating the higher education institutions into a smaller number of institutions, forming a well co-ordinated and coherent system of institutions, each with a clear mission, delivering quality outcomes for students and addressing national objectives set by the Minister and the Government.  The draft legislation supports important elements of that reform and as such it is very welcome.  It provides the legal avenue for the consolidation of institutes of technology and for the process for the designation of technological universities.  Both of those are central aspects to the restructuring of the system.</p><p>  Arising from the publication of the higher education strategy in 2011, the HEA has, with other key stakeholders in the education system, been involved in the development and implementation of the reform programme &ndash; the most comprehensive reform programme in the history of the State.  This reform programme is also an important element in the Government&rsquo;s overall programme of reform of the public service.  In addition to the national strategy document itself, the reform is based on the publication of other major policy advice from the HEA to the Minister for Education and Skills, including Landscape for Higher Education, which dealt with issues of consolidation and co-operation of the existing higher education institutions; Future Labour Market Demand for Higher Education Graduates; pilot surveys of students and employers on their perspectives on higher education; a review of initial teacher education and commencement of a programme of consolidation of 19 existing centres into six major centres of excellence; and criteria and process for designation as technological university.</p><p>  The HEA has also commenced the implementation of a new approach to system governance and the funding of higher education known as strategic dialogue.  The key focus of this process is to better align institutional performance to national objectives set by the Government and to fund the institutions in part by reference to outcomes.  Arising from this process each higher education institution will enter into an agreement with the HEA as to how it will address national objectives and the measures by which its performance is to be assessed.  By way of a side note, I support the comments by Tony Donohue from IBEC on the proposals on pay and conditions set out in the Bill.  It seems to me that the strategic dialogue process and the funding that could be tied to it is a much more effective way of ensuring accountability for abiding by pay and conditions than statutory provisions set out in the Bill.</p><p>   The first round of this dialogue process is now nearing completion and the HEA will shortly provide the Minster for Education and Skills with the first report of the performance of the higher education system under this new approach.  The process will be developed year-on-year, as all parties, including the HEA, gain experience and deeper understanding.</p><p>  As has already been mentioned in previous submissions, it should be noted that this programme of reform is being undertaken in an environment of severe resource constraints on the institutions and strong growth in demand from students.  This both reinforces the need for reform but also adds to the challenges and risks.  A new strategy for the financial sustainability of the system is needed to ensure that we adopt an appropriate funding model for higher education that balances the demand for graduates with the quality of outcomes.</p> <p>The heads provide for the process and criteria for technological university designation.  The creation of technological universities is a significant development in the higher education system, with the potential to provide a new and welcome dimension to higher education provision, especially in the technological sector.  I welcome IBEC's comments on that.  It is essential, however, that any such university is capable of achieving recognition as a university at both national and international levels.  It is for this reason that a fair but rigorous process as well as clear criteria must surround the setting up of such universities, and the heads will provide for that.<br/>The HEA welcomes the changes proposed in respect of the governing authorities of technological universities and institutes of technology.  We particularly welcome the move towards a more competency based approach to governing authority membership<b>.</b><br/>I would like the committee to note that the HEA sees this particular legislation as one of a suite of legislative provisions necessary to support the full implementation of the national strategy.  Other areas requiring attention include the powers and functions of the HEA itself necessary to give statutory underpinning to our new mandate for a more outcomes focused, system approach to the governance and regulation of higher education; the composition of the board of the HEA, adopting a competency based approach in that context, and similarly in the case of the universities; the governance structures in the institutions; and other related matters.  We look forward to proposals on these emerging at the earliest opportunity but in the meantime, we strongly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposals being discussed here today and we will engage constructively with the Minister and his officials as the legislation makes its way through the legislative process.</p></speech>

It is important legislation, both for the prospective technological universities and for the higher education system as a whole.<br/>I will begin by clearly stating the position of the Irish Universities Association, IUA, on technological universities and their designation, which is that, essentially, any institution that is called a university, in the way it looks, acts and behaves, must be a university.  That means it should be characterised by provision at least at levels 8 to 10, although that does not preclude provision at other levels, and it should have a strong emphasis on research also.  If those clear criteria are met and they can be further elaborated, any institution, technological or otherwise, that merits the title &quot;university&quot; should get it.<br/>On the subject of criteria, in a number of interactions with the Higher Education Authority we stressed the importance of clear criteria for designation.  Those provided for in the heads of the Bill are somewhat less stringent than we believe they should be, however, it is important that there are clear criteria in the Bill and we commend the Minister for inserting them in the primary legislation and not leaving it to secondary legislation.<br/>I refer to regional provision.  As Mr. MacGabhann stated, it is important that there is fully balanced regional provision throughout the country.  Something we need to be aware of is that the consolidation and establishment of technological universities could leave many regions without an institute of technology.  In that context, it is very important that within technological universities there continues to be adequate provision for levels 6 and 7 education and that there is not a drift entirely into level 8 and above because that will disadvantage a number of students, and particularly students whose attainment levels will not allow them succeed in a level 8 course.  We have some evidence of that already.<br/>On the sustainability of higher education, there is the old adage that structure should follow strategy and one of our concerns is that there is an emphasis in policy on structure whereas the pressing concern is the financial sustainability of higher education overall.  As a number of speakers stated, we are in a crisis in that regard and unless it is solved, we will not be in a position to undertake the institutional reform and have successful institutions.  It is a critical issue.  The IUA is having an international symposium on the sustainability of higher education on 29 September and I take the opportunity to invite members of the committee to that event; we will issue them with a formal invitation shortly.<br/>On the question of governing authorities, we welcome the provisions in the legislation.  Some years ago the Minister asked us for a report on governing authorities, matters of university governance and higher education governance overall.  In that report we proposed a configuration very similar to that proposed in the heads of the Bill, namely, that governing authorities should be smaller and that their membership should be competency based.  <br/>One point of detail is that we believe strongly that the determination of the competency framework should be a matter for the institutions themselves and should not require the approval of the HEA because diversity is an important part of national policy, and this is where we believe institutions are best equipped to determine the competency framework their institution needs with regard to its mission.<br/>We believe collegiality is very important and we were somewhat surprised that there is a provision in the heads that decisions of governing authorities be made on the basis of majority voting rather than primarily by consensus.  We believe consensus is important in that regard.<br/>Accountability and autonomy was mentioned by a number of speakers.  There are provisions in the heads, and they have been cited, that run directly against institutional autonomy and contradict some of the other provisions in the Bill on remuneration and so on, which follow the norm for legislation.  The specific provision on the directive power of the Minister is an unusual provision.  It may even be unique because it allows the Minister, without reference to anybody, to direct that an institution comply, for example, with a collective agreement to which it may not have been a party.  I hasten to add that we have no difficulty with collective agreements, but it overturns the principle of volunteerism, which underpins all industrial relations.<br/>Similarly, on numbers, if this provision went through there would be nothing to stop the Minister saying that a particular discipline in a university reduced the numbers in that discipline.  This could be used, I admit <i>in extremis</i>, but we must account for the fact that, sometimes, <i>in extremis</i>happens.  It could be used in a directive way, and it could impact directly on academic freedom as well as institutional autonomy.  <br/>There are provisions about which we are seriously concerned but, overall, we welcome the legislation.  I am sure it will improve further with dialogue and with input from the committee and other parts of the democratic process.  We look forward to seeing it progress.</p></speech>

We have also put in a submission.  By way of context, QQI has a legislative responsibility for the external quality assurance of the 14 institutes of technology included in this draft legislation.  The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act of 1999 allowed for the institutes of technology to be granted delegated authority by the then Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, to make their own awards within the National Framework of Qualifications.  By 2006, all 13 institutes of technology, following individual external evaluations, were delegated awarding powers up to the level of honours bachelor degree in the NFQ.  Since then, all the institutes have been granted delegated authority for postgraduate taught programmes, and many institutes have received delegated authority for postgraduate research programmes within prescribed disciplinary areas.</p><p>  Between 2008 and 2011, all 13 institutes of technology underwent institutional quality reviews, which incorporated evaluations as to whether the institutes were operating quality assurance procedures in line with the 1999 Act and the 2005 European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Higher Education.  These evaluations also examined how well the institutes were managing their delegated authority responsibilities.  The outcome of all these reviews are publicly available.  With the establishment of QQI under the Act of 2012, the autonomy of the institutes was extended further with the clarification of the institutes' status as awarding bodies with powers, for example, to award joint degrees.</p><p>  The journey I have described is one of institutions being given more autonomy and more responsibility balanced by periodic evaluation and public accountability.  That is entirely in keeping with the central principle of the European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance whereby the primary responsibility for the quality of education and its assurance lies with individual higher education institutions.  All global rating and ranking systems for higher education are led by countries and systems characterised by high levels of institutional autonomy.  </p><p>  The general scheme of this Bill further proposes that any technological university so established will become a designated awarding body under the 2012 Qualifications and Quality Assurance Act.</p> <p>While there is a legislative difference in the relationship with QQI, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, and the universities, Dublin Institute of Technology and RCSI, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, all designated awarding bodies in their own right, and the other 13 institutes of technology, QQI&rsquo;s policy approach since our establishment in 2012 has essentially been the same for all.  We act as the external quality assurance agent for awarding bodies.</p><p> QQI is aware that it is not the intention of some of the institutes of technology to pursue technological university status at this time.  The general scheme is silent regarding any change to the awarding status of these institutes.  QQI believes it is important for these institutes to have clear ownership of their own awarding activities.  This proposed legislation may provide an opportunity to solidify an appropriate designation in that regard for institutions, many of which have been operating with delegated authority to make their own awards for more than a decade.</p><p> The mission of a self-awarding public higher education institution is largely shaped by the institution itself within the framework of national policy.  Well-functioning and successful higher education institutions are well led and well governed.  The governance specifications in the general scheme are consistent with the system wide findings in a review recently combined by QQI into the institution quality review process conducted by its predecessor&rsquo;s bodies which found the need to decrease the size, range and complexity of governance structures.</p><p> As the body responsible for ensuring higher education institutions establish and operate access, transfer and progression procedures consistent with the 2012 Act, the inclusion of the nominees of the newly established education and training boards in the proposed governance structure is welcomed by QQI.  The competency-based outline of the governance system is also clearly consistent with best international practice.</p><p> QQI is committed to extending its current model of annual dialogue visits for the self-awarding institutes to the institute of technology sector after this year, reflecting a relationship between QQI and higher education institutions that is more appropriate to a maturing sector.  QQI will seek to collaborate with the institutes to support the design of quality assurance that enables the developmental trajectory.  We are pleased to be providing input to the aforementioned technological university quality framework which is being designed by all 14 institutes of technology.</p><p> QQI would also be happy to suggest some technical changes that would make the general scheme more consistent with the terminology of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012.</p></speech>

The one trend running through all the presentations is that higher education funding has been reduced while enrolments have increased.  This is happening alongside these reforms in question.  Since 2008, there has been a 12% reduction in funding but a 15% increase in enrolments.  What assessment has been done of the necessary staffing and funding requirements to develop those institutes which wish progress to technological university status?  While we are putting in the legal structures for that development in this Bill, it will not happen unless the funding resources are available.  As Mr. Tony Donohoe said, we must avoid a rebranding exercise that does not allow these institutes to develop properly.</p><p>  Do the institutes of technology believe the heads of the Bill are sufficient to ensure level 6 and level 7 courses continue to be a mainstay of these institutes?  There is a chance of regional imbalance with those institutes that have suggested they may wish to go forward to technological university status being in certain regions.  Do more detailed requirements need to be inserted into the Bill to avoid such an imbalance?</p></speech>

I must declare an interest as I come from Waterford city and the south east has a particular interest in this legislation as one can imagine.  I arrived at this issue initially as a sceptic.  I agree a university needs to behave as one and it cannot be simply a rebranding exercise.  Neither can we have two tiers of institutes of technology.  There must be a clear logic to this development.  We can also learn from mistakes from the past.  For example, the previous national spatial strategy looked correct on paper with the development of gateways and hubs.  However, we ended up with too many gateways and hubs with something for everyone.  The real intent of the spatial strategy was somewhat lost as a result.  I hope the same does not happen with the establishment of technological universities.</p><p>  I have been won over, however.  The technological university approach is the right way to develop this sector.  Coming from the south east, I believe Waterford should not be aping Cork, Dublin or Galway.  We need a university in the south east that is embedded in the needs of enterprise and the community.  The bar has been set reasonably high for the criteria that will allow that to happen.  Are all the delegations satisfied that the criteria have been set to the highest standards to ensure these new technological universities will live up to their name?  Are there concerns about them?</p><p>  The south east is a good example of where there are several institutes of technology.  With the merger of Carlow and Waterford Institutes of Technology, we must ensure we have sufficient numbers of levels 6, 7 and 8 courses with the same number as levels 9 and 10.  This is an opportunity to look more holistically at education with the education and training boards in place.  There are opportunities for much greater engagement and collaboration between the institutes and the boards.</p><p>  I am concerned with the governance issue and the suggested role of an academic council which could compromise the role of the governing body in a technological university.  What are the views of the delegations on this?  I also agree head 55 will allow the Minister the unfettered right to impose ethics on higher education institutions.</p> <p>It is an important issue, and many presentations were made.</p></speech>

Given that the Seanad is debating education legislation at 3 p.m., I will have to leave.  However, I will read the transcripts to see all the answers and other issues that arise after I leave.  I thank the witnesses for all their presentations.  It is good to have the different perspectives of so many groups.  Both Mr. Boland of the HEA and the Dublin Technological University Alliance steering group mentioned the need for greater clarity about the criteria.  The draft scheme of the Bill is too vague.  The Hunt report recommended that if there were to be technological universities, different institutions would form clusters rather than one institution evolving into a technological university.  It also recommended that any new technological university should be different from the existing ITs and universities.  Following on from this, and the work done by the HEA on it, the Marginson report proposed a set of possible criteria to try to achieve that and indicated the standard to expected regarding scale, research and industry links, etc.  Even at that there was not enough clarity for me about the difference between the technological universities, the ITs as they stand and the universities, and what exactly would be unique about a technological university.<br/>Is there agreement for a start?  At the very least the<i></i>Marginson criteria or something similar should be included in the Bill.  There is a need for clarity.  It is too important a matter to make it up as we go.  From the point of view of individual institutions and from the landscape point of view, as Senator Cullinane noted, we need to be mindful that the whole picture fits together, there is no duplication, the system works and we maximise our strengths.  It is in everybody's interests and we are all on the same page regarding it.  In addition to the criteria Marginson set out, what is the difference between a technological university and the existing ITs and universities?  What extra criteria should we put into the legislation?  We should have clarity on these so at least the institutions know the criteria on which they will be judged.<br/>Student representation is essential in all of this, as I have said in every speech on higher education I have made in the Seanad.  From a quality assurance point of view as much as any other, we must have strong student representation on all our governing authorities and good procedures for listening to students and getting feedback on the quality of lecturing.  It is in everybody's interests to have this because it is good for the institutions.  In some respects it challenges existing practices.  Some colleges have been very good on this, some less so.  Most universities have three student representatives on their boards.  The Bill should provide for standard practice and set three as a minimum.  I agree with the point that there is necessity for there to be a student union representative.  As a former student union officer I would have grave misgivings about the idea that an institution would decide which student sits on its board.  There are serious issues with this.  It is essential that the student representatives be elected representatives of the student body.</p></speech>

I recently attended a symposium in DIT on the issue of preparing for the technological university regarding quality and standards, which was very useful as a backdrop to this Bill.  To follow up on Senator Power's question, I have a question for Professor Norton, Mr. Boland and Mr. Hannigan.  What will be the difference between, say, a level 8 degree in mechanical engineering or hospitality-hotel management from GMIT in Galway and the Waterford Technological University or DIT when it becomes a technological university?  How will the student experience differ in a technological university from that in an IOT, both offering level 8 in that category?</p><p>  My next question, on funding, is for Mr. Costello, who has very great concerns about it, Professor Boland and anybody else who wants to address it.  How is it proposed that we will address the funding and drop-out issues at third level?  Figures from the HEA show that for the academic year 2010 to 2011 11% of level 8 students dropped out or withdrew in first year and 29% of students at levels 6 and 7 dropped out.  Bearing in mind that it costs the State an average of &euro;3,300 for level 8 students and approximately &euro;450 for level 6 or 7, it is a massive financial loss to the State through early drop out and withdrawal.  It is a major investment by families and the State and a poor experience for the student.</p><p>  I do not blame the institutions but I ask how they will address it because the causes are much earlier.  How are they working with second level to ensure better student choice?  How will the new technological university model address it?  Will we have the same problems?  If 4,000 level 8 students drop out, the State loses &euro;13.2 million.  We have major funding problems at third level and maybe investing more in second level career guidance would be a place to start.</p></speech>

How can we speed up the merger?  Mr. Donohoe of IBEC mentioned concerns about quality.  Could he expand on the main concerns from the perspective of IBEC?  Is it regarding general educational standards?  This is a very important issue and in this economic climate we need to target our graduates regarding business and the IBEC perspective.  Would anyone else like to contribute on concerns about quality through these mergers?</p></speech>

It is an issue and we are at a point in the economic cycle where revenue is available.  Irrespective of this legislation there needs to be an improved funding base for institutions to function effectively and in relation to student hardship.  Many cases of students dropping out are due to student hardship and family circumstances, etc.  There are other developments, for example in the context of merging DIT, ITB and ITT, the relocation of DIT to Grangegorman which would bring costs together and reduce costs, for example the institutions would have only one president.  This would allow them to put more resources to the coal face.  There would be savings which would enable one to do certain things.  There would be expenditures, as always with institutional change.  Both Deputy McConalogue and Senator Cullinane raised the critically important matter of levels 6 to 7.</p> <p>One of the differentiating factors is providing a level of opportunity and for legibility of opportunities for different learners to move between different levels and modes of study in different locations.  They should be able to take a module in this or that location and build a degree, which is the important part of what it is about.  I am not sure one should include that in legislation because the demand for particular levels of programmes and types of programmes varies with the economy and this, that and the other and to legislate at a particular point in time may be inappropriate.  However, the legislation should enshrine the commitment of a technological university to the area because that is our commitment.  In the particular consortium of three institutions I represent, the level of study is growing, not declining.</p><p> With regard to the criteria referred to by Senators David Cullinane and Averil Power, they are reasonable and appropriate in a broad sense.  The idea of an international panel then making a judgment is important because what might be a criterion today might not be tomorrow.  Higher education is developing internationally and one might want to be more rigorous or use different criteria at some point in the future; therefore, one needs to be cautious about what one includes in legislation and avoid things that might be contradictory, for example, having things that are a percentage of another number and that other number being a function of other things can lead to some contradictory and oddly shaped institutions.  A number of people are using the walk like a duck, talk like a duck argument about a university, but if one does this, one can end up with strong contortions.</p><p> A key factor is flexibility and the ability to move between part-time and full-time modes of study.  I agree that there should be progress from further education and with levels 6 and 7 being part of the criteria.  I do not over-emphasise any particular aspect, for example, research or high levels of qualifications.</p><p> I agree strongly with Senator Averil Power that student representation should be by a students' union and that it should represent both undergraduates and postgraduates, as my colleague in the DIT students' union said earlier.</p><p> Senators Averil Power and Fidelma Healy Eames raised the issue of differentiation.  We are looking at a practice-led institution; ours is not an institution that will produce people to tell others to do things.  The people concerned can do things; they are entrepreneurial and international.  This is a small, open international trading economy and our graduates work internationally and in the city.  That understanding is critically important for success.  They are also active citizens and active participants in the democratic process and do not just have an economic role.</p><p> Senator Fidelma Healy Eames asked what would be the difference between GMIT and WIT in the future, but I cannot speak for these institutions, sadly.  Looking at it in the context of a technological university in Dublin, level 8 provision will have legible access from levels 6 and 7 and there will be an ability to move between full and part-time and between workplace and study modes.</p></speech>

If one is a level 8 student, one of the opportunities we provide is to study part time in the work environment, then full time, etc and have the ability to take modules in different locations.  For example, in the hospitality sector a student might be able to take certain modules in the city centre or Tallaght or Blanchardstown while working and build his or her degree in that way and, because of the scale of the institution, gain a huge breadth of opportunities to interact with facilities and staff, thereby enabling us to construct programmes.  The nature of advances in sectors is fast and new sectors emerge during the four years of an undergraduate programme.  The ability to have pathways to change direction and the scale to do this with reasonable effectiveness while using public resources effectively is important.  A philosophy that must be linked with this - it is a bigger agenda for another day - is that we intend that all those enrolled graduate.  People coming into a programme are inculcated with good learning skills and provided with appropriate pathways to appropriate qualifications.  We will not have the waste mentioned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.47" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hannigan" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014041600010#K00600"><p>I will try to answer the questions generally without referring specifically to those who asked them.  </p><p>  There is a fundamental problem from our perspective that we have failed to convince the political system that there is a crisis in higher education with respect to funding.  No matter how we have tried to do this in the past few years, we have failed.  The problem is that we, like any other sector in the public service, have taken one for the country in the context of making sure there is economic revival.  People took on board the serious cutbacks made for each institution and tried to work through them to come out the best they could at the far end.  We are in real difficulty and need to have it addressed.  A consistent message is developing with respect to the overall development of higher education and whether it is the institutes of technology, the universities or the HEA, we are saying the same thing.  We have to move beyond trying to convince the political system.  There is a real issue which needs to be dealt with and there will be huge implications if we fail to deal with it.</p><p>  From the point of view of level 6 and 7 provision, in fairness to the HEA it has listened to the institutions in the past few years and tried to equalise the funding model with respect to the provision of level 6, 7 and 8 programmes and that has been an incentive for institutions to maintain the provision of level 6 and 7 programmes across the country.  Nobody is walking away from this provision, which is clear from the comments made so far.  That is the consistent message from institutes of technology.</p><p>  I am probably better placed than anybody to comment on regional provision as president of LYIT.  It is important that politicians look at the contribution institutes of technology and universities have made across the country.  There has been a turnaround in society with respect to education generally.  When one considers the completion rate for the leaving certificate examination, the transfer rate to higher education, the price and value people are putting on higher education, the provision of that service throughout the country and the movement of students from second level to higher education, it is very much a regional product.  The enrolments of universities and institutes of technology predominantly comprise people living within the region in which they are located.  There is a strong regional input from higher education generally.  That allows us to engage with business, as Mr. Donohoe outlined, create opportunities for new businesses coming into regions and then create opportunities for graduates to stay in and develop these regions.  Regional provision is, therefore, important from our perspective in the context of any discussion.  We want to continue to meet the targets and ambitions we have set for ourselves.</p><p>  The retention of students is a complex issue.  I have been involved for the past ten or 15 years and we produced the first review of retention in the IT sector in 1999.  We looked at the myriad issues that impacted on whether a student remained in a programme.  We have not been good at relaying into the public domain that when students discontinue a programme, the majority make their way back the following year, perhaps into different programmes or new areas of study.  Conscious and definite decisions are taken by both students and families to redirect from where they had started out.  In one way that is a positive in people making a decision early to correct what they have done and move to another area of study.  There are also the issues outlined by Professor Norton such as hardship, etc, which have had a major impact in the past few years.  Every institution is aware of this issue and making definite attempts to address it.</p><p>  The issue of the criteria has been clearly articulated in the documentation from the HEA.  Some of the institutes see them as overly stringent in the context of what is being asked of them in moving towards a technological university, but that debate will have to be engaged in on an ongoing basis.  I take into consideration what has been said by Mr. Costello and committee members about universities having had to meet the criteria to be called a university.  I accept this.</p></speech>

That was the crux of what we were trying to hit home in our submission.  Process, policy, procedure and legislation should be included to account for the worst case scenario and prevent it from happening.</p> <p>The difference is night and day between a representative of a students' union elected to a committee and a student who may have been taken in from the corridor 15 minutes beforehand but not given an explanation as to why this had happened.  At a very low level there is a difference between a class representative sitting on a programme board and feeding in to quality mechanisms who has been trained by a students' union in how to relay information on behalf of the class and somebody who may have been taken in a few minutes beforehand.  Unfortunately, such incidents happen.  I get a cold shiver up my spine when I hear about colleges holding separate elections to positions, the holders of which do not sit on governing bodies.  This undermines the ability of a students' union to claim it fully represents the students.  That is the crux of our submission.  The ethos of an independent students' union should be enshrined in order that it can fully represent students.</p><p> It would be remiss of me not to raise the issue of funding.  We need to talk about Higher Education, a paper released by the Nevin Economic Research Institute, is a good starting point for this conversation.  Society may have lost sight of what higher education is supposed to be about with regard to having a value system; perhaps this is why it has been undervalued in recent years.  Perhaps we are putting the cart before the horse in discussing new and fantastic ideas without having the resources to implement them.  The USI believes higher education is a public good, that the money for it should come directly through the Exchequer and that there should be no financial barriers whatsoever to education.</p><p> The students' unions in IT Tallaght, Blanchardstown and the DIT will hold a student-led conference on technological universities on 14 May.  We will issue invites to members of the committee and hope to see them there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned Costello" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014041600011#L00200"><p>I thank committee members for their questions and observations, which are all very interesting.  <br/>I will begin with the criteria.  Senator Averil Power correctly mentioned the Marginson report.  At the time we made a submission to the HEA stating we felt it had set the bar very low.  I commend the Minister because he has upped it relative to the Marginson report.<br/>With regard to the qualification level of the staff of technological universities, everybody accepts that there must be a starting point, but the criteria provide for an absolute.  The HEA recommended there be a trajectory, whereby at the beginning a certain proportion of staff would have doctoral qualifications and the aim would be to increase this over time.  That would be a positive approach.  We have made significant investment in postgraduate and doctoral education in Ireland and should see many graduates migrating into the university and technological sector.  The bar would be raised, but it would be done in an organic way.<br/>With regard to level 10 educational provision and research, it is very important to have collaboration between technological universities and universities.  Research and level 10 education are expensive and demand scale.  We can see very good examples of this in the clusters, but it needs to go further.<br/>Deputy Charlie McConalogue and Senator Fidelma Healy Eames raised funding and transition issues.  Deputy Charlie McConalogue asked what planning had been engaged to cost and provide technological universities.  The answer is somewhere between very little and none.  In recent years we have seen a progressive erosion of Exchequer funding for higher education and I see no plan to reverse it.  This is at the heart of the sustainability difficulty.A number of measures could be taken to deal with it.  Any system will involve a mix of public and private funding of higher education and we must acknowledge that there has been a significant transfer of the cost of higher education to individuals through the increase in the student charge.  Whether &euro;3,000 is the right level merits debate.  To return to the Nevin report, one of the reasons for holding the symposium is it is important to have a debate.  There is no direction or debate, which is a problem.<br/>Two years ago a &euro;25 million temporary budget cut was made to higher education funding and the funding was to be restored last year.  Regrettably, it was not restored; it should be.  That would at least be a gesture of good faith in the system.<br/>On Monday an article I wrote appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I made the observation that there had been a significant transfer to social welfare payments, by which I meant dealing with the unemployment crisis, and it was very important that this had been done.  As we see a return in employment growth to somewhere near normal levels there will be a dividend and Exchequer resources will be freed up.  A commitment needs to be made to invest these resources in higher education.  We know education generally and higher education is the best route to a job.  We have an opportunity to create a virtuous circle and it should not be missed.<br/>The drop-out issue is slightly related to funding.  It is where one sees some of the effects of the financial crisis.  The student experience has been worsened by larger class sizes and reductions in services to students because of falling resources in institutions.  There must be some causal connection.  <br/>Another aspect which is important is transition from second level to higher education, an issue which has been actively examined by the Department and the universities.  We are considering simplifying the number of entry routes into higher education.  In this regard, Mr. Hannigan made an interesting point.  In a system with highly denominated courses people possibly take the wrong course.  Perhaps they return to the system later, but there is a cost associated with this.  Simpler entry routes will, I hope, lead to some of this problem being addressed.  <br/>There is also the fundamental issue that the second level system does not prepare people as well as it could for higher education.  The modes of assessment and teaching are different.  One goes from the highly structured and prescriptive points system, with its emphasis on rote learning, to higher education where there is a strong emphasis on independent learning.  There is a disjuncture between these two tectonic plates.  This is an issue for the policy system.</p></speech>

That the committee can engage in a pre-legislative process is a welcome development.  I thank the delegates for coming before the committee and their contributions.  This process gives interested stakeholders an opportunity to flag their concerns, wishes, dissatisfaction and satisfaction with the legislative proposals.  The involvement of the students' unions is particularly welcome.  There are many vested interests, some of which have greater strength than others with regard to numbers, advisers and the mechanisms available.  I consider the students as having a vested interest and they should have a higher profile.  I welcome the contribution they have made today.  The avenues through which their participation can be strengthened were listed and I support many of them.</p><p>  The funding issue is a little like world peace; we all support world peace and increased funding for the third level sector.  The question we must face is from where we will take it.  The Bill aims to find greater efficiencies and eliminate duplication in the system.  This will increase funding by one means or another.</p> <p>It must be acknowledged that this is the motivation for much of what we are doing.  I would be delighted to see a further increase, but we have broader responsibilities and must ask tougher questions about from where funding will be taken to be invested in third level education.  This is not for one second to say third level education is not worthy of that funding.</p><p> The plans for the south east were not addressed.  It is a commitment-----</p></speech>

I seek clarification on the plans for the south east, as referred to by Deputy Jim Daly and Senator Hildegarde Naughton.  In terms of higher education, access is the main issue for my constituents.  We need to consider how the country will move forward.  What can we do immediately on that front?  A loan scheme has been mentioned.  What are our guests' opinion on same?  Has any of them encountered problems with emigrants who want to return to Ireland but, as a result of not being resident in the State for a time, do not qualify for free fees?  I encountered this issue recently, given the demographic shifts which occurred in the past few years.  A large cohort of emigrants want to come home, but they find themselves locked out of the "free" education system.</p><p>  Speaking colloquially as a Kerryman, we see major potential for the development of a technical university in the south west, incorporating IT Tralee.

One of the underpinning themes is funding of the system.  It is the Higher Education Authority's opinion that the current funding approach to higher education is unsustainable and that the creation of new universities must be undertaken in the context of a sustainable funding system for the sector as a whole.  An impression may have been given that the Minister and his Department are blind to the difficulties.  I am well aware that they are not.  Although the funding structure will remain in place until the end of 2015, the HEA is working with the Department on developing a process and, ultimately, proposals around how higher education can be funded in the future.  It is a complex issue and I will not attempt to second guess the outcome today, but the Minister and his Department are alert to the issue and it is being addressed.</p><p>  Regarding levels 6 and 7, it is essential that we maintain a highly diverse higher education system.  One reason for the reform programme was a concern about the homogenisation of higher education and mission drift.  We have new mechanisms to safeguard against them.  We have clear profiles for the institutions and how they comprise the system as a whole.  In our discussions with them about creating compacts or individual agreements with them we will always have the national need in mind.  Through that process and our funding, we can ensure the level of provision from levels 6 to 10, inclusive, that society and the economy need.  As Mr. Hannigan stated, the institutes are not walking away from levels 6 and 7.  We can be reasonably confident of dealing with the matter.</p><p>  The HEA has advised the Minister on what the criteria for technological universities should be.  He has accepted these, although none is set down in legislation.  It would not be appropriate to do so.  I understand the criteria for technological universities will be fleshed out in regulations.  By and large, I expect them to reflect the criteria recommended by the HEA.  The heads provide for this: "Regulations made under subsection (1) may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of those regulations".  I do not want to speak for the Minister, but the criteria fleshed out in the regulations will be close to the HEA's recommendations.</p><p>  Senator David Cullinane raised an issue of engagement with the education and training boards, ETBs.  A significant part of the structural reform we are putting in place is the development of regional clusters of institutions, in the first instance universities and institutes of technology.  We see these clusters engaging with other aspects of the education system, particularly further education, as managed by the ETBs.  This will be a way to join the totality of post-second level education with how it interacts with regional societies and economies.  This is important.</p><p>  I wish to comment on the subject of student representation.  I had occasion - I believe it was last Monday week, but I am unsure - at the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, congress to address this issue.  It is firmly the view of the HEA that students should be represented in all of the decision-making fora of higher education institutions, not just on the basis of sufferance, grace and favour, but also on the basis that they have a legal right to be present.  In good governance structures all company directors and governors should have an equal voice and be given the opportunity to express themselves.  We strongly support the USI's opinion on the appropriate involvement of students in appropriate numbers in all of the decision-making systems of higher education institutions.</p><p>  Senator Fidelma Healy Eames asked what would be different about the student experience in a technological university as against in an institute of technology.  I will quickly cite our explanatory memorandum on the criteria.  In considering Ireland's future economic development and the contribution of higher education there is a particular need to ensure economic development is supported and fostered by active, enterprise-oriented and university level institutions.  This requires that the disciplines offered, the pedagogy employed and the research undertaken all be underpinned in a deliberate and strategic way by active and focused engagement with enterprise and technological industries.  While such an entity could be formed from existing universities, a university designated with this specific mission provides the opportunity to place this mission at the heart of the university system rather than relying on traditional universities to alter their courses incrementally over a longer period.  The key objective is greater speed in introducing to university level a strong enterprise focus in disciplines and research.  That is what a student will experience.</p><p>  The question of early drop-outs was raised.  I am sure the Senator accepts that there will always be some level of dropping out, as there are no guarantees.  By international standards, our level is low.  Approximately 80% of students complete their courses in the university sector and slightly fewer in the institutes sector.  This is positive.  There are issues, but they are not being ignored.  Mr. Costello mentioned the transition agenda.  The idea of broader entry and giving students an opportunity to reflect for some months before they specialise in particular areas can help them to be more certain about what they are doing.  Mr. Costello also referred to the current funding problems.</p> <p>The Higher Education Authority is seeing an increase in drop-out in some areas.  It is fair to assume that this is related to funding difficulties in the institutions which simply do not have the resources to provide the type of student supports that would be necessary to assist the academically weaker students.</p><p> On the south east, I do not want to comment on any particular application for TU.  However, the timeframe and creation of any technological university is in the hands of the institutions.  This requires leadership, trust and collaboration.  All of these things are necessary.  That said, the HEA is not a disinterested bystander in all of this.  In the event of our identifying that institutions are having difficulty in this space, we would be prepared to intervene appropriately.  In the first instance, this is very much down to the institutions concerned.  By and large, we are seeing creative and proactive engagement by the institutions in this space.</p></speech>

First, I want to endorse what has been said in regard to levels 6 and 7.  They are absolutely critical, including on a democratic basis.  There are a significant number of adults who wish to return to learning but do not have the prior academic achievement that would allow them go directly to level 8.  These people are located in the regions as well as in the larger urban areas.  We are quite likely now to revisit history in the short term in terms of our once more having a deficit of skilled trades persons because we have not put in place at a sufficient level a floor under the collapse that has occurred in the apprenticeship model.  It is vital for economic sustainability that we put in place a floor and that we maintain it.  This will have to be done regionally.</p><p>  Senator Healy Eames asked what the difference would be between a level 8 provided by one institution versus another.  I do not mean to be glib but there should not be any significant difference in that regard.  The QQI mandates a particular level-----</p></speech>

There may be a difference in terms of scale.  Professor Norton referred to the economies and facilities that scale may provide.  I would be exceedingly worried if there were a material difference in qualitative terms between a level 8 provided by one institution and another.</p><p>  On the question of access and attrition, it must be borne in mind, and this links into funding as well, that what is at issue is not only the numbers currently in third level but the average of 60% proceeding to third level year on year.  We are facing a demographic bulge that is working its way through primary and into post-primary level.  Any planning that must be done must be for numbers significantly in excess of current numbers.</p><p>  On funding, the TUI believes that the battle in this regard has been already lost.  The political system needs to prioritise funding for third level.  It has not done so to the extent required.  It has instead relied on the relatively soft belief that one can transfer to private funding.  Private funding in the Irish context means fees for the student.  We do not have significant philanthropic availability in this area.  In any event, it is unlikely to have hugely burgeoned in recent times.  The TUI has previously suggested that those who are beneficiaries and can afford part of the burden should be taxed with the provision of funding.  By this I mean those industries which through a liberal rate of corporation tax benefit most from the graduates who are supplied by our universities and institutions.  We have previously suggested that a modest levy of, perhaps, 1% should apply in addition to the corporation tax, specifically for transfer to the funding of third level.  We see no moral or practical reason this could not work.</p><p>  In regard to retention, inescapably it is the case that at levels 6 and 7 and, perhaps to a degree at level 8, the absence of the more individualised style of provision which the learner needs, which is caused by an attrition in terms of staff and increasing pupil numbers, has an affect on the ability of the student to complete and the ability of the institute to support completion.  I would like now to return to a matter not yet raised.  Anybody who believes that deregulation of human relations functions, which essentially means deregulation and the dismantling of industrial relations agreements, is the way forward either in the short or medium term is pressing the wrong button because the group quintessentially at the heart of any progress in this regard is the academic cohort, namely, the staff.  One cannot effect the changes that are sought without the allied and enthusiastic involvement of the academic staff.  I know only too well that academic staff are notoriously difficult to coerce.  They are not likely to become any more easy to coerce as time goes on.</p></speech>

I was in my earlier remarks commenting on the heads of the Bill and the absence therein of any commentary around the validation, monitoring or reviewing of programmes.  I would like now to comment on quality in general and on business perception around it because commentary around this issue is often fairly lazy.</p><p>  When IBEC raises the issue of quality with companies, which it does on a fairly regular basis, 75% say they are satisfied with the quality of outputs from Irish higher education.  Whether or not that percentage is positive or negative, it has been remarkably consistent.  This should not be confused with some of the commentary one hears about specific skills deficits, particularly around ICT and engineering.  That we are experiencing particular skills deficits does not mean third level is broken.</p><p>  The other aspect of quality which IBEC emphasises is that of employability.  This also pertains to technological universities.  Again, slightly nebulous but very important are the skills, learning and attributes that graduates will require in the workplace.  Why do we put emphasis on this?  First, as they are likely to be in multiple careers, flexibility and learning to learn, which is probably the most powerful thing which higher education experience can give a person, is important because they will have to continue to reinvent themselves.  Careers are typically much shorter now.  Business is changing at such a rapid rate we cannot even forecast the types of occupations that are likely to exist in the next 20 years.  What is important are the attributes and skills developed for young people to survive in this world, which we can just about begin to imagine.  I recently read a report from the UK Skills Commission which speculated about the types of jobs that will exist in 2030, one of which is the occupation of ethical hacker.  When sitting next to IBM's university engagement manager recently at a conference, I raised this issue with her and she told me IBM has an ethical hacking division.</p><p>  In regard to what quality would look like for the technological university, flexible learning pathways are important.  I do not wish to repeat what has been said regarding levels 6 and 7 but they are very important.</p> <p>Related to that, a piece of work was carried out to review apprenticeships.  I am not sure if the committee members had a chance to look at it, but it is potentially very interesting and links into the role of the TU because it posits the notion of advanced apprenticeships from level 5 to level 10.  It fits into the idea of professionally ready graduates, which is at the root of quality as well.  It is about the delivery of regional and national economic objectives and high quality occupational training.  As Tom Boland said, this defining enterprise engagement piece is what quality will look like within the TU.  It provides an alternative to the gold plated standard of the BA honours, to which too many families appear to aspire.  Ultimately, some of the young people who go through these educational experiences might not get the jobs they had hoped to get.  Again, the closeness of the TU to enterprise will, one hopes, make them qualified in the jobs that are more likely to be available in the labour markets.</p><p> With regard to the idea of levying multinationals, it is not something on which I would be jumping up and down, so to speak.  Not only does higher education provide staff for these multinationals, the multinationals provide well paid, highly rewarding careers for their employees and a livelihood for their families.  However, there is a point to be made regarding funding.  Some universities get 50% of their funding from non-State sources.  That raises issues around governance and deregulation of autonomy because they are functioning in an international market that is highly competitive.  If we constrain them too much, they will be unable to do that.  That is not to suggest that education is some type of commodity or to get into that debate, but that is the reality of these institutions.  If the TU is of the scale we hope it will be, that will be the market it will compete in as well for research and talent.</p></speech>

The Senator referred to mechanical engineering in particular.  On a worldwide basis one probably would not see much difference in the academic programmes people would develop within mechanical engineering.  It is also a professionally regulated programme, including at European level.  The experiences students might have in different institutions could be different.</p><p>  The point Professor Norton made about the ability of a technological university to offer programmes across the range is one of the big distinctions.  One could have a comprehensive offering across the range between level 6 and level 10.  Currently it is quite difficult to see institutions doing that.  The university sector will largely offer between levels 8 and 10.  Although there are level 10 awards in a number of the institutes of technology, they tend to be to relatively small numbers of students.  One of the things that has come out of this Bill in the criteria and in the national strategy is that there is no movement from an institute of technology in its current form to a technological university without amalgamation.  The concept of critical mass is part of the national strategy and the national landscape.  There is a recognition that if one wishes to offer that, there is a protection in size.  There are levels below which, particularly in technological areas, it is very difficult to offer the necessary comprehensiveness.  That is one of the things that is permitted within this.</p><p>  As well as this Bill, we are doing all this in the context of a changing national landscape.  The issue of regional clusters is very important.  There is a comprehensive examination of that and the ability to move from further education into higher education.  One of the dangers people have mentioned here is the difficulty of people coming in unprepared or unsure.  Broadening entry might facilitate a greater chance for people not to make errors in their choice as they go in.  One of the advantages of having comprehensive offerings across levels 6 to 10, and this might be where the Senator might see a difference in the mechanical engineering graduate, is that it is likely that in a traditional university that person will have come through from leaving certificate in school, whereas in the current institute of technology sector, and it would still be permitted within the technological university, there is the ladder effect of certain people coming in at level 6 and progressing to levels 7 and 8, and people who either do not progress or do not need to progress can find satisfying careers without having made the mistake of coming in on a level 8 programme and then dropping out.</p><p>  With regard to the drop-out rates, a significant number of people, perhaps 10%, drop out in the sector.  I work a great deal in the European area and there are many countries that are extremely envious of the persistence and completion rates we have in Ireland.  We have a very high completion rate, which is testimony to the high quality offering from our higher education institutions.</p></speech>

One relates to the point Mr. Tony Donohoe made about apprenticeship education.  I worked in the student registrations section of Dublin Institute of Technology in Bolton Street many years ago.  A student there who was doing a postgraduate course had started out in Bolton Street as an apprentice.  He then did a night course and completed a certificate and diploma.  He then studied full-time, got his degree and went into a postgraduate course.  That is the way our education system should be and I hope the new technological universities will retain that.  The institutes of technology, including DIT, are particularly good in that regard.  Perhaps Professor Norton would discuss the role of apprenticeship and how he envisages that in his vision for the future.</p><p>  The second issue is fees.  Is the funding available to establish these new technological universities?  Is there a need for extra funding for that?  That is one issue, and there is also the issue of funding in general.  My view is that we must bury the idea that tuition fees would be reintroduced and work from the assumption that they will not.  Then people should knock their heads together about that.  What is stalling the debate is this prospect or hope, which some people have, that there might be fees or loans, as Deputy Griffin suggests.  I believe it is stalling a proper look at the issue.  That is probably a political point.</p><p>  The Association of County and City Councils made a submission about the need for democratic representation on the new boards for the technological universities.  I agree with that.  It is already in the system and councillors would represent the communities.  Does anybody have a view on that aspect?  It is something the committee will examine in its report.  Does anybody wish to comment on the issue of social inclusion?  Is that a very important element and should it be addressed in the legislation?  Are there any gaps in the legislation that must be filled?  We can make recommendations on that in our report, which we will produce shortly.</p><p>  Finally, there is a political point.  Mr. John MacGabhann's point about level 8 being the same in all institutions is very valid, but would he not say the same for the junior certificate, FETAC level 3?  One of the arguments against the junior certificate reforms is that there would be different standards in different schools.  Could one not make the same argument in that regard?</p></speech>

I have some follow-up questions on the points made.  One of the witnesses mentioned a transitions project being considered to aid retention in third level.  I am delighted to hear about that.  When will that happen?  This ties in with the response Professor Norton gave about the flexibility envisaged in the new TU model.  Does he envisage an opportunity if a student makes a poor choice?  Even though our retention levels are supposed to be comparatively good, it has a desperate impact on families when the student withdraws in January.</p> <p>The number of children I know in this position is immense.  It is almost taken as a norm but I do not see it as a norm.  Will the new TU model create opportunities?  Can a student who realises by Christmas that he or she has made the wrong choice get an opportunity in January to join his or her new and preferred course with guidance in-house?  Why must students wait until the following year if the model is flexible?  The matter was considered before when we looked at a more modular approach to education.</p><p> With regard to the funding deficit, it was stated that one of the first things that could be done is reinstate the &euro;25 million that was cut.  That leads me to my initial argument that if third level supported second level, the &euro;25 million cut could easily be made up by the State not having to fund the cost of early drop-outs which cost more money than we have acknowledged.  Mr. Boland may have the figure I seek.  How much does the State invest in students who drop out every year?  What is the average cost per year, which he puts into his reports, to allow for early drop out?</p></speech>

I believe that third level should work with second level by investing in career guidance.  We know there is a pull on funding in that area but there is quite a strong argument to support the idea that the function of second level is to serve third level.  What has third level education given back to second level students and their families to ensure they make better choices early?  Such an initiative would help families, particularly the ones who are at the pin of their collar, a fact acknowledged by Mr. Hannigan.  The initiative would help the State as well as the student's experience.  We must not forget the impact it would have on a student. </p><p>  I have a question on the quality of lecturers, a matter on which I am sure all the delegations will have something to say.  I was a lecturer in a third level institution for a period.  As I see it, a lecturer plays a role in teaching and research and connects town with gown.  Some lecturers are brilliant at one area but not so good in another, and rarely one can find a lecturer who combines all three roles well.  Should the technological universities Bill have a requirement that lecturers can combine all three roles?  Should we have a minimum requirement?  We want and need elite institutions.  We also want a quality third level education system.  Do the delegations agree that a lecturer should have a combination of all three skills?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian Norton" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014041600015#P00600"><p>The access issue is very important.  An anecdote relating to the DIT was given, so I will give an example.  With philanthropy we have provided access programmes and mature access programmes.  People have progressed from those programmes and studied all of the way through to PhD level.  What is interesting is that the retention of such students is greater than for student numbers in bulk.  Therefore, we know that with appropriate tailored interventions for students, one can get very successful achievements.</p><p>  The cost of higher education is a problem for a variety of student groups who do not meet a particular criterion.  Returning people, children of recent migrants, and so on are an issue in this category.  I do not know what the actual data would say but it is our experience that such people tend to study part-time.  Another issue is the availability of part-time education and its provision.  They work to provide the fees which are lower for part-time courses.  There may be a whole separate issue, perhaps separate from this legislation.  However, one needs to look at how such education is funded and the scale of the issue, but it is sufficient right now.</p><p>  The Chair asked about the apprenticeship system.  Mr. Donohoe was very modest earlier but he is part of the group that looked at a review of apprenticeships so he can speak a lot about the matter.  There are a number of key things about apprenticeships.  First, apprenticeships need to be ranked at a proper level in the system.  They have been out of the system but they should be at levels 6 and 7 in the system.  Second, apprenticeships should cover a range of levels and be much broader.  Apprentices should be able to graduate from levels 6 or 7 and work all the way up to level 10.  Apprenticeships should no longer be confined to a large amount of the construction and engineering disciplines and should cover a much broader range of disciplines.  Third, the taught component needs to be credit bearing on the qualifications framework.  That means if people lose their employment, which has happened recently in the construction sector, they should be able to bring their credit to other programmes.</p><p>  The system would be improved with those kinds of changes.  Perhaps a type of Schoolsnet funding model would bring employers into funding the systems.  All those measures would go some way to addressing the TUI's concerns.  If employers are proactive in funding the system, they may begin to address a future apprenticeship model that works and is sustainable from the student and institutional perspectives.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of democratic representation, I will speak specifically about the Dublin Technological University Alliance.  We are very concerned in moving from an institution that is very much rooted in the city centre, Tallaght and Blanchardstown, that we do not lose that which is critically important.  We want it to continue to serve those areas.  We think local representation is important, which links back to an issue we have with the academic council.  The legislation, as constructed at present, has a merger stage, but it does not reconstruct the academic council to be representative of those constituent groups.</p><p>  The Irish Taxation Institute has other issues with the role of the academic council which I will not dwell on too much but will single out the issues.  We are less concerned about it because a successful academic institution needs many of its dimensions to work in harmony.  The dimensions that must work going forward are: collegial harmony both from colleagues' and students' perspectives; the Government's perspective regarding governance, accountability and so on; management of the enterprise; the proper use of resources; and the industrial relations context.  Legislation needs to be constructed in a way that ensures there is that kind of shared governance.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of teachers, lecturers and so on, I have had the honour to be President for nearly 11 years in an IT context.  When I joined, it was a requirement that all newly joined members of staff obtained a qualification in third level teaching and learning.  It has always been the case that progression from assistant lecturer to lecturer required a balanced approach in terms of submitted contributions to teaching, research and public service.  I reassure the Senator that a huge majority of our staff, following a rigorous process, passed that bar.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hannigan" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014041600015#P00700"><p>I will respond to a few issues and Mr. Costello will go into more detail.  There is a real issue about how we deal with people who have emigrated from Ireland but want to get back onto programmes here.  We need to find a solution and Mr. Costello has suggestions that can help.</p><p>  In terms of the academic council, it is important to note Professor Norton's comment that we must strike a balance between governance, management and the academic council.  At the moment the council seems to have a different role than it currently has within institutes of technology.  In the context of what Dr. Walsh said, we are very conscious of the important role that academic councils play, particularly in the quality assurance area.  We want that maintained because we think the relationship works quite well at the moment and it is a case of trying to retain and build on what we have.</p><p>  In the context of the overall situation, mention was made of taking the fees issue off the table.  However, fees matter to students who want to go to an institute of technology or university.  They feel that they already make substantial contributions through fees which will increase over the next few years.  From a student perspective, they already pay for the service.</p> <p>We must look at how that is addressed in the overall funding situation.  We are looking at the development of lecturers in the context of an overall institutional contribution to the region in which we operate.  Three roles were mentioned and any institution will see itself as trying to develop in all of those areas.  We can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the staff that are appropriate to address the issues concerned.  That is how it works.  There is good engagement from the lecturing staff in the context of community engagement with the regional perspective at institutes of technology.</p></speech>

The worst-case scenario involves a student identifying two courses with a similar name and outlook in the prospectus and choosing the wrong one.  The course ends up being completely different from what the student expected.  We have run campaigns highlighting 31 October as the date for saving free fees.  The date was not well advertised.  Students engaging in this kind of conversation should be seen as a positive thing.  It is a problem for the system rather than individual higher education institutions.  The feedback from fees and income officers and guidance counsellors is the same, that the system is unfair on students and on higher education institutions.  It is a big decision to drop out of college but the system does not allow it to be seen as a positive step.  People get into college and are going through inductions and getting used to life in college when, all of a sudden, it is early November and they have not thought about dropping out.  I point to the system in that regard but otherwise I will stop.</p></speech>

What is the motivation for certain choices?  Is it coming from family pressure or economically driven decisions?  There are a number of reasons that a student may make the incorrect choice.  There are systemic problems rather than individual problems with higher education institutions.</p></speech>

On the issue of councillors, raised by the Chairman, there is an issue of engaging the key stakeholders when considering the composition of governing boards.  There is also an issue of ensuring we have people with the competences needed.  Increasingly, governance of complex institutions requires more boards that are highly accountable and have the skills needed.  My sense is that the balance in the legislation is good and there is nothing in it that would prevent councillors being engaged through other processes.  A competency based approach to governing bodies is a sound one.<br/>With regard to transitions, members can expect a statement from the Minister within days about good progress in that space.  The point about the different roles of an academic and different workload allocation and how it applies in the context of technological universities, the last criterion the HEA advised the Minister on in respect of technological universities was that workload practices and employment contracts must be reflective of a modern university including, <i>inter alia</i>, the flexibility of delivery of programmes for diverse learner groups, the length and structure of the academic year, the efficient utilisation of the institutions' physical resources and other infrastructure.  It is a matter to be addressed specifically in the context of the development of technological universities.</p></speech>

The first concerns people who are abroad who want to send their children to Irish universities and the second is the people who have come back.  Both matters centre on the residency requirement to be eligible for the so-called free fees scheme, which involves being tax resident for three of the past five years.  We have not seen a major indication of a problem but it is hard to know whether the rules do not allow the demand to be manifest.  We are anxious to examine it and the Minister has raised it.  The challenge will be twofold, the first of which is to ensure we can do something without a significant leakage of revenue because the regime must apply throughout the EEA.  The second issue is one of cost and revenue and where the money will come from.  This nests within the bigger funding issue but it is a matter I am about to write formally to Mr. Tom Boland about to start engagement.</p></speech>

I take the point that this has not manifested itself as a problem because of how the system is set up.  From speaking to people on Facebook who have been forced to emigrate, this is primarily people who have emigrated rather than second-generation immigrants..  They feel they cannot come back because they are locked out.</p></speech>

It is a declaration of war if there is any suggestion, as Mr. Tom Boland has made, that they should be scrapping contracts.  That will not happen.  There was one issue he omitted in his description of the system, which is the enormous workload on the lecturing cohort in the institutes of technology.  It is abnormally high by any comparison, particularly international comparisons.  It is an impediment to the institute of technology sector in progressing towards technological university status.  It throws out of kilter the balance sought by Senator Healy Eames between research, work with community and teaching.</p><p>  I will not address the junior cycle, which is a separate debate.  I am happy not to address it if the members are happy not to hear me address it.  Under the noses of the political system, there is attrition through the employment control framework each year.  It is going on unremarked and there is a withholding tax the HEA is proposing to apply to the residual funding available.  The withholding tax, for the attainment of particular national objectives, is arbitrary to say the least and is certainly not welcome in straitened circumstances.</p><p>  On the question of collegiality, the academic council is critical.  I echo the comments of Professor Brian Norton.  The problem is not with the academic council but the absence of a structure that is adequate in terms of merged entities.  We must ensure the engagement required with the academic workforce is ever present.  I also endorse what has been said on behalf of the students.  There should be full engagement with the student body as citizenry.</p></speech>

The Chairman presented a compelling portrait of the Bolton Street apprentice.  Without getting into the nitty-gritty of the model proposed, it offers the potential to turn that into reality.  We would appreciate any fair wind the committee can give it by interrogating, exploring and discussing the model.  With regard to democratic representation and without wishing to sound anti-democratic, I urge a word of caution and point out that in most modern universities there are tighter competency-based structures.  Our submission refers to the Danish model.  The suggestion of 20 members for the governing body is too large for efficient decision-making.  We suggest between 11 and 15 because it is important the governing body can manage and is not a collection of representative interests.</p> <p>That is not its function.  The structure should exist for the academy to reach out to the town but the governing body is not the place, nor is the academic council, which should really sit as an advisory body and have competence in the areas where it works, such as quality assurance, academic programmes, etc.</p></speech>

The broadening of entry routes may assist in stopping people from making poor choices.  This would require more flexibility within the higher education system for people to move around.  We must be careful, however, not to go down the route other countries have gone, such as the United States, where people can spend years trying to find a major and where there are far more significant dropout rates.  It must be managed carefully in this regard.</p></speech>

Lithuania made substantial progress on a number of important environmental files.  The climate agenda was a heavy focus for that Presidency, particularly in light of the 19th Conference of the Parties, COP19, on climate change that took place in Warsaw in November.  This was an important stepping stone towards the Paris Conference at the end of 2015, when the objective is to reach a new global agreement on climate change.  There will be two further important staging points on the way to that conference.  First, the UN Secretary General will hold a high-level summit on climate matters in September of this year.  Second, the process will move on to COP20 in Lima in December.  The European Commission has published a new policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030.  This will be important in shaping the EU's contribution to the international negotiations.</p><p>  The main elements of business that the Lithuanian Presidency dealt with were files relating to CO2 emissions from cars and emissions from shipping.  The latter was a first step in a longer-term strategy to deal with emissions from shipping, one that will be delivered through an agreement by the International Maritime Organization, IMO.  Other issues that Ministers discussed during the second half of the year focused on waste shipment inspection regimes and a proposal from the Commission in that regard.  Ireland is strongly supportive.  We had some reservations on a number of its aspects, but those have been dealt with in revised texts developed by the Lithuanian Presidency.</p><p>  The final significant environmental dossier that the Lithuanians dealt with related to invasive alien species.  I will not go into much detail on the matter, but the work is being led in Ireland by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and managed through the environment Council at European level.</p><p>  Before turning to the wider priorities and challenges for the Department, I will mention one further item of business at European level, that being, the funding of European political parties.  The Department has been involved in dealing with two proposals at European level.</p> <p>An information note provided by the Department was discussed by the committee last December.  There has been some progress on those files which deal with funding of European political parties.  The regulations have now been agreed between the Council and the Commission and are before Parliament this week with a view to final agreement, although they will not come into force until 1 January 2017.  All of the issues referenced in the note discussed by the committee last December have been addressed in the final text that is now in course of being adopted.</p><p> I will now speak to the Department's priorities and challenges for the period ahead.  As the chairman will be aware I was only recently appointed Secretary General.  During the next few years the Department's work will be heavily influenced by the programme for Government and other Government initiatives of a cross cutting nature, particularly the Action Plan for Jobs, coupled with the Department's own departmental strategy which encapsulates its core mission to pursue sustainable development in its social, economic and environmental facets.  Delivery of all of this will inevitably involve a significant programme of legislation which I am sure will come before the committee at various stages over the next few years.</p><p> I will now comment on domestic environmental matters.  Climate policy is an area in which this committee has a strong interest.  It is also an area in which the Minister has taken a lead role in terms of his programme of policy and legislative development.  We are grateful for the committee's input in the development of that programme.  That input, and the committee's report, has fed into the final proposals for the heads of the climate action and low carbon development Bill and an associated policy statement, which are currently before Government and will, I expect, be published shortly.  </p><p> Environmental protection and economic development are not mutually exclusive.  A key challenge for us will be bringing them together to underpin the transition to what will ultimately, by 2050, be a competitive low carbon environmental sustainable economy.  In parallel with this, we will have to deal with the inevitable impacts of climate change.  As such, implementation of the climate change adaptation framework, which we published in December 2012, will be a key focus for us as we move forward.  As I mentioned earlier, there is an ongoing process at EU level in relation to the EU's 2030 level of ambition in relation to climate change.  The Department will continue to feed into that.</p><p> A second priority in the environment area is waste.  A new policy statement on waste was published in 2012.  Key business for the Department in the coming number of years will be putting in place new regional waste management plans and a new regulatory system for household waste collection.  Also in relation to environment, we remain on track to merge the Environmental Protection Agency and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland this summer.  Legislation to underpin this is at an advanced stage.  I would expect it to be published within a matter of weeks, following which it will be brought before both Houses for consideration.</p><p> Local government reform is a significant area of work for the Department in terms of functions, structures and finance.  It has been an area to which considerable effort has been devoted over the past number of years in the context of the local elections on 23 May and the establishment of new councils on 1 June.  Members will be aware we will in future have 31 councils as opposed to 114.  A significant element of the implementation action will fall to the new councils to deal with.  </p><p> The Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government sets out a vision of local government as the primary vehicle for governance and public service at local level.  This will be a key focus as we move ahead.  In regard to local and community development, there is an ongoing programme of work in terms of securing greater alignment between local government and local development.  This will be taken forward through the new local community development committee structures to be established under the Government's reform programme.  Also on the community development side, development of the new community development programme will kick in from 2015 and the new Leader programme will kick in next year as part of the next round of EU funding.  Work in both areas is ongoing.  </p><p> In terms of planning, the Department's aim is to ensure we ultimately achieve a planning system that is not reactive in nature but instead is proactive and provides a strong basis for sustainable development, ensuring that the right development occurs in the right place at the right time while protecting the common good.  We are in the process of developing new legislation, including legislation that will bring forward proposals for a new office of planning regulator.  We will also be considering future arrangements for spatial planning at national and regional level and on new planning guidance.</p><p> Housing is a significant area of activity for the Department.  It accounts for approximately 70% of the Department's voted expenditure for this year in terms of social housing, our role in the private rented sector and the operation of the housing market generally.  A significant piece of work by the Department that will continue into next year and onwards is the new housing assistance payment which is being developed to replace rent supplement for a significant cohort of people.  A range of regeneration and retrofitting programmes, along with small scale construction of new build, are also ongoing.  Addressing special housing needs will continue to be a key priority for the Department, particularly in the area of homelessness.  New arrangements are being put in place to implement the report of the homelessness oversight group and to meet the needs of people through the housing grants for older people and people with disabilities.   </p><p> New legislation is being developed in relation to the private rented sector, particularly around tenancy deposit protection.  Members will be aware of the new building regulations and requirements introduced in this area.  A key priority for the Department will be ensuring these bed down and continue to work effectively.  On the water sector, members will be aware there is a considerable programme of reform under way in this area which is focused on improving the resilience of our water system, addressing leakage and ensuring that we have a secure supply for the future needs of households and businesses.  A centrepiece of this is the establishment of Irish Water, new funding arrangements and the introduction of independent economic regulation of the sector through the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p><p> Other matters on which the Department is focusing include the local and European elections due to be held on 23 May.  Later in the year work will be ongoing on two constitutional amendment Bills on the voting age for general and presidential elections.  On the fire and emergency management side, the policy statement, Keeping Communities Safe, which was launched last year will continue to be the focus of concerted implementation in the period to 2015.  Along with our colleagues in Met &Eacute;ireann, which was formerly part of the Department, we will continue to try to ensure it can deliver a service that will support social, economic and environmental activities, particularly in terms of how meteorological information can contribute to this.</p><p> On corporate issues, the Department continues to operate in a tight fiscal environment and with declining staff resources.  That said, we still have a significant budget provided for in the Department's Estimates this year.  A key challenge for us will be to continue to ensure that we use those resources for maximum efficiency and effectiveness, to promote job creation and sustainable economic recovery, environmental protection and, ultimately, better outcomes for those most in need in our society.  We will also be heavily involved in continuing to progress the public service reform agenda, not alone at Civil Service level but in terms of our role with the local government sector, where a significant programme of reform is ongoing.  While we will continue to see reductions in staffing resources we will do everything we can at management level and across the Department to ensure we can continue to deliver on our ECF targets while at the same time continuing to deliver on the key priorities of our business agenda.  </p> <p>We will keep our business under ongoing review to ensure we can match as best we can the available resources and skills we have to deliver on the important business that has been assigned to us by the Government and, ultimately, to serve the broad range of constituencies we are here to serve, not least the Members of both Houses and the general public.</p></speech>

It is a very busy Department because it covers so much.  Representatives of every housing agency and homelessness agency appeared before the committee yesterday.  Housing is a priority for the Government and for the Department, particularly the provision of housing for the homeless.  The housing plan was mentioned as well.  It is necessary to have an over-arching plan for housing development, especially where the houses are needed in Dublin.  Perhaps the witnesses would make a statement on that.  The Minister is working on that to draw it all together and the Government is working behind the scenes.  Some of us know a little about what the Department is doing but the general public has no idea that the Government is working on a housing plan and driving it forward.  Information should be provided on that and how it will be dealt with.</p><p>  There is also the report of the group that was established to address the issue of homelessness.  More information should be forthcoming on that.  The agenda is to address homelessness completely by 2016.  What is the position with that?</p><p>  With regard to climate change, the British have now decided that our wind energy will not be suitable for them.  The reason they have given is the cost of &euro;140 per megawatt hour.  Could it be provided at a cheaper price?  On virtually the same day that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its report stating that Ireland and every country in Europe must move to renewable energy the rug was pulled from under our feet by the other side.  How realistic is it to reach our targets if we cannot reach our target for wind energy?  I realise we must be sensitive about where wind turbines, pylons and so forth are located, but we must reach our target by 2016.  There should also be a statement on the linkages.  For example, if one reduces, re-uses and recycles, and one has a free green bin and pays water charges, there is a bounce from that as one is saving the environment, but that is not coming across at all.  It is all about how much one pays, there is nothing about how much one does as a citizen.  Many people want to ensure that the planet survives but they are not being shown the linkage between one and the other.</p><p>  The water charges issue is very topical today, but I will not ask a question about it.  I have done some research on it.  Ireland is the only country in Europe that is not charging for water, but nobody is saying that.  Why would Ireland be the odd one out?  We should show the link that if one pays for water, the return is saving on leakage and saving the environment, but that message is not getting across.  It is up to the Department to convey the message that by doing one thing there is a knock-on positive effect on another.</p></speech>

The Senator referred to climate change and the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  If wake-up calls were needed, the report certainly provides a clear wake-up call with regard to the extent of the challenge the global community faces in dealing with climate change.  On the Ireland-UK issue, our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have the lead in that regard.  To offer clarity on it, the fact that the agreement is not going ahead at this point between Ireland and the UK probably presents more of an issue for the UK in how it meets its targets rather than necessarily for us.  I recall hearing the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, say in the last few days that we remain on track to reach Ireland's target of 40% for electricity generation by 2020.</p><p>  In terms of our overall climate objectives, we have a target to reduce emissions by 20% in the non-traded sector of the economy by 2020.  The projections from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, show our emissions to be on the right side of the line we must observe for the first half of that period, up to 2015-16.  Thereafter it becomes more challenging.  That is the reason the Minister has put a great deal of emphasis not just on the development of legislation but also on the development of a new climate low-carbon roadmap to both envisage the 2050 time horizon and where we must be at that point and also to deal with the shorter term to 2020 and what further measures might have to be taken across the key sectors of transport, energy and agriculture.  Those are our three key emitting sectors in so far as the non-traded sector of the economy is concerned.</p><p>  I accept the Senator's point regarding communications.  Over a decade ago we found ourselves in a situation where the wider roll-out of waste charges had to be dealt with.  A great deal of effort was put into communication about what those charges would yield in terms of better approaches to waste management and improvements to our environment.  On foot of the recent EPA report we are starting to see the benefit of that.  For the first time we are recovering more domestic waste than we are sending to landfill, which is a significant achievement.  There are similar issues with regard to water, and communications are obviously essential.  We will work with Irish Water in that regard.  As I said in my opening remarks, one of the key benefits and reasons for the approach the Government has taken is to ensure we get to a point where we have a water infrastructure that is fit for purpose and delivers in a manner that supports both individuals and businesses in meeting their needs.  Significant benefits will flow from the new regime so the communications issue must be addressed.</p><p>  With regard to housing, a number of strands of activity are ongoing.  There is an overall cross-governmental construction strategy in preparation and that is at an advanced stage.  We are also working on a plan for social housing specifically regarding homelessness.  The oversight group has published its report and perhaps my colleague, Michael Layde, might comment on the homelessness aspect as it is one in which he has a particular interest.</p></speech>

The target is that involuntary rough sleeping and long-term homelessness would be eliminated by that year.  We are working systematically towards that.  Following the report of the oversight group that the Minister appointed, we are working on a detailed implementation plan.  As it happens, the high-level group that is overseeing this is meeting this afternoon.  It is the intention of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning to bring this implementation plan to the Government in the coming weeks and seek its endorsement of it.</p><p>  In parallel with that we are working very closely with local authorities and, crucially, the voluntary sector or the not-for-profit sector, as it is now described, on developing solutions to the problems that exist.  They are significant.  Even since the report of the oversight group in the latter part of last year there has been an intensification of some of the issues around homelessness, particularly in the Dublin area, and we are working very closely on a real time basis with local authorities, particularly Dublin City Council, on dealing with that.</p> <p> The implementation plan will be quite precise when it is published in the coming weeks.  One of our mandates is to report on a quarterly basis thereafter to the Cabinet committee on social policy.  In terms of achieving the milestones towards its implementation, there is a full and whole of Government commitment to this matter because the solutions for homelessness are varied.  They are not just within the remit of my Department and we work very closely with other Departments and agencies.</p><p> I wish to comment on the broader issue of housing supply.  Obviously supply is central to dealing with homelessness as well as addressing housing need more generally.  As the Secretary General has said, we will prepare, as a follow on to a finalised construction strategy, a specific strategy for social housing.  It will seek to address a range of issues but, crucially, supply is a common issue for social housing space, commercial housing and the availability of suitable property for office purposes and more generally.  We intend to have the social strategy, approved by Government in the first instance, published before the end of the year with clear timelines for the actions to be taken thereafter.  </p></speech>

I have missed some of the opening statement but the delegation is very welcome.  I shall concentrate on the housing part of the submission.  We have met a number of the voluntary housing groups who mentioned blockages and delays in delivering voluntary housing for social housing purposes.  Has the Department identified blockages?  Can it assist voluntary housing groups in dealing with blockages?  Is it just a fear of borrowing 80% of the money from the Housing Finance Agency?  Has the Department identified serious blockages in voluntary housing?  I ask the delegation to please respond to each of my questions individually.</p></speech>

That work has intensified with the downturn.  We are working very closely with them.  We regularly meet the Irish Council for Social Housing and various subsets of same.</p><p>  The housing policy statement issued by the Government in 2011 clearly outlined that there was going to be a new, expanded and dynamic role for the sector in terms of meeting social housing need which is what we have tried to evolve.  We acknowledge the co-operation that we have received from the sector, in that regard.  This issue is a challenge for them.  As has been said by a number of commentators, we seek to do here what took a much longer period to evolve in other jurisdictions.  </p></speech>

The sector in Ireland is very small and even in the aggregate it is very small.  Individual associations are quite small when compared with the situation in the UK, particularly England.  Having said that, we are making progress.  There are challenges and blockages.  Clearly, funding is a crucial issue.  The Housing Finance Agency is very supportive regarding funding.  For sound prudential reasons it has set a reasonably high barrier in terms of the capacity of particular associations of housing bodies to borrow.  The numbers that are capable of borrowing from the HFA, having reached that threshold, is quite small.  We hope the number will increase somewhat in the period ahead.</p><p>  Another crucial relationship regarding the supply of properties is with NAMA, whether it is the local authorities or approved housing bodies.  The complexities surround the status of the properties, the involvement of NAMA obviously - and we have had very good co-operation with it - also the original developers of the properties, the receivers and other lenders that may be involved.  We have standardised a lot of our approach to the matter, which has led to an increase in the supply of properties to approved housing bodies.</p><p>  Similarly, in terms of the mortgage-to-rent issue, approved housing bodies are crucial to the solution for commercial mortgages.  Initially, there were issues with engagements with lenders and so on but we have smoothed those away fairly substantially at this stage.  I would not underestimate the problems that we still face and that the sector still faces in terms of meeting those challenges.  We work very closely with them and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

Financial institutions claim there are severe blockages with mortgages-to-rent and said "There are too many players at the table."  That sounds like an excuse to me.  Let us look at the delivery of the mortgage-to-rent sector.   The sub-prime lenders have been better at dealing with mortgage-to-rent cases and have a 38:1 comparison with the Bank of Ireland.  Only one mortgage-to-rent case came from the Bank of Ireland yet the sub-prime lenders have provided 38 mortgage-to-rent cases.</p><p>  Are there too many players at the table?  Do the terms and conditions imposed stop mortgage-to-rent options being availed of?  Why do sub-prime lenders deal with the option much better than our own financial institutions?</p></speech>

When we initiated the scheme the sub-primes were the ones who were primarily interested.  They had their own particular motivations and circumstances for doing so.  Their early interest should not necessarily be seen as a criticism of other lenders whose business model is different.  More recently there has been much better engagement by the pillar banks which will be reflected in more recent statistics.</p><p>  The mortgage-to-rent process is slow for a number of reasons.  It involves various parties.  Obviously it involves the approved housing body which will ultimately become the owner of the property.  It involves us and we have set guidelines on what we are willing to pay for the properties which is important from a prudential point of view.  There is a conveyancing process but the same is associated with any such transaction.  There can also be delays with the process.  </p></speech>

If a property ends up with two owners will there be double the conveyancing process under the current system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Layde" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014041600006#E00900"><p>Yes.  The property transfers from the owner of the property - the mortgage holder - to the lender and then onward to the approved housing body.  We have managed to streamline the process considerably over the months but there is an inherent complexity.  Any single act of conveyancing is prone to difficulty and when there are two that will be exacerbated.</p><p>  The housing agency is a key partner in this matter.  It has taken on the role of pulling the scheme together and we are beginning to see the benefits.  It manages the relationship between the approved housing bodies and the lenders.  </p><p>  It is important to remember that at the heart of this matter is the household or family involved and within the process there are cooling off periods.  It is a very big decision to forego ownership of one's home even though one will remain in the dwelling, which is central to the mortgage-to-rent process.  Therefore, we must be respectful of that fact and be aware of the sensitivities involved.  The process has been slow but we are gaining traction.  We now have upwards of 2,000 potential cases within the system that have been identified by lenders.  We also have 700 or 800 cases that have advanced significantly.  We have a target for this year of 350 transitions, as we refer to them, and we are confident of meeting our target.  </p></speech>

It has been stated, especially within urban areas like Dublin and Cork, that there is a shortage of housing.  The ESRI reports have shown that there is a substantial shortage.  It is normal to hear commentators on radio and television say that there are planning blockages regarding housing development.  Has the Department done some work on the matter?  I am not sure whether there are planning blockages because a substantial number of properties in urban areas have received planning permission.</p><p>  Today, a REIT scheme was launched by a Canadian company and I looked at its business model for Canada.</p> <p>The Canadian business model is to use 10% for social housing.  Has there been engagement on that?</p></speech>

We looked at the key developments in their areas and we tried to get a sense of the factors preventing them moving forward.  In many cases, there are financial issues in terms of the unwinding of the housing market into a more normal space and the capacity of the financial institutions to provide development finance in order to allow them to proceed.  That said, we are mindful of the need to ensure the planning system does not become a blockage to proper development.  As part of the construction strategy mentioned earlier, which the Government is working on, we are looking to see if there are ways we can make tweaks to the planning system to facilitate development that is financed and has the capacity to move forward.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the Canadian example.  We had discussions recently with the approved housing bodies and other stakeholders to begin to explore this to see what is possible.  It is bound up with a return on investment.  That is at the heart of many of the issues we face in attracting external funding.  Any investment will be remunerated out of public funds, whether through payment and availability agreements or whatever, but there are broader issues about the tax treatment about housing units being provided for social purposes or where a proportion of the development is so provided.</p><p>  The Canadian model is interesting because it applies to a proportion of units.  We would be concerned about a situation in which the REIT model was used to develop large-scale social housing projects of the type we pursued out of public funds in the past, which presented difficulties.  We are aware of it and we are exploring the possibility that there is some advantage for the delivery of social housing.</p></speech>

I have questions on areas outside housing that come under the remit of the Secretary General.  The programme for Government is committed to the reorganisation of local government and local governance.  What plans exist to devolve greater powers and decision-making to local level?  Are there areas where the local council can take decisions that heretofore it could not?  Guidelines need to be published because block grants come from the Department and the roads grant, as an example that comes from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, was increased considerably this year.  It was encouraged to make decisions at local level and councillors still want a special allocation for local improvement schemes.  They want it to be specified because the bulk of elected members on a council are from the urban areas and do not see it as important.  How can we overcome a problem of rural versus urban councillors?  The former are in a scarce minority because of the population structure.</p><p>  Over-zoning took place during the Celtic tiger years, when townlands on the outskirts of towns and villages were zoned for various types of development.  Will new guidelines be published to deal with the issue and to promote the development of town centres?  Rural towns are dying on their feet because the main centre of the town was taken outside of the town centre through development.  This has been a problem in many towns in rural Ireland.</p><p>  The national spatial strategy must be addressed urgently.  County development plans, area plans and regional plans were produced but there is no collation of the plans.</p><p>  Reducing consumer waste to protect the environment is an issue that must be addressed.  Another thorny issue, after pylons and wind farms, is the concerns of farmers about fracking.  When will new fracking guidelines be produced?</p><p>  Last but by no means least, we need a balance between conservation and development to address the heritage horrors that occurred during the Celtic tiger years.  Many of our monuments were destroyed in the Celtic tiger with overdevelopment.  The issue must be addressed.  What are the plans for that area?</p></speech>

At yesterday's meeting, when witnesses ran out of time, they agreed to provide written answers in writing to the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014041600007#F00900"><p>In terms of devolution, the first two important steps are happening at the moment.  The county enterprise boards have been dissolved and are now in local authorities as local enterprise offices.  In terms of microenterprise support, it is an important additional function going into local government.  The new legislation provides an important role for the local authority in coordinating economic development at local level.  The third area concerned the community development side and greater alignment between local development and community development.  This is not to take it over but to ensure both systems work together in a more cohesive way.  The Government's action programme sets out that it will keep under review the possibility of further devolution of power to local authorities.  The important thing, with new councils coming into play, is for those local authorities to show form in dealing with economic development, microenterprise and community development functions as a platform towards further devolution.  One of the important changes in the Local Government Reform Act is that the existing power to allow powers of Ministers of the Government to be devolved to local authorities has been widened.  The powers of State agencies can now be devolved to local authorities where the relevant Minister agrees.  Further progress can be made along that road.</p><p>  There is a significant amount of dezoning of land to deal with the over zoning issues the Deputy described in respect of town centres.  One of the important functions features of the local government structure is the replacement of town councils by municipal districts.  This means there will no longer be a border running through the suburbs of the town, with two local authorities trying to manage the competing forces of town centre development and development in the suburbs.  We are turning our heads towards the replacement of the national spatial strategy with a new national planning framework.</p> <p>Fracking is being led by our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  As the committee is aware a piece of research is being undertaken jointly by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p></speech>

Last Monday, the Taoiseach launched the report of the Commission for Economic Development for Rural Areas chaired by Mr. Pat Spillane.  That report sets out measures to be taken to address rural decline.  Much of the job of work will fall to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  What practical steps are being taken to tackle this very real problem in order to build sustainable communities in rural areas, based on economic growth, as people will not live on fresh air?  There must be jobs, investment and growth.  Given that job creation growth is evident in other areas which are predominantly urban, we still have the problem of rural migration and young people disappearing from rural Ireland.  What is being done in the Department and what measures does it intend to pursue as the way forward?<br/>On the issue of energy projects and the whole side of community gain, once it has been established from a planning point of view that a particular energy project, whether a wind farm or anything else, is desirable and the way to go in a particular area, the issue of community gain must kick in.  From the point of view of local authorities, so far as I understand, community gain is not on a statutory basis.  Therefore, community gain is <i>ad hoc</i>.  In some cases, depending on the promoter, some are more generous and more transparent than others.  What is the view of the Department in respect of this issue and what will be done about it?<br/>Are plans afoot whereby rural water would be taken over by Irish Water?  Obviously, the problem in rural areas is the viability of projects.  This is the reason many projects, whether water or sewerage, have not been delivered in the past.  When we had the polluter pays contribution, as these communities do not have a rate base they could not come up with the equivalent; they do not have development levies that the council could put towards it.  I come from Mayo, a rural county, where this has been a particular problem.  I would like to think as well as having Irish Water that there will be an holistic approach to tackling this issue in rural Ireland.  People want to get out of septic tanks.  There are villages that could do with sewerage schemes.  However, there is always a gap as they fall short of the mark.  As part of the CEDRA report it is important that the infrastructural issues and deficits in rural areas are dealt with.  </p></speech>

As the Deputy said the CEDRA report was launched by the Taoiseach earlier in the week.  The comprehensive nature of the report is a great tribute to the chairman, Mr. Pat Spillane, and the members.  As to where it will go from here, the Government will need to examine each of the recommendations in detail, to see how they can be advanced.  From the Department's point of view, we will engage with other Departments as part of that process.  As part of the next rural development programme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will lead so far as EU funds are concerned.  As we are responsible for the Leader programme we will be looking at CEDRA to see whether there are elements within it that we can take forward as part of that process.  Following on from one of the points I made to Deputy James Bannon, given that local authorities are being conferred with a broader economic development co-ordination role we will look to the CEDRA report to see if there are elements where the local authority hand, so to speak, could be brought to bear to bring things together in a more cohesive and beneficial way so far as rural communities are concerned.</p><p>  In terms of planning gain so far as wind development is concerned, Deputy Mulherin is correct in saying that up until now, in so far as the issue has been addressed, it has been on a case by case basis.  I note the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is looking at that issue as part of its renewable energy development policy.  Rather than speak for that Department, it is an issue that should be taken up in that context, but we will continue to engage with it because the planning process is a critical part of it.    </p></speech>

The issue appeared to be thrown back to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as it is a planning issue and the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources is looking at other matters.  The position may have advanced since then but as planning falls within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, it will, obviously, have a significant role in that area.</p></speech>

That is reflected in the fact that there is a budget and an investment programme within the Department's Vote.  Irish Water has the same legislative powers as local authorities had in relation to rural water in the sense that group water sectors if they seek to be taken over, completely at their choice, then those powers would be initiated but it is not a function of Irish Water to take over from the group water sector.  We would be seeking to ensure that sector and the investment we have made in it and will continue to make, continues to be viable and supported and that the quality improvements are made because there are issues around drinking water in the sector.  The Minister does have a rural water committee to look at whatever is the water provider, whether through group sewerage schemes, group water schemes, wells on their own or Irish Water to ensure a holistic response because all of our water provision is within the water framework directive and it comes from the same source that we have to protect.  There are mechanisms in place to look at it from that perspective.</p></speech>

On the merger of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Environmental Protection Agency what is the timeline for putting the legislation in place and effecting that change?  My other question is on climate change.  The publication of the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report has stimulated debate on it.  It was almost as if that whole debate had gone dormant for a long time, even though I note in the report that the Department acknowledged the work we did last year and our suggestions around it.  At least the committee was thinking about the issue.  Is there a deadline on the publication of the heads of the climate action and low carbon development Bill as that should be done as soon as possible?  Is it intended to include the national climate roadmap which we were keen on in terms of the sector roadmaps?  If so, will that be done in parallel with the publication of the heads of the Bill or included in it?</p></speech>

We hope that it will proceed through both Houses before the summer recess, with the formal merger to follow on after that.  A great amount of the preparatory work at an administrative level, led by Mr. Walsh here and colleagues within both organisations, has already been done to facilitate that.</p><p>  The heads of the climate action and low carbon development Bill are before the Government at the moment.  As soon as it has approved them, we will move on to publication very quickly thereafter.</p></speech>

Some of the town councils allocated a small amount of money in the overall scheme of things, but a very significant amount of money to support projects and awards like these.  With the abolition of town councils, what happens in towns where they did have the reliance on local government in the form of town councils to support the projects?  What will happen when it is subsumed into the full council?  We must be realistic.  When the town councils are gone and they are part of the full council with a lot of other stuff going on is there any commitment or structure in place to ensure that in areas where one had good local councils doing that kind of work that it would be continued?  Is the system being structured that way or is it up to the individual elected members to try to pull that along as part of the legacy as they go into a municipal district?</p></speech>

There will be a vehicle within the budgeting process.  Certain decisions will have to be taken at county level as that is part of the process in terms of efficiency but there will be a general municipal allocation within the budgeting process that would provide an avenue for some of those decisions to be taken at municipal district level.</p></speech>

Obviously, the provisions that exist in the Local Government Reform Act were absolutely fundamentally predicated on the process that had been under way.  If there were to be one, the only plebiscite that could take place in tandem with the local elections is one that would have got the support of the four councils.  As the committee is aware, that ultimately did not prove to be successful.  We have not had a chance at this point to think about what the next step will be because our focus currently and for the period ahead will be to get the elections out of the way, the new councils established and the programme of reform embedded in the new councils.  It would be open to Government to consider whether it wants to go an alternative route in the future.</p></speech>

It is to ensure that the &euro;1 billion in loans at ICS, which is the only building society currently in the country, that are potentially to be sold are not sold to a vulture fund, except in circumstances that are not identical to those affecting the sale of the loan book of IBRC.  Nevertheless, we should copper-fasten the need for these loans to be protected.  We are open to any legal clarity that can be added to the amendment but we insist that the spirit of its implementation be retained in the Bill.  We are told legislation is being drafted to deal with this issue in a general way and if that is happening, we welcome it.<br/>We recognise also that the Government had allowed Deputy McGrath's Bill on this issue to pass to Committee Stage.  All of that is to be welcomed but in the here and now we are talking about &euro;1 billion of mortgages that could be sold as soon as this Bill is passed and as of now, we do not have any guarantee that we will not have another IBRC type situation.  We specifically mention the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the legal status of which FLAC has called into question or at least the enforceability of that code.  I would appreciate the Minister, Deputy Noonan, replying to me on the code's legal status and the enforceability of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.<br/>We know there is a need for greater competition in the banking sector, particularly in the mortgage sector, and we are aware of the difficulties people are experiencing, but it is our hope that this change will help to bring that about.  Does the Minister have any indication at this stage whether interested parties are looking to move in on the ICS loans?</p></speech>

I do not propose to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Doherty for the following reasons.  The amendment would prevent the sale of mortgages to an entity which was in the process of obtaining authorisation from the Central Bank.  Additionally, in the event that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears were repealed or replaced by the Central Bank of Ireland, this amendment would potentially prevent the sale of these assets permanently, even if equivalent or greater protections applied in a potential purchaser.  In addition, the amendment would potentially give rise to a contaminant effect on the broader pool of assets of Bank of Ireland in that it could become difficult to identify which assets were transferred from ICS into the broader pool of assets owned by Bank of Ireland.  This could potentially give rise to legal complexities in respect of any further sales of loan assets by Bank of Ireland, regardless of whether those assets had been transferred under this Bill.</p><p>  However, I agree with the objective of this amendment.  This Government is committed to bringing forward legislation to protect mortgage holders and believes that the Sale of Loan Books to Unregulated Third Parties Bill is the most effective way to address the issue in a comprehensive manner.  That legislation will ensure that the protections of the CCMA or any replacement code in the future continue to apply to mortgages which are sold to unregulated financial service providers.</p> <p>That legislation is being actively progressed and will be brought forward to the Oireachtas when finalised.  If enacted, the Bill being debated today will permit the transfer of assets and liabilities from building societies to banks only; it does not allow the transfer of assets to other entities other than licensed banks.  As all the banks are regulated financial service providers, they are required to comply with the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears in any case.  However, this amendment proposed by Deputy Doherty would address the matter in an incomplete manner as it refers specifically to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  It is not appropriate to refer to that specific code in primary legislation as it could require a primary legislative change were the code to be superseded or repealed or could be rendered ineffective in the absence of such an amendment to primary legislation.  </p><p> I cannot commend to the House an amendment that would unsatisfactorily address the issue which the Deputy intends to address, especially when, as I have said, a dedicated piece of legislation is being prepared on the matter with the best interests of the consumer in mind.  It would not be appropriate to deal with this issue as part of this Bill as the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill, which is listed in the Government's legislative programme, is intended to address the concerns surrounding the applicability of CCMA, following the sale of loan books to unregulated entities in a comprehensive manner.  Officials in the Department of Finance are engaging with the Central Bank and the Attorney General's office to ensure that mortgage-holders will be protected.  The Government will continue to work with other interested parties to achieve the best solution for consumers.  For these reasons I believe the proposed sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill is the appropriate way to address these issues.  I do not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I accept the Minister's statement that he will progress his own piece of legislation to deal with the issue.  However, I take issue with him on one statement he made during Leaders' Questions last week when he said that nobody who currently finds himself or herself in this situation has raised any issue about dealing with one of the funds not currently regulated by the Central Bank and who is not legally under the CCMA.  I do not believe that to be true.  Only yesterday a mortgage-holder contacted me who is a customer of a foreign-owned bank which has left this jurisdiction and the mortgage is now being held by an affiliate of a US fund.  That mortgage-holder is adamant that the code is not being complied with.  I cannot vouch for the fact in that case but the problem is that nobody can adjudicate on it and that is the issue I have consistently raised with the Minister on previous occasions.  If that mortgage-holder believes that the new mortgage institution is not complying with the code of conduct, he cannot go to anyone to vindicate his rights; nobody can adjudicate as to whether the new mortgage institution is complying with the code.  This is the fundamental problem.</p><p>  The bottom line is that thousands of mortgage-holders have been left vulnerable.  It might never come to pass and I hope that none of them experiences problems with non-compliance with the code of conduct - God forbid - because the truth is that if they experience any non-compliance with the code there is nothing they can do about it.  The Central Bank will not want to hear of it, the Department will not want to become involved.  The problem is that nobody is legally mandated to become involved.</p><p>  When does the Minister expect the Government Bill to be brought forward?  I am aware that the Central Bank is being consulted.  The Bill is listed as due for publication in 2015.  This is not good enough.  I ask the Minister if the Government will prioritise this legislation to protect all the mortgage-holders affected, those mortgages taken out before the IBRC case came to public prominence, the IBRC mortgage-holders and potentially some ICS mortgage-holders who could find themselves in that situation and whom the Minister must acknowledge are potentially vulnerable.  Will the Bill be brought forward before next year so that we can all devote time to it and get it right?  I accept it is complicated but I believe that with collective cross-party political will we should be able to legislate to deal with this issue effectively.</p></speech>

The Deputy is returning to a previous wider debate.  I cannot today give the Deputy a date for publication of the legislation which is being prepared.  I said last week that the heads of the Bill have been forwarded to the Central Bank for observations and we need to have them legally proofed in the Office of the Attorney General.  It is only at that stage that we can move on to drafting the Bill.</p><p>  I will have a better idea in the next couple of weeks of the time line we have in mind.  I want to give that legislation priority.  While the voluntary commitments made by the purchasers of loan books were very important and valuable to those persons who had mortgages, they do not have the force of law underpinning them which is what I want so that all mortgage-holders would be able to avail of the same code of conduct and that the enforcing agent would be the Central Bank.  I will keep the Deputy informed as to when the legislation will be ready but he can take it that it will be a lot sooner than 2015.</p></speech>

There was a comprehensive statement on Second Stage as to why Ireland will not benefit from a similar initiative.<br/>In February 2013, the European Central Bank, ECB, reported its holdings under the securities markets programme, SMP, for the first time.  It stated it held Irish Government bonds at a book value then of &euro;13.6 billion and a market value of &euro;14.4 billion, 8.8% of gross domestic product, GDP, at the time, with an average maturity of 4.6 years.  The profit to the holder of the bonds comes in two forms, the annual coupon or interest and capital appreciation.  I want to focus on the issue of the coupon and the question as to whether Ireland should get some relief on the interest on these bonds.  Given there has been some redemption of bonds in the meantime, it is possible the ECB&rsquo;s holdings are approximately &euro;10 billion.  At a rough annual coupon of 5%, we are paying &euro;500 million in interest on these bonds held by the ECB and, ultimately, to national central banks which are in turn borrowing at 0.25% from the ECB.  Ireland has a large interest bill of between &euro;8 billion to &euro;9 billion per annum.  It is possible that almost &euro;500 million of that is going through the ECB to national central banks.<br/>If that money were recycled for Ireland in the same way it will be for Greece, it would represent a significant boost to the Exchequer.  I do not believe the Government has made such a case to the authorities.  The Minister probably does not believe it is a good idea because we are in a different position to Greece&rsquo;s, as has been outlined.  It would not, however, represent debt write-down but would be just an initiative in respect of the interest we pay to the ECB on these bonds acquired through the secondary markets.  What is the Government&rsquo;s position on this?</p></speech>

Under this amendment, the obligation to report is placed on the Minister for Finance rather than the Central Bank which, given that the SMP is a monetary policy instrument, would be the appropriate source of such a report.</p><p>  In this context, complying with this amendment would be conditional on the Central Bank agreeing to provide the necessary information.  Further, my understanding is that the Central Bank could not be obliged to provide, indeed it would probably be prohibited from providing, the information concerned to me.  Sections 6A(3) and 6A(5) of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, limit obligations on the Governor and the Central Bank commission in regard to consulting with or informing the Minister for Finance by reference to the European treaty as defined in section 21 of the Central Bank Act 1942 as amended and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.  I am informed the Central Bank expects information on the SMP to be covered by the obligations in the treaty and statute with regard to professional secrecy.</p></speech>

The Deputy knows all about the debate of what could be done for Greece.  For all the programme countries, including Greece, the programmes were designed with conditions in the recipient countries involved in mind.  There was no one flat programme applied.  Greece&rsquo;s programme was distinctly different to Ireland&rsquo;s.  It is important to note that the concessions agreed, which include the SMP measure being facilitated under this legislation, are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality.</p><p>  They must also be seen in the context of the very significant debt restructuring that has taken place in the Greek programme.  Countries and programmes seek to assist each other.  We did not object to this when it came up as part of the solution for Greece.  There was no payment required from Ireland while we were in the programme.  The total amount that might be applicable to Ireland is reduced by &euro;35 million.  The residual amount now is &euro;126 million which will be paid over a long period.</p><p>  At the time this was going on, we were pursuing a solution for the promissory note.  The Greeks, the Portuguese and other programme countries did not oppose us in that.  There are 18 countries within the eurogroup with 28 Union member states.  If one is looking for a concession, one has to bring everyone on side.  One thinks twice before objecting to something other member states are availing of, particularly if it does not interfere with one&rsquo;s key objectives or interests.</p></speech>

No one would begrudge Greece getting some interest back.  I accept its position is very different to Ireland&rsquo;s but the principle is the same.  We bailed out the European financial institutions but are now making substantial interest repayments each year, a serious burden on the economy.  While the Minister claims the scheme may be obsolete, the interest repayments are not.  If we were running a business and another business down the road got this concession from our bank, we would be looking for it too.  The public finances and families are under pressure.

For many years the members of the committee have observed the situation in Syria as it has continued to deteriorate.  For those watching from a distance it seems the situation there is bad and getting worse than when the conflict began more than three years.  Sadly, a settlement does not appear any nearer.</p><p>  The format of the meeting is an address by Dr. Thomas Pierret followed by a question and answer session from the members.  If any clarification is required afterwards we will facilitate that.  Without further ado I invite Dr. Thomas Pierret to make his presentation.  Usually presentations take 15 minutes or thereabouts.</p></speech>

I will briefly address some key aspects of the conflict through an assessment of the possible scenario and policy options western countries are faced with in their dealings with the Syrian war.  I think the dominant position among western governments has been that the solution to the conflict should be a diplomatic one, a political one and, in principle, this is an opinion I support.  As I will explain, diplomacy is faced with serious limits and I do not think there are many positive prospects in that respect.</p><p>  What we witnessed earlier this year was the failure of the Geneva II conference which was supposed to discuss power sharing in Syria, political transition, the establishment of the transitional body, including members of the regime and excluding Bashar al-Assad himself, including the positions that members of the transitional body should enjoy full prerogatives.  This  transition plan was outlined by the Geneva I communique in June 2012. </p><p>  It is fair to say that the talks in Geneva II failed for a very simply reason, namely, the Syrian regime refused to speak about power sharing and political transition.  Basically it wants to keep Assad in power.  What the regime is preparing now is another political transition and, as the committee is aware, that is the re-election of Bashar al-Assad in a no-contest election later this year.</p><p>  The failure of the Geneva talks has taught us many lessons.  I will highlight two important lessons from this failure.  It has shown that the core problem in Syria is a domestic one.  We often hear that Syria is in a proxy war between regional powers with Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia and Qatar on the other side.</p> <p>This is part of the picture, but I think that the root cause of the problem is domestic.  It is a problem of power sharing, or more exactly, a lack of power sharing.  We have a ruling clan, the Assad family, their cousins and their cronies, who oppose any kind of deal that would sideline them, even if that deal keeps elements of the regime in power, as was proposed by the Geneva I communiqu&eacute;.  I do not think this is essentially a proxy war.  It is a domestic conflict that has attracted the intervention of foreign actors because both contenders have sought the support of foreign powers.  This is important because we often hear that the easiest way to solve the conflict will be to start by putting an end to the rivalry between Gulf monarchies and Iran.Although that would certainly be a positive development, I do not think it would be enough to solve the conflict, because as long as we do not address that core problem of power sharing and political transition in Syria, the conflict will remain.<br/>Another lesson of the failure of the Geneva talks is the negative role played by the allies of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, namely, Iran and Russia.  The Geneva I principles were supported by western countries, Gulf monarchies, Turkey and even Russia back in 2012.  However, over the last month Russia has been <i>de facto</i>backtracking on its initial support for a transition and coming much closer to the position of the Syrian regime, which is to keep things as they are with some cosmetic reforms.  Iran is even clearer.  It rejected Geneva I from the outset and has clearly aligned itself totally with the position of the Syrian regime, which is political <i>status quo</i>rather than political transition.<br/>I do not think any change can be expected in the short or even mid term from Assad and his allies, because at the moment the military situation is relatively favourable to them, although it is not favourable as common wisdom has it.  The regime is confident that it can survive and it does not see why it should abandon through negotiations the power it can keep by using force.  It is that simple.  Even if the regime suffers significant military setbacks in the future, which I would not exclude, there is a Plan B, which would be to establish a small state on the coast, which is the historical stronghold of the Alawite community to which Bashar al-Assad belongs.  Assad would remain the president of something, instead of ending up in a jail in the Netherlands, which would probably happen if he lost power.  That would also be a possible solution for Iran and Russia.  They have gone so far in their support for Assad, by providing his regime with unlimited diplomatic, financial and military support, that they would certainly be marginalised in the post-Assad order.  It is my conviction that an elected regime in Syria would be quite inherently hostile to Iran and Russia for their role in the current conflict.  The idea that Iran and Russia could be convinced of changing their minds by being offered some guarantees about the survival of their interests in post-Assad Syria is problematic in two respects.  First, guaranteeing the interests of certain countries in another country is something that has its roots in a colonial context.  It is normally a part of the way we do international relations today.  It is also unrealistic.  Who would guarantee these interests in Syria?  Western countries are too little involved in the conflict to be able to offer such guarantees if they were willing to provide them.  Unfortunately, both Iran and Russia would be happy with the partition of Syria if that is the condition to serve their interests, just as Russia has been encouraging the partition of Ukraine recently for exactly the same reason.<br/>I would like to say a word about a measure that is frequently associated with a political solution, which is the idea of an arms embargo on both sides.  On paper, that looks like a good idea, but we should keep two things in mind.  First, if the policy adopted by western states was to pressure their regional allies into ceasing to supply rebels with weapons, we would have no guarantee that the other side would do it, and that Iran and Russia would do likewise.  Second, Assad is sitting on enormous stockpiles of weapons, which he has accumulated over decades.  The Syrian regime runs military factories which are still functioning, so even if an embargo was implemented by both sides, the Assad regime would retain a major advantage.  It would be able to keep fighting for a long time, whereas the rebels would probably be short of weapons.  That would provide the Syrian regime with the opportunity to achieve a victory over the opposition, or at least to think it could achieve such a victory.  Therefore, it is likely that an arms embargo could lead to an escalation rather than de-escalation, even if that sounds counter-intuitive.  The rebel groups that would suffer from such an embargo would be the most moderate groups, because the radical groups - especially those linked to al-Qaeda - do not receive state support because they are overtly hostile to regional states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  They get their military supplies from shadowy, clandestine private sources which are not affected by any diplomatic measure on the part of western countries.  Therefore, an arms embargo would favour radicals over moderate rebels.<br/>To sum up, in my view the prospects of a diplomatic solution are dim for all of these reasons.  I would like to address an alternative solution which has been evoked in western circles over the past month, which is simply to repair ties with Assad.  It is not really public policy, but we know that some European intelligence services have been resuming visits to Damascus.  The idea was that some rapprochement with Assad could help restore stability in the region and fight Islamic radicalism.  My opinion is that this policy is immoral, unrealistic and counter-productive.  It is immoral because it basically rewards one of the most brutal campaigns of mass murder in the post-Cold War era.  Whatever crimes are perpetrated by members of the opposition, and these are crimes are a reality, there is no equivalence with the crimes of the regime in terms of scale and responsibility.  I would like to refer the committee to the words of Navi Pillay, who is the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who said recently that the regime was responsible for most human rights violations in Syria.  This involved chemical attacks, summary execution on an industrial scale, deliberate starvation of certain neighbourhoods, and barrel bombs over Aleppo over the last five months, killing several dozen people almost every day.  It is unrealistic because it is unrealistic to believe that Assad could win in the sense that he could retake the entire Syrian territory, stabilise and police it.  It is based on an inaccurate reading of military developments.  At the moment Assad is consolidating his hold over his strongholds in the centre of the country, but at the same time he is suffering setbacks in the north, east and south of Syria.  I do not think he will be able to reconquer the whole country for the simple reason that he is lacking loyal manpower.</p> <p>This has important consequences.  It means that when he wants to reconquer a region - this is what he wants to do - it is usually by starving the people and bombing them for a long time.  Usually this generates a massive flux of refugees and this is why we have a vast refugee crisis in the region at the moment.  He rarely retakes a region without first forcing the inhabitants to go.  Given his lack of manpower he is heavily reliant on Shia Islamist foreign fighters.  These are pro-Iranian militia men recruited in Lebanon and Iraq.  They play a key role.  Every strategic victory won by Assad in the past month was won thanks to the support of these people.  This is a concerning development for the future because it means that regime victories, far from bringing stability, actually lead to a form of foreign occupation by people who have a different religion from the majority of Syrians.  This is a recipe for long-term instability.</p><p> I will comment briefly on the issue of counter-terrorism because this is what drives intelligence operatives in the West to resume ties and co-operation with the Assad regime.  Believing that Assad is an ally in the fight against Islamic extremism is like believing one can fight fire with the help of a pyromaniac.  Assad has a terrible record.  He has encouraged and co-operated with jihadi networks in Iraq in 2003 and in Lebanon after 2006.  After the uprising started in 2011 he deliberately encouraged the emergence of jihadi groups by releasing dozens of radical Islamic activists from jail.  This has been widely documented.  We have dozens of profiles of radical insurgent leaders who were in jail in Syria until the spring of 2011 and who were then released.</p><p> Assad needs these people to survive.  He needs them to be seen not for what he is, a mass murderer, but as a potential partner in the fight against terrorism.  He knows that the most extreme rebel groups do not receive State support for the reasons I have explained and because, basically, they excommunicate, for instance, Gulf monarchs.  These people do not receive the sophisticated weapons that could defeat the regime.  We know their mere presence among the ranks of the rebels discourages many western states from supporting the opposition.  The most extreme elements among the opposition, like the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shām, actually devote more energy to fighting other rebels than fighting the regime itself.</p><p> It is time for me to stop now but since I am among policymakers I will outline what I believe European Union countries, including Ireland, should do.  I believe diplomatic efforts should not cease but we must be aware of their limits and we must be aware of the fact that thus far they have failed to improve the situation, they have failed to protect civilians and this is likely to continue.  This is why we should explore other solutions.  Humanitarian aid is important but healing the injured and burying the dead while the massacre goes on is slightly hypocritical.  At least there should be some way to enforce an end to aerial bombing, especially so-called barrel bombings, which occur on a daily basis and wipe out whole blocks in cities such as Aleppo.  These are unacceptable.  I realise there is strong reluctance in the west towards ideas like a no-fly zone.  I am in favour of it but I recognise this is not a widely accepted idea.  At the least Syrian rebels should be allowed to arm themselves to protect the regions they control from such attacks.  European countries, even if they have no wish to participate in efforts to arm the rebels, should not oppose such initiatives from countries willing to do so, like France, for instance.  Of course it is not at all about arming the most extreme elements in the opposition.  On the contrary, I believe that by allowing moderate rebels to arm themselves we will create the bulwark against the most extreme elements in the insurgency.  I thank the committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

I should have mentioned earlier that Dr. Pierret is a lecturer in contemporary Islam at the department of Islamic and Middle Eastern studies in the University of Edinburgh.  He has lectured widely from Washington to Paris and in the United States on this and similar or related subjects.  Thank you for your original presentation.</p></speech>

He has outlined a picture that is remarkably difficult, complex and horrendous for Syria and the neighbouring regions.  I understand there have been more than 140,000 fatalities, over 9 million people within Syria are in need of immediate life-saving support and 2.6 million Syrian refugees require assistance in neighbouring countries.  That is a stark picture of suffering for so many individuals.</p><p>  The second international humanitarian pledging conference for Syria and the broader region took place at the end of January.  Initially the international community had been slow and reluctant to act.  Unfortunately, they did not react and provide the assistance needed.  Is Dr. Pierret aware of whether the humanitarian aid pledges made in recent times have been honoured or improved upon?  I realise it is not Dr. Pierret's particular area but he may be familiar with it.</p><p>  The United Nations Security Council resolution No. 2139 had laudable and necessary objectives.  However, at the end of March the United Nations Secretary General reported limited progress in respect of the issues that the UN was mandated to pursue.  The humanitarian situation has deteriorated in the meantime.  Has a robust assessment been carried out by the United Nations of the implementation of resolution No. 2139?  Has any urgency been shown in implementing the action plan to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons?  Dr. Pierret has laid particular emphasis on the difficulty with regard to establishing a transitional governing body.  If that issue could be progressed or if some progress could be made, does Dr. Pierret envisage any chance of the Geneva II conference being revived?</p></speech>

He referred to attacks on the regime.  It appears that Assad is unlikely to resign or give up his grip.  Those in the opposition seem more divided now than they have ever been.  The only thing those in the opposition seem to be joining together is their opposition to some of the groups within the country.  Deputy Brendan Smith noted that 15 March was the third anniversary of the beginning of the Syrian war.  Many people believe that it came out of the Arab spring.  Many people thought there would great and positive regime changes throughout the region.  As we have seen, there have been some changes in some countries but in others, like Bahrain, where the Arab spring started, it was not allowed to develop.</p> <p>Libya has broken down into tribal areas.  The whole region has experienced conflicts.  We all hope the magic bullet to resolve this situation will be found.  In the view of the witnesses will the opposition ever agree to a peace deal with Assad or his government?  This was a possibility considered during the Geneva talks.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to comment on a recent development in the reorganisation of Kurdish political forces and the creation of military self-defence groups in that region.  People have been coming into that region for security and protection.  Kurdish political groups have campaigned for a separate seat at the Geneva talks because they do not wish to be lumped in with the general opposition.  Would it be helpful if the Kurds had a separate seat at the table?  The Kurdish united and popular political movement could have a positive impact on the situation in the region.</p><p> Some attempts have been made to establish a humanitarian corridor, some more successful than others.  According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, 9.3 million people are in desperate need, 6.5 million people are displaced within the country and 2.5 million Syrians have become refugees in neighbouring countries and in north Africa.  The figures are staggering and I do not think we have any sense of the impact on the people.</p><p> The situation in Syria will not be fixed overnight.  How can countries like Ireland best ease the humanitarian crisis and what can Europe do?  Should the EU do more such as opening its borders to refugees?  What is the impact of the crisis on Jordan and Turkey which are dealing with massive numbers of Syrian refugees?  Lebanon has expressed concern about the impact on its infrastructure of the number of refugees.  It would seem that humanitarian aid is an attempt to plaster over the cracks which exist in Syrian society.  We are told that 65% of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile has been removed from the country.  Will it be possible to remove and destroy all the chemical weapons?   </p></speech>

Last week we acknowledged the anniversary of the massacres in Rwanda and we are facing another situation of that magnitude.  People say that what happened in Rwanda could never happen again but it is happening in Syria and I have no doubt that in ten or 20 years' time we will be acknowledging the number of casualties, fatalities and massacres in Syria.  It seems we never learn to move on and we continue to treat people in that way.</p><p>  I ask for the witnesses' view on the role of the United Nations.  As other members said, strong resolutions have come from the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council but it would seem that they are not worth the paper they are written on.  Does this show how the UN is inept or ineffective in this situation?</p><p>  There are questions with regard to the Syrian opposition.  I read an article which suggests that the headlines given to radical Islam are disproportionate to the actual numbers involved.  What is the Free Syrian Army doing about the radical groups which have infiltrated it?  Have particular areas been taken over by al-Qaeda?  I would value the views of the witnesses about the opposition.</p><p>  Russian and Iranian interests were mentioned in the submission.  The counter-balance is the influence of western and American interests.  It might be preferable if they could all back off from their involvement and let the Syrian people decide their own destiny but it seems we are not too fond of doing that.</p><p>  I was horrified by the reaction of the Russian ambassador who attended a recent committee meeting to speak about Ukraine.  I asked him if he would impress on his Government the need for humanitarian corridors in Syria so that medical and food supplies could get to the people.  His reaction was horrifying.  When the war eventually stops there will be massive problems for people trying to continue with their lives in the aftermath and for the rebuilding of Syria.</p><p>  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the reference in the submission to a separate Alawite state.</p></speech>

It indicates that he is a very keen specialist and he has in-depth knowledge of the subject and who am I to challenge some of his proposals?  However, I am a politician and we work in different worlds.  Dr. Pierret works in the academic world and mine is in the pragmatic, grassroots engagement with the people.</p><p>  The situation in Syria is horrendous.  My sympathy, for what it is worth, goes out to the Syrian civilians who are caught up in this international madness, this holocaust, essentially.  The degree of displacement and the number of refugees is unbelievable.  The solid middle class and working class communities find themselves in camps and in desperation.  We hear terrible reports about wealthy Saudi Arabians buying young girls from the camps.  I do not know if these reports are true but it was mentioned at a recent public meeting in Athens.</p><p>  We all ask the same question as to where we go from here.  At the outset of this crisis the committee heard representatives who made the case for our support.  Ireland decided to lend its support to the UN for aid assistance.  Some of the representatives wanted aid to go directly to them in the field.  These were opposition supporters at the time.  </p><p>  I have some suggestions to put to the witnesses and I ask for their comments. Should we be surprised at the role of the West?  It seems to me that once al-Qaeda or Islamist fanatics and suicide bombers are equated with the opposition, it is inevitable that the West stood back and did not show the support to which the opposition was entitled.  One cannot be blind to atrocities and the witnesses referred to the atrocities of the Assad regime.  We live in the age of the Internet and we have been able to see the atrocities carried out by elements of the opposition.  We are faced with a moral dilemma.  Dr. Pierret referred to morality and the moral case.  What Assad's people are doing is immoral.  The Russians support Assad.</p> <p>At around the time we had witnesses from Syria before the committee telling us about their experience, the United States Administration was referring to its red line policy, the red line being the use of chemical weapons, after which, we were told, the game would change.  Of course, that did not happen.  In fairness to the Russians, they did broker a deal with Assad to take chemical weapons out of the war zone.  To what extent that actually happened is probably still open to question, but at least it was something.  Having said that, it does not matter all that much whether a person dies from inhalation of some chemical or has a barrel bomb dropped on him or her.  How does Dr. Pierret view the Russian involvement in basically bailing out the West, and the United States in particular?  After talking about a red line and promising action would be taken if chemical weapons were used, the Americans did nothing.  We might say that the Russians did at least do something.<br/>There are elements of the conflict that have not been mentioned today, some of which are referred to in an excellent and saddening report in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  What is Dr. Pierret's interpretation of the role of Palestinians, Coptic Christians and other minorities who are caught up in the conflict?  The article to which I referred describes the support for the regime among the people living in the historic valley where the language of Jesus Christ is spoken.  It really is an incredible article which everybody should read.  Are such people wrong to support Assad for coming in and providing the security they seem to need?  In some cases, the loyalties of some of those who started out supporting the Arab spring seemed to have been usurped by other interests.  On the question of Western attitudes, was there not a fear that if support was given to the Syrian opposition, all the young men from Britain who went to fight against Assad - indeed, there were even a few Irish lads who went out - would bring their fanaticism back to the West?  This might have been another factor in the less than wholehearted support for the opposition.  As I said, there are many forces at play in the region.<br/>I did not know about the gains being made by the opposition, as referred to by Dr. Pierret, in the north, east and south of the country.  Not being very familiar with the region, can I assume that one of those regions is where the Kurdish population is very highly concentrated?  If there were ultimately to be a division of the country, is it right to presume that Assad would tolerate - one can hardly say he would be happy about it - those people being given their own homeland?<br/>The morality of the issue is very hard to get one's head around because we do not know who is moral in the field.  Dr. Pierret is suggesting that we should demand a stop to the barrel bombing, support the implementation of a no-fly zone and then arm the rebels.  Several questions come immediately to mind.  Who would be considered acceptable in the region to impose a no-fly zone?  What agency might be capable of applying the moral prerogative to stop the barrel bombings?  Finally, would arming the rebels really be a solution to the problems and conflicts in Syria?</p></speech>

Regarding the pressure for the implementation of a no-fly zone, can Dr. Pierret say why it has not happened?  Will he elaborate on the barrel bombing and the effect it is having on civilians?  It sounds like carpet bombing and must be taking a terrible toll on the civilian population.  It is often said that truth is the first casualty of war.  The civilian population is surely the second, particularly in this case.</p><p>  One of the saddest aspects of this conflict is the almost total helplessness of the global community in dealing with it.  Of course, it is always very difficult to deal with a situation where a person has been elected within a so-called democracy.  It is very difficult for the international community to get involved in regime change.  The morality of that issue has been discussed at this committee many times.  Allied to that is the reality that not everybody who has been elected democratically down through the centuries has proven subsequently to be a democrat.  Those issues must all be borne in mind.</p><p>  The extent to which the international community, including the European Union, Russia and Iran, seems invariably to be helpless in bringing any influence to bear on any perpetrator or series of perpetrators in defence of civilian populations is an issue of grave concern to this committee.  There seems to be no deterrent or warning sufficient to convince certain regimes in conflict situations that what is happening is not acceptable internationally.  One possible exception might be the former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, who did receive his comeuppance, albeit after a great deal of strife.  To what extent does the United Nations need to revise its thinking, attitude and policies in order to ensure that where atrocities of the nature we are seeing in Syria occur, there will be intervention to protect the civilian population and retribution for such atrocities?  It is very sad that this particular conflict is being overshadowed by other conflicts, which are serving to deflect public attention away from what is happening there.</p></speech>

I apologise if my expertise is such that I am better at answering certain of them than I am at addressing others.  In giving my response, I will try to link certain issues together.</p><p>  Several speakers referred to the role of the West, and there was reference to al-Qaeda, Islamists, suicide bombers and so on.  In my view, Western policy on Syria was defined once and for all in the autumn of 2011, when we did not have a single visible Islamist fighter on the ground in Syria.  In August of that year Assad was starting to use his military and it was obvious he was building towards the use of artillery in due course.  The military opposition at that time consisted of small groups of military defectors; one did not see any Islamists around.  At the same time, the NATO Secretary General and Ms Hillary Clinton were insisting there would not be any military intervention in Syria.  That is a statement we heard every single week in the autumn of 2011 and it was a disastrous message to send to Assad at that time.  He was being told, in effect, that he was free to do whatever he wanted, which is precisely what he had begun to do by late January 2012.  The Islamist threat simply did not arise at that time and cannot now be used as an excuse by the West for its inaction.  The policy was being defined very early on and was very clear by virtue of its contrast with what happened in Libya.  There the message was that it was not acceptable for Gadaffi to use his military against rebel strongholds, whereas, in Syria, Assad was allowed to do exactly the same without suffering any type of retaliation.</p><p>  Then we come to the famous red line.</p> <p>The Vice Chairman spoke of the helplessness of the global community in dealing with this situation but we see that the only moment Assad agreed to change his policy was when faced with a credible military threat.  It is the only thing that has worked so far.  The only dramatic move he made since 2011 was under a very serious and credible military threat.  Therefore, I do not think it is true to say we cannot do anything.  If the same kind of threat was formulated with regard to barrel bombings, forced starvation and all of that, we could secure some resources<b>.</b><br/>That leads me to the dreaded issue of the Russian role and whether it is positive.  I personally think, and this is strong wording, that the deal for chemical weapons was shameful.  It removed the most dangerous weapon from the scene as far as we know but we have now heard of new chemical attacks and they seem real because they have been mentioned by both the opposition and regime media.  Each side is blaming the other for the attacks.  I have good reason to think that the regime is best placed to carry out chemical attacks.  Apart from the fact that the implementation of the deal is perhaps not complete, it opened a period of several months during which Assad was given free rein to do absolutely anything he wanted and, I would even say, he was encouraged to do it for the simple reason that the military factories that produce chemical agents in Syria are located in the hinterland, mostly around Damascus and Aleppo.  In order to transfer these weapons to the port of Latakia and have them destroyed, the regime had to secure the strategic roads linking the hinterland to the coast.  That led to bloody battles that entailed forcing thousands out of their homes and barrel bombings of towns, which wiped certain towns off the map, all with some kind of beneficial blessing of the international community because that was necessary to implement the deal.  It was very problematic.  After that deal, we saw the implementation of the policy of starvation.  The message sent out was very negative.  The message was that as long as Assad got rid of Syria's chemical weapons he could do anything else, including starving the people.  I am not that grateful to Russia for its role in that respect.<br/>That leads me on to humanitarian measures, the issue of UN resolutions and the partial end to the siege of Homs.  As was said by one of the members of the committee, the implementation of these measures is very limited for the simple reason that the implementation of these humanitarian measures for besieged areas remains much too heavily dependent on the regime's goodwill, which, in many places, is still preventing food from coming in.  That is why I am personally in favour of a much more forceful approach such as humanitarian corridors that would be protected by UN military forces.  With regard to some of the people who left the besieged areas in Homs a few weeks ago, males aged between 18 and 50 were arrested and some of them have disappeared.  It is shameful that happened literally under the eyes of UN personnel.  <br/>I mentioned the issue of radical Islamists who were not there at the start of the conflict but who grew in strength throughout 2012 to a large extent by exploiting the helplessness of the international community.  I remember when the organisation al-Nusra - the front of support - issued its first statement in January 2012.  At the time it was a tiny network comprising a few dozen or a hundred people.  It was a very minor complement of the armed opposition.  Its first statement was very critical of the United states and Turkey and the reason for its criticism is complicated.  I remember it was perceived extremely badly among the opposition at large, and not only by the moderate opposition.  Most rebels found it ridiculous at the time to focus attacks on western countries when the real enemy was Assad and his allies and many rebels were still hoping they could get support from the West.  These radical movements and their entire western discourse gradually took root because of that context and because of that feeling of abandonment by the international community.<br/>What did the rebels do about it?  The members will have heard about internal fighting among the rebels which are internal divisions among them and I think that is very good.  The organisation being followed by the mainstream rebels, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, is essentially a destructive one which has its own agenda which has very little to do with the Syrian revolution.  Its agenda is one of a murderous utopian dream of having an Islamic state across the border between Iraq and Syria with complete disregard for the basic aspirations of Syrians to have freedom and dignity.  The regime it is trying to establish is certainly very harsh and repressive.  One of the most dangerous things it was doing was that it was sealing off the country from the outside world.  In 2012  a large number of Western reporters were coming into Syria and reporting from rebel controlled areas.  That completely stopped in 2013 because any foreigner getting into Syria was abducted by this organisation which was consistently working against the interests of the opposition in that respect.  At least this organisation has now been expelled from certain regions between north and western Syria and this has re-opened contact with Turkey.  I think this is good.<br/>Reference was made to a possible line of balance between Russia, Iran and western countries.  I do not see that kind of balance there at the moment in the sense that the support provided by Russia and Iran is much more significant and dedicated than western support.  With regard to the countries that support the opposition overall, we frequently hear about the rivalry between Qatar and Saudi Arabia - which are supporting the same people - and there are rivalries undermining the unity of the national coalition.  That is well known.  Western countries are not exactly on the same line as the Gulf countries.  There are not the same divisions among the allies of the Assad regime.  They have a very clear and well-defined objective.  They want Assad to remain where he is and they are doing everything they can to achieve that.  There is a major imbalance in the kind of support each side receives.  To connect the issue of the transitional body, I do not think the transitional body is a way to achieve a solution.  That is the final product but the question is how we get there.  How do we get the parties to accept the establishment of a transitional body?  I do not think it is a problem for the opposition, the political opposition, or even for significant elements of the military opposition.  It is interesting that before the Geneva talks earlier this year, military groups were saying, &quot;Do not go to Geneva; if you go there you will be traitors&quot;, but during the talks we had several rather encouraging statements by military organisations, including Islamist ones, but not radical jihadist ones, I suspect, encouraged in that respect by Qatar, which is not always playing a negative role.</p> <p>We are not very enthusiastic about Geneva but if one can achieve something there that is okay.  In that respect I do not think the problem is on the side of the opposition.  There was a question of whether the opposition would agree to a deal with Assad but that would not be a deal or a compromise.  One cannot have a compromise with Assad remaining in power.  That would be total victory by Assad.  The compromise in my view would be what was outlined in Geneva I, namely, a transitional body with elements of the former regime and elements of the opposition but not Assad remaining on top because that would not be a deal; that would be just a victory disguised as transition.  The problem is that the regime is totally opposed to the idea of transition so I do not think we are getting anywhere close to that solution, which is why I am so pessimistic about diplomacy.  I am sorry if I did not answer clearly.  I do think that military options could be part of the solution.  They would of course not solve everything.  There would be many problems but if we want to break the stalemate and protect civilians it might force Assad and his allies - perhaps not Assad; I do not think he will ever change his calculation.  He is in a bunker and he will remain in the bunker until the end but there are people in the region who I think would be ready to take a more flexible approach.</p><p> In the last days of August when everyone was expecting a strike against Syria I heard from western diplomats that many high-ranking officials in the regime were getting in touch with western governments seeking a way out because they thought the boat was sinking and that it was the time to leave it.  Once they realised that the US was not serious about the threat they just back-tracked.  They are people who have no affection for Assad.  They know where he led the country but they make a very rational calculation.  They think that if the regime is there to stay because no one is really serious about putting an end to it then they will stick with Assad because that is the safest option because they have families and interests in Syria.</p><p> I am looking for other issues I might not have addressed.  Reference was made to Kurdish political forces.  That is a tricky issue.  The problem is that there was a Russian idea to have three kinds of groups of representatives of the opposition; one would be the national coalition which was backed by western and Gulf countries and Turkey; one would be what they called the internal opposition, which I think is not a very accurate term because its main figure lives in Paris, but to put it simply, it refers to the opposition that is acceptable from the point of view of the regime; the third group is Kurdish nationalists.  The problem is that they would not be representative of all Kurds; it would be the dominant military force among the Kurds, which is called the PYD which has an armed branch called YPG.  It is a group that has historically had relatively close ties to the regime, which is very powerful because it is linked to the PKK in Turkey which means it has weapons, training and credibility on the ground but there are other Kurdish groups which do not share that political approach and especially their readiness to co-operate with the regime.  Kurds have the right to be represented in negotiations but the way the representation is designed must be very delicate and should be handled with the greatest care rather than serving the agenda of the regime.</p><p> There was a question about the regional impact and refugees.  The Western approach was that perhaps it could not do much to solve the conflict but at least it could try to contain it.  At least that was the US view.  I am not generalising to include all western governments.  That was misguided.  The refugee crisis is one thing that clearly shows we cannot contain the conflict.  It is good to help refugees in neighbouring countries but if the refugees keep flowing in and if we do not address the source of the problem it is hypocritical and eventually useless.</p><p> The kind of regional impact it can have varies widely from one country to another.  I am not too concerned about a country like Turkey, which is a large and relatively wealthy country and can deal with an influx of refugees, but Lebanon, on the other hand, is a very worrying case.  How can a country of 4 million remain stable with 1 million refugees, which is an insane number, and especially with all the political problems Lebanon has?  It is reluctant to welcome refugees.  There is a problem with sectarian violence in Lebanon.  Pretty much all Syrian refugees are Sunni Muslims and that is an issue.  In the 1940s when the Palestinians arrived in Lebanon that was already seen as a problem especially by Christian politicians at the time because it was creating an imbalance in the population and now one has this new even larger influx of Syrian refugees with no guarantee they will be able to go home any time soon because many of them come from regions especially around Homs where the regime is not at all eager to see them back.  The situation in Lebanon is very worrying.  Jordan is in between.  It is not as unstable and does not have the same potential for ethnic or sectarian strife as Lebanon but at the same time it is a rather poor country with limited resources.  One could ask how it could cope in terms of water supply with such a massive increase in population.  I will stop at that point.  I am happy to answer further questions.</p></speech>

I have picked up the threads of what was said from speaking to my colleagues.  I am a little alarmed with the answers Dr. Pierret has given.  It is a very complex and difficult situation but the Syrian army and regime looks as if it is winning the war.  It might take some time for that to happen.  I do not know whether the witnesses agree.  It is also obvious at this stage that the opposition is far from being a homogenous group.  It is made up of many diverse groups including some jihadists and al-Qaeda organisations.</p><p>  Dr. Pierret should correct me if I misinterpret him but his response seemed to be that perhaps the Americans should bomb the regime and follow through on the threat they made.  That would be disastrous.  Dr. Pierret does not paint any picture of what would happen subsequently.  There is no denying the Assad regime is a brutal one but would the cure be as bad or worse than the disease?  We have seen that in other places in the Middle East.  I just read a report in today&rsquo;s newspaper, for example, that in Maaloula &ndash; a town that has been totally destroyed &ndash; Christians were driven out and some of them were killed.  Moderate Islamists were also killed.  I look at what the US did, for example, in Iraq.  I doubt there are too many people there who say that what the US did has been a panacea for their problems and what they would have liked to see happen even though Saddam Hussein was brutal as well.  Another way must be found to deal with such issues.  It strikes me that simplistic answers will not resolve complex situations.</p> <p>The lack of cohesion among the international community is an issue that applies everywhere, including Ukraine, which we may discuss later, but I do not regard what Dr. Pierret said as being any sort of solution.  In terms of having a transitional body, I believe the extremists have an agenda, as we have seen in other countries, that will not end when the war is over.  It will continue, but Dr. Pierret does not appear to have factored that into the equation.</p></speech>

We have discussed matters of this nature previously and what it comes down to in the end is the extent to which a war of this nature can take place in a country with impunity in so far as the perpetrators are concerned.  Recognising that there cannot be an intervention from anywhere and that the conflict will continue indefinitely, without any retribution, to what extent must the United Nations change to meet the emerging situation because there are similar conflicts worldwide, and more will occur?</p></speech>

It is winning in certain regions that have been identified as the stronghold of the regime, which is mainly in the centre, in the province of Homs.  Second, it is not the Syrian army that is winning.  Every single battle won by the regime was won with the support of Hezbollah fighters, Iraqi fighters and pro-Iranian militias.</p><p>  When I spoke about gains by the opposition I was not referring to Kurdish region; I was referring to recent developments around Aleppo.  The regime is winning victories, mostly around the Lebanese border because Hezbollah is willing to intervene forcefully there as it is close to Lebanon but elsewhere in the province of Aleppo, the situation is not good for the region.  There have been setbacks there.  I do not believe the regime could ever achieve complete victory.  It cannot take the entire territory because it does not have enough loyal soldiers to do that.  It has suffered from a dire lack of manpower since day one, and that is why it is using such brutal tactics.  It needs to wipe a city off the map before re-taking it because it does not have enough soldiers to engage in street fighting and retake it house by house.  It first expels people or starves them before moving in.</p><p>  Senator Walsh said bombing the regime would be a disaster.  What we have in Syria today is far more violent conflict than what we saw in Iraq in the 2000s.  The monthly death toll is higher than at any point in the civil war in Iraq.  Currently, it is the most violent armed conflict in the world.  It is a disaster.  It has displaced 40% of the Syrian population.  I cannot see how it could it be worse.</p><p>  On the idea that the regime is providing something positive, we should compare it with that of Saddam Hussein.  Before 2003, Iraq was a stable country.  It was run by a ruthless, brutal regime but there was no war.  We have an actual war in Syria.  In terms of Damascus, it would be like saying that inside the beltway everything is fine but outside it one cannot find a building standing because all of them have been shelled for two years.  Is that the kind of security they are providing?</p><p>  We hear comparisons with Libya.  Libya is in a difficult, chaotic situation.  There is violence in Libya, but most Syrians dream of a situation like Libya.  What is the monthly death toll in Libya?  It might be dozens at most but it is very low in comparison with Syria.  The problem is that we cannot hope for anything better.</p><p>  Using military threat against the regime to obtain the end of the most blatant violations of human rights such as barrel bombings and starvation would not be a disaster.  That would save lives.</p></speech>

He did it unilaterally, and it worked.  We should not wait for the Russians to accept it because they will never do that.  I do not see any reason for Russia to change its mind on Syria, especially after the crisis in Ukraine.</p><p>  On that issue, I am in favour of unilateral action but in that respect the UN is inept.  It is not even able to issue a strong verbal condemnation.  When the first one was presented by the western countries in February 2012, which explicitly stated that this resolution cannot be used to justify military action, the Russians found a way to oppose it.  We can expect anything from that kind of mechanism.</p><p>  Reference was made to radical Islamists.  Radical Islamists have an agenda but it is not one that is compatible with political transition and democracy in Syria.  I agree with that but leaving Assad to do what he wants will not make these people weaker.  It is empowering them.  Their whole discourse is vindicated by the behaviour of the international community.  The first statement from the front of support organisation sounded misplaced to most Syrians.  They wondered what it was talking about and why it was bashing the West but many people now believe it was right from the onset.  There were fears about encouraging regime change in Syria and the Muslim Brotherhood taking over but because of that policy we find ourselves faced with far more radical Islamists than the Muslim Brotherhood.  That is a misguided approach to the conflict.  Also, as I explained, seeing Assad as a bulwark against these people is a fundamental error.  He needs them to survive because once they are gone, he will be gone too.</p></speech>

The letter noted that the committee agreed it would be useful to examine the issues raised as part of the brief.  As a preliminary step the Chairman asked the Minister to outline the Department's role and responsibilities and those of the Referendum Commission and other bodies in respect of the referendum process and format of the ballot paper.</p> <p>In response the Department sent a report to the committee addressing these issues, and I note from the committee's letter of January to the Minister's office that the report was noted by the committee at its January meeting.  I understand that at that point the committee felt the format of ballot papers should be reviewed in line with the findings of the Referendum Commission, and invited the Department to appear before the committee to brief members on the issues highlighted.  We are very happy to attend before the committee today.  It might be helpful if I summarise some of the key points and outline some of the issues that might inform discussion on the reported confusion over the format of the ballot paper.</p><p> The format of the ballot papers in the autumn 2013 referendums was in accordance with the law, as set out in section 24 of the Referendum Act 1994.  The two key requirements in the context of the present considerations are compliance with the form of ballot paper set out in Part 1 of the Second Schedule to the 1994 Act, and that the referendum proposal is stated on the ballot paper by citing the short title of the Bill as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 24 of the Act provides that the Minister may by order, following a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas approving that order, provide for the inclusion on the ballot paper of a heading indicative of the referendum proposal.  This was done on a number of occasions for referendums.  For example "British-Irish Agreement" and "Treaty of Amsterdam" were on ballot papers for two referendums held together in 1998.  In these cases the titles of the respective Bills did not include any reference to the referendum proposal.  The format of the ballot paper for the autumn 2013 referendum on the Seanad complied with these requirements.  The need for a heading, indicative of the referendum proposal, did not arise as the Short Title of the Bill included a clear reference to the referendum proposal, "Abolition of Seanad Eireann".</p><p> It is worth noting the format of the ballot paper has remained largely unchanged since 1963.  Since then the text of every referendum proposal has been prefaced with the question "Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the under-mentioned Bill?", followed by an instruction to mark either the "Yes" box or the "No" box.  We have had 35 referendums since 1963.</p><p> The referendum Acts provide for the dissemination of information to voters.  This is done in two main ways, namely, through the independent Referendum Commission and through the statement for the information of voters circulated to voters with their polling information card.  Section 2 of the Referendum Act 1998 provides the Minister may establish a referendum commission once a constitutional amendment Bill has been initiated in the Dail.  A commission has been established for every referendum held since then.  The statutory role of the commission includes the preparation and publication of one or more statements explaining the subject matter of the referendum and the text of the relevant Bill.  An independent guide drawn up by the commission is sent to each householder.  The Referendum Commission research indicated that 72% of the public claimed to have read at least some of the guide for the 2013 referendums.</p><p> Section 23(1) of the Referendum Act 1994 provides that a statement on the referendum proposal may be prescribed for the information of voters by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  A statement for the information of voters has been prescribed for every referendum held on the Constitution.  This statement is circulated to every person entitled to vote at a referendum with their polling information card.  It is also displayed in poster format at polling stations.  It can be used by presiding officers in assisting voters who have sight or reading difficulties.  Another source of information for voters is, of course, the record of the Oireachtas debates on the particular constitutional amendment Bill.  These information sources are the formal or official sources of information for constitutional referendums.  They are additional to the campaigns that might be run by political parties and third parties with an interest in the subject of the referendum.</p><p> As I mentioned earlier, I understand the committee received correspondence expressing concern that the ballot paper at last autumn's referendums was confusing.  The Department also received a small amount of correspondence and telephone calls, approximately ten letters and 20 calls.  This is a small number relative to the 1.2 million people who voted on the referendum.</p><p> The Referendum Commission research indicated that 55% of the respondents stated it was quite difficult or very difficult to tell what they were being asked to vote for with regard to the Seanad ballot paper.  The comparable figure for the Court of Appeal referendum was 47%.  The research also showed that 13% of respondents who stated they voted "Yes" on the Seanad ballot paper meant their vote to be a vote for the retention rather than the abolition of the Seanad; while 6% of those who stated they voted "No" meant their vote to be a vote for the abolition rather than the retention of the Seanad.</p><p> In any consideration of ballot paper wording, it is important we do not lose sight of the gravity of the decision voters are being asked to make and the need for precise language in legal matters.  Proposals to amend the Constitution can have far-reaching and profound consequences.  In a constitutional referendum voters are not simply being asked their opinion on a particular issue.  They are being asked to decide on amendments to the written Constitution that are set out in the relevant constitutional amendment Bill.</p><p> A question on constitutional amendment is significant and deserving of appropriate consideration and reflection by the people who are deciding on whether to amend the Constitution.  This is why significant resources are assigned to informing voters about the subject matter of referendums.  A "Yes" vote for a proposal at a referendum has the immediate and direct consequence of changing the law of the land.  For this reason these are a number of key considerations that must be taken into account on the design, text and language of the ballot papers used for the referendums, including the use of language.  We have been advised in the past by the Attorney General that the use of precis or paraphrases of the proposal which is the subject of a referendum could cause legal challenges.  In addition, the question needs to be asked as to whether there is a formula of language and approach to ballot paper formatting that eliminates all possible scope for confusion.  According to UK Electoral Commission research, an approach that may be completely understandable to one group of people may give rise to confusion in another group.</p><p> It is important the information available to voters is adequate.  The provision of information to voters by the independent Referendum Commission is a fundamental aspect of the referendum process.  As already outlined, the format of the ballot paper has been by and large the same for the past 35 referendums and 40 years.  People have built up a level of familiarity with the format of the ballot paper.  Any proposals for change to the design, text or language of the ballot papers used at the referendums would need to take account of these considerations.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to provide this summary and we look forward to hearing the views of committee members and engaging with them.</p></speech>

I am a little disappointed the presentation did not reflect the gravity of the research.  He is absolutely right that any referendum is an important matter and the language ought to reflect this, but the research suggests a huge number of people found it difficult or very difficult to understand and a considerable number of people apparently voted the wrong way.</p><p>  The fact we have been doing something for 50 years is probably not really terrifically beneficial when one considers we used to send children up chimneys and export children to the United States.  Unspeakable things happened many years ago which we do not do any more, so longevity does not cut it for me.  In a modern world we need to state the possibility of legal challenge absolutely exists, and I do not at all diminish its importance, but we have the capability to find language which is appropriate.</p><p>  My daughter came with me to vote in the referendum and she had to ask me which choice was correct.  That was my experience of confusion.  I did not report it, but there were only two of us and 50% of us was confused.  I hope we can move on and acknowledge the importance of this research and state it needs to be changed.  We need to keep in mind what is important not only to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government but to the people and state we can do better than this.  I hope the witnesses will tell us this is what will happen and that the Department is seeking a positive way to change it so we do not have to come back after the next referendum and have another conversation in which somebody states we have been doing it this way for 50 years so there is no way we can change it.</p></speech>

We are stating it has been considered on a number of occasions over this time, but this does not mean it cannot be changed or does not need to be changed.  The Referendum Commission stated what it felt was required was further research.  It is important that in examining this we include the widest possible research, including the considerable research in the UK which I mentioned in my presentation.</p> <p>We must do our own research and examine our experience in that regard.  The point I was trying to make is that when people vote "Yes" or "No" they are deciding on legislation.  The Seanad Bill is a good example, as there were a number of consequential changes.  Therefore, people were voting on whether they wished to change the Constitution to insert all of these other changes in it.  In that case to have simply have put a question such as, "Do you wish to abolish the Seanad?", would not have stood up legally afterwards.</p><p> We are not saying it cannot be changed but that it is important to hold onto the legal aspects and find a way of removing the confusion that exists to the greatest extent possible.  We believe there are two elements to this.  A key element is the information people are given in advance of and during the campaign beforehand.</p></speech>

However, there is still some mystery surrounding the papers.  One does not see the paper until one gets there, so one has no idea.  It is not fair to say that there is not enough information because a great deal of information is given to people, but they do not read it.  Would there be a way of giving a leaflet or having it present in the polling booth when people are engaged with the vote?  I do not know what the legal standing of that would be.  The UK does not have referenda, or not very often, but I am sure some research has been done and I wonder what it contains.  While we may have discussed changing it from time to time, I would have thought that the research that shows the confusion that arose is sufficient to propel us into a position where we need to change.  The issue is what to change to and that we are not defending the <i>status quo</i>.</p></speech>

I wish to make one or two points that might be relevant.  The Senator spoke about information at the poll.  There is the statement for the information of voters that is passed by the Oireachtas, which is available at a poster in polling stations.  That information is available to people as they vote if they wish to read it.</p><p>  With regard to the wording used, we must be particularly careful because there are constitutional constraints that will have to be borne in mind.  If one looks at the words used in Articles 46 and 47 of the Constitution, they give very little manoeuvre for changing what one might put on a ballot paper without being subject to some type of legal action.  Article 46.2&deg; refers to "Every proposal for an amendment of this Constitution..." - note the word "amendment" - and 46.3&deg; refers to "An Act to amend the Constitution", while 46.5&deg; refers to "a proposal for the amendment of this Constitution".  Against that background it is very difficult to come up with a question that might pass legal muster other than the one that is there, "Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution?"  It is quite constraining.  It is part of our job to point out these difficulties to the committee, so they are taken into account in its consideration of what it believes must be done.</p><p>  On the point about research and the UK research, it is quite instructive to look at them.  The Senator said the UK does not have referenda, or does not have them very often.  That is indeed true, but it is facing one about its membership of the EU and Scotland is also facing a referendum about its proposal to break away from the UK union.  Quite extensive research has been done in both areas regarding the wording.  It is interesting to see it because it reflects some of the difficulties that can arise with regard to the use of language.  The European proposal started as, "Do you think that the United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union?".  This was the initial question but it was found to be a bad question.  It appears fairly straightforward to me, per the average Joe Soap; I do not know what the Senator thinks of it.  It is asking whether one wishes to be in the European Union or not.  However, they found two things wrong with that.  They found that the phrase "do you think" should be changed to "should" for a number of intellectual reasons that we need not go into here.  Then they encountered difficulty with the phrase "the United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union".  The difficulty was that some people did not realise that the UK is already a member of the European Union, so how was that to be addressed?  It had to be put into a neutral phrase, "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?"</p><p>  I mention these to show there are immense difficulties and it is very complex to come up with a wording that will keep everybody right.</p></speech>

In fact, it is part of what we hope will come out of today's meeting, and the committee's deliberations on this would be factored into wherever we move forward on this.  Our opening statement was meant to be more informative than defensive.  It was not meant to be defensive of the <i>status quo</i>.  In fact, if one looks at how it finished, we said that if there are changes we need to be careful.  I would be worried if there was a perception that there is a simple solution to this and that we can simply go into plain English.  Any solution to this will not be that simple.

In years gone by there was something of a problem with that, in the sense that it might just read, for example, "The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill", and one could well imagine somebody going to the polling booth and wondering what the fifth amendment is about.  There was a provision in the legislation, as was said in the opening comments, about including a heading which helped.  In more recent years, however, if one thinks of the last amendment, whatever its number was, it included the abolition of the Seanad in brackets, so one got an indication, at least, of what was involved.  That is the law.  There is no provision in the law for subjecting the wording to examination by the courts before it appears on the ballot paper.</p></speech>

One can build up a head of steam.</p> <p>I shall not feel embarrassed about doing so anymore having listened to what has been said about people getting annoyed.</p><p> A point was made about seeing the information or question for the first time.  Is there a way to get around the matter?  A referendum is not like a local, general or European election where one can clearly vote for people and parties and one has sight of what one votes for.  The general rule of thumb, down through the years, has been that when the question is put,that the Government favours a "Yes" vote.  Therefore, if one supports the Government then the decision is simple and one votes "Yes".   However, if one does not support the Government then one can vote "No".  I am being very simplistic about the matter but a lot of people would say "This is what such a party is saying yet I belong to another party or no party" and vote accordingly.</p><p> The research remains unclear to me even though the delegation talked about what happened in Britain and what will happen in Scotland.  I also worry about holding a number of referenda on one day which has happened a lot in recent times.  From what we have heard from the Constitutional Convention there may be a proposal to hold a multi-referenda one day between now and the next general election.  I would like to hear the views of the delegation on the matter.  For the children's referendum we had one question on one day so the process was a bit more clear. </p><p> Reference was made to the design of the ballot paper but I am not sure what it was based on.  There has been talk for years of having a circular ballot paper for a general or local election.  I am not sure how its design can help the matter.  I would like to know the views of the delegation on all of the issues I raised.</p></speech>

We know that when there are multiple referendums the number of spoiled votes tends to rise in comparison with a single referendum.   As Mr. Falvey mentioned earlier, there was a time when the title of the referendum did not include what its purpose was. That led to a lot of confusion because one might have to vote on three different referendums just using the number of the referendum but all of them were on the same paper.  To remove that confusion we now use a separate paper with the title included.  The statistics have shown that one tends to have more spoiled votes in a multiple referendum.</p></speech>

There is a strong correlation between the information that is available to the voter and how he or she performs when voting.  Let us look at the information that the Referendum Commission circulated about the abolition of the Seanad.  It was upfront and said that in the referendum one may vote "Yes" or "No" to the proposal to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It also listed what would happen if the referendum was passed and stated that if the referendum is not passed "The Constitutional position of the Seanad will not be changed.".  To me that was clear information but I accept that some people may find that it was not clear enough.  There may be scope for looking at the information package that people receive.  Perhaps graphics showing the ballot paper and what happens when one ticks each box would help.  There is a balance to be drawn and it is something that the committee might want to think about.</p></speech>

The aim would be to ensure that the commission has enough time to present information in a way that is most beneficial, we hope.</p></speech>

I thank the officials for their attendance.  It is a belated thanks because it is some time ago since we raised this important issue.  However, I am pleased that they are here and hope that we can satisfactorily deal with this real issue.  We are practitioners and have first hand experience of the matter and I get annoyed when I hear replies such as "there is no provision in law".  If there is no provision in law then it is up to us to work towards a change.</p><p>  I am concerned that 14,355 people spoiled their vote on the Seanad referendum.  I do not know the reasons for them doing so but I know from my first hand experience of being out and about on the day that I have never had so many people complain about the structure and format of the ballot paper.  The same format was used on other occasions but the double negative was an issue.  The matter was well put by Mr. Falvey a moment ago when he iterated the question and then pondered the confusion.  Anytime one is asked a double negative there will be confusion.  We need to make the ballot paper more user-friendly without interfering with the gravity of the questions, as Mr. Deering has rightly said.  </p><p>  We will have a number of further referendums before the lifetime of this Government expires.  From the Constitutional Convention, which Deputies Mulherin, &Oacute; Snodaigh, Kirk and myself are on, and along with Senator Susan O'Keeffe, we will recommend more referendums are held.  The likelihood is that more than one question will be put on the one day which will present a challenge.  It will not be sufficient to say "we will do it as we did it before and let the consequences fall wherever".</p><p>  The ballot paper is confusing.  The last referenda was the first time that my 18-year old daughter voted and the ballot paper left her quite confused but I can see why.  I do not believe, for example, that the Irish and English versions should be together and I advocate separate boxes for them.  We could have the Irish version on one side and the English version on the other side.</p><p>  Let me turn to the language used, which was as follows:  "Do you approve ... to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?"  Words like "undermentioned", "aforesaid" and that sort of stuff is more for the D&aacute;il Chamber, the courts or a tribunal than for people exercising a "Yes" or "No" decision.  I could go on but I am not going to.</p><p>  The Referendum Commission was very quick to pass the buck when we initially raised the issue.  The phrase "none of my business" was given to us by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government but we have before us the two officials whose business I assume that it is.  </p><p>  Mention was made of the colour of the papers.  That was fine but people did not know beforehand that the pink paper referred to the Seanad and the other option was blue or whatever.  The colour code could have been adverted to by the Referendum Commission in its advertisements displayed in the weeks before polling day.  </p> <p>The matter of the language used by the Referendum Commission is not for today but it is worth remarking that the previous referendum on the Lisbon treaty had a condescending actor on behalf of the Referendum Commission saying that he was not very good at counting but that he could count calves.  He said it with a rural accent as if this was, in some way, going to bring farmers out to vote.  Let us not treat people like fools but treat them in a way that is understanding of the world we live in.  It is no issue to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government officials or to the Referendum Commission if people do not turn out to vote but it is up to us, as public representatives who have been elected by the people.  We have a duty.  If we make recommendations, the recommendations should be taken on board.  If we are told there is no provision in law, let us have such a provision.  I am looking for change although we may not decide on the type of change today.  I ask Mr. Falvey and Mr. Deering to accept that 14,000 people spoiled their votes, having taken the trouble to drive, cycle or walk to a polling booth, not to mention the 70% of the electorate that did not bother to vote.  Research does not advert to the reasons behind this.  I thank the officials for attending.  I am a little disappointed with the replies and there is too much legal jargon and confusion.  The Irish and English language elements need to be separated.  If there is colour coding, we should know before we go in what colour to look for.  In the leaving certificate, it used to be pink or blue papers for pass or honours level exams and people used to know the one they wanted.  Let us make this a little more user-friendly and let us not be surprised if people are turned off by the outdated process, which has not changed since 1963, if we do not make it user-friendly.  That is beyond the lifespan of some people in the room.</p></speech>

I agree on that point.  For many reasons, the Deputy has difficulties with the ballot paper but we are saying there is a need to exercise caution in examining the ballot paper because of the legal context.  The other issue concerns information.  There is great flexibility in what can be provided by way of information through the Referendum Commission while leaving the ballot paper alone.  That is a point that strikes me.</p><p>  I understand the point about the double negative.  Trawling through the various referendums we have had in the past, people have voted on complex issues before and the issue has not risen.  The fifth amendment was a negative proposal to the people.  At the time, perhaps people did not question things but there is no suggestion that people were confused then or are confused by detailed questions.  </p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Kitt.  We should get information beforehand and see what it looks like.  There was confusion in our literature where we mentioned voting "Yes" and an X in the box.  When people see X, they think of "No".  What is handed out beforehand can make a big difference.  If the literature was handed out beforehand, people could see a snapshot of it.</p><p>  We do not want to have different referendums on different days because people give out to us, saying that we are wasting taxpayers' money by holding them on separate days.  If they saw what was coming up beforehand, it might make it easier.  We could send out circulars saying that this will happen if people vote one way.  </p></speech>

Referendums differ and giving too much detail may be prejudicial to the matter being put to the people.  Underneath, we could ask whether people approve of the proposal to abolish the Seanad.  There were multiple parts to it but that is what would have happened.  People would have been clear in that situation.  It is always an issue of legalese.  It is a bit like the rabbit in the headlights when people see sections quoted and they wonder what they must do.  I agree with Mr. Falvey.  Over 50% of people talk about confusion.  The confusion is compounded when they see the ballot paper.  As citizens, people see it as their duty to vote and vote on everything.  They are confused coming in.  I go to polling stations and I hear commentary from presiding officers that people are making comments about being unsure.  That points to what has been discussed generally by people, that there is a need for more information.  Is there a fundamental problem?</p><p>  I agree with the point made by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Kitt.  I have never seen a referendum where people have not said they were confused.  It may be about the ballot paper or about how they were going to vote.  When they vote on council elections, D&aacute;il elections or European elections, unless they have a particular objective to spoil a vote, they vote because they connect with the person.  One can question whether they really know us and whether they know what the referendum is about.  It is very confusing.</p><p>  In the children's referendum, the rule guaranteeing equal coverage to those for and against meant that clarification could have been provided by me but, because media could not find someone to argue against the referendum, what I had to say could not be in the paper or presented on radio.  It borders on the ridiculous.  There will always be issues with referendums.  Unless it is a clear-cut question like whether to join Europe, going into topics like a court of appeal means that it is confusing.  People argue strongly on each side, which is good because we are in a democracy.  There will always be confusion about referendums.  That is the issue and we must clarify as much as we can with the information.  We should make people feel comfortable.</p> <p>I think that is what Deputy Charles Flanagan was saying.  We need to ensure people do not feel overwhelmed when something is put in front of them.  When they see references to sections of legislation, etc., they wonder what it really means.  They feel like they are on the spot.  They feel like they are doing an exam.  That is what it is like.  People bring that confusion with them when they are not clear from the outset about how they want to vote in a referendum.  They might trust me or Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and decide how to vote on the basis of what one of us has said.  That is the truth.  I hope people will continue to do that.</p></speech>

We discussed some referendums and by-elections which are not yet on the calendar.</p><p>  I am a firm believer in the use of plain English or Irish.  We should not forget that 25% of the public in our society is functionally illiterate.  There is another volume of people on top of that who are afraid of forms and officialdom.  If we couch anything in official language or take a convoluted approach, it makes it difficult for them.  When ballot papers are being prepared, we need to join the officials in doing whatever we can to prevent people from spoiling their votes.  If there are people out there who want to spoil their votes, that is fine in some ways.</p><p>  I do not believe the outcome of the referendum that has been mentioned related solely to the form that was used.  The same kind of question was put when the death penalty was overwhelmingly rejected.  The people were asked "do you agree to remove the death penalty?" or something like that.  People were not confused about whether they were voting for the death penalty or against it.  They understood what to do.  Part of the onus to get the message out there in a proper format is on us.  I believe there is nothing to prevent us from producing the wording and detailing the format at an early stage.</p><p>  I heard what was said about the use of a headline, but there is nothing to prevent the use of a headline term like "Seanad &Eacute;ireann" or "Death Penalty", which would not involve taking a position one way or the other.  I think it would end a certain form of confusion when there is more than one referendum.  Some people want to vote in one referendum and not in another.  The Referendum Commission probably has figures to show that people have left ballot papers blank in some cases because they were unable to make up their minds.  When we voted on the abolition of the death penalty, two other referendums were held on the same day.  Some people were confused about the other issues, or did not engage with them.</p><p>  I suggest that this debate points to the need for a permanent electoral commission that could deal with these issues on an ongoing basis.  As this is a political question, I do not expect the officials to answer it.  Perhaps such a commission could try to promote voter education in schools and in wider society so that this kind of confusion is less likely to arise.  In any democracy, there is always a discussion about ballot papers.  Concerns have been expressed about the shape of the normal ballot paper.  I understand that up to 28 candidates are running in the forthcoming local elections in some areas, which will necessitate the use of a long sheet of paper.  The difficulty with folding over the ballot paper, as is done in some countries, is that the candidates on the back page will complain that they are not accessible.  Similarly, there have been complaints that the use of alphabetical order when listing the candidates in an election means that some of them receive preferable treatment simply by virtue of having a surname that begins with a certain letter.  Obviously, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has grappled with such issues.  I suggest that the Referendum Commission should be allowed to make decisions on them.</p><p>  I encourage those involved to look at the layout of referendum ballot papers to make sure the language is clear.  I appreciate that some of the language comes from the legislation we pass to provide for the referendum.  An additional complication is the fact that the Irish-language version of the Bill is on one side and the English-language version of it is on the other side.  When such Bills come before us, it can be very confusing to work out which section to try to amend.  There is much to be said for straight talking and plain English.  I am sure the Plain English Campaign is still out there.</p></speech>

Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Mulherin both made points about what appears on the ballot paper.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, it is actually decided by the Oireachtas in the context of the Bill that promotes the referendum.  That governs what we are required to do from a legal perspective.  As I said earlier, there is more openness with regard to the information that can be provided.  There are two approaches to this.  We will be interested to hear the views of the committee on them.  One approach relates to information and the other approach relates to further clarification.</p><p>  I emphasise that the Referendum Commission does not claim that its research, which is a very welcome opening salvo in this process, is definitive.  We need to be very clear on the issues that are confusing people.  It is important to note that resounding decisions have been made, in one direction or another, when other referendums have been held in similar areas.  This tells us that it is not always necessary to focus on the language - we may need to look at other things as well.  All we are saying is that the manner in which we proceed in this respect needs to be carefully considered.</p></speech>

The matter was highlighted recently in Kilrush District Court.  On behalf of the committee I welcome assistant commissioner, Mr. John Twomey, as well as chief superintendent, Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, and superintendent, Mr. Cornelius O'Donoghue, of the Garda national traffic bureau.<br />I wish to draw your attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The opening statements you have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.<br />Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I call on the assistant commissioner, Mr. John Twomey, to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

Before getting into specifics I believe it might be useful to give a broad overview of the GoSafe safety cameras to help to contextualise the relevant issues.  The safety camera project was established to reduce speed-related collisions and, as a consequence, save lives in designated areas, known as speed enforcement zones.  Although 2013 resulted in an increase in road deaths from the previous year the total of fatalities that year was the third lowest number ever recorded.  To put it into perspective, in 2005 there were 396 road deaths and in 2013 there were 190.  Therefore, the reduction between 2005 and 2013 was more than 50%.  For the five years prior to the commencement of GoSafe operations approximately 30% of fatal collisions annually were occurring in particular zones of the road network.  In 2013 there was a reduction of 40% of fatal collisions in these speed enforcement zones, a reduction of 23 road fatalities.  Separately, the speed surveys from January 2011 showed average compliance rates for all speed limits in these areas of 81%.  Speed surveys from 2014 showed average compliance rates across all speed limits of 95%, an increase of 14% in these areas.<br />Excessive and inappropriate speed is the number one road safety problem.  Speeding is a primary factor in approximately one third of fatal collisions and an aggravating factor in all collisions.  These data are from an European Transport Safety Council performance index, PIN, report in 2010.  We believe it is fair to say that these statistics demonstrate the important role safety cameras have played in improving road safety in this country.<br />The outsourcing of the operation of safety cameras commenced in November 2010 and reached full operational capacity in March 2011.  The contract was for five years from commencement in November 2010 with an option to extend for one further year.  The system is operated by the service provider GoSafe under the direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responsibility for the scheduling of monitoring and survey sessions.  The superintendent of the Garda national traffic bureau, GNTB, has responsibility for ensuring oversight of the day-to-day running of the project.  This work takes place in the office for safety camera management, OSCAM.  GoSafe has responsibility for ensuring that monitoring and survey sessions are conducted in accordance with the schedules and for the provision of survey and monitoring data to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  GoSafe provides the necessary vehicles, monitoring and survey equipment and operators.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the prosecutor and the data are transferred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for prosecution.<br />From the outset of the project An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established OSCAM under the responsibility of the superintendent of the GNTB and currently four full-time personnel are allocated there.  OSCAM has <i>inter alia</i>access to all GoSafe session data, equipment, vehicle and personnel logs and the office is responsible for monitoring the operations of GoSafe on a day-to-day basis.  We have supplied appendix A, a document setting out some of the performance indicators and areas where we focus.<br />The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data.  Following the selection of a speed enforcement zone the outsourced safety camera operator, GoSafe, liaises with local members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify suitable sites to operate from.  Each site must be clearly visible and risk-assessed to ensure the health and safety of the public and the operators of the safety camera vans.  Once a suitable site is confirmed ongoing surveys are conducted to monitor the compliance rate with speed limits.  Signage is erected at the start of each zone to inform road users and information on the location of all zones is available on the Garda website.<br />Speed enforcement zones are continually reviewed to ensure enforcement activity is targeted and prioritised at the locations where collisions are occurring, with some zones being removed and additional zones being included.  Currently there are 727 speed enforcement zones nationally.  The locations and collision history are available on the Garda website.  Monitoring of speed enforcement zones is carried out at set times and on set days based on when collisions occur.  Analysis of compliance and detection rates has also led to the introduction of a weighting system within the roster which allocates a higher weighting, and, consequently, more monitoring hours, to those locations where compliance rates are lowest.<br />GoSafe is contracted to provide 7,475 hours of monitoring and surveying per month.  This is currently divided up into a minimum of 7,375 hours per month throughout the country from vans marked with high-visibility reflective material, which display safety camera symbols.  These safety cameras are mobile.  GoSafe also provides a minimum of 100 survey hours per month from unmarked vans to observe and record the speeds at which vehicles are currently travelling.  This is for survey purposes only.  These survey hours may be reduced to increase monitoring hours.  As I noted earlier, no prosecutions come from survey hours.<br />The audit process in place includes weekly and monthly reviews and invoice reconciliation and consists of a two-tier audit process involving OSCAM and GoSafe.  GoSafe has fulfilled its contractual obligations at all times.  As part of the monitoring of the contract, each Wednesday the roster for the following roster week is approved by OSCAM.  This is checked to ensure that GoSafe adheres to certain guidelines, including that sites are not overused or that sessions do not overlap with other nearby sessions.  On a daily basis the actual data for each session is received by OSCAM as well as a non-completion log, which outlines any sessions not completed as expected.<br />Under the audit process at the end of each month the actual data for the month is compared to the approved roster.  Each session is cross-referenced against other reports received during the month and a decision on payment is made at that stage.  Any sessions conducted in excess of the contractual agreement are not considered for payment.  However, data gained from these sessions are transferred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are processed as normal.  Since June 2011, GoSafe has consistently exceeded the contractual sessions and all hours before that date have been recouped by the State at no cost.<br />The ongoing oversight by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GoSafe has led to improved back-office processing methods as well as the upgrading of camera equipment to tackle such issues as image quality and images lost due to the presence of multiple vehicles within an image.  GoSafe will shortly introduce dual radar units, which will enhance the identification of the offending vehicle when more than one vehicle is present within the detected image.  These units will be utilised specifically at locations where validation of images is difficult due to multiple vehicles or image quality.<br />I wish to comment on specific issues raised by the committee.  Failure to pay a fixed charge penalty notice after 56 days results in a summons being issued.  Speeding summonses are received at the fixed-charge penalty notice office in Thurles.  The certificates of ownership, copies of the speeding detection, a request to produce the driving licence or learner permit in court and details of all correspondence with that office are attached to the court pack for prosecution purposes.  A cover sheet issues to the relevant superintendent in the district who conducts the prosecution.<br />OSCAM currently schedules GoSafe employees to attend court when required as a Garda witness in speeding offence prosecution.  Where GoSafe notifies the fixed charge penalty office that an operator has left its employment the fact is recorded on a cover sheet provided in the court pack with the home address of the operator and outlines that a witness summons must be applied for to secure attendance in court.</p> <p>Where GoSafe notifies the fixed charge penalty office, FCPO, that an operator has left its employment this fact is recorded on a cover sheet provided in the court pack with the home address of the operator outlining that a witness summons must be applied for to secure his or her attendance in court.  When GoSafe commenced operations in 2010 the inspector in the fixed charge penalty office briefed all personnel involved in the preparation of the court files in the various Garda districts and outlined the actions required to prosecute these cases.  A direct number and mobile phone number are provided to assist with any inquiries.</p><p> At times there can be a conflict of court sittings, resulting in a GoSafe operator being required in two courts at the same time, resulting in it being necessary to request an adjournment in one of the courts.  It is accepted that there are, at times, ongoing difficulties in scheduling the operators for court as they operate across a number of District Court areas.  Furthermore, the late notification of the court list, sometimes the evening before the court, allied with the late service of summons, makes it problematic for securing operator attendance and in applying for and serving witness summonses.  This issue is receiving ongoing attention.</p><p> As well as receiving formal training from GoSafe in relation to court attendance, a number of briefing sessions were held for operators at the outset of the project.  The superintendent in the Garda national traffic bureau and-or the inspector in the fixed charge penalty office addressed each of these briefing sessions dealing with the issues of court procedures and the giving of evidence.</p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied with the court process.  However, where difficulties arise, each case is reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Similar to all road traffic and other legislation, prosecutions of GoSafe offences for speeding are open to defence challenges on both legal and procedural matters.  However, there have been no challenges to current legislation underpinning the safety camera project.</p><p> I am also aware of the request for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to supply the committee with figures for the number of summonses that have been dismissed or struck out in court due to the inadmissibility of evidence given by GoSafe staff when prosecuting cases in court.  These figures are unavailable as this level of detail is not recorded.  We do not differentiate between a GoSafe summons and a summons issued directly by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are unable to provide that information.</p><p> Each case is heard before the courts on individual merit and on a case-by-case basis.  However, as stated earlier, where issues arise that could have an impact on the relevant legislation or corporate policy, these cases are reviewed specifically and any issues of concern addressed.  In this regard, a number of cases relative to the safety camera project have been remanded to May 2014 and the results of these cases will be closely monitored. </p><p> The Minister for Justice and Equality and the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na entered into a contract with GoSafe to operate safety cameras in Ireland on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The management of outsourced safety cameras formed part of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report 2012 for the public services, chapter 8.  In compiling that report a representative from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General reviewed how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na oversees and manages the contract with GoSafe.  The report did not make any comment or recommendation in respect of current oversight as carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></speech>

The background to the meeting from the point of view of the committee is based on comments made by a judge at Kilrush District Court and the concerns he raised.  I refer to his comments addressed to the local Garda superintendent who prosecutes those cases:<blockquote><br />You have been put in an unenviable position of trying to prosecute cases where matters have been so badly and so appallingly put together by [a named inspector] and his team....The sooner this is highlighted, the better....The complete waste of public money by these people who come into court who don't know or don't happen to be told how to prosecute simple road traffic matters.</blockquote>Mr. Twomey, the Assistant Commissioner, has set out the process and procedure.  Has he had an opportunity to investigate that particular case?  If so, I ask if he might share with us what he believes went wrong and how he might propose to have it fixed.<br />With regard to the broader contract with GoSafe, Mr. Twomey stated that GoSafe has fulfilled its contractual obligations based on the audit.  In light of issues which have arisen, is there a necessity to revisit that contract and the training of personnel?<br />Mr. Twomey described in detail the process for preparing and presenting evidence in court.  In his view, would a change in legislation, which is our role, be preferable, rather than dragging him in here to explain the process?  Is there a role for us as legislators to bring forward amending legislation to make that process more streamlined and make it easier to prosecute while also protecting the citizen?<br />I refer to other references made by Judge Durcan about comments by Gay Byrne whose view was that the courts do not deal with this in an appropriate manner.  I have asked the question but I suspect Mr. Twomey will not comment.  I will not press the matter.</p></speech>

Any such issues raised are of particular concern to us.  We examine each and every one of those cases in detail and we ask ourselves a number of questions.  Do the points raised impact on the law?  Invariably the issues raised will follow two lines.  One line will be to address the legislation and the second will be to address the process.  In the matter of the Kilrush District Court case and other cases, we are happy that it is a matter of the process more so than the legislation.  We are happy that the legislation is sound and that it stands.</p><p>  This project has been running since 2010 so we are four years down the road.  There have been lots of prosecutions.  Any legislation is open to a defence.  We do not have a particular concern about the legislation.  A number of issues related to the process were raised on that day and some of those process issues related to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because we are the prosecutors while GoSafe personnel appear as witnesses.  It is a matter for the Garda superintendent and the prosecution to ensure that all the proofs are in place.  The number of issues arising on that day have been addressed.  The cases have been put back to a later date.  The inspector from the fixed charge penalty office will be present in court to address any of the issues the District Court judge may raise.  At this stage we are satisfied that we can address the issues that have been raised in the court but like everything, the situation can change from case to case and from issue to issue.  We are reasonably happy at this stage that we can address any of the issues raised by the court.</p></speech>

Anything that can be done to reduce the number of road fatalities is a good thing.</p> <p>Anything that could be done to try to reduce the number of road fatalities would be welcome.  Regardless of the colour of the vans or where they are based, the most important issue is that people are made aware of the speed at which they travel and that they try to reduce it.  Anything that could be done in that regard is a good thing.</p><p> Mr. Twomey might be able to indicate whether it is urban legend or if there is a degree of truth in the following.  It has been recounted to me that if a person fails to turn up in court for prosecution, he or she can use for defence a statement to the effect that he or she did not receive the summons in the post.  It has been relayed to me that if they use that defence the case is essentially thrown out.  There is an assumption that the person must receive the summons and if it is conveyed to the individual by way of standard post then the assumption cannot stand up in court because the person might not have received it.  If that is the case, is there anything that could be done to mitigate the situation from the point of view of saying the assumption is taken for granted once the summons enters the postal system?  The postal rule is that the letter becomes the property of the person to whom it is conveyed rather than the person from whom it is conveyed.  If what I outlined were the case it would be worrying as it would be a serious waste of Garda resources if it had to hand out summonses.  I do not say the situation I have outlined is true but I would welcome clarification.</p><p> On the 727 speed enforcement zones, could Mr. Twomey provide an indication of, typically, how often they are manned or policed?  Other committee members might have a different view but I seem to see the same locations manned regularly, in particular on national primary roads &ndash; open and straight stretches of road that are prone to speed.  There might be a tendency to put one&rsquo;s foot down on the accelerator on such a road but it might not necessarily be the same type of road that claims so many lives.  I refer to secondary and tertiary roads on which lives are lost in many cases because of the condition of the road or the nature of the driver.</p><p> Is the data compiled by the speed vans used to try to encourage local authorities and the National Roads Authority to carry out mitigating works?  My understanding is that the approach being taken is based on enforcement, engineering and education.  Enforcement is fine.  That is what the Garda is doing but is the data used to suggest to local authorities that speed limits are wrong &ndash; too high or too low &ndash; or that work must be carried out?</p><p> It has been said in the context of dismissed cases that there is no differentiation between what is dismissed by virtue of an operational issue with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and cases relating to Go Safe.  Is it the intention to introduce categorisation to find out what is happening so that we know the situation?  Everyone would agree that the investment by the State is significant.  There is a lot of capital investment.  Much money is involved.  The company in question has returned its accounts.  To ensure the individual and the road user is getting value for money and the Garda is getting value for money, is it the intention to break down the figures to see if it is possible to improve the situation?</p></speech>

The situation is under constant review.  We analyse collision data for a five-year period.  That highlights trends in various zones.  The situation shifts constantly.  This was the first time An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had embarked on such a contract to outsource some of its enforcement and to tell people and put on its website the locations of the speed cameras.  The simple message is that if one speeds in those zones one is liable to be killed or seriously injured, more so than anywhere else on the road network.  They are the areas that are most dangerous on the road network.  We have given the information to the general public to ask them to slow down in the first instance because if they do not they run a far greater risk than anywhere else on the road.</p><p>  The zones are constantly shifting.  Compliance rates have shifted to 95%.  Some areas do not shift and other areas are higher than 95%.  We took zones off the list where compliance was higher and we replaced them with other areas.  The analysis in 2012 and 2013 was a year older and we had more up to date information.  We did change and we added to the locations.  We increased the number of monitoring hours.  It started off at 6,000 and we have now extended it to 7,375.  As a consequence of the surveys and the increased compliance we were able to focus greater attention on the monitoring aspect of it to allow enforcement.</p><p>  We focused more on certain areas because of the collision data and what it tells us.  We weight the zones.  If compliance levels in some zones are considerably lower than in other ones we will put increased emphasis in that area to try to bring compliance up.  When we bring compliance up we increase safety and reduce road fatalities.  That is the simple and single objective of the initiative; to reduce fatalities and injuries on the roads.  We can achieve that by reducing speeds.</p><p>  On the splitting of the dismissals in the court, it is certainly something we will take away and consider but it has not been of concern to us to date.  There is no considerable differentiation between the Garda dismissals and the GoSafe dismissals.   There is no noticeable difference between the two but it is certainly something that we will take away in light of the issues raised and I hope we will be able to provide the data in future.</p></speech>

All accidents are recorded on what we call a form CT68.  Every accident has a CT68.  The data is shared with both the Road Safety Authority and the NRA.  They have the information.  We also have national and local meetings with both of those organisations.  We visit every fatal accident site with the local authority.</p><p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan is correct that the three areas that relate to road safety are known as the three Es - enforcement, engineering and education.  We work very closely with local authorities.  They have the same data we have on accidents; time of day and location on the road.  There have been lots of stretches of roadway that have been re-engineered based on the accident data.  There is a close working relationship between ourselves, the NRA, local authorities and the RSA &ndash; all of the agencies involved in road safety.  I will ask Superintendent O&rsquo;Donohue to respond to the final point.</p></speech>

We serve them by ordinary post.  It is covered in legislation &ndash; in the Interpretation Act &ndash; that we can serve a document by ordinary post.  People do on occasion go to court and give the defence that they did not get the notice.  They are entitled to give that defence and it is up to the court as to whether it accepts it.</p><p>  There is a change in the 2010 Road Traffic Act which will affect how we serve our fixed charge notice and in terms of the evidence.  To go back to the first question asked by Deputy Dooley about changes in legislation, there is a change that will allow us to serve notice.  Proof of service will be provided by way of certificate of postage to a particular address or delivery to a particular address.  It would also remove the defence for somebody to day they did not get the notice in defending their case in the court because as part of the summons under the new process they would be given another opportunity to pay the fixed charge.  If one is sent a fixed charge notice and one did not get it for whatever reason, when one gets a summons one will get an option to pay.  We refer to it as a third payment option on the basis that one has two options to pay before that; a payment of &euro;80, an increased amount after 28 days and then a third payment option at some stage.  Those changes are part of the 2010 Act.</p><p>  There is an ongoing project with the other stakeholders in the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Courts Service to try to implement that section of the 2010 Act.  The introduction of those provisions will see a change in terms of how we prosecute cases and how cases are defended.</p></speech>

Preventive methods and learning from procedures is what is important.  Deputy O'Donovan referred to the additional warning signs, the changing of speed limits, the necessary road surface improvements and the elimination of bends, particularly on some minor and regional roads that are accident black spots.  The level of co-ordination among the National Roads Authority, the Road Safety Authority, the Garda and the local authorities must be addressed at an early stage.  The accident black spots throughout the country have been identified but what progress has been made in meeting the requirement to eliminate the dangers on those sections?  I am aware that near Milltown, in the centre of County Kerry, action has been taken in the past six months as a result of numerous incidents, including cars skidding off the road, on which there was good liaison among the local authorities, the Garda, the Road Safety Authority and the National Roads Authority.  We need more of that because prevention is the answer to these problems.  Such liaison will not remove all the risks or reduce the number of fatalities but it will assist greatly in that regard.  I wish the witnesses well in their endeavours.</p></speech>

I welcome Assistant Commissioner Twomey and his colleagues.  It is an interesting discussion because road safety and reducing collisions and fatalities on our roads should be a priority of all of us.</p><p>  I want to touch on three areas, one of which a response has been given to the Deputies who raised it, namely, the criticism by the courts.  My question is to Assistant Commissioner Twomey.  Why are the cases dismissed or struck out not recorded by the office for safety camera management, OSCAM?  Does the Garda keep a record of that?  I accept it can be complicated for various reasons but if a record was kept of the number of cases being struck out it would be of interest this committee and to the general public.</p><p>  With regard to the integrity of the process, I refer to a recent "Prime Time" programme which I am sure the Assistant Commissioner saw in which questions were raised regarding the standard and maintenance of equipment used.  That can be used in court if challenged.  What key performance indicators, KPIs, or system of oversight does the Garda use to ensure that the contractors, GoSafe, have adequate equipment?  What are the reporting mechanisms to the Garda or to OSCAM?  It would be essential for public confidence that the integrity of that system would be good.</p><p>  The assistant commissioner explained how the Garda reviews the selection of enforcement zones and that it is closely monitoring that.  He mentioned the Road Safety Authority and the National Roads Authority but is there an opportunity for the local authorities' road sections or even public representatives through the Garda liaison committees on local authorities to give local feedback on problems identified by locals or public representatives?  I understand the Garda selects the enforcement zones and then directs the contractors but it is important from a public confidence point of view that there would be adequate opportunities in that regard.  The assistant commissioner might address that point.</p><p>  Public confidence in the system is vital.  It is important that people support the system in operation but it would be remiss of me not to say that sometimes I hear criticism in that regard.  People are caught speeding, and that is a fair point, but there is criticism of the system on occasion in that it is almost entrapment.  I ask the assistant commissioner to respond to that from a public confidence point of view.  If people are speeding, they are speeding.  It is a black or white issue, but people sometimes say these vans are located on relatively straight roads where there does not appear to be a problem, whereas there could be a problem in other areas.</p><p>  I want to give credit to the Garda for its use of social media.  I use Twitter, and I notice that breath-testing and speed zones are regularly notified on social media by the Garda.  That is a good exercise in terms of public awareness because it alerts people to the fact that the Garda is monitoring and checking, all of which is in the interests of road safety.  I would encourage further use of that because it is working, and I commend the Garda for engaging in that platform.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041600006#G00700"><p>I have a question that is somewhat related.  In the context of the questions raised by Deputy Coffey about the equipment, he is probably referring to the same television programme I had intended to mention in which former employees alleged that procedures were not complied with.  The assistant commissioner will be familiar with that.  I am curious to know about the technical aspects in the context of the GoSafe operation and how they impact on potential prosecutions.</p><p>  GoSafe is not the only speed detection system in operation.  The Garda operates its own speed detection systems, and I have always been curious about how that works.  There is an eight mile stretch of road where I live in County Leitrim between Drumshanbo and Carrick-on-Shannon on which GoSafe vans operate on a regular basis.  Sadly, they are located where fatalities occurred; I assume that is the reason they are in those locations.  It is probably one of the safest roads in the country at this stage because not only are the GoSafe vans in operation on it but the local garda&iacute; operate unmarked speed detection vans also.  That leads me to the query Deputy Coffey raised.  There is a public perception that there is an element of sneaky entrapment going on in that these vans and cars are unmarked.  I do not wish to detract in any way from the serious nature of what the garda&iacute; are doing because it is all about saving lives, but is there a revenue generating element to that?  Are there brownie points for garda&iacute; who detect speeders, separate from the GoSafe operation?  It is probably an urban myth but it might be useful to clarify that it is about speed detection and not gathering revenue for the sake of it.  There is an old saying about pork in a barrel, and there have been a number of incidents of that around the country.  The most famous example is the Stillorgan bypass on which I was caught driving over the speed limit on one occasion on my way to attend a vote in this House, only to discover when I got here that a vote had not been called; I was caught on the double in that regard.  Those are the generalities of the questions.</p></speech>

One will hear various stories about what did or did not happen in certain cases.  The revenue does not come to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We get no revenue from the enforcement of the Road Traffic Act; it goes to the central Exchequer.  That is one myth we would like to lay to rest.  We have put all the speed enforcement zones on the website.</p> <p>We have also put notices at the start of every zone.  The simple message we gave from the minute this project started was, &ldquo;Please, slow down&rdquo;.  If one does not slow down in these areas, one is putting oneself and other road users at a greater risk of being killed or seriously injured.  There is no more that we can do.</p><p> Unfortunately, while our compliance rates have improved and increased and the majority of road users comply with the Road Traffic Act, there are a number of people who do not.  That is where the enforcement end comes in.  I do not want to put anyone&rsquo;s life at risk in these particular areas or anywhere on the road network.  We want every driver to be responsible.  The rules of the road are there for a specific reason - that we can all use the roads safely.  Unfortunately, I have had the bitter experience of having to deal with families whose lives have been devastated by road traffic fatalities.  It is cold comfort to them when they hear a driver say he was only a small bit over the limit.</p><p> Up to 30% of road fatalities were happening in these 700 zones.  We in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have to enforce the Road Traffic Act for people that will not heed the road safety messages.  We advertise the zones on the website and they are constantly referred to in a variety of ways.  We must protect the public.  Unfortunately, for that 5% who do not listen, we have to move into the enforcement area.</p><p> I thank the Deputy for his comments on our use of social media.  We have 70,000 Twitter followers, the second largest number in the public service.  It gets the message out, telling people where we are so we can improve compliance.  It is not about enforcement but compliance because compliance equals safety.</p><p> In every area there is a local JPC, joint policing committee, where people and local representatives can raise any local issues of concern about road safety.  There are many examples where roads have been re-engineered as a consequence of safety issues raised locally, either informally with a local superintendent or through the more formal structures of the JPCs.  We welcome such public engagement as we do not have all the answers and do not get it right all the time.  Those who use a road day in, day out very often have a greater insight of safety issues with it.</p><p> There were several issues raised on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which we are pursuing.  All the equipment used is calibrated and is to the highest ISO standard.  This information is provided to the court to support cases.  All cases dismissed in court are a concern to us.  We examine the issues raised in each individual case to see if it involves the detection process or the legislation and address them if we need to.  Legislation changes due to issues raised.  We are aware of the issues raised in Kilrush and have taken steps to address them but will continue to monitor it.</p></speech>

The equipment is approved to international standards and is calibrated.  We have full access to all equipment registers and repair logs to ensure it remains within proper calibration and certification standards.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na oversees this all the time to have full confidence that the equipment is maintained to the highest standard.  In every court case, the operator is in a position to produce the certification from those who check the equipment.  There have been no issues with court cases.</p></speech>

The allegations made by the former employees were that they brought this to the attention of their superiors but were dismissed out of hand.  In turn, this had an impact on subsequent prosecutions.  That was the core message of these allegations.  This raises serious issues which could be impacting on drivers who perhaps were not over the speed limit.  I do not know anything about the technical aspects which is why I asked how it can impact on subsequent prosecutions.  What is of concern is the serious allegation that alleged serious deficiencies were brought to the attention of the employer by some employees but were ignored.</p></speech>

We are examining the case.  On the day, there was a record of the operator raising an issue about the equipment.  Unfortunately, that was not passed on to the validation process or to GoSafe management.  They missed it.  Part of our quality assurance is that operators are encouraged at all times to raise issues on a no-blame basis.  I went around the country speaking to operators when they took up employment because many of them were new to the courts process.  One point I made to them was that they were to immediately put their hands up if they had not set up equipment properly.  This was on a no-blame basis which I told the company so as to ensure it would not take action against them.  I had every confidence that would happen.</p><p>  As a result of that sort of input, the particular operator on the programme had been spoken to by another inspector.  While I was not at that session, the operator got the same message.  When he realised that a court case coming up was related to a session he had already raised with management, he went back to highlight it.  That quality assurance worked.  GoSafe management immediately brought it to my attention and we took action at the time.  It was certainly not buried by anybody.  It was accepted by GoSafe management that it was not acted upon correctly when it was identified on day one.  Once it was raised again, the management did not drop the ball the second time.</p></speech>

I always felt the Garda should have been running the GoSafe programme and it should never have been farmed out to a private company.  Resources should have been put in place for the Garda to do it.  The profits made indicate that.  There would also have been fewer problems dealing with the courts.</p><p>  It was said that some of the GoSafe zones have been fixed by road improvement works and so forth.  Are figures for accidents going up or down in these locations?  It is important we monitor those problem zones as thoroughly as we can.</p> <p>We pay the likes of GoSafe based on enforcement and survey hours.  Have we ever considered paying on the basis of convictions?  Does the Garda monitor the qualifications of the GoSafe staff and whether they have full knowledge of the rules of the road and all the issues that arise?</p><p> I was going to talk about the alignment of the cameras.  According to the reports, they were badly aligned and this could make a difference of plus or minus 5 km/h.  If the alignment of the cameras is that critical and there is a standard procedure of how the vehicles are set up, could the witnesses tell us what has been done to address it and if the GoSafe staff are rectifying it?  Since the witnesses said new cameras are being introduced, particularly with multi-vehicles, there must be a problem to be addressed in clearly identifying vehicles in areas where there is traffic build up and cars are coming alongside each other.</p><p> At one stage there were 1,200 members of the traffic corps and now there are 800.  This weekend there will be a special operation in place and I welcome that.  The Garda sergeants and inspectors have asked the witnesses and the Garda Commissioner to examine this.  In 2011 and 2012 there were significant reductions of over 40% in the number of casualties.  In 2013, suddenly 28 more people were killed than in 2012 and there has also been an increase this year.  Is there any relationship there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-16a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041600008#J00200"><p>I welcome the assistant commissioner, Mr. Twomey, and his colleagues.  I am a former postmaster, and the much-maligned postal service is getting a hammering here today.  That is totally unfair and the evidence or court cases may improve that situation.  There may be a need to examine that because it is more than just a myth or a perception.  There is a problem when one can legitimately claim as a defence that one did not receive a notice in the post.  One is then at the mercy of the courts.  This committee has the task of examining road safety and perception is a very important issue.  We are here because of media reports.  There is an inaccurate perception that there are ways of getting away with speeding.  We must nail that.  The Garda has a role in improving the processes all along the way to ensure that perception is nailed.</p><p>  I have read the appendix.  Could the witnesses flesh out where OSCAM fits into the bureau?  At what stage or level does OSCAM report to the assistant commissioner's office?  What influential members are part of OSCAM to ensure there are clear communications between the processes and what is happening within the assistant commissioner's office with a direct responsibility for road safety?</p><p>  Previous speakers touched on the "Prime Time" programme on the set-up or calibration of the equipment.  I have examined some of the processes they carry out across the water.  The West Midlands Police service routinely publishes on its website in PDF format the calibration certificates of each piece of speed detection equipment, whether it is GATSO, red light, Truvelo, mobile or ProLaser.  While I do not know what those are, I presume the witnesses are familiar with that equipment.  An industry of dedicated speeding ticket solicitors has built up in the UK.  They use every avenue they can to try to get people off, often on technical grounds.  It might be a reasonable approach to publish the technical calibration certificates on the Garda website.  The use of the website and social media regarding the speed zones is very beneficial and positive.  The light-hearted social media engages people, they are interested and it is very positive.</p><p>  Do the witnesses have figures on any reductions or changes in accidents, fatalities or behaviour in high-accident areas?  Are those zones monitored?  Would they consider publishing any figures on changes in attitude where there is continuous monitoring or speed vans in those areas?  The witnesses' report stated there were no figures on the cases that were struck out in court.  Could the witnesses establish some liaison between their office and the court registrars to get some handle on the number of traffic offences struck out and the reasons?  Since the court registrars are civil servants, not part of the Judiciary, there would be no question of infringing on the separation of powers.  Over recent months we have had a public debate on people dying because they believed they could get away with speeding.  There must be some way of approaching the court registrar service to establish the truth and the myth, and how best it can be addressed.</p><p>  When one has 12 points on one's licence, is disqualification mandatory?  In the UK it is discretionary and in 2012, just under one third of those who had 12 points were not disqualified after giving mitigating circumstances, and we know where that can lead.  Could the witnesses clarify that a person who reaches 12 points is automatically disqualified?</p></speech>

Everything is straightforward and that is appreciated.  The GoSafe contract was awarded nearly five years ago and it was a very competitive tendering process.</p> <p>The successful consortium was an international group with French and Australian involvement but the operation is centred in Listowel, County Kerry, where I come from and, therefore, I am familiar with it.  The Listowel people who are involved have a long history of successful involvement in a number of businesses related to photo processing and they are regarded as highly competent and professional and men of probity.  I was reassured by Superintendent O'Donohue's response to the television programme.  I saw the programme and felt it was very much over the top and made a mountain out of a molehill.</p><p> Judge Durcan more or less condemned the GoSafe operation.  Is the function of GoSafe staff to detect and report speeding offences and present themselves in court when a prosecution is made with the process of prosecuting remaining a matter entirely for the Garda ensuring total separation?  The judge did not seem to appreciate that.  I stand corrected if I am wrong but if it is true, the judge did not seem to know that and I am surprised.  Has he been contacted by the Garda to point out the reality to him?  I do not know if that is how everything operated at that level but perhaps there should be communication with him because he was in error.</p><p> I refer to another issue that has bothered me from some time.  I drove home to Kerry on Good Friday last year and as I drove along the two-lane carriageway at Islandbridge while leaving Dublin, a major Garda operation was under way involving up to a dozen or more Garda vehicles and two dozen garda&iacute;.  They were pulling motorists in to breathalyse them.  I found it to be a dangerous practice.  I was lucky not to be in an accident because drivers were crossing lanes and so on.  The operation was over the top.  Is that normal practice?  If so, should this be examined?  I thank the assistant commissioner for his attendance.</p></speech>

We have what we call super MAT checkpoints where we take a main road and they would be more overt than what we normally do.  We do not do them terribly often.  We did one on the M50 before Christmas.  We are very conscious of the health and safety aspect of such checkpoints.  I am concerned by the points raised by the Senator and I will take them back and discuss them with the people involved.</p><p>  He is right that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the prosecutor and the GoSafe people perform as witnesses.  Any issues with the prosecution are a matter for the Garda.  We have spoken with the court and on the next date the inspector in charge of the fixed penalty office will be available to the court to answer any issues that are addressed in respect any of the procedures that are followed.  We have, therefore, tried to address those specific issues.</p><p>  I will jump then to the first question Deputy Ellis asked.  These are contractors working for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are doing the job but we have contracted out a little of it.  Our contractor provides 7,500 hours of enforcement to us every month.  It is a good fit.  They can do the off-road stuff; we do all the on-road, highly visible, overt enforcement.   When we come back to the statistics, we had a reduction in these 727 zones of 23 road fatalities last year.  That is a simple fact.  As a consequence of the increase in compliance, there has been a reduction of 40% in road fatalities across these zones.  There are issues around the edges regarding processes and the courts and we need to be careful and clearly oversee them but the facts speak for themselves.  We are about reducing road deaths and how to achieve that.</p><p>  The 12 penalty points is mandatory.  There is no option around it.  It is an administrative, court process.  Once a driver reaches 12 points, he or she loses his or her licence.  The zones are constantly updated and we constantly review, check and examine the collision data to see if another area in the road network pops up.  We have made public even here today the results of the past few years.  Speed compliance has increased by 40% in these areas and road fatalities have reduced by 40.  They are the results.</p><p>  We will take away the issue of making the details of the equipment public and give it serious consideration.  There is no doubt that road traffic legislation is among the most hotly debated.  It is something we constantly monitor.  We also monitor court cases on a daily basis, irrespective of whether the Garda is involved.  The Garda is responsible for all these prosecutions and, therefore, we monitor what develops in a court case closely and where are there are issues of concern, we look at how we can improve the process.  If we need to do so, we will.  We have done that on many occasions.  If there is a more fundamental difficulty, we  have to come back to a forum such as this where we need legislative amendment.  The 2010 Act, which was mentioned, will address the issues relating to postal service.  That will make it a little tighter for people in that the certificate of postage will now be accepted by the court if the notice has not been delivered.  The legislation constantly evolves.  The third payment option was discussed earlier, which means people can pay the fine within a certain timeframe rather than go to court.</p><p>  OSCAM was set up when this project started and Superintendent O'Donohue is directly in charge of it.  He reports directly to me and Chief Superintendent O'Sullivan and, therefore, there is a direct line of communication.  We have meetings on a daily basis and address any issues that arise with the equipment.  It is closely monitored and audited and a number of changes have been introduced in the processes as the contract has evolved.  It is the first time in the world that such a contract has been introduced where enforcement has been subcontracted directly by the enforcement agency.  The results are positive.</p><p>  The reduction in the traffic corps is a topical issue.  As everyone in this room is well aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and every other State body has reduced budgets and reduced staffing.  That has necessitated us trying to streamline and look at different ways of operating.  That is the space we operate in and that is the challenge we face.  While we have 800 people in the traffic corps, the force still has 13,000 members.  Every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts and ensuring compliance when they are on duty.  It is still quite a number of people.  We have worked with other agencies to improve our processes and to make it easier for us to operate on the roads.  Certain efficiencies have been gained.  During the first quarter in 2014 there was an increase in enforcement compared to the same period last year in all areas of road traffic - speeding, mobile phone use, drink driving and seat belts.  Resources are a constant challenge and we constantly review them.  Hopefully, there will be recruitment later this year which will provide greater opportunities for us.  We will monitor resources closely.</p><p>  Issues that are raised in the courts come directly to us.  We deal with and take appropriate action.</p></speech>

Is this in force or how will it be implemented?  Will it have an impact?  Technology is improving in every area.  Might other improvements help the Garda detect speeding?</p><p>  In recent weeks in my constituency cases have been highlighted whereby the cars of people stopped because their tax is out of date are confiscated on the spot.  According to a radio programme I heard, people have had to walk home.  Has there been a change of policy in this regard?  It is not within the remit of today's discussion topic so the witnesses may have to follow up with information.  It is an area of concern as in one case the road was unlit.  I would have thought a person whose tax was out of date would be fined and would have to appear in court.  Perhaps the policy has changed.</p></speech>

It is governed by legislation.  I am not familiar with the particular case mentioned by the Chairman.  Our clear advice to all our people in such a case is they must be balanced, reasonable and proportionate.  This is the policy in all enforcement.  I am not aware of the specific case raised by the Chairman.  We will take away what he stated and examine it.</p><p>  Equipment changes all the time and is getting more up to date.  We constantly watch improvements in equipment and we deal with the Department in this regard.  Average speed limits from one point to another will be tested but this is not in force yet.  Proposals have been made to examine the Dublin Port tunnel, whereby if one enters it at a particular time and exits it after a certain time one must have exceeded the speed limit.  This method is used on the Continent.  It deals with point to point journeys and is all about exits.  We will examine it in time with regard to the Dublin Port tunnel.</p></speech>

It is an indication of the changing behaviour of road users and the updating and upgrading of mobile phones and technology.  It is no coincidence the greatest increase in enforcement is with regard to the use of mobile phones on roads.  It is a problem and a challenge.  The new legislation is welcomed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Is there any way fixed cameras can be used on the 727 routes in question or is it the case that fluency does not allow this as we could have a change in circumstances?  Would it be more cost-effective to use fixed cameras on many of these routes with enough scope to upgrade if necessary?</p><p>  I did not receive an answer to my question on multiple vehicles.  Obviously there is a problem with the GoSafe cameras dealing with multiple vehicles in an image with regard to angles or focus.  Has this led to problems with convictions with regard to cars overtaking?</p></speech>

The ability to change location gives us greater scope and coverage throughout the country.  We had fixed cameras and there was a noticeable difference in the speed of cars before and after fixed cameras.  Everybody knew where they were.  People drove at a certain speed approaching the camera and after they passed them they moved on.</p></speech>

The maximum length of time a camera will be in any location is three hours.  It is considered more efficient and effective to have this greater mobility in the network.  The results of the initiative to date probably support this argument.</p></speech>

There are limitations to any piece of technology.  With the particular camera and radar system used at present in some cases one cannot proceed with prosecution because of where a second vehicle is in the image.  We look at the data behind capturing the image, with regard to what the radar detected, to identify an offending vehicle but it is not always clear.  The new technology makes it easier to identify the offending vehicle if two vehicles are in the image.  We check all of the images and the data behind them.  Radar constantly sends out a signal and receives results which are plotted in a graph we can examine.  When we do so we decide whether an image can be let through.  This limitation at present does not cause a problem with convictions because we do not let the images concerned through the process.  The dual grader will allow more images to come through the validation process and more fixed charge notices will be issued.  If two cars are side by side in an image we will have a better chance of identifying an offending vehicle with the new technology.  This is slightly more difficult to do at present.  Anything which goes through the system is perfectly validated and the new technology will allow us validate more images and approve more fixed charge notices.</p></speech>
