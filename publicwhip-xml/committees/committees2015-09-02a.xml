I appear before this committee on a purely voluntary basis.  I will, of course, co-operate fully with the inquiry in so far as it is legally possible for me to do so given the issues that have been the subject of correspondence between my solicitors and the committee.  I've already submitted a detailed witness statement which addresses the lines of inquiry as requested by the committee.  This opening statement deals with the issues set out in that written statement.  I prepared that statement on the basis of my recollection and the limited documentation available to me.  My statements were prepared without access to information and documentation from the society which has not been available to me since my retirement in April 2009.  I will confine my opening statement to a summary of some of the evidence given in my statement, together with some relevant comments.</p> <p>  The society's motivation for entering the commercial property market was the shortage of housing in Ireland in the early '90s following the extended downturn in that market in the '80s.  The explanatory memorandum issued with the Building Societies Act 1989 encouraged building societies to get involved in residential development and provided specifically that building societies should be a "major source of funding for housing by investing directly in residential development".  Following the entry of Bank of Scotland and the other foreign-owned banks into the market in 1999 it became increasingly difficult for the society to compete in the residential loans market.  Their entry resulted in a period of intense competition, with all major lenders taking steps to protect and increase their market share, sometimes irrespective of price considerations.  In addition, the brokers who controlled up to 50% of the market were predominantly aligned to the larger financial institutions.</p> <p>  It was decided by the society for good commercial reasons that it would off ... not offer 100% home loans as a matter of policy.  Such loans were only provided by the society in exceptional circumstances.  For the same commercial reasons, the society also refused to introduce tracker mortgages.  We did not engage in self-certification of income mortgages or expand into the sub-prime lending market, and for some time resisted the term extension of loans to 30 and 35 years.  The society also refused to lend at margins of 1%, which at that time was a prevalent practice in the market.  In this prevailing climate, it was difficult for the society to grow its residential loan book.  I would note that our fellow building society, the EBS, had 90% of its loan book in residential lending and it was not saved from the effects of the economic collapse as house prices fell nationally by up to 60% following the crash.</p> <p>  In 1995 the society came to the conclusion that building societies as stand-alone institutions had no long-term future and that the best option for the society was to seek a change in section 102 of the Building Societies Act 1989 which would enable it to effect a trade sale, thus realising the full value of the society for the shareholders.  The enabling legislation was finally passed in August 2006 after ten years of unnecessary and inexplicable delay.  The desired sale did not materialise for reasons detailed in my opening ... in my statement.  Once it became apparent that we would not effect a trade sale of the society in the short term, I reviewed the society's position in the market and decided to downsize its balance sheet, reducing its commercial loan book, and from September 2007 I began taking appropriate steps to do so.  I'd every expectation that this would achieve a significant reduction in the society's exposure based on the premise that in excess of &euro;5 billion of the loan book was due to mature in 2008.  At this time the society accepted the market consensus that in the event of a downturn in the property market, a soft landing scenario would apply.</p><p>Under this scenario, it was anticipated that a fall in real property values of around 20% would occur over an extended period.  The society would have, at this time, welcomed such a development on the basis that it was in the interests of a more stable market.  We were influenced in our views by the forecasts and commentaries arising from successive reports by the Central Bank, the IMF, the OECD, the EU, the ECB, the Department of Finance, the EIB, the World Bank, the ESRI and the NESC.  In addition, all the economists in the banks, stockbrokers and academia were of the same view.  Indeed, this consensus view appears to have been prevalent in every one of the 69 countries affected by the crash.  In addition, prior to the general election of May 2007, all major political parties were seeking to increase spending, and indeed some campaigned on the basis of a proposed reduction in taxation.  It was clear that parties on all sides of the House expected that the revenues from the property market would continue to accrue to the Exchequer.</p><p> The financial crisis which preceded the property crash originated in the US on the back of the sub-prime debacle which caused the banking crisis in which the rating agencies played a major role.  A range of powerful institutions which went bust or had to be rescued or nationalised, such as Washington Mutual, AIG, Merrill Lynch, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and, in April 2008, Bear Stearns.  On 26 September 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman's caused the collapse of the liquidity market in Europe and in the United States.  As David Doyle, former secretary of Finance, said in his evidence, and I quote: "Lehman was the killer".  If Lehman's and, to a lesser extent, Bear Stearns had not been allowed to fail in 2008, then things may have been different and the ultimate extent of the crash may have been somewhat moderated.</p><p> I reiterate, for the reasons outlined in my statement to the committee, that the society was not insolvent on the night of the guarantee.  No individual financial institution could have prevented the property bubble in Ireland.  The only entities that could have acted to prevent the property bubble were the regulator, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance or the Government.  The ECB, who had the powers to compel the Central Bank to take any necessary action - sorry, the ECB also had the powers to compel the Central Bank to take any necessary action.  However, none of them chose to do so.</p><p> The losses from property lending incurred by the banking sector in Ireland were not just confined to Irish institutions.  The foreign-owned banks, namely, Ulster Bank, Bank of Scotland Ireland Limited, ACC, Danske Bank and KBC, all incurred significant losses estimated to be collectively in the region of &euro;40 billion.  The Building Societies Act 1989 states that it shall be the duty of the auditors to carry out such investigations as will enable them to form an opinion on whether the society has kept proper accounting records and maintained satisfactory systems of control of its business and records and systems of inspection.  Where the auditors are of the opinion that the society has failed to keep proper accounting records or systems of control, they shall state so in their report.  The committee should note that since their appointment as auditors of the society, KPMG, in each and every year have expressed satisfaction that the financial statements of the society correctly showed the financial position of the society and that proper books of accounts and records have been kept and that the directors had established and maintained reliable systems of control and, accordingly, issued full audit reports - full unqualified audit reports.</p><p> I do not accept that the NAMA valuations provided an accurate assessment of the value of the society loans.  The extent of the losses attributable to the society on the back of the NAMA valuations of the society's commercial book is an issue which is in dispute.  It is, in my view, that NAMA exceptionally discounted the society's loans in the absence of any, or with little credible, challenge to their valuations.</p><p> On 23 May 2012, in its address to the chartered certified accountants in Galway, Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of NAMA, said that having completed the due diligence of the property portfolio and having assessed the property portfolio in more detail, NAMA's view was that the assets had more potential than they initially had reason to expect.  He went on to say, "A high proportion of the property assets in Ireland ... are located in or close to counties with large urban centres of population (Dublin and neighbouring counties, Cork, Limerick and Galway) and the long-term prospects for much of this property will be better after the economic situation stabilises."  It is a matter of record and fact that the society's Irish commercial properties, including development lands, were located in precisely those locations - in Dublin, Wicklow, Meath, Kildare, Cork and Limerick.  A reference to that is KPMG due diligence report, June 2007.</p><p> In the United Kingdom, where the society had the majority of its commercial loan book, with 60% of its lending to the London market, I have identified profits that have accrued or will accrue to NAMA in the region of &euro;1 billion from sales relating to a relatively small number of borrowers.  I am awaiting the receipt of further information and documentation in relation to many other borrowers to enable me to conduct a similar evaluation.  I outline now examples relating to three properties to illustrate my point: property A - NAMA valuation &pound;18 million, realised &pound;200 million, excess &pound;182 million; property B - valuation ... NAMA valuation &pound;12 million, realised &pound;100 million, excess &pound;88 million; and property C - NAMA valuation &pound;165 million, realised &pound;250 million, excess, &pound;85 million.  The total accumulated profit in relation to those three properties amounted to &pound;355 million, equivalent to &euro;443 million.  It must also be noted that at the time when NAMA was calculating the discounts, UK property prices were already on the rise again, particularly in the London area.  The London property market has clearly performed strongly since this time.</p><p> I believe the society was a victim of the financial crisis which originated in the sub-prime market in the US, precipitated by the bankruptcy of Lehman's.  However, I accept that the society was a contributor to the resulting property crash that followed by being unable to sufficiently reduce its exposure to the commercially property market, despite having realistic expectations to do so, while the decision of the society to downsize its commercial loan book in September 2007 and despite having diversified geographically its market exposure.</p><p> The financial crisis which occurred was in the ... was an event, the occurrence, size and magnitude of which was unforeseen by even the most astute observers of financial markets.  As a result, the collateral damage caused by the collapse was immense for everybody concerned.  Almost all commentators, as already said, accept that the financial collapse was not foreseen and could not have been reasonably foreseen.  In my 30 years ... 38 years with the society, I had, prior to the economic collapse, gone through three recessions and downturns in the property market.  I did not expect the predicted slowdown to be any worse than any of those previous recessions and none of the other market participants did either.  Having built up the society in a competitive, innovative and cost-efficient manner over the years from a business with &euro;20,000 profit and five employees with one branch office to almost &euro;400 million profit and 455 employees with 50 full branch offices, it was an absolute shock and bitter disappointment to me that the society succumbed to such a cataclysmic financial crisis, a one-in-100-year event which caused such huge damage to every element of the nation, both corporate and personal.  I regret very much ... I have and I am continuing to pay the price, personally, as a result.</p><p>In particular, I regret it for the society's employees, shareholders and borrowers, who all became casualties of the crisis, and I regret it for the taxpayer and the State, who had to fund the deficit.</p><p> Thank you, Chairman.  I am happy now to take your questions.</p></speech>

In your contribution you mentioned, for example, contributors or those who could stop the property bubble.

In your view, where does Irish Nationwide and your role as the chief of Irish Nationwide, INBS, for the last 38 years ... where do you stand in relation to the fact that you regret that other people had to pick up the tab for the bank that you were in charge of that went bust?</p></speech>

And in that year, I changed the name of the society, of course, to Irish Nationwide.  We were called the Irish Industrial Benefit Building Society.  I changed the name to Irish Nationwide and I was instrumental in the appointment of KPMG as auditors to the society.  Over the years, up to 1992, the society ... I built up that society, as CEO, with the full co-operation of our board and I always insisted that the board would be fully involved in the lending process, which was unique - and is unique - among financial institutions.  And during the '80s, we expanded, slowly and conservatively, the development of the society, particularly in the home loans market.  But in addition, we also did small ticket commercial loans for shops and individual offices, for farms and even for small developments and building construction.  I think we have ... we had about 10% of our book in that area of the market.  And in 1992, following the change in legislation, we took advantage, if you like, of the encouragement, as I've explained earlier, of the legislation which enabled the societies to engage in development and construction of housing.  And we were encouraged, as I said, to do it and I quote, "[that] building societies should be a major source of funding for housing ... by investing directly in residential development".  That was the purpose of the Act and the genesis of the Act in relation to that area.  So, we decided at that time to get involved and we acquired, I think, 70 acres of land in Lucan.</p></speech>

I think that's borne out in the due diligence report by KPMG in 19 .... in 2007.  And we had matched our wholesale funding, which was between three and five years, to the maturity of those loans.  Funny enough ... and that was a comfort to us at the time and it was a big plus.  So, therefore, if we had got another year of normal lending or normal markets compared to 2007, Senator, there was the maturity of &euro;5 billion ... there was a book of &euro;5 billion of our loans due to mature in that year, 2008.  Therefore, we would have reduced I'd say by, realistically, maybe &euro;3 billion.  So, we'd have our book down from &euro;8.5 billion down to &euro;5 billion.</p></speech>

Mr. Fingleton, you were in charge of Irish Nationwide Building Society for 38 years.  During that period, the bank made a series of business decisions that led to it eventually going bust and to be bailed out by billions of euro of taxpayer's money.  In the annual accounts of Irish Nationwide Building Society, it was reported that a pension fund of &euro;27.6 million had been set up and subsequent newspaper reports revealed that that separate pension fund that was set up at that time was for your exclusive benefit.  Can you explain to the committee why a pension fund of &euro;27.6 million was set up in the year 2007?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-02a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Fingleton" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090200002#H01100"><p>I'll try, Deputy.  In the early '90s, I think it was '91 or '92, I looked at my pension fund and the value that accrued on that fund.  It was managed by an outside insurance company - an outside fund - and I discovered that if I had invested all the contributions in the lowest deposit account or the lowest paying deposit account operated by the society at that time, that would have produced more than what was produced by the insurance company in the fund.  So I agreed with the society at that time that I would manage my own fund and I would invest the contributions that were provided by the society in that fund.  So I made the decisions from that time on what to invest in and the fund was, of course, administered by the trustees of that particular fund.  So that's the genesis of where it started and originated.  And over the years the fund built up to almost &euro;30 million based on my decisions on what to invest in.</p><p>And when the fund matured and when the retirement came, as I said, there was &euro;30 million in it, &euro;30 million in it.  Now the net cost of that, Deputy, to the society - booked it in a public document that doesn't appear to have got great circulation - was in my view almost nearer to &euro;3 million than what the experts said was nearer to &euro;4 million.  So in that period, I increased that fund by almost ten times, tenfold.  So you can appreciate, because pensions and the pension pots and funds are very much discussed within your environment, and you can appreciate what &euro;3 million, what sort of a fund &euro;3 million would buy you today, or even &euro;4 million would buy you today.  So the cost to the society was &euro;3 million, or if you believe the ... some of the experts who have examined the account, and I will come to that in a minute, nearer &euro;4 million.</p></speech>

There was no target-related bonuses paid in Irish Nationwide, except to the branch managers to incentivise them to get more home loans or attract more home loans for the society because that's where we were weakest for reasons I have outlined in my statement, that we didn't do tracker mortgages or we didn't do 100 per cents or we didn't do self-certification.

This was a source of concern for the regulator, that the society did not have the appropriate skill sets or controls in place to effectively manage this exposure.  On page 47 of the core booklet that you have in Vol. 1, we see that by September 2008, 80% of INBS's loan book was in commercial property and 81% in land and development exposure was in speculative property activities.

So ... okay, I'll leave it at that.</p><p>Can I ask you, in the letter from INBS, and again this is in core booklet, Vol. 3, page 41?  This is a letter from INBS to the Financial Regulator's office in April 2008 and it's in response to the Regulator's query of February 2008 - its report on commercial property lending.  The letter from INBS states:</p><blockquote>Mr. Fingleton is closely involved with the U.K. and Ireland commercial lending managers in assessing large commercial loan applications and in ongoing reviews and discussions with large borrowers.  The Chief Executive is ultimately responsible for all lending and it is essential that he is involved in all material loans being approved by the Society.</blockquote> <p>That's coming from your own institution to the Financial Regulator.  So, is it reasonable, or not, to say that with regard to commercial loan applications, that you were ultimately responsible for the lending?</p></speech>

So, I would have to familiarise myself very thoroughly with all the loans that were being proposed, all the loans that were there for approval and all the loans that ultimately went on to the society's loan book.</p></speech>

Mr. Fingleton, in the core booklet - again Vol. 1, page 71 to 73 - this is a review by Deloitte in the second quarter of 2008 into your bank, Irish Nationwide, commercial and residential lending.  It had the following to say with regard to critical issues.  On page 71 of these documents it quotes:</p><blockquote>No Credit Committee approval was present on a number of reviewed files, mostly relating to loans originating in Belfast. <br /><br />In many cases the Commercial Loan Application was approved by only one member of the Credit Committee, while at least two members are required under the terms of reference to approve these loans.</blockquote><p>It goes on then to say in page 73:</p><blockquote>Until December 2007, board approval was required for all loans in excess of &euro;1 million.  In a number of incidences, no board approval could be located in either the loan file or the board minutes for loans which, according to the lending policy in operation at the time, would have required board approval.</blockquote><p>You have told this committee that at all times - and you're very proud of it - that the board was involved in all of these decisions; that you didn't, despite what the Financial Regulator says, have ultimate responsibility in terms of these decisions, or the authority lay with you.  How come is it that Deloitte is pointing out, again and again, that the board didn't approve these ... that the credit committee didn't approve some of these loans?</p></speech>

INBS's overarching driver was demutualisation and sale and this is talked about in the Nyberg report.  In your opinion, did the desire on the part of management, and on your part also as part of that management, to maximise the value of INBS result in the adoption of poor lending practice and an increased level of risk in the loan portfolio?</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Fingleton.  In relation to the loans acquired to the society by NAMA - you made reference to them earlier - the discount overall was 61% and you spoke about where you feel the discounts were too high.  Now, they were the highest discounts of any of the financial institutions and, Chairman, I am referring here to Vol. 1, page 125.  Can you explain how you got into a situation where you became partners with developers in terms of profit-sharing, where you gave 100% loans to developers, you took up to 50% of the profit on the development, you charged them a rate of interest?  And were they non-recourse loans?  So can you give a background in that area?</p></speech>

Chairman, yes, I refer back to 1992.  We were coming out of the recession of the '80s, where there was little or no increase in the real value of house prices, there was little or no construction going on.  I think there was about 15,000 or 20,000 houses being built annually - and we had, of course, the 1989 Act just passed and, as I said to the Deputy ... that building societies ... it encourages us, it stated that, "Building societies should be a major source of funding for housing by investing directly in residential-----"</p></speech>

There was absolutely no commercial reason for that change in legislation not to have been implemented at that time.

But because of the fact that we were being sold, the individuals concerned felt that this was a short-term thing and they weren't interested in taking up the position.  And we were looking for a particular calibre at the time of ... at a very high level.  Some of them weren't interested because of the imminent sale of the society and others weren't because they were just too busy in their own businesses.  That is fact, and also the chairman, I think, asked a former director general of the Central Bank to become a director and that did not materialise either.</p></speech>

I will explain to you the background.  I was authorised <i>ex officio</i>to attend all credit committee meetings.  But I excused myself permanently from 2002 to the time the committee was set up to 1 December 2007 when the board decided to allocate the credit committee with the full powers to approve loans.  And I did that, Senator, to ensure there was no conflicts of interest and that I would not have undue influence on the credit committee and that it would remain fully independent.</p></speech>

Good morning, Mr. Fingleton.  Firstly, can I ask you in relation to the Irish Nationwide annual report from 2007?  It shows that in the period 2002 to 2007, profit before tax increased by 303% and total assets by 190%.  It is document B02, IBRC00678-002.  I don't think you are allowed to show.

This was at a time where you said in your opening statement that there was increased competition in the Irish lending market.  Do you think ... the question really is: do you think that level of increase was sustainable in the context of that increasing level of competition in the Irish market at that period of time?</p></speech>

That would be the criteria there.</p></speech>

And also, as I said before, we were turning over our book every three years.  So it was within that context, Senator, sorry, Deputy, that we were engaged in our lending programme.</p></speech>

It cited a report compiled by KPMG into Irish Nationwide where it said that 15% of all residential mortgages issued in 2006, which amounted to &euro;111 million, were to just 39 clients who borrowed on average &euro;2.8 million each for the 39 of them.  How was that situation allowed to happen?  Was that not an over-concentration of the risk from the point of view of the building society?</p></speech>

And while we might have a fairly large exposure to a single borrower, there'd be a number of stratification of loans within that exposure, which you already referred to, in the average loan.

No, Senator.  UK loans would be introduced by the manager of the UK office almost exclusively.  I think we had one or two that were Irish.  The Irish loans from customers that were there since the '90s, I would have introduced them to the society, but they'd have started off as customers in the Irish market and became customers in the UK market.  I would say, if you look at the top 30, maybe five might have come through me.  I don't know, I'm just guessing now, but they'd be the Irish, they'd be the Irish ... some of the Irish borrowers.</p></speech>

I had defined powers given me by the board and approved by the regulator's office, and they were the normal powers to manage the society and promote the business and develop the business.  And, therefore, it would be my duty as CEO to be fully familiar with all the loans, not least as they moved through the process but also as a member of the board where the final decision was being made, so it wasn't unusual.  I was suffering from the perception that was out there that it was me and me alone, because I was seen as the face of the society that I came into in the '70s and '80s, and I did promote myself and the society through PR, because we couldn't afford to buy advertising space at the time.  So it evolved from that time because I was ... my picture was appearing in the paper day in, day out in relation to some sponsorship we were doing, or some statement I would make, or some conflict I would have with some of the banks or whatever, and that's how that evolved.</p></speech>

This question may have been somewhat covered already by some colleagues but during the period 2003-2006 with commercial lending being the driver for the reasons that you outlined earlier on, the society trebled its book from about &euro;3.5 billion to just under &euro;11 billion.

We tried ... we made all the effort to expand our home loan book and, as you may be aware and as I've already mentioned it in my statement, when Bank of Scotland came into the market in 1999, all things changed in that marked irrevocably.  They undercut everybody, competition intensified, our book was attacked and we, effectively, couldn't compete, because, principally, we did not ... we refused to adopt as a policy 100% loans, we refused to adopt as a policy tracker mortgages, we refused certification, we refused to lend at uneconomic rates such as 1%.  Nobody could lend risk ... or buy risk at that level.  And that is why we failed to grow our book in the analysis.  We were evaluating the risk compared to what the market was dictating.  And we weren't into market share; we hadn't the capacity.  And you also had the brokers who controlled 50% eventually of the market and they were aligned, almost totally, to the bigger institutions, and they all fought for their market share and we were left behind.</p></speech>

The reports states:</p><blockquote>the Society reviewed and revised its commercial and residential lending policies ... in December ['07].  Of particular note for commercial lending was the extension of the power of the Credit Committee from the approval of loan applications up to &euro;1 million ... to the approval of all commercial loan applications [post 2007.  As a result the] Board [was] no longer directly involved in the approval of loans; prior to ['07] the Board approved commercial loan applications in excess of &euro;1 million.</blockquote> <p>Can you explain why the board made this decision?</p></speech>

In ... from about September, October on, we were reducing our exposure to the property market and that would be reflected in the board decision.  So we weren't doing very much lending whatsoever except to the commitments we had and to protect the security of the assets we already had on our books.  So there was little or no business anticipated by the board at that time.  So that could explain why it was given solely then to the credit committee.</p></speech>

And it found a number of issues regarding the concentration of loans in the higher-risk development sector - or what the report calls the "speculative property investment" - namely: that 41% of total commercial lending was, in this sector, &euro;3.2 billion; that there was a concentration of loans in the higher loan-to-value bands; that 30% of commercial loans had loan-to-value of over 100%; and that there was a concentration in your customer base where 30 commercial customers accounted for 53% of total commercial loan book.  This was at the end of 2006.  Did your board ever consider or were they concerned that these levels of high concentration and the correlation between them posed a risk to the business model that the society was based on?</p></speech>

And they would have been reassured by the fact that since 1992 to the end of 2007, that there was little or no bad loans within that book.  And, furthermore, you've mentioned ... they would also be comforted by the fact that our book was being turned over by .... every three years, and it was relatively low risk in the sense that even their land development loans embraced just planning, mainly - getting the planning and then refinancing it with another institution to take on the big risk, which was the construction risk.</p></speech>

Mr. Fingleton, the chief executive of NAMA, Mr. McDonagh, said as a comment on the covered banks generally, including Irish Nationwide, &quot;the banks consider[ed] property lending to be almost a one-way bet, notwithstanding the well-established cyclical behaviour of property markets&quot;.  And the chairman of NAMA, Mr. Daly, on the same lines, said, &quot;the banks were taking the type of risk normally the preserve of private equity ... hedge fund providers without demanding the same level of rigorous analysis&quot;.  And if I can put to you then the ... in some detail what the Nyberg report, which I am sure you have read in detail, and I quote in relation to INBS, &quot;Loan contracts tended to include profit share agreements, with INBS receiving ... between 25% and 50% of the profit when [the] project was concluded successfully.&quot;  Nyberg continues:</p><blockquote>This business model was, in principle and in practice, risky because of the planning permission risks involved and because of the reliance on the refinancing of borrowers by other banks.  These risks were seen by INBS as significantly mitigated by accepting, as borrowers, only developers who had a long and successful history of doing such projects.</blockquote> <p>And my quote concludes: &quot;The model was in some ways closer to that of a venture capital financier than that of typical banks.&quot;</p><p>Now if you take those three observations, Mr. Fingleton, essentially amounting to a claim that INBS was more a venture capitalist organisation than a building society, and then if we add further observations about only 30 individuals or entities being responsible for 41% of your total loan book, and these individuals, as you said yourself, had a long relationship with, with you and the society ... I mean, would it be fair to say that it wasn't just a venture capitalist project but a crony capitalist one as well in the methods which you used?</p></speech>

That's a short answer.  And I would also disagree, Deputy, with the observations of Nyberg in the saying that lending on land development under the criteria employed by the society in relation to planning ... planning wasn't a risk at all.  Planning was well-defined in the UK and here.  You knew what planning you would get in relation to loans.  You knew, it was established by precedent and all the rest of it.  And that was the easy part.  The big risk was the construction, and we had disengaged from that almost totally, I think, in the early 2000s.  There was little or no risk in land development and that's proven by the fact that we would get our money back in six months or 12 months, whenever the planning came through.  We would get our money back and we would have a free run on the construction side financed with another institution, who were very ... I know the institutions involved and they were very anxious to take all the business from us, not just the construction lending.</p></speech>

On the internal audits, if I may discuss that with you ... in their 2005 report, KPMG stated:</p><blockquote>The existing internal audit function is not best practice. ... In particular it lacks the depth of experience necessary to challenge ... areas of key risk which includes Treasury and Commercial Lending.</blockquote> <p>And in their management letter in 2008, they stated: &quot;The Society's Internal Audit department needs to build up ... experience and training in order to perform reviews of key risks areas which are currently outsourced to a third party service provider.&quot;  I think they had concerns in 2004 and I think they had concerns in 1999.  So, how would you respond to those critiques?</p></speech>

And they did but they found a lot of positives.  They found, Deputy, that we'd a strong audit committee in place.  And the audit committee was extremely strong and dealt in detail on reports from the internal audit and, indeed, effectively supervised the internal auditor in his reports and in his activities.  And the credit committee was made up of all of the non-executive directors.  So they had a full, detailed knowledge of the business ... of the micro-business of the organisation.  They said we had strong mandate ... there was a strong mandate for internal audit; they said funding available to enhance the section was available; they said the internal audit used a risk-based methodology; they said an audit manual was in place; they said large exposures were reviewed regularly.  The new head of internal audit function was thought very highly of throughout the business and there was an expectation that improvements would occur, as advised by KPMG-----</p></speech>

I'm now going to wrap up with a couple of matters - just a tidy-up on it - and seek further clarification on some earlier questions, and then after which I'll invite the two lead questioners this morning, Mr. Fingleton - Deputy Doherty and Deputy O'Donnell - to conclude before we break.  Can I just get clarification on one point, Mr. Fingleton, and it's in regard to an earlier question by Senator O'Keeffe?  Can you clarify that the findings made by the Financial Regulator in November 2006, raised by Senator O'Keeffe, were rated?  How were they rated?  Were they medium priority by the regulator?  Were they?  What was the rating of them?</p></speech>

On the .... another matter ... it's just the ... following ... there'll be two documents coming up on the screen there relating to the credit committee's operational review.  The first one relates to December '08.  Following the delegation of authority of the credit committee in December 2007, internal audits carried out by two reviews of the operation of the credit committee: one in July 2008 covering the period of January to June 2008, and the other in January 2009 covering the period of July to December 2008.  The findings note that the frequency of meetings declined as the year went on, to the point where the ... in the internal audit's opinion, the credit committee is not meeting just ... is not meeting with enough frequency to fulfil its duties, and it's listed there as being of high risk.  It's given a rating of 2.4 that the credit committee may not be adhering to its terms of reference of meeting.</p> <p>  Then moving on to the January '09 report, it also notes that several other weaknesses, including one critical issue re the failure to present a facility for approval before drawdown, and that relates ... I think it's coming up on the screen there.  It says, when it comes - it's the fourth one down I think - the credit committee minutes may not be adequate and may not represent an accurate description of each meeting.  And the other one, once again the credit committee may not be adhering to its terms of reference and so forth.  Mr. Fingleton, can I ask you to explain why the credit committee was not functioning properly during this critical period in 2008?</p></speech>

The credit committee met when it was required to meet.  The volume of meetings had no ... has no relationship to anything except the approval of loans and at that time, we weren't lending.</p></speech>

However, from your evidence here today, you would appear to have excused yourself from many of the key credit decisions during that time.  You also dispute the ... many of the findings made in several reports produced by a number of independent parties, such as Deloitte Touche, KPMG, the Financial Regulator and on the governance of the society, and have suggested that there were no real problems with INBS.  Could you please explain to the committee as we come to our conclusions today of the session why you believe INBS has ended up costing the Irish taxpayer &euro;5.4 billion and what responsibility you personally bear for this?</p></speech>

I think after the audit of 2010, we still had &euro;1.2 billion in capital and about nearly &euro;4 billion in assets.  What we were anticipating was all the possibilities and the contingencies that may or may not arise, as would be prudent for us to do.  This was not to say that we had any, any at that time, worry about our liquidity or our solvency.  What materialised afterwards - after 2010 and NAMA and all the rest of it and the crash - that took care of all that and then we were insolvent.  Certainly at the time of the guarantee and a year later in March 2009, we were very liquid and very solvent and had capital of, let's say, 10.2% on our balance sheet.</p></speech>

I know you're pressed for time so I'm not going to repeat my statement in full, but obviously I'm more than happy to cover any aspect of it.  As the Chairman has indicated, my career and background is in finance and public service.  In 2001, I agreed with the board and the Central Bank to become non-executive chairman.  The purpose of my appointment was to help the board oversee a sale of the society under legislation which was agreed by the authorities and which was to be implemented the following year.  Accordingly, I expected my role would be relatively short, circa two years.  When the authorities failed to deliver that legislation in 2002, the Central Bank and subsequently the Financial Regulator required that I stay <i>in situ</i>until the sale could be completed.<br/><br/>Every single year, the authorities, be they the Central Bank, the regulator, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment, and the relative Ministers, promised they would deliver the necessary legislation within the next 12 months.  They failed to do so.  As a result, instead of the expected two-year term, I actually served as non-executive director and non-executive chairman, in particular, for almost eight years, until I resigned in February 2009.  The planned sale of the society is not the focus of this committee.  However, the significant, avoidable delay in implementing the necessary legislation is and was very frustrating.  Implementing it earlier would have avoided any involvement by the society in the banking crisis.  This points to the enormous cost of inaction by the authorities and the policymakers alike, a theme that I will return to.<br/><br/>Chairman, I'd like to put on record my acknowledgement of the massive challenges that the collapse of the Irish banking system has imposed on the Government finances and the citizens of Ireland.  Many families have suffered from both the collapse in the property market and the era of austerity that has followed it.  Mistakes were made by all financial institutions.  Irish Nationwide was no exception.  However, in my view, by 2006-2007 it would have been impossible to completely avoid the damage from the global credit crisis.  While the damage could have been mitigated, we must recognise that the crisis was global; it was systemic.  None of the financial institutions, none of the authorities or the international or domestic economic advisers fully appreciated the significance of the global credit bubble, particularly as it related to property and indeed structured credit.  This was equally true in the US, where both of the quasi-Government finance agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, failed.  The Fed models didn't adequately capture the events and 12 of the top institutions required support.<br/><br/>My greatest regret is that we didn't recognise sooner the convergence of factors that led to this global financial collapse and the devastating series of interrelated knock-on impacts for the Irish property sector, the financial institutions and the public purse.  Some of the criticism levied at the Irish financial institutions, including the society, is warranted.  That said, I cannot concede all the points made by those who have criticised the society, often without any real understanding of its model and, furthermore, based on 20:20 hindsight.<br/><br/>From the inquiry's perspective, I am deeply concerned that the popular, but erroneous, depiction of the society as being in the poorest financial health of all institutions at the time may hinder both the inquiry and, indeed, the public understanding of the real issues at play.</p><p>For example, when the downturn hit, the society had the highest percentage capital of all Irish guaranteed institutions.  Equally, at no stage did the society advocate a guarantee for bondholders.  Because of the society's liquidity position, the society wasn't reliant on future bond issues.<br/><br/>You have heard from the managing director, later you'll hear from the finance director - the two key executive directors.  My perspective is that of a non-executive director and I'd like to focus on a few key areas in my opening remarks: firstly, the society's model; secondly, the society's awareness to the changing environment and its actions in the period from December 2007; thirdly, the regulatory authorities - the interaction between the society and them and their powers; and, finally, I'll turn to liquidity and solvency.  I'm going to spend most of my time discussing the society's model, so do not be too concerned if that takes a bit more time.<br/><br/>The society's model was different to that of other institutions but it was carefully considered.  Notwithstanding the comments made to date, I believe it was more prudent than that adopted by many of its competitors.  Though it may jar with the popular narrative, the society had a prudent financial model.  Its loan book was much shorter than others, with many of its loans, particularly in the UK, being for less than 18 months.  This was clearly not understood by some of your witnesses.  In the absence of the global crisis, the society would have been expected to be able to realise half its commercial book in 2009.  The average loan duration in September 2008 was 30 months.  Obviously, in perspective, bond issues were typically for five years.  Secondly, the society was very different in terms of liquidity.  It was a net supplier of funds to the interbank market, both before and after the liquidity squeeze caused by the Reuters story.<br/><br/>On the night of the guarantee the society had over &euro;3 billion of cash on deposit with other banks.  Unlike others, the society didn't require emergency liquidity or funding and that position should be contrasted with both ILP and Anglo who, as you've been told on a number of occasions, were both about to run out of funds and, in ILP's case, had been requiring ECB funding for about a year.  The society was also different in not competing for unprofitable mortgage business.  Again, as a number of witnesses have testified, a small institution competing for this, at best marginal mortgage business, was ultimately going to have too much gearing and too little capital.  By way of direct comparison, there was only one other stand-alone building society, EBS.  In the period 2003 to 2008, INBS maintained its loan-to-capital ratio always between 10% and 13%.  In contrast in EBS, by 2008 that ratio had fallen to just over 3%.<br/><br/>I have just noted - at a balance sheet level - INBS had a strong capital base and its gearing was less than half its peers.  Despite what you might think, it had more conservative lending growth rates than many of its competitors.  In the five years to the end of 2008, the society had a significantly lower lending growth rate than AIB, than Anglo, than Bank of Scotland Ireland and Ulster if you focus on the combined property, construction and mortgage areas, all of which became highly correlated due to the credit bubble and the crisis.<br/><br/>In summary, Chairman, the society stuck to its strengths, it focused on its key areas of competitive advantages.  It didn't seek to turn treasury into a profit centre.  There were no exotics, no structure products and money was placed with board-approved institutions.  As a result, in early September 2008 the society had sufficient liquidity to meet all its boundary payment obligations through to the beginning of 2010.  Indeed, but for the global credit crisis, the society would have been sold in late 2007, probably at a valuation between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;2 billion.<br/><br/>The society's core business was funding property - its area of expertise.  Ultimately, with the gradual decline in property values, by 2010 many of these loans were non-performing.  However, as is evident from the NAMA transfers, there was no significant difference between the discounts applied to AIB, to Anglo, to EBS and to the society.  In your deliberations, Chairman, you may also want to consider that, for a true comparison and to get a full picture across institutions, you need to examine what would have happened if a policy similar to NAMA had been taken in relation to other categories of loans and not just commercial loans.  For example, in 2009 the mark-to-market loss on much of the new mortgage business which was entered by various institutions in 2006 and 2007 ... the loss on that group of loans would have been similar to the levels experienced in commercial property.  In other words, about 60%.<br/><br/>The society failed as, with all others, it didn't anticipate the impact of the global credit squeeze sufficiently early.  This made the refinancing of its short-duration loans impossible.  However, the society wasn't asleep.  It did monitor the economic development and took steps to adapt the business model accordingly.  The society was the first of all Irish lending institutions to anticipate and respond to the changed market circumstances in late 2007.  As non-executive chairman, I believed the Irish banking system was over-exposed and immediate retrenchment was required.  The board agreed and in December 2007 the board decided to reverse engines, cancel the trade sale, decided to minimise lending and to build liquidity.  Immediately after the board took that decision, my first port of call was the regulator.  I was anxious to share both my analysis and the society's actions.  In my analysis, the emerging threats to the banking system in Ireland and elsewhere should have caused concern.  The society was willingly ceding market share to its direct competitors who were, in many cases, also under the control of the regulator.  The decision by the society was taken over nine months before the State guarantee.  Months later, the bank ... the Central Bank and the ESRI were still forecasting significant economic growth for 2008 and 2009.  Indeed, internationally, in June .... July 2008, sorry, the ECB even raised interest rates.  However, despite prompting, the leadership that I felt was required from the regulator never came.  I took the opportunity of a meeting, in early May 2008, with the regulator and his senior staff to relay, both orally and in writing, the need for urgent leadership and, indeed, action to save the Irish financial system.<br/><br/>In summary, Chairman, my key messages were, and I quote them directly:</p><blockquote>[One,] Leadership is required from the Financial Regulator/Central Bank.  Because of the differing competitive positions between the institutions no consensus will be achieved without the leadership of the Financial Regulator/Central Bank.<br /><br />[The second key message was on similar enough lines] In the absence of intervention, problems are inevitable as the Irish growth story has been funded by the capital markets and these are no longer available to meet redemptions.  The sooner the intervention the lower the cost.</blockquote><p>To this day, I cannot understand why the authorities did not intervene in the markets before the financial crisis broke months later.  The inquiry has heard that the authorities were working on contingency plans but didn't activate those plans until the crisis broke and by then it was too late.  Indeed, I was surprised to hear evidence from a senior Department of Finance witness that the Department appears to have welcomed the immediate crisis caused by the false Reuters story as it gave them, finally, the impetus necessary to begin to take action.<br/><br/>I'd like to talk briefly about the society and its relationship with the Central Bank and the regulator.  During my time as non-executive chairman, the Central Bank raised routine issues with the society.  The board took all issues raised by the Central Bank or the Financial Regulator very seriously and I and the other directors - and one in particular, along with myself - maintained very close relationships with the Central Bank and sought to get management to continually enhance systems.  The Central Bank became the society's regulator in 1990.  Under the building society legislation, the Central Bank had much more power in relation to building societies than in relation to banks.  The legislation specifically conferred a duty on the Central Bank to protect both depositors and to protect the stability of the societies.  Commensurate with that duty, the legislation gave the Central Bank the power to do whatever the Central Bank deemed necessary to comply with its duty.</p><p>Those powers existed from 1990, and in my experience the Central Bank had no hesitation in using its powers where it deemed necessary.  For example, in 2006 the Central Bank-regulator threatened to remove the society&rsquo;s licence if the society didn't hold an election for a non-executive position on the board.  This threat wasn't made to protect depositors.  It wasn't made to ensure stability.  It was not made in relation to lending.  It wasn't made in relation to controls or indeed any prudential issue.  This threat was to facilitate an individual who wished once again to go forward as a non-executive board candidate.  I believed then - I believe now - that threat was irresponsible, but none the less a clear indication of the powers of the Central Bank and the regulator and its willingness to use them.  At no stage after 2004 did the CBFR seek to take any meaningful action in relation to lending or lending-related issues.  On the contrary, the regulator approved a reduction in the society&rsquo;s deposit ratio in June 2007, which would have facilitated substantial further lending growth if the society, without any prompting, had not decided to reverse engines.  In summary, contrary to what some have suggested, from 1990 the Central Bank and the regulator had extensive legal supervisory powers to do whatever it deemed necessary to protect depositors and the stability of the societies.  Through their expert inspection teams they had direct access to and detailed knowledge of the inner workings of the society and indeed every institution.</p><p> Finally, if I just briefly turn to the liquidity and solvency debate, within my statement I have dealt with the issues raised by the banking inquiry in relation to liquidity and solvency.  The society was solvent in September 2008 and there is contemporaneous e-mail traffic which confirms this.  Furthermore, I have attached key minutes of society meetings which took place in March 2009, some time after I had resigned.  The minutes of those meetings record the views in March 2009 of the society's auditors, the society's legal advisers.  Even more importantly those minutes in particular reference the attitude of the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance at the time.  Whatever the situation in September 2008, by March 2009 the authorities had full detail on each organisation, and in aggregate certainly more than any non-executive director in any one institution.  In March 2009, following full consideration, the new INBS board confirmed that the society was solvent.  Chairman, members, thank you for your time.  As I said earlier, I deeply regret that we didn't foresee the market instability at a much earlier stage, which would have resulted in earlier action by the society and potentially other institutions, and a situation where perhaps at least the society, due to the short duration of its loan book, its high liquidity and strong capital base, could have avoided being a cost to the Irish taxpayer.  Thank you.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh, on page 9 of your own statement, the witness statement, you list a number of reasons which you believe were the "difficulties which the Society subsequently encountered and the associated losses arose from a combination of factors" and you list those factors - a bubble of cheap credit, hyper-competition, markets freezing, inability to refinance, the property bubble bursting, excess pressure and a concentration of risk in the commercial property sector.  And that's where you say, "because the Society loaned funds to a relatively small number of borrowers many of whom were in the commercial property sector the Society was badly affected by the impact of the factors listed above".  I'm ... forgive me for being puzzled or surprised that in that list you don't include, if you like, any of the activities at the building society itself, that if you like, you are largely saying that it was external factors that contributed to your problems.  I would draw attention in that fact to the Central Bank's own report of 2015, which as you know, investigated the building society between August 2004 and 2008,  INBS has admitted multiple failings at several levels of its commercial lending process from operational lending to credit review, its credit provisions and audit committees, all the way to its board of directors.  INBS's admitted failings amount to a consistent and at times wholesale disregard for its own policies and procedures.  So I'm wondering, Mr. Walsh, why in your list of reasons do you not list, if you like, your ... the failings of INBS along with those other matters?</p></speech>

Absolutely, I take issue.  I mean, by definition, there were things that needed to be remedied within the society but, you know, I had continuous contact with the Central Bank and the regulator from the time that I agreed to take on the chairmanship.  You know, I would have had a meeting in early 2004 with the top two head people in the regulator at that point in time - it would have been Dr. O'Reilly and Mr. Neary, and both of them confirmed to myself and indeed Dr. Power, who I think was one of the other non-executive directors at the time, that there was nothing as between the regulator and the society, other than normal matters as between a regulated entity and the regulator.  Now, you know, I have difficulty reconciling in some senses, you know, those statements there and the statements by Dr. O'Reilly and Mr. Neary in 2004.  Were there issues?  Absolutely, there were issues.  Were they addressed as they arose?  Yes, they were.  Was the board ever happy with the degree of progress?  No board should ever be happy with progress.  Boards should always be pushing for more performance.</p></speech>

We would have involved both our, you know, external legal advisers, our external financial advisers.  We would have actually held special board meetings to actually review it, and indeed I would have responded to every single item in that letter, I think by letter, at the beginning of February 2005.</p></speech>

It is a letter from the Financial Regulator to the INBS dated 8 February 2008.  The Financial Regulator "calls into question the adequacy of controls and risk management in place in INBS for large commercial property loans and suggest[s] that a significant degree of approval authority rests with a single individual, Mr. Fingleton, who also appears to be the only source of information on some of these large clients".  What is your view of that observation by the regulator?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-02a.1148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090200002#OO01300"><p>Well, I think, first of all I have two observations in relation to it, and if I deal with the first and probably the most important one, this letter arrived, as you say, in February 2008.  In December 2007, the day after the board meeting, I went and saw the regulator and his No. 2, and at that meeting I told the regulator and his No. 2 that we were not continuing to lend, other than where we needed to, to preserve existing facilities.  So when I got this letter, it was got at a time when the board had already taken a decision to effectively cease lending and to actually build liquidity.  Was I happy with this letter?  No, I was never happy with a letter like this, and you can be sure that this letter was actually reviewed carefully.  Considered responses would have been sent by the board to the regulator.</p><p>In the context of the specific situation in relation to Mr. Fingleton, the reality is that the board had a very clear requirement which was up to, I think, the beginning or the middle of December 2007, all loans above &euro;1 million, having been approved and recommended by the credit committee, had to come to the board for approval.</p></speech>

You would disagree with that.</p></speech>

Mr. Fingleton, as you know, was here this morning giving evidence and he said that much of the way in which he had been portrayed over the years, as a man who ran the Irish national building society and that he was the main guy and he gave money here and there and everywhere.  What would you say, as the man who was chair for quite a number of those years?</p></speech>

It built up the perception of the society, its importance, and, you know, all of the coverage that the society got because of his, sort of, image or aura was all effectively beneficial.</p></speech>

Whose idea was that and was that supported by the board?</p></speech>

I mean, the initial permissions to actually get involved in property or property development were in 1992 in Ireland, you know, and that permission was obviously under Central Bank supervision.  The second permission was in 1994 when the Central Bank gave permission to the society to acquire sites in London.  So, to a degree, once that actually happened, there was a beginning of the development of expertise within the society in relation to that particular sector.  Clearly, before, kind of, 1990, the society had done relatively small loans in the context of pubs or farms or whatever, but really, it was under the 1989 Building Societies Act that the society was effectively being encouraged - well, it was obviously before my time but, nonetheless, was being encouraged - to get into housing and housing development, and that was, you know, a facility and power that it actually embraced.  By the time-----</p></speech>

But ... you know, sorry, the initial concept was very much, kind of - and, as I say, it was pre-my time - "We will do it ourselves."  That evolved into a situation where the society very quickly recognised that the expertise in terms of development was not within the society.  You know, the society had expertise in terms of assessing and reviewing but it didn't have expertise in terms of doing the development itself so it actually formed partnerships, you know, different structures at different times.  But the initial relationship was ... one of the, I think, people who have actually been involved here in terms of being a witness, which was, you know, Ballymore and Mr. Mulryan, and as, I think, Mr. Mulryan would have explained, you know, at no stage over whatever, kind of, the 25-28 years that he was involved with the society, did the society ever lose a penny; on the contrary, it actually made money.  Now you'll see in that particular letter that you referred to, the one from whatever date it is in December of 2004, there is discussion in relation to, I think, joint ventures and, you know, the unwinding of those. And, you know, part of the problem was that, you know, that particular joint venture with Mr. Mulryan, which is blacked out obviously in your sheets, was actually causing distortions in the returns.</p></speech>

But, you know, the Financial Regulator was doing absolutely the right thing by saying, "Look, we have to look at contingency.", and I think you'll be aware from the fact that, you know, I mean, months earlier, they had started to look at private sector contingency solutions in the event of something actually going wrong somewhere in the system.  So the Financial Regulator was absolutely right.  They did exactly what they should have.  Now, I think, the reality is - I think you will have heard it from Mr. Burrows - all of the institutions, by September 2008, were suffering from, shall we say, liquidity pressures.  The society was unique in the sense it had, for all practical purposes, more liquidity than anybody else.  I mean, I think Mr. McDonagh mentioned that the NTMA had something like &euro;5 billion in cash at that point in time.  You know, in comparison, the society, even after the problems during September, had &euro;3 billion cash on hand.</p></speech>

I mean, you probably have seen.  There's an e-mail which Mr. McDonagh forwarded to, I think, Mr. Beausang the night, or sorry, the day before the guarantee.  In that, you know, Mr. McDonagh's words are more or less - or, sorry, the words in the e-mail, to be precise, are that at this point in time INBS has &euro;3 billion in cash, its outflows are - I think, that day - something like &euro;20 million, and his assessment or the assessment in that e-mail is that we don't have a current problem, we may need to actually do something precautionary for December 2008.</p></speech>

You've got to wake up and got to deal with them", you know, at that point in time we were continuing to build liquidity.  You know, we had contingency facilities, from, I think it was, Danske Bank, at the time but, you know, we were building and we were looking at other avenues.  So when we got to the beginning of September 2008, we had sufficient cash to meet all of the bond repayments through to the beginning of 2010.  In that context, you know, particularly when you have such a short duration loan book - as I say, if there hadn't been complete dislocation in the markets we would have expected to realise half the loan book over the period of 2009 - so we had, you know, a very viable model at that point in time.  Now, obviously, what happened in 2009 and 2010, the markets continued to remain frozen and that gave, unfortunately, all of the impacts that we saw subsequently.  But, you know, if you had done a review at the beginning of September in 2008, I think you would have come to the exact same view as Mr. McDonagh was coming to at the end of September 2008, which was, you know, the society has &euro;3 billion in cash, which, as I say, kind of, 60% of the amount that the NTMA had.</p><p>The leakages or the withdrawals of cash at that point in time, you know, they would have been higher earlier in September, immediately after the uncertainty caused by the story, but then you had the guarantee raised to &euro;100,000, I think on 20 September, and after that the outflows from the society dropped dramatically.  </p><p> I think, just to put it in perspective, on I think it was ... what was it ... 29 September, was it the day of the guarantee ... the outflows from Anglo Irish that day were &euro;2,000 million whereas from the society the outflows were &euro;30 million.</p></speech>

Finally, was it appropriate with you, as chair, that by September 2008, 80% of the loan book of INBS was in commercial property and 81% of its land and development exposure was in speculative property activity?

In 2000, there was an equal split between commercial and residential.  We had taken very clear decisions in terms of not pursuing certain markets - i.e. a residential market that was overall competitive and with a very low margin because that was going to destroy the capital base.  The society maintained at all stages a very high level of capital.  I think, you know, the core books include, you know, Project Harmony.  At the end of 2006 the society's solvency ratio was nearly 14% - now that would have been probably twice anybody else's in town.</p></speech>

It is in front of you now.  Over the period 2002 to 2007 in particular, profit before tax increased by 303%, and total assets by 190%.  Even the four diagrams there will show what some people might think would be an astonishing exponential growth from 2002 onwards.  Do you think that these levels of growth were prudent or sustainable, particularly in view of the growing competition within the Irish lending market at this time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-02a.1184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090200002#QQ00900"><p>Well, I think first of all, you know, with the benefit of hindsight, nobody really understood the dangers of the actual kind of degree of growth in terms of the aggregation.  But, I think, to put things in perspective the society, you know, in the period say ... well, let's take the five years, the end of '03 to the end of '08, the society lent, in terms of the Irish property market on the commercial side, roughly speaking, &euro;2.5 billion.  In the same period, AIB would have lent &euro;30 billion into the same sector and, indeed, Anglo would have lent &euro;30 billion into the same sector.  So, you know, the practical reality is the society was growing at a lower rate in terms of these sectors than all of its competitors.  It was growing at a lower rate because, you know, it actually was trying to maintain appropriate standards in terms of what it should actually do.</p> <p>  You'll notice if you look at that - and I accept the asset growth is high - but you will notice the level of reserves, which is the accumulated funding.  And, you know, that went up by a substantial multiple as well.  All of those funds are available to actually meet the situation in relation to any downturn.</p></speech>

For example, Professor Honohan, the former Governor of the Central Bank, in an article in the Economic and Social Review, summer 2009 says as follows, "A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth; that an annual real growth rate of 20% is taken as the trigger."  And he goes on to say that in the case of INBS, Irish Nationwide crossed the line six out of nine years for an average rate of growth over the nine years of just over 20%.  And are you aware of Professor Black who gave evidence to this committee?  And I might assume, or you can tell us, that you might have been aware of the crisis in the savings and loans situation in the United States.  Now, in view of that experience, Mr. Walsh, if you were aware of it as an academic, why were you not able to see that alarm bells should have been flashing in your head above anybody else in this period when this exponential growth was happening?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-02a.1190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090200002#QQ01500"><p>I suppose, you know, I would take that at two different levels.  First of all obviously, I look back and say, "Why didn't I see it?"  I suspect everybody who is in authority in any of the economic bodies now looks back and says "Why didn't they see it?"  But the practical reality is that nobody saw it at the time.  I think when you look at the savings and loan - and I would be fully aware of the savings and loan's situation - the problem was absolutely, completely different.  The context of the savings and loan was they were lending at long-term fixed rates and they had a complete mismatch in terms of their book between the assets and liabilities side.</p> <p>  If I look at the society, the society, as you say, had high growth rates, but it also had twice the capital of most of the other institutions.</p></speech>

KPMG, its own auditors, referred to, you know, the speculative land developments.  And, for example, you got a letter in 2003 from the regulator expressing concern on the growing concentration in property and development land.  And then by September 2008, 80% of your loan book was in commercial property, and 81% of its land and development exposure was in speculative property activities.</p></speech>

And by the way, there were people, as you know ... we had evidence here where in 2003, David McWilliams very accurately predicted what was going to happen.  I am wondering why, as an academic, you couldn't see this.</p></speech>

I think Mr. McWilliams was probably one of the few commentators who at that point in time had a view.  But, you know, being realistic, that view wasn't one that was shared by most other people.  I think it was Professor Honohan who said, "You will always have mavericks.  We should listen to mavericks more often, but in practical terms we don't."</p> <p>  I would love to have seen the problems earlier.  The reality is we did not see the problems until 2007, but when we saw the problems we actually took action.  We went to the regulator, or I went to the regulator, told them what was happening, told them that things needed to be changed.  Now the reality is in 2006 - and you've heard from Professor Honohan in his report - there were stability tests done as part of the round-table discussions.  And what wasn't disclosed in those stability tests, which is actually in his report, that under the stress test No. 2, 88% of the Irish system collapsed.  Now if 88% of the system actually collapses and you don't actually feel as a central bank or regulator that you have a problem on your hands and you need to communicate that to people, then the problem is there. </p> <p>  Now I have tried for the benefit of this committee to actually get more information in relation to those stress tests, because those stress tests are actually terribly important.  They are done at a point in time when we'd been coming out of a very positive period.  There were no warning signs in terms of overall problems in the domestic economy, in the global economy.  So if action had been taken when those signs were there under those stress tests, the country would have been much better off today.  The society would have been able to unwind its loan book because of the very short duration.</p></speech>

Concentration of loans in higher loan-to-value, 30% of commercial loans had higher than 100% loan-to-value and 30 commercial customers accounting for 53% of the total commercial loan book and 41% of the total loan book.  Can I ask you, did the board ever consider or was there a discussion about concern that these levels of concentration and the correlation between them greatly increased the risks to the business model that was being pursued?</p></speech>

The board would have commissioned the KPMG Project Harmony vendor due diligence.  The board, obviously, would have reviewed that at the time and, indeed, so would the Central Bank and everybody else.  Those reports are prepared, as you know, because you want to give a warts-and-all picture of the institution that you are seeking to sell.  You know, at that point in time, there was no indication whatsoever of serious concern by any potential buyer in relation to the structure of the society or the model it was actually pursuing.</p> <p>  I think you make the point in relation to high LTVs.  I think what you need to recognise is that the nature of the loans were very short in duration in many cases and, as a result of that, they were there with a view to getting planning permission or whatever kind of short-term refinement and that, in itself, enhanced the value of the actual loan.  There was proper, or, when I say "proper", there was a detailed review done of the loan books, I think in, probably, kind of, November 2008, before the real collapse, I suppose, took place in 2010.  But in 2008, I think it showed that the average LTV across the book was 80% and, you know, if you couple that 80% with the 24% absorption capability the society actually had, the society was actually in an extraordinarily resilient position if it hadn't been for the absolutely phenomenal decline in prices in 2009 and 2010.</p></speech>

Nobody, prior to ... certainly from my point of view, I didn't see it being in difficulty until 2007.  You know, clearly the Central Bank and the regulator, on the basis of the information they had, should have seen it in 2006.  I know Dr. Nyberg says we should have seen it in 2005.  The reality is, I wish I'd seen it earlier because we would have been able to avoid, you know, the problem and the costs that subsequently arose.</p></speech>

In your opinion, did the desire of management to maximise the value of Irish Nationwide for demutualisation result in the adoption of poor lending practices and increase the level of risk in the loan portfolio?</p></speech>

I think, you know, the unfortunate reality is ... I mean I had believed - and I think I included a paper in part of my statement - I had believed really from, for all practical purposes, the early '90s that small institutions like the society, like EBS, like First Active, could not hope to survive in the long term, given the way the markets were evolving.  So I was clearly of the view that the society should be sold to a larger institution and, you know, my deep regret, that did not happen.  But the only way it could happen was on the basis of legislation.  Now, when I agreed to take on the role in 2001, legislation had, supposedly, been agreed by the Central Bank, by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment.  That legislation should have been implemented then; it wasn't for whatever reason and, unfortunately, the rest is history.  Every single year ... I mean, when that didn't happen in 2002, the Central Bank said they were going to try and put it in as part of the 2003 Central Bank Bill.  In 2003 they said, "Well, we didn't get it in there but there is a working party now; it's going to get agreement in terms of how things are going to be set up."</p> <p>  So, I believe the society would have been sold much earlier.  Clearly, the society was going to continue to run its business properly and efficiently over the time period but I think both the board and the management would have expected that it would have been sold much earlier than that.  I think Dr. Nyberg, whoever briefed him, didn't really get a proper understanding.  The society was absolutely focused on getting a sale of the society done, obviously at the best price possible at the earliest opportunity, because that's what it believed was right from the point of view of the society, the point of view of the members and the long-term structure of the markets.</p></speech>

I am quoting from his statement:</p><blockquote>I gave [Ernst and Young] every assistance.  The investigation ultimately led to the initiation of legal proceedings against the 'old Board' for the losses of the society [...] proceedings represented an attempt by IBRC to make the directors personally liable for the losses of the society.  [And] A central plank of the claim was the allegation by the Plaintiffs that the delegation of powers by the Board of the Society to Michael Fingleton was excessive.</blockquote> <p>Were you involved in this, in these proceedings?</p></speech>

And, absolutely, both sides were satisfied that a settlement was appropriate and that was done, obviously without admission of any wrongdoing or otherwise.

In the book called <i>Fingers</i>, in relation to Mr. Fingleton, in relation to yourself, they're speculating about your reasons for being on the board, &quot;Whatever his reasoning, [Walsh] Mr. Walsh [that's yourself] would later tell friends that getting involved with a toxic society was his greatest regret in an otherwise distinguished career.&quot;  Would you just comment on those two last questions, Mr. Walsh?</p></speech>

You might have to remind me which is which.  First of all, in relation to Dr. Power's comments, I actually can't relate to, you know, certainly, that description of them at all.  Every single board meeting had a board pack, it had an agenda and, you know, in many ways, you know, others have criticised us for actually having too big a board pack, too much agenda, etc., so I'm not sure how one can say, you know, there was, shall we say, kind of, no information and the other can say there was too much.  I suspect, to be honest, it's a misinterpretation.  Con, as you know, is, kind of ... you know ... or can be quite a comical and quizzical figure.  So I suspect the question was actually probably, shall we say, tongue-in-cheek addressed to Michael Fingleton, as managing director, rather than myself.</p> <p>  In relation to the other comment as to, you know, my attitude to the society, I would never have used such words or such a description.  I got involved because of a particular situation which was ... you know, I had expertise in a certain area, I had undertakings from the Central Bank and various Government Departments as to what was going to happen.  Clearly, it didn't happen.  Given that it didn't happen, I continued to chair the place in the best fashion that I actually could, with as good a board as I could hope to have had at the time and to continue to look to strengthen all aspects of the society so as to have it in as perfect a condition as possible when it came for actual sale.  There is no point in trying to sell anything unless you have a product that is interesting for the buyer and the only way to have something interesting for a buyer is to actually have it as a good business.</p></speech>

I'll be bringing you back in again, Deputy Higgins.  I just want to clear up one or two items now that the leads are finished before I bring in the other questioners, Mr. Walsh.  And one relates to ... on 7 September 2008, Mr. Purcell and two of his colleagues attended a meeting at the Central Bank on behalf of INBS together with representatives from AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Mr. Walsh, in his opening ... or, sorry, Mr. Purcell, in his opening statement, refers to this.  I assume you're familiar with that text.

When I actually talked to the, you know, regulator, on the Friday night after that story, you know, had broken, I would say that from that point on, I would have been in touch with the regulator probably every single day, potentially multiple times during the day, for the month of September.  You know, that story ... you know, the potential damage it could have done to the society was just absolutely enormous and, consequently, it was very much, you know, "We have to make sure that we explore every opportunity and all such back-up opportunities that are there."</p></speech>

I think the meeting was actually proposed by the regulator because obviously, you know, I mean, when a story breaks like that ... when I say I presume it was by the regulator, I mean, literally, I was talking to the regulator I would say, you know, 20 minutes, half an hour ... so I would say on that ... sorry, after the story broke.  I would say that, in practical terms, you know, we had discussed, really, what needs to happen now in terms of precaution because obviously the society was different to the banks in the sense the society used to open on a Saturday morning, so, you know, there was a danger, effectively, that the story could actually do a lot of damage even on the Saturday and, consequently, you know, the focus really of the Friday night conversation was probably in relation to, kind of, Saturday, making sure that there were contingencies there, no queues and all the rest of the things that you saw with Northern Rock.</p> <p>  I think, the meeting ... the other meeting ... I can't remember was it a Saturday or Sunday but, you know, I am aware of the fact it didn't go well and, you know, certainly the explanation I heard at the time was that, you know, all of the other institutions were actually suffering from the same degree of concern in relation to liquidity as the society.  I have to say I hadn't been aware that they were in nearly as bad a situation as subsequently has turned out to be the case.  </p></speech>

I mean, reality is that the approach ... because I think earlier in the year the Governor had actually approached both of the two pillar banks with a view to, "If there is a problem, will you be there for a private sector solution?"  I think what maybe the Governor didn't understand at the time, or maybe none of us really understood, was just how widespread and systemic the problem actually was.</p></speech>

He'd used that personality to actually build the business from scratch and, you know, like all of those, as I say, the, kind of ... let's say, the Michael O'Learys of the world, you know, they are forceful people.  That doesn't mean that the board abdicates responsibility.  Just because somebody is a colourful character doesn't mean the board disappears but if I was to ask, I'd suspect, each of you here today - well, with maybe one exception - you know, could you name ten people who actually work for Ryanair, and I don't know how many people work for Ryanair - I suspect thousands and thousands - but I suspect most people could probably only name the one.  In the same way, I think when people looked at the society from the outside - I mean, there was a senior executive team, you know, there was a whole network underneath - most people could only identify with one individual.</p></speech>

I mean, what I can never understand in terms of, you know, shall we say, kind of, some of the coverage that goes out, because there's, kind of, an assertion that, you know, the managing director could do whatever he wanted without any reporting lines, without any restriction.  Very clearly, you know, there was a delegation set up in, I think it was 1994 initially before my time.  That delegation and the, you know, shall we say, prevention or, you know ... I'm not sure what the right word is, but actually the powers retained to the board, the retention of powers, were clearly documented in 2000 ... sorry, not in 2000, in 1997.  In 1997, we had discussion with the Central Bank, you know, the assistant director general at the time, and he laid out what he believed were appropriate reserve powers for the board.  Now, the minutes of the board meeting whenever it was in 1997, clearly set out, "This is the delegated authority to the managing director".  And then it goes on to say, "However, the board reserves the following powers to itself".  And the powers that it reserved to itself were discretion in relation to, you know, anything above a certain threshold had to come to the board.</p></speech>

So there was a whole fabric of things that were reserved to the board.  I mean, I think what is interesting is, you know, there is a governance report there from KPMG.  And, you know, buried at the back of that governance report is a recommended list of reserved powers for boards of directors.  And, you know, if you actually go through that - and, you know, I don't want to take your time; you actually have that, I think, as part of your wider documents, but all of the things that were reserved for the Irish Nationwide board were things that would have been recommended by KPMG in their report in - whenever it was - October or November of 2008.  Now, many of those powers that KPMG advised should be reserved to the board wouldn't have been relevant in the context of the society, such as the final dividend, but things like the annual report and accounts, circulars to shareholders etc., etc., etc., were all powers that were specifically reserved to the board and always held by the board over the period.</p></speech>

You know, first of all, you know, for companies of its size, I think if you actually look at the Higgs report, you know, which was one of the, kind of, famous reports on these things, a board size of five with, kind of, a majority of three non-executives and two executives was actually deemed appropriate.  I mean, I think there has been a lot of debate over time as to what the appropriate board size is and what the appropriate mix is between executive and non-executive, and that's changed.</p> <p>  I think to come to, maybe, the other element of your issues though, by definition, you know, one would have always liked to have, you know, one or two additional board members.  And, you know, I think it was probably early 2004, you know, I tried to convince the other board members that, shall we say, we should co-opt a particular individual to the board who should probably remain nameless.  But that would enable us to both appoint him and to have, kind of, a larger board.  But I couldn't get full agreement to that.</p></speech>

He had very good experience with the Smurfit group, a very good individual and ideal.  And when we got agreement from Mr. Brophy, I expected the board size would actually increase to six.  And we agreed with the regulator that Mr. Brophy would be co-opted to the board following the 2006 annual general meeting.  Unfortunately, there was a problem in the sense that in the ... I think it was February of 2006, Dr. Power, because of a conflict of interest between his role as chairman of the audit committee and vice-chairman of the society, and his chairmanship of the financial ombudsman's council, had to step down due to that potential conflict.</p> <p>  I was very disappointed to lose Dr. Power at the time because he'd actually been a very good non-executive director, a very good chairman of the audit committee, but, nonetheless, when I tried to persuade him to stay, he felt that, you know, as chairman of the financial ombudsman's council, he had a first duty to that role.</p></speech>

I don't think it's me; we'll put it under here just in case.</p> <p>  Take 3 - KPMG, in its review of Nationwide's corporate governance structure in November 2008, made numerous recommendations for improvement, including the development of strategic objectives, the introduction of formal strategic and financial planning process, documenting of board terms of reference and assessment of director independence.  Many of these recommendations could be considered to be basic form of corporate governance considerations.  Why were these measures not put in place much sooner by you in your role as chairman?</p></speech>

I would have been very happy with the KPMG report.  I think it actually set out, you know, a menu of things that could actually be done, should actually be done and, you know, the board would have obviously adopted those.  I think you have to recognise though that there is a real danger in corporate governance that it becomes, you know, almost, kind of, a box-ticking exercise where, you know, let's assume that we have terms reference for this, let's assume we check it and, you know, people actually stop thinking.  I would say at no stage did the board of Irish Nationwide stop thinking.  It may not have always come to the right conclusions, but it, at no stage, stopped being an active board or a focused board.  I mean, I think within that series of recommendations - and there are, you know, multiple recommendations there - some of them would have been recommendations that, you know, the society itself would have actually prompted them to do and some of them would have already been in train for implementation.</p> <p>  Equally well, some of the recommendations would have been ones that, you know, one wouldn't have actually agreed with.  Now, you know, the problem, being simple about it in the context of that particular report ... that report was completed in November 2008, and while it gave a menu for things to be done going forward, you know, at that point in time the whole issue across all of the Irish financial institutions was working out where they were going in terms of, you know, the global crisis that was actually emerging.  So, you know, I would have, maybe in a different environment, spent more time reviewing with KPMG the report and considering it, but, you know, at the time, you know, there was a much greater degree of importance on other-----</p></speech>

Shall we say, in my very early days, I mean, I was on one particular State board, which probably should remain nameless, but, you know, almost the objective, I think, in that particular case was to give the non-executive directors so much information that you wouldn't know where to actually look.  I would say in most, you know, commercial boards - and, you know, I've been involved in a wide range of them across a variety of different sectors - you know, the board actually are pretty focused in terms of what are the important things from their point of view.

I would have given them copies of the various reports that were actually around.  And, you know, I would have been entirely open to them to actually asking whatever questions or deal with any issues that were actually there.</p><p>Now, you know, in the context of, you know, shall we say a board process, you know, I mean, if you're running a board of, kind of, 12 or 14 people, you know, you have a very different requirement for, let's call it, you know, paper tick-box-type exercise just so that everybody comes onto the system, but when you're in a relatively small group, you know, it is a much more, kind of, closely meshed situation.  You've much more contact with each individual director than you would have in, say, a large plc-type board.</p></speech>

You said that that leadership never came so, you know, what sort of leadership were you expecting from them?  What sort of intervention were you expecting from them?

There was also a detailed evaluation done by the regulator in terms of the capital needs.  And on the basis of that and, you know, to use their words, they actually evaluated all of the loans on a cash-flow basis.  So here we have a board saying in, I think it was probably, kind of, April 2010, you know, we have evaluated the cash flows associated with every single major loan that we actually have and, you know, for right or wrong due to the concentration in the book that should have been easy to do.  They came to a view as to what the necessary write-down was.  Now, for some peculiar reason and, you know, I have no idea what it was, the amount of the write-down actually almost doubled between April 2010 and September 2007, or September 2010, sorry, I get my years confused sometimes.  Now, I don't know what actually happened over that five-month period for the board to actually agree to accept prices which were effectively 40% below what they had done as valuations.  I mean, I have looked, obviously, at the NAMA reports, and if I look at say, tranche 1, I see that the society uniquely accepted a valuation which was below the market value of the underlying properties.  I can't understand that, I can't rationalise that but that's what they actually did.  I think it is fair to say that I did talk to my successor on one occasion in relation to a particular project, which probably should remain nameless, but it's actually the largest in terms of what's defined as the spec projects, and his view at the time was that they had an offer which was more than double the price they could actually convince NAMA to accept the transfer out.  Now, I don't know, but I think the view of the board, and I can understand exactly where they were coming from, was, you know, NAMA had been set up, it was Government policy that everything would be transferred to NAMA, and I suspect that the board saw themselves as price takers but, as I say, I'm not an expert on property, I wasn't there at the time, so it is entirely supposition.</p></speech>

Every single year, you know, the board in the absence of any of the management would have actually met with KPMG as the auditors, and KPMG as the auditors would have confirmed (a) that, you know, they had reviewed everything; i.e. they had reviewed not just the numbers, they had reviewed the correspondence with the regulator, they had reviewed the correspondence with the financial ombudsman, they had reviewed all of the internal audit reports, they had reviewed the compliance documentation with Ita Rogers, the compliance person, and in those circumstances they were confirming to the board that everything was appropriate and unqualified, so I have no issue whatsoever in terms of figures.

I expressed the view, as chairman of the society, that I didn't think the changes were appropriate but, you know, the changes were the changes.  They were the rules and the society had to implement them.</p></speech>

Can I ask you in relation to the Central Bank's findings?  This is in relation to your role on the board.  It talked about, under its own internal policies ... and it's reviewed 110,000 documents here ... it's not ... it's an intensive investigation and I presume it's based on evidence on looking at the documents.  It says, "Under its own internal policies and procedures, INBS was required to provide certain reports relating to commercial lending and credit risk management to its Board of Directors."  It goes on to say, "INBS has admitted to [...] internal systemic failure[s]."  I want to go through some of these.  Reports on exceptions to commercial lending policies, it says that such reports would have given the board an insight into an overview of the extent of commercial lending, which was outside the scope of the lending policy.  Did you get those reports between December 2005 and September 2008?</p></speech>

The purpose of an exceptions policy is to make sure that decisions actually come up the line rather than actually stay down the line.  The purpose of an exceptions policy - because these are board policies, they are not enshrined in rules or regulations, Central Bank or society rules ... they are board policies and, so, the purpose of those exception policies is to ensure that if somebody wants to do something which is outside a very sort of defined box then it has to come to the board for approval.  Now, you've already heard that, you know, everything above &euro;1 million had to come to the board for approval.</p></speech>

Let's be clear in what we're talking about here.  A report was required to be provided to the board of directors on compliance with geographic concentration risk limits.  This wasn't about being aware of something, it was about a physical report being distributed to board members that the chair should ... obviously to ensure that the board members were fully aware, as the Central Bank have said, about the risks in terms of concentration, geographic risks and so on in terms of the commercial loan portfolio.

Project Harmony - the report notes:</p><blockquote>The overall approach to risk assessment would not be described as highly developed given that the Group continues to rely heavily on the Managing Director, does not have sophisticated IT systems and operates across a limited range of products.  The modus operandi would be described by management as fit for purpose, particularly given the degree of Board oversight on the lending approval process.</blockquote> <p>Was that an appropriate structure to have for an advanced institution which had a balance sheet of &euro;16 billion at the end of 2007?</p></speech>

The society actually had a very simple model.  You know, it wasn't, you know, a complicated business like, you know, the high street banks - the pillar banks, as we describe them today.  It, you know, was, for all practical purposes, a small building society.  It wasn't trying to offer complicated products.  It was focused on a particular area where it had its expertise.  You know, it didn't have a whole series of, kind of, treasury risk issues, which would have been, you know, potentially, kind of, an issue in some situations.  You know, it was not trying to develop an esoteric set of products to market to its members.  You know, its mortgages were completely plain vanilla.  It was very straightforward and very simple.  I think the point that KPMG are actually making there, which is a completely valid point, is if the buyer who took over the society wanted to actually build, you know, the equivalent of, you know, a high street bank or a pillar bank, then they would obviously have to change the systems to cater for that.  So, while the systems were appropriate for the society, you know, it was clearly recognised that, in the context of an organisation where somebody was going to develop the retail side as opposed to the commercial side, that investment would be required both in the systems and, indeed, in the branch system.</p></speech>

Well, a number of your colleagues did.  Professor Niamh Brennan saw it happening from the board of the Ulster Bank, that there was a property crisis going to happen in Ireland.  Morgan Kelly, of course, most famously.  Have you discussed with either of them their ability to see that we would end up investigating here a &euro;64 billion bill to the Irish Exchequer?</p></speech>

Sorry, but at the time, I think, when Professor Kelly, you know, published his report or his paper, which would have been I think, was it the May-June of 2007 - I can't remember the precise date - you know, I think there would have been a phenomenal amount of comment in relation to his views at the time.  And, you know, his views were a legitimate view, I think, in relation to, kind of, house prices and what might actually happen but I think it is fair to say that, you know, he didn't foresee the depth of the problem or the speed of the problem.  Obviously, you know, in the context of Professor Brennan, you know, a very capable individual, but I mean I think the reality is that, you know, as I've said earlier, the rate of growth and the continuing growth in property and property lending was actually higher in-----</p></speech>

Sorry, I mean, I think, you know, Professor Brennan will actually tell you, you know, they didn't anticipate, you know, the, kind of, downturn any more than we did.  Whatever about her own view, certainly, the reality is, as I think you know, over that period of time, you know, Ulster Bank would have actually grown at a higher rate, a substantially higher rate, than the society and indeed, you know, at a faster rate than EBS and a faster rate than ILP.</p></speech>

I think he was the one person who, at an early stage, saw the problems.

I mean, it's very clear, as I said to you earlier, the society should have had an absorption capability of about a 45% or 46% decline in property values.  Unfortunately, the actual decline in many areas was higher than that.</p></speech>

So what did you make of that or, if this is the first time you are hearing it, what do you make of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-02a.1402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090200002#CCC00500"><p>I mean, to be blunt about it, I'm absolutely astonished by his evidence, or at least by that statement, because, you know, it was he who actually sent the e-mail to Mr. Beausang in the Department of Finance, effectively, that day, saying the society had &euro;3 billion and that the outflow from the society at that stage was &euro;30 million, so a multiple, because the reality is that once the guarantee level had been increased to &euro;100,000, the outflow from the society in terms of deposits actually went down dramatically.  I think in the earlier part, before that increase, there was substantial outflows which would have caused serious concerns in the middle of September.  Once, I think it was 20 September that the increase in the guarantee went to &euro;100,000 that largely stopped.  As I said, the specific e-mail, which, as I say, was sent from McDonagh to Beausang, says the society has &euro;3 billion, the outflows are &euro;30 million.  They are, for all practical purposes, in no immediate need of cash.  They may have a need in December and they may not.  Now, if somebody is saying they have all the cash they actually require, there is no short-term problem, they have potentially an issue coming up in December but we don't know at this point in time, they may or they may not, I would have said it was pretty much irreconcilable for that and an insolvent situation to be put together.  I just can't rationalise it, to be honest.</p></speech>

We may need to consider a contingency plan for December".  So, on any basis, at that point in time, it was absolutely solvent.</p></speech>

I mean, no loans were actually made which the society didn't deem were actually prudent.  Would it have been sustainable going forward?  I think the reality is almost certainly no and we all know, with the benefit of hindsight, it wouldn't have been.  Clearly, those people who were interested in actually buying the society at the time and I think, you know, you have the names of a number of them, all believed the society was actually a good model and, you know, had good potential.</p></speech>

I mean, the society actually had a very simple business.  It didn't need overly sophisticated systems or overly sophisticated tools.</p></speech>

I mean, the purpose of these reports is to say, "Look, this is what an organisation actually looks like.</p><p>If you're coming in to buy it, this is what we're representing to you.  So, if you're going to come in and buy it, to do what it's doing at the moment, that's one thing; if you're coming in to buy it to do something different, then you're going to have to make changes."</p></speech>

So the relevance of those points, as in Project Harmony, relate to if the buyer decides to diversify out of what you see as a very simple banking function up to that point in time.</p></speech>

It was all in the one sort of place, you know, very straightforward.  So, yes, it was straightforward and simple.  The reality is it was concentrated in property and whether it had been residential property or construction or commercial, you'd have had the exact same writedowns if you decided to mark to market everything in 2009.</p></speech>

The final area I want to look at in the limited time I have is coming back to the regulator.  Because one of the titles ... subheadings in your written statement is "Lost Opportunity".  You talk about the society reversing the engines before any other institution.  So, when you decided to make that ... when you made that decision in December 2007 and the regulator at the time was doing the five by five, large exposure-large debtor connections in the individual institutions ... so it had some awareness of the liquidity crisis that was developing in Irish banks.  But you brought this to the regulator and said, "We're making this decision out of prudence because we're not sure about the next year for Irish banking."  And then what happened on the side of the regulator?</p></speech>

Sorry, I mean, clearly there was correspondence during 2008, and to a degree, I suppose, I always wondered whether it was an element of, you know, shall we say, kind of moving the deck chairs.  You know, there was a problem that was actually systemic across the country.  I mean, it should have been obvious for over a year, but it was a systemic problem.  It wasn't a problem with one institution or some small number of institutions.  I mean, those 2006 stress tests were saying 88%.  So, by definition, all the pillar banks had to be gone at that point in time.  It should have been an extraordinarily worrying situation for any regulator or central bank.  Now, very clearly, you know, liquidity was an issue that they were focusing on.  I mean, I think we've actually heard that the domestic standing group, you know, was putting in place contingency plans from the beginning of, I think, 2008.</p> <p>  But I kind of can't actually reconcile, you know ... I mean, I went back to the regulator, as you know, in May.  There was other correspondence in between but primarily in May.  And I said, "Look, you've got to take a leadership role."  You know, you had AIB there and with due respects to AIB, they were actually sort of saying, "We can't stop lending because, you know, we'd lose market share."  The society was taking a decision, "Look, it may mean we lose market share but this is the right thing to actually do."  Now, from the regulator's point of view, they should've seen that it was the right thing for us to do.  It should've been right across the system and yet, you know, you find, I think, there was &euro;3 billion in property and construction lending by AIB during 2008.  It just ... I mean, I don't ... and, sorry, I need to be very clear: I do not believe that all of the damage or anything close to all of the damage could've been stopped at that stage.  We were-----</p></speech>

I mean, you know, you have my written statement in terms of my direct quotes as to what they needed to do.  Because from the society's point of view, I mean, it actually was a decision we had taken.  We recognised the implications of it but it was also clear that there were competitive pressures still going on around the place.  People were trying to actually suggest there was instability around and they were doing that obviously for competitive advantage because if money left the society, it was going to go to one of the larger institutions, but ... or, indeed, Northern Rock, which was actually seen as guaranteed by the UK Government at the time.  But the only way you were going to stamp that out or really get ahead of the curve was actually by the regulator - or not necessarily the regulator; the regulator, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, whoever - actually taking a real role in terms of trying to deal with the crisis.</p></speech>

You know, clearly, the performance of Anglo, which was very public, very successful, but was actually a very different model to the society.  I mean, Anglo was entirely focused on commercial lending from day one.  It had no natural deposit base.  It was highly dependent on, you know, both the commercial deposit base, it was highly dependent on the interbank market, it was highly dependent on corporate bond issues.  So, you know, the society was in a much different situation.  It was much more liquid and much less gearing.  I mean, the gearing ratio in Anglo is over twice the level it was in the society.  When I talk about gearing, I'm talk about loans to actual capital.  So, you know, they were very different.  But to go back to your original question is, you know, by definition, no one institution can create a bubble.  I think, you know, some institutions have said "Well, we were out there playing follow the leader, we weren&rsquo;t thinking for ourselves".  Certainly, nobody was playing follow the leader with us.  The society was, as I say, the minnow.  Over the period, you know ... and the worst of the property crisis obviously was in Ireland ... over the period 2003-2008, I think the society lent a total of about &euro;2.5 billion into the Irish market.  You know, as I said to you earlier, in 2008 alone AIB actually lent more than that into property and construction.</p></speech>

And it also seems to me that, over that period, that it wasn&rsquo;t just organic - it didn&rsquo;t just start and be created - that there was a plan in place going back to demographics, and Mr. Fingleton touched upon it earlier, of the late &rsquo;70s ... that children born in the late &rsquo;70s would require loans and housing from the noughties onwards.  Your ... the institution that you chaired was ... cost the most in terms of the money that was State required and you're saying to me that no one institution can create a bubble.</p></speech>

I think the reality is, you know, if you look at market shares, you know, first of all in total market share, obviously, you know, basically Anglo increased its market share and AIB and Bank of Ireland decreased.  But if you were to actually look at it in terms of ... instead of kind of the total lending, if you were to look at it in terms of, kind of, property and construction, you'll find that, you know, the two big lenders into property and construction in this country were AIB and Anglo.  Bank of Ireland is less than half of either of those.</p></speech>

At the top of the page, first paragraph, you know, you speak about the Central Bank-Financial Regulator and you say:</p><blockquote>Contrary to some of the evidence that has been given to [the] Inquiry the [Central Bank-Financial Regulator] was far from toothless and where it had an issue, it was my experience that it had no hesitation in using its powers, albeit not always, in my view, in a sensible fashion.  One such instance is when the [Central Bank-Financial Regulator] approved a reduction in the Society&rsquo;s deposit ratio in June ['07] which would have facilitated substantial lending growth, had the Society not subsequently decided on its own initiative to curtail lending.</blockquote> <p>Is that not your job and the chair of the board and the executive of the institution in question, INBS, to curtail lending in a prudent manner?</p></speech>

You know, if Central Bank or the Financial Regulator, in terms of looking at the total market, was of the view that the market was becoming unstable, then it should not have done anything which would have facilitated additional lending by any institution or by all of the institutions.  Second thing I am saying to you is if the Financial Regulator or, indeed, the Central Bank had serious concerns in relation to the lending, lending practices or the governance, then instead of actually approving something which would facilitate additional lending, they should have actually rejected it.  So, what I'm saying to you is, two actions: if they believed there was instability in the market they should absolutely not have actually allowed it and, secondly, if they believed the society wasn't being properly run, if its lending policies weren't sensible or if its lending decisions weren't sensible, then they should not have done anything to facilitate growth.  They should have been saying the opposite.</p></speech>

We had Mr. Fingleton in this morning and he said he had the delegated powers from the board that he could approve and grant loans without prior approval of the board.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I can't remember was it one or two other people.</p></speech>

I was very conscious of the need for independence.  I never borrowed a penny from the society.  I never was dependent on the remuneration in any fashion, I wasn't part of the social circle of either Mr. Fingleton or, indeed, any of the other non-executive directors so, you know, I certainly preserved my independence.  I believe the other non-executive directors preserved their independence.</p></speech>

Brophy ... was brought onto the board in '05 and in 2007 he became chief operations officer with Ballymore Properties which were the single biggest client that Irish Nationwide had ... that he remained on as a director?  Did you have a concern with conflict of interest in that?</p></speech>

Mr. Brophy joined, as you say, or was approved to join the board in, I think, probably October or November of 2005.  He was an excellent appointment with great experience in Smurfit.  In, whatever it was, August 2007 he was invited ... I gather he'd been introduced to Ballymore by Dr. Smurfit and he was invited to become ... I am not sure whether it was chief executive or CEO of Ballymore.  The board was fully conscious of its relationship with Ballymore and the potential conflicts of interest that that could give rise to.</p><p>So the board actually met without Mr. Brophy actually being present and discussed what actions had to be taken to ensure that, you know, that conflict of interest didn't emerge.  The board resolved that, you know ... I'm sorry, I should say this was cleared with the regulator at the time but the board actually resolved that obviously he shouldn't be present for or participate in any lending decisions that related to Ballymore and, indeed, where there was potentially a competitive element, that he should not be party to anything.  When I determined in December of 2007, some three months later, that the society needed to reverse directions, I got absolute and complete support from Mr. Brophy, despite the fact that that might not have been in the interests of Ballymore.</p></speech>

I need to give you a kind of brief bit of history to be honest.  So, you know, what actually happened then, I think probably one of the last, you know, or almost a transition piece of work that I had actually done, having looked at the, kind of, financial markets and where they were actually going was, I suppose, I would have had a view that, you know, the building societies were effectively going to get into difficulty, you know, because effectively from, roughly speaking, the mid-'80s, the main banks were coming into the traditional mortgage market.  So I would've done a lot of work for the building societies, in total, in advance of the 1989 legislation.  And then, you know, there was consideration given, I suppose, in '92 or '93 to possibly kind of merging the society with some larger entity, which ultimately was, kind of, one of the GE subsidiaries, though not at the time.  And, you know, I did a paper for the board of Irish Nationwide.  At the time I took a view.  I would have had a very good relationship with the Central Bank at that stage.  You know, the Governor of the Central Bank, Maurice O'Connell, was somebody that I would've known well, I would've worked closely with him during the time that I was advising the ... really the Department of Finance, in relation to the sale of Irish Life or, more precisely, the flotation of Irish Life.

Why did ye push so hard so that ye could demutualise overnight and who was the intended ... who would you have seen as your intended purchaser ... as a takeover ... to buy out Irish Nationwide Building Society at the time?</p></speech>

You know, as I say, you know, the first time, you know, I got involved in doing a report for the society when I wasn't involved with it at all, you know, the proposed acquirer was effectively, you know, kind of the GE Woodchester-type grouping.  And, indeed, you know, when ultimately, you know, the society became available for sale in 2007, you know, they became, you know, one of the potential buyers, you know, second time around.</p><p>You know, obviously there were approaches over the years but the practical reality is that nothing could be done because of, you know, the legislation of the structure in the absence of the Central Bank or the regulator deciding to exercise its discretion.  You know, I mean, my view was that ... pretty clear and it is on the record, you know, my view was that the legislation should have been implemented in 2001 or 2002; it wasn't.  My view post that was, you know, look, if the legislation is not going to be passed for whatever reason then you - the Central Bank - have discretion here, we should move on and actually do it.  And, I mean, I remember the discussions at the time.  It was, kind of, "Look, we don't believe there is, you know, any particular problem with the society.  We don't think there is any question of stability.  We do not think there is any question.  We would only use that if we felt there was a problem and, therefore, we want you to await for normal legislation."</p><p> To answer your other question, which is, why didn't you just go the, let us call it the Irish Permanent route, the reality is, and I think you'd have heard from Mr. McCarthy, you know, First Active went what I would describe as the Irish Permanent route and, you know, discovered that it really wasn't a viable model for all sorts of different reasons.  In the context of the society, the society was even smaller than First Active, I mean, substantially smaller than First Active.  My view is that if the society had gone out, it would not have really captured any sort of shareholder demand or shareholder interest and it would have been potentially destabilising so I would have thought it was an absolute mistake to actually go out as a small institution into the markets.  I think the right thing ... sorry, I mean, if you did that, okay, you know, you'd be there, you're quoted in five years' time but, you know, the uncertainty that you are creating for that five-year vacuum, you know, doesn't make any sense at all from, you know, a direction point of view or otherwise.</p></speech>

The pension ... the &euro;27.5 million pension fund of Mr. Fingleton.  In 2007, where did the decision come about?  Was that a proposal put forward by Mr. Fingleton to the board?  Did ye consider it and why did you agree to allow it to be moved off-balance sheet and into the ... under the personal control of Mr. Fingleton?</p></speech>

So here we had a situation where, you know, at the beginning of 2007, my recollection is that we got a proposal from the managing director, as was his right, to enable him to actually take, you know, the money from something that was directly on the balance sheet of the society or in a fund, as I say, noted on the balance sheet into an independently managed situation.  From the society's point of view, it actually made complete sense.  You know, if there was an actuarial liability there of whatever magnitude it happened to be then transferring, you know, the risks associated with that onto another individual made perfect sense.  You know, I mean-----</p></speech>

You've a background in banking.  You're a seasoned individual in terms of finance.  You were 14 years on the board of Irish Nationwide Building Society.  During your tenure as chairman of the board, the commercial loan book went from &euro;3 billion up to nearly &euro;9 billion - the commercial loan book alone.  At the end, &euro;5.4 billion of taxpayers' money ended up going into Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Do you accept that it was the costliest bailout of any Irish financial institution since the foundation of the State?</p></speech>

You know, I actually can't rationalise where some of the numbers have come from, I mean, I am not sure whose background is finance or accounting or whatever.  But if I take the numbers of the society in very simple terms, you know, the gross loans from the society in the commercial area were about &euro;8.7 billion.</p></speech>

Secondly, there was a liquidity management exercise done of approximately whatever, you know, &euro;300 million.  But, all that being said, whatever the number - and there was a number there and nobody doubts that - no number is actually acceptable.  I think the other factor that you need to take into account - but, as I say, no number is acceptable - is what was actually realised subsequently in the context of, you know, the loans that were transferred across to NAMA.  I don't know the answer to that; I can only surmise.  But, you know, as I said to you before, you know, in 2010 in April, you know, the board confirmed that they had done a very detailed analysis and come up with a valuation.

I have deep regrets that I didn't foresee the problems in terms of the global markets, in terms of liquidity, coming at least a year earlier where we could have avoided any problems.  But you asked me in terms of, you know, the size of the actual deficit, and I'm pointing out to you that under any reasonable assessment the deficit could not have been that high.  So I do not know what accounting games are going on.  You are all ... a number of you are accountants.  You can actually go back through the thing, but I mean, the simple reality is there were two sets of loans on those books there.  There were the loans that were transferred to NAMA and there was the residential book.  There was nothing else that would cause risk.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Dr. Walsh.  I have a long initial question.  I would ask you to bear with me, maybe.  It concerns a number of quotations from the booklets that you would have been provided with.  The first one is from Vol. 2, page 93, the KPMG report on review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function, "The existing internal audit function is not best practice ... In particular it lacks the depth of experience necessary to challenge the areas of key risk which include Treasury and Commercial Lending."</p> <p>  And then in Vol. 1, at page 163, I think, there is a letter from the regulator.  It says that "the Society's internal audit department needs to build up its experience and training in order to perform reviews of key risk areas which are currently outsourced to a third party service provider."  And then similar concerns are raised in a letter from the regulator in 2004.  That is at Vol. 1, page 171, I think.  The quote is, "The level of resources in this area are deemed to be inadequate ... The FSR has concerns with regard to the level of expertise and experience which exists in the IA function."</p> <p>  The Financial Regulator also expressed concerns in 2007 echoing, I suppose, their earlier expressed concerns.  Can you explain how in this period, which stretches over exclusively - it's five years when you would have been the chairman of Irish Nationwide - that no apparent success at least appears to have occurred in addressing the issues that were raised by your external auditor, KPMG, and the Financial Regulator with regard to the internal audit function of the building society?</p></speech>

I think, first of all, there were concerns about the internal audit, you know, going way back, which is why all of the non-executive directors actually participated in the audit committee.  There was a letter, which is part of the books there, I think, on 9 December 2004, which actually specifically raises questions in relation to internal audit and actually requires that the society actually outsource the internal audit.  What did the society do when it got that letter?  Obviously, it reviewed it - reviewed it with the board, reviewed it with the executive, also reviewed it with KPMG.  Based on the work that the society did with KPMG in 2005, the society actually developed a risk metrics, audit risk programme and also a, shall we say, decision matrix in terms of what work would be done internally and what work would actually be outsourced.  I think the concern, you know, with Dr. O'Reilly in 2004 initially was that he was concerned that the individual that the society decided to appoint as the internal auditor didn't have enough background or experience, despite that fact that, I think, he had worked with PwC or Craigs or whatever it was in those days for about six years.</p></speech>

You referenced 2004 and actions that you said took place.  They're in 2008, in their management, are raising more or less the same concerns about building up the experience in the internal audit function.</p></speech>

In 2005, actually the report by KPMG on the effectiveness of internal audit and in 2008 their management letter from KPMG, again on the internal audit department within the building society.</p></speech>

KPMG agreed certain things would be outsourced and certain things would be retained inside, and they took the view that the internal auditor at the time was somebody who was capable of actually doing the job and doing it very well.  That discussion went on and, basically, from a situation where the regulator wanted everything outsourced, you know, the regulator ultimately agreed - and when I say "the regulator", Dr. O'Reilly agreed with the process and the way the society was carrying it forward.</p></speech>

When you come to 2008, you'll see that there is actually a reversal of directions because the reversal of directions is, you know, "We want you to build more expertise internally."  So, we started out with a situation where the regulator says, "Everything should go external," and then, we, as a board, say, "Well, we have to develop the team and the management;  you know, we have to focus on the things-----"</p></speech>

I think you're misrepresenting it slightly.  I don't think they said that everything should go ... I mean, they were identifying a shortcoming which they felt could be addressed by an external solution more so than completely externalising it.</p></speech>

And, you know, needless to say, the society actually hadn't.  The society was reviewing its response to Dr. O'Reilly's letter and doing it properly and professionally and coming up with what the society viewed as actually being appropriate.  Now, I would have to go on and say that, you know, there is a lot of innuendo in some senses about the internal auditor.  The internal auditor ... and, sorry, I don't mean from yourself, but just in the ether ... he was a very good individual who actually developed continuously over the years and, you know, as I said, there was a new board that came in for all practical purposes in early 2009.  That internal auditor continued with the society as the head of internal audit for another, I think roughly, three years, until he decided to move to the UK.</p></speech>

I just want your comment on it.  "It exposes for the first time the way in which Fingleton was allowed to operate at will around the board table of Irish Nationwide, despite the society being chaired by an eminent professor of banking and being regularly micro-managed by the state's banking watchdog."  And we've seen, and others have referenced, letters from the regulator.  Many might argue - and this is what I want to put to you - that you, effectively, you or your status as a leading academic in terms of banking, that it provided cover, if you like, for some practices that were identified by the regulator over a period of six or seven years, most of which you were chairman of the board of the bank, which identified serious corporate governance issues within the bank, which didn't appear over that six or seven period ever to have been successfully addressed.  How would you respond?</p></speech>

If I actually look more realistically at things, you know, who did the regulator or the Central Bank or the Department of Finance choose to become the first chairman of the financial ombudsman's council?  They took somebody who was actually the vice chairman of the society.  Now, are you seriously trying to tell me that if the Central Bank or the regulator or the Department of Finance has serious concerns about the board or the governance within Irish Nationwide, that they would have appointed such a person as chairman?</p></speech>

In terms of the non-executive directors, quite frankly, the conduct of the Central Bank and the regulator made it virtually impossible to attract people.  It was only in, you know, kind of 2008, really, that it was possible because sort of game playing that had been going on at the annual general meeting for years, which the Central Bank could have cut out, decided not to cut out, made it ridiculously difficult to actually get people to join the board.  I mean, who ... I mean, you're all used to elections, but the reality is within the business community, why would I put my name or reputation on the line to actually go into what was effectively a complete bunfight at an annual general meeting in terms of who would actually get elected?  I mean if you go back and look at the conduct of those meetings, what was actually being required to be proposed, I mean, basically some of the proposals that were being required to be considered were to actually loosen lending standards.</p></speech>

You know, obviously, you know, we had sought to appoint what I'll describe as a chief operating officer in kind of late-2001 and I brought him in ... when I say "I", you know, the society had actually brought him in on the basis of the fact that, you know, "The society is likely to be sold, you know, in the next year because we're expecting the legislation, so we're going to take you on and actually give you a kind of a contract that protects you."</p> <p>  Unfortunately, for many reasons we probably don't need to go into here but that's a decision for yourselves, that appointment didn't actually work out.  Ultimately, there were requirements being imposed which the board couldn't accept.  Consequently, the board had to decide then "How do we go forward?"  And there were two ways to go forward.  One was to actually try to strengthen the management team around in terms of depth or, two, was to try and actually generate a new focal point.  My view at the time was you would ideally like to have got both.  On the other hand, you cannot impose a single individual into an organisation and consequently, given that you can't impose, you're better off actually building the management team, or the engine room of the place.</p></speech>

Can I start by asking you about KPMG's annual statutory duty confirmation letters to the Financial Regulator for each of the years 2004 to 2007, inclusive?  And they are in the booklets in Vol 1.  And they note instances of breaches and errors in each of the sectoral returns, prudential returns and large exposures reports made by INBS to the regulator.  Can I ask why, in your opinion, did these breaches occur and these errors?  In your view, in view of the fact that the breaches occurred repeatedly over a number of years, were they indicative of systemic weaknesses in the control and reporting environment within INBS?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-02a.1612" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090200002#NNN01200"><p>First of all, I think from the board's point of view it was a matter of extreme frustration that every single year there were issues that arose in terms of the reporting.  And the board was clearly never happy with that.  Equally well the board revisited that pretty much on an annual basis, particularly in relation to the LEx column - sorry, not the LEx column, the LEx report, sorry - because, you know, it was something that was obviously very important.  And consequently there were new systems put in place, new control systems put in place.  I would have to say that I would have thought round 2006 that we were getting the issue under control.  But the reality is that a lot of them re-arose again in 2007, and again that from a board point of view was clearly unacceptable.</p> <p>  Now, having said all that, it was the society who actually identified each of the issues.  And I suspect it was a mixture of the society and the regulator because there seemed to be - obviously it was an executive function, I wasn't close to it - but it seemed to be pretty much kind of continuous interaction between the society and the regulator in relation to that.  But I think every year, I mean, what gave me comfort, as a board member, a member of the audit committee or the chairman, was the fact that every year KPMG confirmed to the board that the society had already identified the issues, had already reported them to the regulator.</p></speech>

They shouldn't have occurred; they did occur.  They were of various magnitudes and KPMG felt at the time ... they were of the view that they should actually report them.  I am not sure from some discussion I had with a KPMG partner whether all organisations did the same thing where they had already identified and reported them to the regulator.</p></speech>

Absolutely no they shouldn't have occurred, but if you go to Project Harmony, Project Harmony which, you know, was there to actually do a detailed review of the society for the purpose of a sale, you know, it identified in that, I think, one loan which actually hadn't been approved.

What I can tell you is that any loan that came to the board always the question was asked, "Has it been approved by the credit committee?", and the answer was always "Yes".  Now, it is clear from some of the internal audit reports - and they were the internal audit reports actually done by the society's internal auditor, you know, obviously Deloitte did some reviews as well, but the society's own internal auditor reviewed these things and actually considered them.</p><p>Where the non-executive directors, you know, met with, as part of the audit committee work, the internal auditor and identified these issues, clearly there were remedies actually put in place and clearly there were undertakings from management.</p></speech>

He refers to when the board formally delegated powers "for the practical, effective and efficient management, promotion and development of the bank to the MD", that it was very unusual that that would be done "given its vague and general formulation [...] not immediately apparent what the limits to this empowerment were."  He makes a number of criticisms about the credit committee, the lack of a risk committee, the membership of the credit committee, for example, and a whole series of areas.</p></speech>

Everybody seems to have, kind of, page 1 of the minutes, which basically says, you know, "These are the powers delegated".  Nobody seems to have been given page 2, which says, "These are the reservation of powers to the board".  Now, I don't know why.  Obviously, there was a, kind of, probably, kind of, new management without the institutional recollection or history.  But the simple reality is ... from all the time I was there, as chairman, there was very clear powers of reserve to the board, there were clear authority levels and, from a board point of view, they were there, required and nobody had permission to actually go round them.</p></speech>

I'm going to move to wrap things up.  I just have one question to ask that remains outstanding.  I'll just wrap up with another question and then I'll invite the two final ... the leads in finally, Mr. Walsh, after which if there's any closing comments or remarks that you want to make yourself.</p><p>Mr. Walsh, did the level and tone of engagement with the Financial Regulator over the period of 2002 to 2008 cause any concerns at board level?  And I'll just go through just a sample of this.  March 2008, a letter from the regulator.  These are all section 33AK documents, so they won't be coming up on the screen.  Corporate governance arrangements in the society - this is on the first page of it.  Moving on to the next page - I'm just going to give an aggregate of these, okay - concerns raised related to the growth in the commercial loan book.  Then going on to 2004, another letter from the Financial Regulator - the Financial Services Regulator - stressed the need for an increase in the size of the board.  The same report goes on ... the Financial Services Regulator &quot;had concerns for some time with regard to the level of expertise and experience within INBS's Internal Audit function.&quot;  It then goes on as well with regard to the regulatory follow-up and capital adequacy requirements &quot;a significant shift in the nature and risk profile of INBS's business, particularly in the last couple of years.  INBS has moved from being a predominantly and broadly based residential mortgage lender to a commercial property lender.&quot;  And, then, going on to a ... even as far back as April 2002, another letter from the Central Bank talks about corporate governance once more, talks about the audit committee, seven meetings scheduled were adjourned due to pressure of time.  Also, &quot;There are no terms of reference in place for the committee.&quot; ... that's the ALCO committee.  Concerns with regard, again, to commercial lending &quot;that a substantial number of loans represented 100% loan to value[s].&quot;.  That's in the commercial lending.  In home loans, &quot;There was no evidence of stress testing on five of the files examined.&quot;  The same correspondence again talks about &quot;There has been a lack of progress made in implementing a risk-based methodology.&quot;  Then, returning back to 2006, another letter from the Financial Regulator, it talks about &quot;The Society should demonstrate how it [has] satisfied the Internal Audit function&quot; or:</p><blockquote>The Society should demonstrate how it is satisfied the Internal Audit function now has the expertise to perform its audit of [treasuries].  The Society should consider requesting an external audit [form] to oversee the Treasury Audit.</blockquote> <p>It then talks about minutes of close out meetings with auditors and auditees, &quot;The Head of [the] Internal Audit advised that [no] audit close out meetings [were] minuted.&quot;</p><p>And Irish Nationwide, again it talks about the inspectors noting that while some basic information in relation to Irish Nationwide Limited is contained in certain monthly reports, such as inflows and outflows, and in the management of accounts, there appears to be no specific discussions of its activities during the period reviewed by the inspectors.  This relates to minutes between May 2005 and April 2006.</p><p> Once again - I'll just conclude, there are more pages I could be going through - the terms of reference ... this is to do with the credit committee.  The terms of reference of the credit committee on page 2 need to be amended as they state that the committee can approve exposures up to &euro;500,000.  However, it is noted that the amounts approved were up to &euro;635,000 and the inspectors were informed that the terms of reference to the credit committee were being amended accordingly.</p><p> Mr. Walsh, were the changes proposed at board level to address these concerns of the regulator ... were the changes actually made?</p></speech>

Because I think we've talked about corporate governance and, really, the two areas of corporate governance were a bigger board and what I would describe as kind of a chief operating officer type situation.  You know, the board couldn't increase during a period of time for various different reasons.  As I think I may or may not have mentioned, the board would have always welcomed additional people.  You know, the board got permission from the regulator to actually approach Mr. Barron, former director general of the Central Bank, to come on the board.  Now, if one really believes that you are going to invite the Central Bank or the regulator on to the board in situations where they're not happy or you're not happy, or trying to keep anything from them, that would absolutely not be the case.  The society ran with absolute and complete transparency with the Central Bank, with the regulator, and always had a good relationship.  I mean, it was very disappointing when Mr. Barron decided he wasn't going to come on to the board but that was his choice.  The practical reality is if we were trying to fight against the regulator or the Central Bank, we wouldn't have done it.  And just to put the thing in context, when Dr. Power resigned, the regulator got in touch to thank him for all his work and efforts.  When I resigned, they did the same.  So people are beginning to rewrite the history for whatever purposes.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh, this inquiry, in preparing for its public hearings, gathered hundreds of thousands of documents.  For today's hearings regarding INBS, documents from the Financial Regulator's office consistently and repetitively over many years expressed concerns regarding corporate governance, senior management resources, lending expertise appropriate to your business strategy, issues on regulatory reporting and control, lack of experience in the quality of internal auditor resources and so on and so forth.  Having listened to your contribution today, is it your opinion here today that these documents are consistently and repetitively wrong?</p></speech>

I mean, from the society's point of view and from the board's point of view, if you get correspondence from the regulator, you actually see it as a menu that you are going to actually use almost as a checklist for things that are going to be done.  Now, you don't take it absolutely on the basis of they're 100% right, you're 100% wrong.  That's not the way life actually works.  You know, there were practical difficulties in some areas and, you know, where there were practical difficulties, you'd actually end up discussing them with ... in my case, I would've primarily been ... kind of, Maurice O'Connell in the early days, or Dr. Reilly or Mr. Neary in the later days.  But you would actually recognise what needed to be done, what could be done.  You also had to recognise where the society was at any point in time.  I mean, I think there was one particular letter that came in, was it March 2007, which was all about, you know, you need to increase your board and your management.  Now, you know, in March 2007, where was the society?  It was actually in the process of being sold.  It was in discussion with, amongst others, GE and, you know, Hypo, but there were a number of other people as well ... probably haven't been mentioned yet and probably shouldn't be.</p><p>If you're in the business of actually selling the society over the next number of months you're not going to put in place new directors or new management, because the first thing that's going to happen once the acquisition is completed, the person or the company who actually buys the society is going to make their own decisions on who should be on the board, who should be the executive, who should be at whatever level it happens to be.  And to try and actually bring people in, in a framework where you're doing that, is actually completely counterproductive.</p></speech>

I'd just like to follow on.  The Financial Regulator first, well, wrote to you in December '04 noting its concerns about resources at senior level and so on.  Are you saying ... you've just given us the explanation as to why nobody might have been added in 2007, because there were negotiations with banks.  Are you saying now that that was the same in 2004 and this was a consistent state of being for the organisation?  I mean, it sounds like an extraordinary, convenient situation not to be able to appoint anyone, because the Financial Regulator kept asking you to do something about it.</p></speech>

There was credit risk ... I can't remember precisely what they were, but I think there is a list of four or five actual individuals who'd been appointed.  And, that's why I go back to, you know, there's a real danger that everybody sort of says, you know, this was a one-person organisation.  Now, within my statement I've actually given you an organisation diagram there and that actually identifies the different areas that are there, the different actual people involved, the size of the teams involved.  I don't remember offhand what the size of the different teams are, but I mean the reality is there was a process of continuous recruitment.  Now, what there wasn't was new appointments to the board and what there wasn't was a chief operating officer.</p></speech>

I mean, to be absolutely clear, first of all, as I say everybody expected, including myself, including the regulator, the society would be sold in 2007.  It was abundantly clear that, you know, the society would not be sold once you hit the beginnings of the global liquidity crisis.  The next day, when I actually went to the regulator in whatever date it was in December of 2007, I said, "Look, the society is not going to be sold.  In that context, we need to actually increase the management team, increase the actual board."</p></speech>

Now, you know, that means that ultimately there has to be a surplus, which actually comes back to the taxpayer.  How that surplus comes back, whether it's part of the gain that the Central Bank has actually reported separately in terms of the promissory notes or what the situation is, I couldn't tell you, but I mean ... as I say, the society was very simple.  It had two books - it had a commercial loan book and it had a residential loan book.  We know precisely what happened to the commercial loan book, irrespective of how we actually argue or justify or believe in the NAMA transfers.  So, that gives you a situation where, if you assume all the NAMA transfers are correct and NAMA made no money in relation to those loans after they were transferred, then you end up with a figure of around &euro;3.8 billion plus, as Deputy O'Donnell said, whatever the losses were on the residential book.  Now, I don't know what the losses were on that.  I know some of the book was actually sold at a premium to Bank of Ireland.  I am sure some of it was actually sold at a loss elsewhere.  It'd depend on the timing of the sale of those books as to what would have actually happened.  Equally well, as I indicated to Deputy O'Donnell, there was a liquidity management exercise which saved, roughly speaking, &euro;0.3 billion and then whatever was made, if anything, on the sale of the deposit book.</p></speech>

I quote:</p><blockquote>Walsh [you, Mr. Walsh] made his strongest argument in favour of a merger with Anglo Irish.  This was the plan he had already privately discussed with its chief executive, Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, a close friend for twenty years.  Anglo Irish, Walsh said, already knew many of Irish Nationwide's clients and had the expertise to manage them.  However, the bank would need a state guarantee to protect it from any negative consequences.  'In effect, the State will have to guarantee Anglo at the same time.'  He warned [that is you].</blockquote> <p>Finally:</p><blockquote>In short, Walsh was arguing that in order to save Irish Nationwide the state should take on the much heavier burden of rescuing Anglo Irish.  Having completely failed to prevent the society going mad during the boom, Walsh was now proposing that the state should be prepared to accept every risk taken not only by Irish Nationwide but also by Anglo Irish.  It was catastrophic advice, capable of bankrupting the entire country.</blockquote> <p>Is this factual?</p></speech>

What actually happened, and you know I have actually touched on it already, on the Sunday evening of 7 September I got a phone call from Con Horan.  As I say, I was in the society that evening because of the situation and the fragility of the markets.  Basically, I was meeting at that time with Goldman Sachs and the clear direction from the regulator was that I should organise to meet with Anglo Irish.  That was a direction that I got.  When I say "direction", it was a phone conversation; it wasn't a written direction, obviously.  Basically, the reason he was telling me to do that was because they had been looking at a contingency plan, as you know, with AIB and Bank of Ireland that hadn't operated.  Apparently, Anglo had contacted the regulator to say that they might represent a solution.  I was slightly surprised, but nonetheless the regulator wanted me to meet them.  I accordingly organised to meet them the next morning.  Having met them, I did a briefing paper for the regulator setting out the options as I saw them at that point in time.  I met the regulator, discussed that options paper.  I then revised and adjusted that at the regulator's request and submitted it to the Department of Finance.  That paper is in the public domain.  It was released I think at some stage as part of some of - I think - the disclosures in relation to the month of September and the night of the guarantee.  I did not advocate the merger with Anglo.  I certainly didn't advocate any situation where, shall we say, the State would take on the combined liability.  That is a complete misrepresentation of the situation.  What I actually advocated was that the society would continue as an independent entity with whatever changes the Government obviously wanted to make and to continue to operate the policy it had adopted the previous December, which was to wind down the society in a gradual and controlled fashion, which was what I felt was best for the society and best from a national point of view.</p><p>Anglo had a different agenda clearly.  They wanted to be seen as the people who were rescuing the system because they had a belief that if they were seen to take over the society that they would be viewed as being systemic.  They were very different to Nationwide; they didn't have depositors.  You know, we had, I think, 180,000 depositors made up of residential, business as well as the commercial.  They were purely commercial.  We obviously had a large deposit book; they didn't have the deposit book.  We had a large amount of liquidity; they were out of cash.</p></speech>

You know, just to reiterate, I do deeply regret the events that occurred and their impact on Ireland but I think the purpose of this committee is for you to actually consider what to do going forward.  Key groups in Ireland saw the problems or foresaw the problems that were coming about.  The stress tests in the Central Bank, you had the NTMA expressing views, even Irish Nationwide was expressing a view in December '07.  The domestic standing group started working in January 2008 to actually generate solutions, possible solutions, etc.  But as everybody here now knows, we ended up in September 2008 without really a clear view of where we were actually going.  And I think, Chairman, you've got to consider what would have happened if we avoided the growth that took place in 2007, even if we only saw the problems to the end of 2006.</p> <p>  As a minimum, there'd have been &euro;70 billion less money lent into the Irish market.  I think there was about 100,000 additional mortgages taken out, so additional families actually probably in negative equity today.  Given the results of the stress tests, you would have required every institution, or should have required every institution, to get more capital.  I think you've heard from the former Attorney General, there was no bank resolution legislation actually in place.  That could have been put in place.  It could have helped Europe in place, whatever.  Now, who knows if that action had been taken at the end of 2006 how much less damage could have been done?  And I think that in terms of your recommendations, what you have to think about is how do you actually remove the silo mentality that exists.  I think one of your witnesses said we weren't prepared to share information until September - it took the Reuters story.  I have no idea what the correct solution is but you have to recognise that there would be a very different situation if, at the end of 2006, you had brought together the key players in the public sector or the private sector and actually tried to find out what was the best thing to do for the country.</p> <p>  So I think, in terms of you framing your views, your recommendations, you have to think about that.  I said I deeply regret I didn't see the problems much earlier.  If I had, hopefully, I would have taken the right decisions earlier but I didn't.  I apologise unreservedly for that but I think if we want to avoid the same problems occurring again, you've got to think about how you actually avoid that, sort of, silo-type thinking.  Thank you.</p></speech>

I wish to begin by thanking the committee for inviting me to attend to give evidence at the inquiry.  I also wanted to express my sincere regret to everyone who suffered as a result of the demise of INBS.</p> <p>  My role in INBS was very diverse and I was engaged in a wide variety of functions on a daily basis.  Whilst I was heavily involved in reporting, treasury, retail deposits, IT systems and compliance, I was not involved in the lending function outside my role on the board.</p> <p>  Up to the crisis, INBS was successful.  Profits increased year on year and the society grew accordingly.  During the period leading up to the crash, much of the focus of the society and a huge amount of my time was taken up with demutualisation.  The members hoped to gain a windfall profit from the demutualisation and sale of the society and the board worked extremely hard to put the apparatus in place for demutualisation.  This involved the production, in 2007, by KPMG of a vendor's due diligence report which provided a detailed snapshot of INBS at that time.  The report was provided to the Central Bank.</p> <p>  The strategy of the society, including demutualisation, developed over a long period of time.  In terms of lending, as time progressed it became apparent that the residential market was overly competitive and margins were diminishing.  Tracker mortgages, which INBS did not market, were commonplace.  During the years 2004 to 2007, INBS, AIB, Anglo Irish, Bank of Ireland, Bank of Scotland, EBS, Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank lent heavily in the commercial-residential sectors.  All of the institutions suffered extraordinary losses as a result of that lending.  A combination of the availability of funding, low interest rates, increased competition, Government policy - including tax incentives for development - and rising property prices caused a surge in lending.</p> <p>  INBS's strategy was to increase lending in the UK.  The UK property market did not collapse in the same way as the Irish market and the London market improved in the aftermath of the economic crisis.  Over 50% of the loan book which transferred to NAMA related to assets outside Ireland.  Consequently, I believe that the INBS assets transferred to NAMA were significantly undervalued.</p> <p>  INBS developed a strategy over time which involved lending to clients who had a proven track record.</p><p>Towards the end of 2007, it became clear that liquidity was tightening.  The board decided to cease new lending in December 2007 when other institutions continued to lend anew, and this was the right strategy at that time.</p><p> By September 2008, INBS's liquidity was coming under pressure due to a credit rating downgrade and an inaccurate report on INBS by Reuters.  The regulator arranged, at short notice, a meeting on Sunday, 7 September 2008 with AIB and BOI to discuss the possibility of the provision by AIB and BOI of a standby facility for INBS.  INBS's liquidity on 7 September was about &euro;3.5 billion and information was provided to the meeting at short notice on liquidity, funding liabilities and the maturity of funding liabilities.  The meeting concluded without any agreement to progress the provision of a standby facility.  Had the matter progressed, any additional information required not brought to the "at short notice meeting" would have been provided.</p><p> Towards the end of 2009, Ernst and Young began an investigation into legacy issues at INBS.  I gave Ernst and Young every assistance required.  The investigation ultimately led to the initiation of legal proceedings against the "old board" for the losses of the society.  IBRC and INBS formally accepted in the pleadings in the proceedings that there was no dishonesty whatsoever on my part.</p><p> The proceedings represented an attempt by IBRC to make the directors personally liable for the losses of the society.  A central plank of the claim was the allegation by the plaintiffs that the delegation of powers by the board of the society to Michael Fingleton was excessive.  On legal advice, I joined the Central Bank to the proceedings as a third party because they had approved the delegation of powers to Mr. Fingleton.</p><p> Given the extraordinary magnitude of the claim - for up to &euro;6 billion - I entered into a confidential settlement with the special liquidators after a mediation process.  The terms of the settlement are confidential.  I can say that the settlement involved no admission of liability on my part.  I paid a sum personally to the plaintiffs for the benefit of the State.</p><p> Separately, the E and Y investigation led to administrative sanctions proceedings being initiated against me by the Central Bank as far back as 2011.  A notice of inquiry was issued on 9 July 2015 and I would ask the committee to be cognisant of the fact that I am the subject of that inquiry, pursuant to which punitive sanctions could be imposed on me by the Central Bank.  I really can&rsquo;t understand how the Central Bank can purport to investigate me in relation to events for which they bear responsibility.  That is the subject of legal proceedings.</p><p> I am not aware of any civil proceedings or any administrative sanctions having been initiated against the management of any other bank or building society as a result of the crash.  I can't see how there is any benefit to the public in INBS being investigated and pursued on the double, when institutions which subsist have not been the subject of any serious investigation, inquiry or proceedings.</p><p> I will now address areas I have been asked to consider.</p><p> Financial reporting and accounting rules.  INBS&rsquo;s financial reporting system was designed to meet regulatory and management information needs.  The system was developed over the years to accommodate new accounting standards and additional reporting requirements.</p><p> The new accounting standards reduced INBS's loan loss provisions in 2005, and resulted in low provisioning while the property market remained strong.  In addition, the solvency ratio was boosted by unrealised surpluses in good economic times and then reduced sharply in the downturn.</p><p> INBS's business model was commercial and residential property lending to experienced people in Ireland and the UK.  The model evolved over time due to competitive pressures and lower margins in the residential lending market.  INBS's loan book was concentrated and significant amounts of new lending was repeat business with existing customers.  </p><p> INBS was funded in equal amounts from customer accounts and the wholesale market.  INBS's treasury function was operated in a risk-averse manner with the emphasis on maintaining safe, readily available liquid assets.  The funds raised on the wholesale market extended the maturity profile of borrowings.  INBS sought to eliminate interest rate and exchange rate risk through swap agreements.  </p><p> INBS had sought to enhance the effectiveness of internal audit by recruiting more staff, together with training and improvements to internal audit systems.  KPMG carried out a report on internal audit in 2005.  KPMG also produced a strategic performance review of internal audit in 2008.  INBS engaged Deloitte to carry out internal audits on the IT function, treasury and commercial lending.  Internal audit had a direct reporting line to the chair of the audit committee.  The internal auditor met non-executive directors without executives being present.  Internal audit had a documented internal audit charter which set out the purpose of internal audit, the scope of internal audit work, reporting lines, responsibility, standards and authority.  Internal audit had a documented internal audit policies and procedures manual.  That, Chairman, concludes my address.</p></speech>

Sorry for delaying you earlier.  INBS's annual report for 2007 shows that over the period '02 to '07, profit before tax increased by 303% and total assets by 190%.  Do you think that these levels of growth were prudent or sustainable in the context of the level of competition in the Irish lending market during this period?</p></speech>

Some institutions may well have expanded more than Irish Nationwide.  Irish Nationwide's expansion in that period was also ... resulted from lending in the UK, where we lent to experienced people, mainly in the London market.  I think at that time, it was not considered unusual, although it was fairly strong growth.</p></speech>

The Nyberg report states:</p><blockquote>INBS&rsquo;s overarching driver [and I touched on this earlier with you] was demutualisation and sale.  This was frequently expressed by management, the Board and INBS members and was expected to result in a cash windfall for all parties.  As the value of INBS would dictate the size of the windfall, it is noteworthy that the bank&rsquo;s most significant growth spurt was during the years leading up to the expected demutualisation.</blockquote> <p>And that&rsquo;s page 24 of the Nyberg report.  In your opinion, did the desire on the part of management to maximise the value of INBS result in the adoption of poorer lending practices or more lax lending practices, or did it lead specifically to the growth in the UK?</p></speech>

Our letter of 9 December 2004 set out our concerns regarding the significant shift in the nature and risk profile of INBS' business towards commercial property lending.</blockquote> <p>In the same letter the Financial Regulator continues to outline similar concerns raised in '06, '07 and '08.

During the period '01 to '03, INBS increased its level of commercial lending by over 60%.  This was a source of concern for the regulator that the society did not have the appropriate skill sets or controls to place ... in place to effectively manage this level of exposure and this level of increase.  By September '08, 80% of INBS's loan book was in commercial property and 81% of its land and exposure was in speculative property activities.  Do you think this was an appropriate lending strategy for INBS as a building society?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-02a.1854" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Stanley Purcell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090200002#NNNN00800"><p>Well, INBS at that stage, although it was a building society, was moving towards seeking to have legislation that would allow it demutualise and engage in trade sale.  So, it wasn't the sort of a situation whereby for years we were always going to be a pure mutual.  We were moving in certain direction.  We were in a market that was very competitive.  I think as people have referred earlier, that the home loans market got very competitive in 1999 and it had been competitive before that.  Banks, both foreign and domestic, were vying strongly for residential business.  INBS had moved gradually away from dependency on residential so we were in the commercial market.  We had worked with clients over a number years.  Many of those had expanded with the market and we had expanded with them.  So, at the time, there was probably a surge in lending generally anyway from what was before.  So, we were a part of that.</p></speech>

I was surprised and I felt that, as I said there, that the UK loans were somewhat undervalued.  And I felt that maybe from, you know, things I heard later and that, a lot of those loans were repaid in full, despite a large discount.</p></speech>

Why did these breaches and errors occur?</p></speech>

Generally, they were prepared by a competent person, reviewed by another and subject to further review.  We were conscious that we were at all times trying to do everything perfectly as regards regulatory returns and we were disappointed whenever any error occurred.  Now some of the errors were larger, some of them were smaller.  But the errors occurred because we'd a fairly tight timetable.  After we had done the returns we continued checking and a lot of that checking would have brought up something that was not found earlier, and we would immediately adjust the return and we would inform the regulator of every mistake, every adjustment, every error, be it large or small.  Some of the errors occurred due to mistakes, maybe a coding error in loans which we copped when we did further checking.  Some of them were ... there was a lot of volume, maybe, happening and something slipped through or else there was some classification that wasn't clear and that we maybe went to the regulator or the regulator went to us about it.  But we did take every precaution to ensure that they were done to the highest standard, and it was disappointing for me and the people working with me who were doing those returns that errors occurred.  But it wasn't for the want of effort, changing systems and reviews.</p></speech>

I, that is correct, Deputy, they did and as I said, I was very disappointed at the time.  And I think there is a mention there in the ...

We brought in additional checking.  All I can say is that some errors kept ... persisted.  But some of those errors were small; some of them were caught by us but we reported every error, be it large or small, immediately, and I think KPMG acknowledge that in the letter.</p></speech>

In particular it lacks the depth of experience necessary to challenge the areas of key risk, which includes Treasury and Commercial Lending.</blockquote> <p>In the 2008 management letter, KPMG stated, &quot;the Society's Internal Audit department needs to build up its experience and training in order to perform reviews of key risk areas which are currently outsourced to a third party service provider&quot;.</p><p>Similar concerns were raised in '04, with the Financial Regulator concluding:</p><blockquote>The level of resources in this area are deemed to be inadequate ... The FSR has concerns with regard to the level of expertise and experience which exists in the IA function.</blockquote><p>The Financial Regulator concerns expressed in '07 echo this sentiment.

We were conscious that work had to be done.  We had a new acting internal auditor and we were conscious that we needed to review that area, and we asked KPMG to produce a report and to work with us.  And KPMG produced that report.  As a result of it, there was ... they were involved in mentoring the internal auditor.  They also conducted workshops with the internal audit committee and the ... we would have increased the staffing level, we would've increased training internal audit and we would've purchased systems for them.  In addition to that, we brought in Deloitte to do a number of audits there - treasury, IT and commercial lending.  So we were working, during that time, to bring internal audit to a higher level.</p></speech>

I'll just move on, Mr. Purcell.  In KPMG's corporate governance review in '08 it states:</p><blockquote>Board packs are very detailed and at times lack clarity and structure.

Sometimes I was able to maybe put a paper in about something beforehand but generally I gave a verbal report on the accounts.  There was a lot of information provided to the board and the board pack grew over the years because what would happen is somebody would say, "Well, you know, I want a report on something" ... "Well, you know, do it every quarter, do it every month."  So there was a sort of a growth in it that people were used to.  They didn't ... sometimes didn't want me to excise reports, you know, they wanted it left there and maybe, after a while, there was a lot of stuff there.  But the board members were able to work through it, and probably it was a good recommendation at the time that the thing be looked at again.</p></speech>

I was discussing the matter with the internal auditor and I think we concluded that the way Irish Nationwide was doing it wasn&rsquo;t the way everyone else was doing it and that maybe ... it was time, maybe, to change the system.  And it was a good time to do it because we weren&rsquo;t lending anew, we were trying to cut back on lending.

We had raised a lot of money on ... from retail deposits.  We had brought in a mortgage-backed promissory note programme.  We were working on its securitisation.  And, in September, even though things were very fraught, there was an increase in the deposit guarantee amount around 20 September.  So we were looking at the credit crunch probably would persist for a while, but people's perspective wasn't that it would go for as long and as deep.  So we expected that we would be able to return to the markets in 2009.</p></speech>

But where we were at the end of September was we did have a good amount of liquidity.  We had probably over &euro;3 billion.  When the deposit protection scheme was increased, it did reduce outflows.  I mean I think that's mentioned in some reports as well.  So it was hard to know what way things were going.

One review in July 2008 covering the period of January to June '08 and the second in January '09 covering the period July to December 2008.  And the internal audit's findings note that the frequency of meetings declined as the year went on to the point where, in the opinion of internal audit, the credit committee is not meeting with enough frequency to fulfil all of its duties.</p><p>Can you comment on that?

Mr. Purcell, in the Project Harmony report, it would show that the society had a concentration of loans in the higher risk development sector, a concentration of loans in the higher loan-to-value bands, a concentration in its customer base - the top 30 commercial customers, for example, accounted for 53% of the total commercial loan book - and a concentration in sources of supplemental arrangement fees, representing 48% of profit in 2006.  Indeed, 73% of those fees came from just nine customers.  Did the board ever consider or did they become concerned or did they discuss those levels of concentrations and the correlation between them and whether or not they could increase the risk to the society's business model?</p></speech>

The board were also aware of the nature of our business, that we, Irish Nationwide, had repeat business with experienced developers.

I am referring here to a document actually from Brendan McDonagh to William Beausang and it talks about repayments that you would have to make of &euro;630 million at the end of November and then on into 2009 there would be another &euro;1.5 billion payable, and I&rsquo;m just wondering how did that arise that those, that there was so much to be repaid?</p></speech>

Say, for example, we would have raised money, generally in lumps, and at different maturities, so some years you might have a small amount, a relatively small amount, and other you might have chunkier amounts.</p></speech>

Now, leaving the Reuters issue aside, Mr. Purcell, why was there such concern in many quarters about the viability of INBS or the need for liquidity support because both Mr. Fingleton and Mr. Walsh in their opening statements stressed that INBS had sufficient liquidity at that time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-02a.2094" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Stanley Purcell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090200002#WWWW00100"><p>Yes, at that time we had between &euro;3.5 billion and &euro;4 billion in liquid assets and our liquid assets were liquid.  I mean, they were readily available.  They were short-term deposits with large European banks.  However, the initiative as regards the stand-by: it came from the Financial Regulator and the Financial Regulator came up with the idea, probably in the light of the threat to liquidity and the threat of maybe increased withdrawals as a result of the Reuters report.</p></speech>

Because, for example, the Department of Finance had secretly or quietly put on the stocks legislation for the nationalisation of an institution like yours.</p></speech>

I heard that, yes, earlier in ... from the inquiry.  Well, I mean, there was - how would I put it - there was a lot of concern probably in the summer of 2008.</p></speech>

And if I could refer to the Goldman Sachs report that was done into INBS.  This is in documentation that has been many times in front of the committee but we have it up in front of us there, Mr. Purcell.  And if you see that line of the total loan book, &euro;11.7 billion, and then their mark-to-market analysis going from 69 ... best mark 69% of the loan book to the worst mark 42%, which equates to &euro;8.1 billion or &euro;4.7 billion worst.  Quite clearly on those figures, INBS was not solvent.</p> <p>  And if I might then refer to a similar diagram from Merrill Lynch, presentation to the National Treasury Management Agency, 26 September 2008, and then on the right ... top right-hand side, Mr. Purcell, you&rsquo;ll see their summary is INBS has &euro;11.7 billion of loans, "Writedowns of 30% &ndash; 60% results in an impairment of &euro;3.6 bn &ndash; &euro;7 bn".  In other words, figures remarkably similar to Goldman Sachs'.  And then the very next line is the liquidity of &euro;3 billion to the end of 2008.  On that basis, INBS is not solvent.  Now how can you square these figures, plus the concerns that emerged about the liquidity, as opposed to what Mr. Fingleton and Mr. Walsh have assured us?</p></speech>

You know, they would be setting out best case, worst case, medium cases.  At that time all options and all eventualities were being explored.  It was people looking at what might happen.</p></speech>

The Financial Regulator sent a letter in December 2004 noting its ongoing concerns with the level of resources at senior and executive management level within Nationwide.  These concerns were repeated in a further letter in March 2008.  Can you explain why the regulator's concerns were not addressed and no apparent effort was made to strengthen the board of the senior management to the satisfaction of the regulator over the period stretching at least six years?</p></speech>

It felt it was doing good business with experienced people, much of it repeat business and, as a background to that, we were recruiting people in relation to aspects of loan.

With an earlier question there that I put to Mr. Walsh when he was in earlier - and I can pull up the document again - I think that figure of &euro;635,000 you mention seems to ring a familiarity with ... that the sum should have been &pound;0.5 million but ... the ... in a report by the regulator, there was actually a comment about a sum of that size.  So was that sum actually beyond the scope?  Is that the same sum that's being discussed?</p></speech>

Irish Nationwide, if I'm correct, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, operated on a basis that they gave 100% funding but on the basis that they would get a proportion or a profitability on what they were giving the loan on.

I concluded with a question to Mr. Walsh earlier, Mr. Purcell, and I'd put the same question to you.  And that is, Mr. Purcell, that this inquiry, in preparing for the public hearings, gathered hundreds of thousands of documents.  For today's hearing regarding INBS, documents from the Financial Regulator's office consistently and repetitively over many years expressed concerns regarding corporate governance, senior management resources, lending expertise appropriate to your business strategy, direction of the society's overall business model and the associated control framework, issues on the regulatory reporting and control - and, I think, in your own engagement this evening, which, as you admit, were a source of continuing disappointment to you - and also the lack of experience in the quality of internal audited resources.</p><p>Having listened to your contribution this evening, Mr. Purcell, is it your opinion, as we come to close these proceedings, that these documents are consistently and repetitively wrong?</p></speech>

They brought up concerns following inspections and, in all cases, we worked to resolve the issues.  For example, we worked to upgrade internal audit in all aspects of its operation.  So, when you look at them all together there is a long list there, but they came up over a number of years and we would have worked to resolve each one as well as we could at the time.  And many of them resulted in systems and processes being upgraded to a good standard.  Some of them about recruiting directors, there was reasons why it was delayed and for other reasons.</p></speech>
