    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018011700002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I welcome this opportunity to undertake legislative scrutiny of the Waste Reduction Bill in advance of Committee Stage.  There has been delay from the Second Stage debate to now, which I regret.  We are looking at different ways in which we could do the detailed analysis, but we have really benefited from the work of the legal advisory service and the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  The reference and research work they have done has been really helpful and useful.  We have just had a presentation from them in private session, and I look forward to engaging with everyone here today.  </p> <p>  A number of other developments in the interim since Second Stage have, to my mind, copperfastened the case for the Bill and for a certain speed and urgency in having it implemented.  I cite first of all, and I am not sure if the Chair has had a chance to read it yet, the strategy paper published by the European Commission, "A European strategy for plastics in a circular economy".  In my mind, it is a defining document in setting European policy for the next ten years.  On a regular basis, the document refers to the sort of provisions contained in our Bill and recommends them as part of fitting in within the new European packaging and circular economy directives that are coming our way.</p> <p>  It is an excellent overview for anyone who has an interest in the subject.  There are endless figures that could be plucked from it, but I refer to the analysis looking to the five best deposit and refund schemes, along the lines of what we are proposing, that indicates that they work.  In countries where they have such schemes, they get a 94% recycling rate for plastic bottles.  </p> <p>  Timely for our own work was the introduction by the Chinese government, as it promised last July via the World Trade Organisation, WTO, of an end to the importation of what it calls foreign garbage.  I imagine Europe and Ireland are some of the highest percentage exporters of our plastic recycling to China of what is an ill-segregated and often contaminated waste stream.  China is no longer accepting this and it means our whole approach will have to change because of the reality that we face.  I also present to the committee a very useful analysis by the UK government.  Only last week it presented a whole new plastic strategy which is in tune with the European approach, whatever else happens with Brexit.  I refer the committee to the work of the UK committee which, back in December, made a very clear recommendation to introduce in the UK economy, which is a very similar and has similar circumstances, the sort of measures included in our waste reduction scheme.  </p> <p>  I notice with interest IBEC and Repak looking to keep everything as it is and arguing that we are just great.  This Bill is important in terms of the deposit refund scheme and how we deal with disposal single use coffee cups and so on.  However, it should be part of a wider change of our entire Repak industry scheme as is also recommended by the UK parliamentary committee.  It recognises that it is completely outdated to have a single price in terms of that industry scheme.  A differentiated and designed scheme in the UK has to a much more sophisticated, advanced and appropriate marketing or management of the whole plastics waste stream.  I also refer to the Blue Planet series on the BBC just before Christmas, a remarkable television production.  At the core of it, David Attenborough had an absolute plea to policymakers, similar to our responsibility here, to start addressing marine pollution and plastic pollution in the environment.  This is again picked up by the European Union and others.  </p> <p>  I have two other points.</p><p>I will cite some evidence.  There was a group outside the Oireachtas today calling for action on this issue.  A group of people went to Dunmore Strand in Sligo yesterday and picked up what was on the beach.  They collected this bag of rubbish.  The same could be done on any beach in the country.  If one goes to any river, canal or street in Ireland and starts looking for waste, one is sure to find a similar amount, by volume if not by weight.  Everyone realises and sees that.  The public are fed up with the level of waste in their environment.  Irish people are very good at recycling and have taken to it in terms of the usage of green bins, but they are increasingly and rightfully suspicious that the authorities and those managing that system are not being honest with them in terms of where the waste is going and how it is managed and are not being ambitious or matching the public ambition for an end to the culture of the wasteful and throwaway use of plastic.  This Bill is an important step toward changing that culture.  More than anything else, it will change the minds of the public through going back to measures such as the deposit refund schemes that I saw implemented as a child and that will change the public connection to this issue, which is one of the biggest gains we could get from the Bill.  I look forward to the question and answer session in due course.</p></speech>

I call our first witness, Mr. Matthew Collins, assistant secretary of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, who has five minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Collins" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018011700002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chair and members for the invitation to participate in the detailed scrutiny of the Waste Reduction Bill 2017.  It is reasonable to say that all of us broadly share concerns about waste.  We are all aware of incidents of illegal dumping or fly-tipping locations in parts of rural Ireland or streets in our towns and cities.  Similarly, we are gravely concerned that over one million tonnes of food waste is disposed of each year in Ireland, around one third of which comes from households.  Every household in Ireland is responsible for one tonne of food waste and the cost per household varies between &euro;400 and &euro;1,000 per year.  We may have different views on which issue should be prioritised, as well as the best way to tackle those issues.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, has welcomed the Waste Reduction Bill introduced by Deputy Ryan, along with a number of other bills addressing this issue.  However, he asked for the Bill to be referred to the committee for detailed scrutiny because he has some concerns around the provisions.  I would like to take the opportunity to outline some of those concerns.  The Bill suggests two approaches for dealing with single use plastics: a ban on non-compostable plastic cups, glasses and tableware; and the introduction of a deposit and return scheme for drinks containers.  It should be noted by the committee that from a national and EU legislative perspective, plastic cups, glasses and drinks containers are packaging and consequently are subject to regulation by the European Union (Packaging) Regulations 2014 - SI 282/2014 - and the EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/EU.</p> <p>  Before dealing with the specifics of the Deputy&rsquo;s two proposals, it is useful to put them into Ireland's policy context.  Our national approach to date for dealing with waste packaging has been based around the extended producer responsibility, EPR, principle as set out in European legislation.  EPR seeks to ensure that the producer of a product bears a significant proportion of the cost of dealing with the waste management of the product they supply.  In Ireland, this has been done very effectively through a producer-funded compliance scheme operated by Repak.  Similar schemes operate in other waste streams such as waste electronic and electrical goods, batteries, farm plastics and, most recently, end-of-life vehicles and tyres.  In a review of EPR schemes carried out in 2014 for the Department, it was concluded that Ireland has achieved great success in recent years in recovering and recycling packaging waste and one of the key reasons for that success was the shared responsibility approach to packaging waste.  In its most recent bulletin on waste packaging statistics for Ireland, the EPA found that Ireland met and exceeded all EU targets for recovery and recycling.  Of the estimated almost 980,000 tonnes of packaging waste generated in 2015, some 91% was recovered and the majority of that was recycled.  </p> <p>  As regards the provision requiring the Minister to ban disposable, non-compostable plastic cups and glasses, the Minister has requested the committee to scrutinise this part of the Bill as it is his understanding that such a ban may be in contravention of Article 18 of the EU Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste, which states: &ldquo;Member States shall not impede the placing on the market of their territory of packaging which satisfies the provisions of this Directive."  In considering this proposal, the committee may be interested to know that France tried to introduce a ban similar to that proposed, which is supposed to come into effect in 2020.  The original idea when the law was adopted was to cover all single-use plastic cups, glasses and plates.  However, the Commission pointed out that in some circumstances those items were considered as packaging when sold full with food or drink.  This meant that the scope has been refined in France to all tableware falling out of the scope of the packaging and packaging waste directive.  In practice, the result is that the ban only concerns packages of empty plastic tableware that one would buy at the supermarket and became known as the "picnic tax&rdquo;.  The Minister also had concerns that the proposed ban needed to be scrutinised to consider whether it is in breach of the free movement provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. </p> <p>  In recommending scrutiny of the legislation to the committee, the Minister suggested that a levy might be a better approach in light of these reasons.  The plastic bag levy has worked very well in terms of behavioural change and this might be a possible approach to limit the volume of single-use containers being used.  Environmental levies are not about revenue generation but are designed to encourage behavioural change and this might be an excellent way to deal with the issues raised.  The committee may like to consider that further.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, packaging in Ireland is subject to a successful producer compliance scheme.  As part of the review of the scheme in 2014, a wider examination of issues was undertaken and consideration was given to the introduction of a bring-back scheme for waste.  The review report did not recommend its introduction because it concluded that to establish such a scheme was inappropriate in view of the operation of the existing packaging scheme.  On Second Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, the Minister indicated that although he was not convinced of the merits of introducing a deposit and return scheme in Ireland for the reasons outlined, he was not averse to considering a review, similar to that under way in Scotland.  The ongoing work in Scotland is of particular interest given that it currently operates a producer responsibility scheme.  A feasibility study based on practice overseas, previous relevant studies, and stakeholder consultations identified how a scheme could work in Scotland and the possible set-up and administration costs involved.   It gave a total estimated cost of a deposit and return scheme of &pound;78 million sterling or about &euro;88 million.  With such significant suggested costs, any scrutiny of this proposal would, at a minimum, need to consider how much the installation and running of a deposit and return scheme would cost; how it should operate; who should operate it; what steps would be needed to provide the necessary infrastructure; what the likely benefits would be; and how it could be made compatible with our existing initiatives.</p></speech>

We will have a further opportunity to discuss the matter, and if there are issues he wishes to raise, he can do so during the engagement with members.  I want to keep within our time constraints.</p> <p>  Our next witness is Dr. Tom Ryan of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018011700002#E00500"><p>On behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address this important issue.  As the committee is aware, the EPA&rsquo;s mission is to protect and improve our environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland and to protect against the harmful effects of radiation and pollution.  A substantial area of EPA activity in achieving that mission is the collection and statutory reporting of national waste statistics and the development and implementation of the national waste prevention programme.</p> <p>  In the context of national waste statistics, the Waste Reduction Bill proposes to target waste streams that are classified as packaging waste.  The EPA reports national statistics on this waste stream on an annual basis to the European Commission.  In 2015, over 980,000 tonnes of packaging waste was generated in Ireland, with packaging waste making up about one third of total municipal waste generated.  Typical packaging is made from materials such as plastic, cardboard, paper, glass, steel, aluminium, wood and textile.  Packaging made of composite, or two or more, materials is also frequently used, for example, in the coffee cups we take away from forecourts and the milk and juice cartons we use every day.  In 2015, of packaging waste materials, plastics comprised 29% of the total, 84% of which is recycled or recovered through waste incineration.  Paper and board made up 41% of packaging waste and 99% of that waste stream is recycled or recovered.  For further information, interested parties may refer to the EPA&rsquo;s recently redeveloped waste statistics platform on our website.</p> <p>  It is instructive to note that Ireland currently meets its statutory recycling targets for waste packaging but future targets envisaged in the EU&rsquo;s circular economy package will likely prove far more challenging.  For example, while Ireland recycled 34% of plastic packaging waste in 2015, exceeding the EU target of 22.5%, the current proposals in the circular economy package call for 55% of plastic packaging to be recycled or prepared for reuse by 2025.</p><p>While Ireland has made progress in improving recycling and recovery levels, further progress is needed to protect the environment, to meet the requirements of the incoming EU regulations and to facilitate the transition to a circular economy in Ireland.</p><p> As part of the process and commitment to continual improvement, the EPA is continually refining and developing national waste statistics in terms of how they are collected, assessed and published.  In that regard, we are currently completing a new, comprehensive waste characterisation project, one of whose objectives will include, for example, estimates of the quantity of disposable cups in municipal waste.  The report from that project will be issued during 2018, and it will provide more definitive statistics on that particular waste stream.  We will be very happy to share the outcome of the project during the year with the committee and other interested parties.</p><p> I would like to make some more observations, particularly on the Bill.  The EPA believes it is important that waste policy and legislation be guided by the waste hierarchy, which accords the highest priority to waste prevention, followed by preparing for reuse, recycling and energy recovery, with disposal being the least desirable option.  In this respect, Ireland's national waste prevention programme was established in 2004.  It is led by the EPA.  The EPA welcomes innovative measures that will increase resource-use efficiency and waste prevention, including actions to reduce the use of disposable items.  In addition, such measures as reduce the scourge of societal littering are also to be welcomed.  We recognise the range of options available.  We desire to be innovative and efficient in that regard.  For example, Ireland has pioneered economic initiatives that have changed consumer behaviour and prevented waste.  A very pertinent example is the plastic bag levy.  A range of extended producer-responsibility schemes have been quite successful.</p></speech>

We acknowledge that his Bill is well-intentioned, if somewhat vague on the expected outcomes.  We have conducted our own assessment of it.  On reflection, we are unable to support it.  We consider it unlikely that it would have got this far in its current form if an impact analysis had been carried out.  Regulatory impact assessments are required not only under the Government's approach to better regulation but also to comply with specific European Commission guidance on beverage packaging.  There appear to be unintended consequences arising from each of the Bill's two provisions that would be difficult to avoid.<br/><br/>As Deputy Eamon Ryan has acknowledged, the mandatory deposit return scheme<b></b>envisaged in the Bill would entail very large set-up and running costs.  Businesses cannot afford to absorb them so Irish shoppers would face rising prices.<br/><br/>There is also a risk of distorting competition between town-centre shops and their out-of-town counterparts.  Focusing briefly on the intended environmental benefits, our analysis suggests a prospect of reduced<i></i>overall packaging recycling.  Drink bottles and cans comprise only a small proportion of post-consumer plastic packaging waste but are by far the most valuable component.  Therefore, they are twice as likely to be recycled as plastic film.  By taking that valuable stuff out of the green bin, one is undermining the financial viability of Repak, which reduces its ability to encourage waste collectors, which are private sector firms, to accept the less valuable packaging materials.  With the closing of the Chinese market, it will be even more difficult to have further progress on the recycling of plastics.  We should not be doing anything that makes it any harder than it already is.<br/><br/><b></b>We draw attention to a recent UNESCO-supported modelling study, ARIADNA.  I can provide a copy or references.  The study was carried out in Spain and considered the impact of introducing a mandatory deposit scheme alongside an established collection and recycling scheme.  It found that, in addition to being very costly, the duplication of effort could feasibly cause a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. <br/><br/>Plastic bottles constitute less than 2% of street litter.  A deposit refund scheme might marginally reduce this already small amount, but possibly at the expense of an overall increase in the litter problem.  Some households will forgo the return of their deposits simply to avoid the inconvenience of driving to, and queuing at, a reverse vending machine.  One obvious way for enterprising individuals in the neighbourhood to make a bit of pocket money would be to go scavenging once the green bins are put out for collection.  The quickest and easiest way to do this would be to upend every bin along the street looking for bottles.<br/><br/>Regarding the proposed ban on disposable cups, glasses or plates that cannot be composted at home, we would question the Minister's powers under the 1996 Act.  Voluntary action by business should certainly be encouraged.  For example, a number of IBEC's members are actively researching, along with their suppliers, the use of safe but compostable hot drink cups.  We have had some dealings with CR&Eacute; on this very issue.  It is very interesting.<br/><br/>It is unclear whether there are any commercially available bioplastics that form the liner of a coffee cup that can be readily composted at home.  In any case, home composting does not count towards meeting EU recovery targets because they are not collected.  If the Exchequer were to provide money to local authorities for segregated waste collection in public places, it would certainly help improve recycling rates, but education and labelling would be needed to prevent cross-contamination.  <br/><br/>As for litter, it is a social problem.  A consumer who cannot be bothered to put soiled packing in the nearest waste bin will not bring it home in his or her pocket or bag to put in the brown bin. <br/><br/>Specifically on the idea of a levy, we do not believe a small levy of 15 cent or 20 cent will have anything like the effect of the highly successful plastic bag tax.  The keep cup I bought was on sale, reduced to &euro;15.  It is huge.  One cannot put it in one's pocket or bag after it has been used as it will leak.  If a levy were to be introduced, it would simply be seen as a regressive tax.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is very important.</p> <p>  Retail Ireland members promote and practice responsible retailing and take an active role in generating vibrant and healthy communities.  Waste prevention and reduction programmes are a core objective of the sector's commitment to tackling environmental issues.  Our members invest many millions each year to ensure we protect and promote our environment.  An example of this commitment is the significant level of funding provided to the Repak organisation, which in turn funds the successful national kerbside collection of recyclable materials, or materials in the &ldquo;green bin&rdquo;.  This direct funding by retailers has helped Ireland not only to exceed EU recycling targets set for 2011 but also to have already exceeded some of the suggested targets for 2025. </p> <p>  Retail Ireland agrees with the recent independent report commissioned for the Government on this matter that states the cost of implementing a deposit-and-refund scheme would outweigh the benefits.  Our members are concerned that the development of a new system will undermine the good work done by Repak and many stakeholders, including retailers, to bring Ireland from having one of the worst rates of recycling in Europe to among the best today. </p> <p>  While many retailers already provide bottle and clothing recycling facilities on their properties, we have concerns about the suggested introduction of further units in the form of bottle-bank-type units or reverse vending machines.  Such units would come at a significant cost and would have to be placed in locations outside town and village centres, with free parking and good access.  Such a move could have the unintended consequence of reducing activity within towns and villages and further threaten the rejuvenation of regional town centres.</p></speech>

Because of effective packaging processes, food wastage rates at pre-consumption point are between 2% and 4% in industrialised countries.  This compares with 50% in developing countries.</p> <p>  The mandating of a deposit-and-return scheme for sealed beverage containers must be considered in the context of our existing waste packaging, collection and recycling in Ireland, called Repak.  In 2016, beverage manufacturers paid &euro;6.6 million to Repak, which is close to 25% of its revenue.</p><p>Beverage manufacturers paid &euro;6.6 million to Repak in 2016, close to 25% of Repak revenues.  The impact of this financial commitment is evidence that before industry began funding Repak, 94% of all packaging went to landfill and now 93% of all packaging is recycled and recovered, according to the EPA.  Placing a deposit return scheme directly on top of our existing scheme would put this progress at risk.</p><p> The packaging targeted by the Bill makes up just 4.5% of litter, according to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Tackling litter louts requires awareness programmes and enforcement of the Litter Act.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s waste packaging collection and recycling scheme is built on the principle of shared responsibility.  This shared cost approach is one where business, waste collectors and householders share the cost of segregated packaging waste collections.  This recognises the obligation on collectors to collect waste from households, with householders contributing towards the provision of a service under the principle of polluter pays and business contributing to the additional costs of collecting packaging waste for recycling separately from other waste.  Food Drink Ireland believes that this should continue to be the case to build on our recycling rates.</p></speech>

I will give a synopsis of our submission as I will share my time with my colleague, Dr. Pat McCloughan.  While we strongly disagree with some aspects of the Bill, we acknowledge the positive social intentions behind it and why it was tabled.  As strong advocates for advancing this matter we believe this is a timely debate, particularly in the context of the EU&rsquo;s circular economy plastics strategy that was announced yesterday.  Ireland, as one of the 27 member states, has had major input into that in the last two years and has been actively involved in developing this particular paper which has been produced by the Commission.</p> <p>  Repak is the predominant route of compliance in Ireland.  It was set up in 1997 under the Waste Management Act.  It is not-for-profit.  Repak represents 2,300 businesses and charges fees to its members in accordance with the amount and type of packaging they place on the market and reflects the recycling available in those areas.</p> <p>In the last 20 years, we have put &euro;400 million into the recycling of packaging in the country, bringing it from 15% to 91%.  We increased the amount of packaging recycled overall from 794,000 in 2016 to an expected 804,000 tonnes for 2017.</p> <p>  The money is spent on subsidising the green bin to the tune of &euro;64 per tonne.  It subsidises the 1,848 bottle bank sites and 118 civic amenity sites for the recycling and recovery of packaging from all those sites.  Repak also has an educational mandate and spends almost &euro;1 million on this annually.  I will not refer to targets, to which Dr. Tom Ryan already referred.  We support almost 5,000 jobs within the recycling industry.  We have been a significant contributor on behalf of industry since the regulations were introduced.</p> <p>  I will cover two key points.  We broadly support the Bill on what it endeavours to do regarding coffee cups.  It is important that a technical assessment is carried out to determine precisely what is needed in the area because there is considerable confusion between non-compostable and compostable coffee cups and the alternatives.  We recommend that the committee examines this.</p> <p>  We are fundamentally opposed to the deposit return scheme as it has been presented and think there are major issues associated with it.  It is important to note that we do not have a major beverage container problem but we have a major plastic recycling problem, particularly in regard to infrastructure in Ireland and Europe.  It is important that those two facts are not confused.  We do not believe that a deposit return scheme will have any noticeable impact on the recycling rate for beverage containers which make up about 4% of all packaging.  We think a deposit return scheme would be extremely difficult to operate.  It is important to carry out a cost benefit analysis on this.  To put a deposit return scheme in place on top of an existing recycling scheme such as Repak would lead to unnecessary duplication of collection infrastructure, duplication of transport, increase traffic pollution, wasteful use of energy and have a negative carbon impact.</p></speech>

Along with Ms Gill Bevington, an independent packaging consultant based in the UK, I was commissioned to write a report examining the rationale and likely effects of the beverage container deposit scheme as proposed in the Bill.</p> <p>  I will highlight the main conclusions of the study.  On the rationale for the proposal, the way that economists would usually look at this is to ask if there is evidence of a market failure.  Our report reviews the literature and previous studies, including a 2004 OECD report which sums the situation up well.  It says that the rationale for a deposit scheme in a jurisdiction where there is already an extended producer responsibility scheme, EPR, such as Repak in Ireland, is just litter control.  That leads to the question of whether there is a litter problem in Ireland and specifically one of beverage containers.  Fortunately, there is extensive information for the position in Ireland provided by Tobin Consulting Engineers in tandem with local authorities.  We have looked at that evidence in detail and it shows two things.  The overall litter problem in Ireland is diminishing, as one would expect, because Ireland is a country with a green and clean environment and we have a vested interest in ensuring that.  Looking specifically at the beverage container litter, as others have noted already, about 3% of all litter in Ireland is beverage containers and when one adds drinks cartons it increases to 3.5%.  The trend over time is decreasing.</p></speech>

After the Blue Planet series, as the Deputy noted earlier, and the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign, plastics is a huge issue on which we are now reaching the tipping point.  According to the Ellen MacArthur foundation, 8 million tonnes of plastic are leeching into our marine environment.  That is equivalent to a rubbish truck emptying a load of plastic into the ocean every minute.  By 2050 we will have more plastic in the ocean than fish.<br/><br/>We have received figures from Repak regarding how much of the plastic bottles and aluminium cans are being recycled.  We have calculated that around 2.5 million plastic bottles, 720,000 aluminium cans and 500,000 disposable coffee cups are either thrown away, incinerated or littered each day.  These are valuable resources that leak from the recycling scheme and there is value in these resources.  This is the result of our throwaway society, a far cry from where we were 20 years ago.  A takeaway coffee then would have been a thermos of hot instant coffee.  While we have improved our household recycling, and Repak has been instrumental in subsidising the collection of mixed dry recyclables, we are terrible on the go when we have takeaway containers, bottles, cans and single use items that are either thrown away or littered into the environment.  We cannot continue with the <i>status quo</i>and we need to take a step back to address where the problem occurs and how we can resolve it.  <br/><br/>First, we need to examine how we can prevent the waste.  This can be done through reuse.  Economic incentives such as the latte levy or the imposition of other economic instruments could be imposed on single use items to encourage people to bring their own bottles, coffee cups and containers.  This can be administered in the same way as we do with the plastic bags, when vendors file their VAT returns.  We could ban their sale but that would be a problem under article 18.<br/><br/>We need to capture as many valuable recyclables as we can.  Where people do not have a choice of bringing their own, for instance, when they buy a can of Coke or a bottle of beer, we call for a deposit refund scheme to be established.</p><p>Deposit refund schemes have been successful all around the world.  I grew up in the state of Michigan where we have had one in place since the 1970s and there is up to 98% net recovery, that is, recapture of drinks containers.  We do not turn the bins over.  We also have reverse vending machines in retail establishments.  When people go shopping, they bring their bottles and cans, put them in and get the chit to present when they buy items.  It is convenient and people do it when they go shopping.  I walked a mile on a beach in Michigan in October and found one aluminium can the whole way.  I have a ten minute walk from the DART to work where I found 50.  There is a litter problem.  Companies such as Wellman International in the North and Shabra in Monaghan support deposit retention schemes because the quality of plastics and aluminium collected in single streams is much higher than what one gets in dry recyclable material.  On extended consumer responsibility, as was stated earlier, Repak charges the same fee for PET bottles and non-recyclable plastics.  This needs to be reformed.</p><p> There is a cost to litter and drinks containers make up around 40% in volume of all litter.  It was said that it is 3% but that it is in items collected rather than in volume.  One cannot equate a plastic bottle with a cigarette butt.  It happens when people are on the go.  They are drinking and eating on the go.  They will not take that packaging home to be recycled.  It ends up in our bins and is not recycled.  Our litter is not recycled and it ends up being incinerated or as litter.</p><p> Economic incentives work.  We have seen this with the plastic bag levy and we call for economic incentives to work again.</p></speech>

The company I work for carried out a study for the Government in 2009.  We were reviewing international policy and this was based primarily on a review of literature.  At the time we felt unable to call out definitively whether we should have a deposit scheme.  Since 2009, we have conducted many different studies, all of them in the public domain.  Interestingly, none of them was covered in the review undertaken by Repak.  This has been rather interesting.  We carried out those for DG Environment, Zero Waste Scotland, UK-based NGOs, Spanish NGOs and the Catalan waste administration.  We are currently working with the Maltese Government, which said it wants to implement a deposit scheme, and the Kosovan Government which wants to implement one.  Both Serbia and Latvia have announced they want to do it.  We worked in Connecticut to improve a Bill there.  Why are people doing this?  What are the benefits to the system?  Why would I recommend that the Irish Government do this if I had the chance again?</p> <p>  There are four key benefits to a deposit scheme.  The first relates to the increase in recycling one will get in an effective scheme for beverage containers.  That has consequences in terms of greenhouse gas benefits.  It is particularly important for plastic containers.  Increasingly, Ireland, along with other EU member states, is moving its residual waste management away from landfill into thermal processes.  From a climate change perspective, putting plastic into a thermal process is possibly the worst thing one can do, especially as the background intensity of the energy being generated is declining over time as one seeks to address climate change objectives.</p> <p>  The second point is that litter will be reduced.  The selective citation of the OECD 2004 study, which I know very well, having critically reviewed it for the OECD a few years later, states - I will quote it selectively - that deposit schemes will achieve an 80% reduction in litter of beverage containers.  The Repak study says that beverage containers only contribute 2.5% and that the figure may be decreasing.  What is acceptable here?  We have a major problem in terms of litter and the flow of that litter into the marine environment.  We know that this is a massive global problem.  We can sit here and imagine that 2.5% or whatever the figure is.  Imagine that the figure is decreasing, although I would dispute it.  Even on Ireland's own econometric analysis, the t-statistics in terms of the trend in its own analysis are not significant.  It is a random walk at the moment.  We do not even know that the percentage is actually reducing.  There is an issue here in terms of the litter.</p> <p>  The other point is the quality of the material.  Ireland is seeing the diminishing availability of its markets.  Repak's own data have shown the level of contamination of recycling material in Ireland.  We have exactly the same problem in the UK and I hope that this will serve as a wake-up call in the UK and Ireland.  We will not see a reduction in the recycling rate.  Ireland can count that in its packaging recycling figures and it would be incredibly sensible if it did that as it would be improving the likelihood of getting to the 55% recycling rate it will have to achieve for plastics under the new circular economy package for plastic packaging.  How will Ireland do it?  It is at 33% at the moment, or is it?  When measured against the actual recycling figures that it will have to report under the new package, I really doubt that it is.  Ireland will have to report what is sent for final recycling and it will see a hit on its existing reported rate.  That will go down and Ireland will have to do better.</p> <p>  What about the companies whose corporate social responsibility, CSR, objectives are to use more recycled content?  This is interesting.  We have had lots of discussions with them and some of them say that they do not like deposit refund schemes.  We asked them where they get their material to meet CSR objectives of recycled content of 25%, 50%, etc.?  Norway is the answer.  This is interesting because it has come out of the deposit scheme.  Everyone wants the quality of the material that those schemes provide.  Why are we seeing the brands starting to shift?  I understand why industry may initially feel a little threatened by this type of measure.  I particularly understand it in the case of Ireland and the UK because we both have schemes where the producer responsibility scheme does not cover the full costs of the packaging recycling service.  Therefore, we are in a uniquely interesting situation where the costs go up.  Norway, funnily enough, has very high recycling rates of aluminium and there is a zero fee for the aluminium packaging producers.  It is even thinking of giving a rebate because the value of the material more than offsets the costs of collecting it.</p> <p>  Therefore, there are a number of different reasons to do this.  I understand the objections.  I have seen them before.  However, we have seen brands becoming more aware.  They realise that having their bottles washed up on pristine beaches all over the world is not good PR.</p></speech>

I represent the owners of 3,500 local, independent and family-owned shops, convenience stores, forecourt stores and supermarkets.  RGDATA members are community-based retailers and we share the concerns the Bill seeks to address, namely, the need for waste reduction, increased recycling and reduction in single-use plastic packaging, food and beverage containers and utensils.  The independent retailers I represent have played a significant role to date in the dramatic increase in Ireland's packaging recycling rates, from 15% in 1997 to 90% in 2016.  Our members pay significant fees to Repak to fulfil their waste management and recycling objectives and to comply with Irish and EU regulations.  They also pay for their waste to be taken from the backdoor of the shop as well.</p> <p>  We are active in our communities.  We encourage reuse and recycling.  Many of our members host recycling centres on their sites and are proactively working in their stores to follow best practice guidelines.  They provide staff training on waste management, appoint green champions in their stores and adopt initiatives to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and be more efficient in their use of natural resources.  Many of our members are also trialling initiatives to encourage their customers to use reusable beverage containers.</p><p>The shop owners I represent are genuine "green grocers" and take their responsibilities in this area very seriously.</p><p> In principle, our members welcome any initiative which helps to reduce waste and contributes to consumers and retailers having more sustainable choices concerning packaging of food products.  Accordingly, we are supportive of the general aims and objectives of the Bill.  However, we do have concerns about aspects of the Bill which we feel need to be addressed to ensure that any new legislative measures achieve their objectives without unintended consequences.  We also believe that any new proposals should be rigorously tested to ensure they will deliver value for money and that they will actually deliver on their objectives.</p><p> There are two elements to the Bill: the banning of non-compostable disposable beverage containers and tableware from 2020, and the introduction of deposit and return schemes for sealed beverage containers from July 2019.</p><p> On the first provision, banning non-compostable containers and tableware, it is important that consumers and retailers have ready access to affordable substitutes to the products currently being used typically for food to -go in shops and other outlets.  There are concerns within the trade at both the cost and availability of substitutable alternatives which will be available in the numbers likely to meet the anticipated demand.  Unlike the plastic bag levy, where people could bring their own bags to a shop and customers adapted very quickly to this, there are concerns within the sector that a significant proportion of consumers will be less inclined to bring their own coffee cups, containers or glasses to shops and will be reliant on the food or beverages continuing to be supplied in containers and with utensils from the shop.  Consequently it is important that there are cost-effective and substitutable alternatives available to both retailers and consumers before any ban on the existing implements is introduced.  Retailers have shown that once alternatives are available, they will fully embrace any initiative designed to reduce unnecessary or unsustainable waste.</p><p> On the bring-back scheme proposals in the Bill, we have serious reservations about how this scheme will operate and about the impact the new scheme will have on the existing producer compliance scheme to which retailers contribute.  As I have pointed out, our members pay between &euro;1,000 and &euro;3,500 to Repak depending on the size of their store and the amount of packaging they put on the market.  They already make a significant contribution to the cost of recycling in Ireland.  There is concern that a new deposit-and-return scheme would undermine the rationale and justification for supporting Repak by my members and would amount to a form of double compliance with regulatory obligations with significant extra costs for the smaller retailer.</p><p> There are also concerns that such a scheme would be very expensive to set up and that the design of the scheme would need to take account of the place of sale for particular beverage products.  For example, if a larger retailer is putting beverage containers out into the market place, then that retailer should have a commensurate responsibility to take back those products in proportion to the volumes put onto the market.  It would be an unfair system if smaller retailers found themselves inundated with beverage containers which had been purchased at larger outlets, in circumstances where they would need to install the relevant infrastructure to manage, store and fund a deposit-and-return scheme for products that they did not directly put on the market.  Obviously, we would like to see this rigorously tested before being applied because we are concerned about its impact, cost and effectiveness.</p><p> In general, we are very supportive of the principle of reducing packaging waste but believe that the design of any legislative measure needs to have due regard to the practical consequences of enactment on both consumers and retailers.  There is no point in bringing in new restrictions where easily substitutable alternatives are not available or which serve to undermine existing producer responsibility schemes which are working well.  Obviously, we do not place a disproportionate burden on smaller retailers by making them accountable for the sale practices and trading volumes of larger retailers.</p><p> In the interest of brevity, I will finish there.</p></speech>

I propose that we bank the questions.  If anyone wants to come in at any point, they should indicate to me and I will get around to any members who want to contribute.</p> <p>  My first questions are for the Department.  On banning non-compostable disposable cups, glasses and tableware, I note Mr. Collins's comments on the incompatibility with the EU packaging and waste directive.  I know the committee is taking its own legal advice.  Is this an issue the Minister would raise with his European counterparts?  Has the European Commission's plastics strategy been considered regarding this issue?</p> <p>  I note the EPA's point on the present treatment of recyclable waste which cannot be dealt with here and much of which is exported.  Is Dr. Tom Ryan diplomatically asking where all this new recycling will happen if the Bill proceeds?</p> <p>  My final questions for now are for Repak.  Presumably the deposit-and-return scheme, if introduced, would deal with more lucrative plastics.  How would that impact on household waste charges?  That is a concern for members of the public.</p> <p>  We will bank those questions.  If anyone wants to come in on any of those later, I will let them do so.</p></speech>

I recognise that they are all here with some degree of vested interest depending on whom they represent, but the one vested interest that does not get enough recognition is the environment.  It falls on us, as legislators, to try to craft and develop a series of legislative measures that force industry to respect and protect the environment.</p> <p>  The organisations before the committee today, particularly IBEC, represent industry and receive contributions from their companies annually.  They represent those companies that want to sell their products.  However, producers have not done enough to reduce the amount of packaging that ultimately ends up as waste.  While we can clap ourselves on the back and claim we have achieved phenomenal results in the amount of materials we recycle, the volume has grown dramatically.  It is possible to use statistics in whatever way one wants.</p> <p>  Like many other people I often walk the roads for enjoyment.  During the winter period the amount of material that is disposed of into the ditches along our roadways has increased significantly.  It is appalling how that has increased in recent times.  Clapping ourselves on the back and claiming we are recycling much more material does not resolve that.  We know from others about the amount of material that is disposed of into our waterways that ultimately damages aquatic life.  It shows up in rivers as well as along our beaches, and we know the impact it has on the international seas.  We need to take legislative measures to some extent almost disregarding what the industry is looking for because it will always push back and want to protect the producers.  Unless we put serious measures in place to protect the environment and speak up for the environment, we will not see the kind of change we need.</p> <p>  I have great regard for what Repak does, but it is an industry representative group.  Mr. Clancy is right in saying the recycling industry employs people and naturally enough there is a lobby group to protect the recycling industry as we know it.  However, we need to find legislative measures to reduce and eliminate to the greatest extent possible the amount of waste material that ends up being discarded.  I was struck by points made by one of the previous speakers that we are relatively good at recycling within the home, the commercial environment etc., but the disposable society we have and the amount of materials that are disposed of really is having a huge impact, and we need to look for other ways.</p> <p>  I note the rejection from the Department and I accept that there are European issues that need to be addressed.  Perhaps we would introduce some pilot projects that would not contravene the overall national policy, that would help to deal with what Ms Buckley says in terms of testing the viability of these initiatives, and which would get to inform policy into the future.  We can be imaginative rather than just pushing back and pulling down.</p> <p>  Let us work together collectively in the interests of the environment.</p></speech>

I listened intently to all the arguments and points raised.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in broadly supports Deputy Ryan's Bill.  The Deputy has listened to the debate.  We acknowledge the Bill would possibly have to be heavily amended, but that is a matter of tweaking.  Stepping back and looking at the broad picture - Deputy Dooley touched on this and was spot on - it is about the environment but also about people, and we are the people.  The key here is that we need to be healthy to survive, so we must take a realistic and common-sense approach to the matter.</p><p> I reject a few of the comments made.  Luckily enough, I remember as a young fellow getting the old 5p coin back for the glass bottle.  I certainly did not go scavenging through bins, but it was an adventure and an education for young kids at the time.  Our Saturday morning was getting up early and walking the country roads, hoping to God that, the farmer having cut the ditch, the bottle would not be broken because, if it was, we would not get the 5p.  The comments about scavenging are a bit of a myth.  Such schemes are a very cute and selective way to educate people.  It was mentioned a while ago that we must educate people about recycling.  Let us do so in a common-sense and rewardable way.</p><p> I acknowledge that legal dumping happens.  I am a little disappointed by the Minister's recent statement and the fact that money was being allocated to address the issues, therefore effectively admitting we are possibly heading towards more legal dumping.  The other side of that is that I acknowledge what Ms Mindy O'Brien said a while ago.  It is said that by 2050 the plastic in our seas will outweigh the fish.  That will be horrific if it comes to fruition.  The more worrying thing about it, and this goes back to my comments about the environment and people, is that we will be eating the product from the sea.  We should not be human recyclers in this.  I go back to my first point, which was that the environment and people both have to be healthy to survive.  As I said, I support the broad thrust of the Bill, although tabling amendments to it would be a common-sense approach.  Things are achievable, and I appeal to all to think outside the box.</p></speech>

I have probably not been here as long as some of the members present.  I have been here about two years now, since 2016, but I am seeing a pattern.  Everything cannot be done until it is being done.  We see a lot of resistance again today.  I respect entirely the mandates of the organisations that all the witnesses represent and the concerns they have.  They are well voiced and, I am sure, well founded, but where there is a will there is a way, and perhaps that is the attitude we need to have to these kinds of environmental challenges that face us more and more now.  When my party introduced the plastic bag levy, perhaps 15 years ago or more, such concerns were probably raised as well.  We got over them and got on with it.  I think the public is very accepting, possibly more so at times than the institutions and organisations, of what needs to be done, and they got on board with it in the case of the plastic bag levy.</p> <p>  Mr. Walker's comments about scavenging in bins caught my imagination as well.  They painted an apocalyptic scenario and reminded me of watching "The Walking Dead" on Netflix, a programme in which people upturn bins on the streets and scavenge, prowling by night trying to find what might be around.  I do not remember the 5p scheme in Ireland but I did live briefly in Amsterdam for one summer and was very familiar with what they had, which was a bottle deposit scheme, as opposed to a plastic deposit scheme.  Every morning I was nearly run down by bicycles whizzing past with crates full of empties sorted for collection and return.  It worked extremely well and was an incentive.  I did not see anyone scavenging or upturning bins but I did see plenty of people on their way to the various collection centres every day.</p> <p>  On that note, I think it was Mr. Burke who mentioned the possibility that the collection centres may be outside towns and may somehow contribute to the demise of our town centres, a risk with which we are all familiar.  However, I am not sure about that.  I appreciate the witnesses must cover all bases, but I think it may be a stretch to associate the demise of town centres with the location of collection centres.  We already have plenty of bring centres, and I have been involved in working to bring them into many places in my area.  I see the Bill in the same vein and consider that collection centres can be complementary to existing facilities.  They do not have to be brand new centres.</p> <p>  Regarding compostable cups and whether they can be composted at home, I think the brown bin could take a great many things.  I am familiar with one company, Zeus packaging, which has kindly given us samples.  They seem to work perfectly well and seem to be compostable.  I know they can go into the brown bin.  The technology and the products are already there.  It remains to support them in the marketplace.</p> <p>  It was very interesting to hear Dr. Dominic Hogg's comments and it is very illustrative for us to hear how other jurisdictions deal with this issue.  If I understood his contribution, various other jurisdictions have grappled with this and similar concerns and questions have been raised but they have been overcome satisfactorily.  It would be very interesting to pursue that a little further and see how exactly that was done.</p> <p>  Going back to what I said at the start, the point of Committee Stage, amendments and Report Stage is to thrash these things out.  It is really useful to have a discussion on this here, but rather than parking it and saying we cannot proceed because of these questions, I would say let us take the answers to these questions and put them into amendments and proceed on that basis.</p></speech>

We were talking about litter, and I just want to let the committee know that Coastwatch, an environmental charity, has just come up with its recent survey of beaches.  Its members track all the litter on the beach, and what they found in 2017 is that the largest constituent of litter on the beach was plastic bottles.  They found more than 8,800 bottles.  They tested 538 areas.  The next largest constituent was plastic lids, followed by metal cans.  Those are the top three litter items on the beaches, which contradicts some of the comments made today.  There are many bottles littering the countryside.</p> <p>  As for the environment, we have support outside the gates of the Houses today.  We have signatures from 8,000 people and we have received 3,000 signatures to support the deposit refund scheme in the past four days.  Thirty Tidy Towns groups have also lent their support for the Bill.  They are at the coalface of seeing all this pollution and litter on the ground.  They see plastic bottles and disposable cups.  They are there and they see it so they support the Bill.  I do not think they publicly support many pieces of legislation.</p> <p>  Compostable coffee cups are better than the existing coffee cups.  The problem I see is that if we do not have the good infrastructure to collect them, they will just go to be burnt like any other waste.  If one wants to have them composted, one must send them to a composting facility.  That means separate collection.</p></speech>

I did not mean to be in any way ambiguous.  My comments concerned not only the Bill.  Looking at the plastic strategy published by the Commission yesterday and looking forward to the evolving policy demands of the circular economy, we are very keen to highlight the challenges of self-sufficiency of waste management, including recyclables, that lie ahead for Ireland.  It has been rehearsed here already that we are heavily reliant on export markets for treatment of recyclable waste.  We had suggested that efforts to enhance the management of those waste streams should include proactive planning for adequate future treatment capacity in the State.  We see that as a really important step, particularly as we transition to a circular economy.  The role that the EPA can play to support and assist in this is by providing evidence and by funding appropriate targeted research that might assist in that transition process.</p></speech>

To respond to the Chairman's questions, the plastic strategy was published yesterday, so we have not had a chance to consider it fully at this stage.  The focus of the Department's thinking now is really the legislative package that will be formally concluded probably this quarter by the European Union.  That will bring in the legally binding waste targets for Ireland.  They set the targets from 2025 to 2030 and 2035, and it is really in that context that we would very much focus on how Ireland will move from where we are today to delivering on those targets.</p><p> The best way to describe what we are thinking of is an attempt to put in place sufficient evidence so that we know what initiatives and measures we are proposing.  We would like to understand what the impact would be, determine the best structure for the Irish context and know the cost.  That will be an ongoing process now that we are approaching the conclusion of negotiations on waste targets.  Whether or not the Minister has done so, we have already raised the issue of tackling plastic and packaging with the Commission and the European Union at an official level.  Depending on direction of the Bulgarian presidency, the circular economy package it is due to be discussed by the Council of Ministers.  I have no doubt that the Minister will raise the issue at that point as well.  It will be the Minister's first chance to consider the publication of a plastics strategy, and hopefully also to sign off on the new targets for 2025 and 2035.</p><p> The real challenge for us as a Government Department is providing robust evidence on the impacts of the instruments we choose to use, whether they are economic or regulatory in nature.  Deputy Dooley asked if we would consider ways of testing the viability of options.  That is certainly something we would like to pursue.  In our work with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, we explore possible research projects examining how various measures might operate in an Irish context.  That would be a challenge, but it is something we would definitely be willing to look into. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.47" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Clancy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018011700002#L00200"><p>I think it is important to understand that we are on the same page where the intent of the Bill is concerned.  We are supportive of the intention.  We feel that other ways to deliver the potential outcomes should be examined, and we should be trying to achieve measurable outcomes.  In that context, we are developing a plastics strategy.  We have been working on it for about two years.  There are a lot of complex stakeholders involved in this.  We believe that Ireland Inc. needs to implement a good strategy to deal with plastic, and recycling as a whole, in order to hit the 2025 targets.  We have a huge deficit in infrastructure.</p> <p>  I welcome the comments from the EPA calling for this to be examined in a very serious way, because that is what is needed.  I am suggesting to the committee that this must be examined in a very holistic way, with the involvement of producers.  At the end of the day, they are the people placing the material on the market.  We work with them all the time to try to prevent and reduce use, reuse and do away with unnecessary packaging.  Unnecessary packaging is a blight on our landscape throughout the country.  It has to brought to an end, but they have to play a part.</p> <p>  The consumer has also been referred to.  In urban areas, green bins have up to 30% contamination.  That has an immediate impact on how much we can recycle.  The third area to consider is the development of technology.  It is still at a very low ebb, particularly for recyclers.  The technology still needs to be developed. The circular economy package refers to tackling this problem. </p> <p>  Last but not least, Ireland Inc. needs to have a coherent, cohesive strategy to deal with this.  The Chair asked a question about the bin itself.  Removing polyethylene terephthalate, PET, the plastic present in beverage bottles, from the recycling bin would remove a valuable commodity.  It is one of the varieties that is fairly stable worldwide.  In the main, it does not go to China but is recycled in Europe.  A much bigger problem is the amount of low-grade plastic on the market.  I recommend that the committee looks at this in its totality, and uses this as a core body of work.  The focus should not be on something that is a relatively small area in the overall context of plastic.  </p> <p>  Moreover, when we are making comparisons it is important to remember that the situation in Ireland, where there is an extended producer responsibility scheme for 20 years, differs from a jurisdiction where there is no scheme and deposit returns are to be introduced.  They all have different mechanisms for reaching the same level of return.  It is important to note that in the countries where there is a deposit return scheme there is very little difference in overall recycling rates.  A good example is Norway, which has had a lower overall recycling rate over 40 years than Ireland has today. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Neil Walker" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018011700002#L00300"><p>It is a pity that Deputy Dooley is not here.  He made two comments; that business is not doing enough and could be doing more; and that the problem is all about litter.  Businesses are doing more than we advertise, and we are very strongly committed to the polluter pays principle.  Ms O'Brien and I sit on the water forum, and she can testify that I have been quite outspoken on the polluter pays principle in the face of some people.  Let us not get into the water charge debate though.<br/><br/>We have supported the EPA's waste prevention programme with a 75% full-time executive since 2010.  We have provided consultation to hundreds of companies in effectively promoting resource efficiency.  Dozens of them have done resource efficiency assessments.  We are planning a big campaign on this issue in 2018.  That has now morphed into a circular economy role.  We have a circular economy executive which is virtually full time.  We will run member surveys to determine a baseline and another survey at the end of the year, to see if we can change hearts and minds.  The circular economy is a huge opportunity and we want to avail of it.  There could be first-mover advantages.  <br/><br/>Greenhouse gas is a minor issue in this regard.  If we could increase the recycling of high-density polyethylene, HDP, in bottles, we might get an extra 10,000 tonnes or 15,000 tonnes.  If it cost &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million a year to do it, that equates to &euro;1,000 per tonne.  An equivalent carbon tax would collapse the economy.  The greenhouse gas argument is not the major one.  Litter is a huge problem, but if the Government is to spend &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million a year in running costs, with set-up costs further to that, it raises the question of what could be done with that money that would be more effective in reducing litter?<br/><br/>Litter is a scourge.  I bloody hate it.  I would like to quote one of Deputy Lawless's Senatorial colleagues, Senator Catherine Ardagh.  She spoke in the Seanad on 10 May 2017, talking about Dublin City Council and litter, and we wholly agree with what she said.  The Senator remarked:</p><blockquote>&quot; In 2014, there were 18 litter wardens in Dublin city but we now only have 16.  There were 2,295 fines issued, 698 fines paid and 542 prosecutions for failure to pay on-the-spot fines, of which only 44 were successful.  It seems from the statistics that no one was prosecuted either summarily or on indictment.&quot;</blockquote> <p>That is not intended to be a criticism of Dublin City Council.  If the council had more money, it could employ more enforcement.  Why are there no council employees going up and down the beaches on Segways?  If we want to stop litter, we must deal with it as a litter problem.<br/><br/>I have one more point in response to Mr. Clancy's remarks about Norway.  Our packaging recycling rate is higher than Norway's.  Over all packaging, our rate is 68% while Norway's is 56%.  Some 57% of plastics in Norway are incinerated.  For Ireland to be more like Norway might please President Trump, but it would not necessarily make us any better at recycling.  In the area of plastic packaging, we are roughly on a par with Norway.  According to 2014 data, the most recent we have, Norway recycles 36.1% while Ireland's rate is about 0.5% lower than that.  As much as I love Norway, I am not sure it is a role model that is any better than what we currently do. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Dominic Hogg" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018011700002#L00400"><p>I will respond to Dr. Walker's comments first.  It is very welcome news that the industry bodies are developing a circular economy.  It is important to recognise the opportunity.  The company I worked for recently carried out a major review of waste statistics in environments where deposit schemes apply.  The initial executive summary was pretty stinging, because we felt we had been here so many times before.  Sadly it is very difficult to do comparative analysis on European waste data.  In a discussion of the effect of a deposit scheme on packaging statistics, another question arises.  How much of the total packaging consists of beverage containers?</p><p>The other issue is that when we are talking about total packaging and what the effect of a deposit scheme is, we have to ask how much of the total packaging is actually beverage containers.  It is not massive.  That is interesting, because when we talk about the collection system and the effect of it, we have to think about what is in the collection service.  All the paper, card, steel cans used for food, glass jars not used for beverages and plastic bottles not used for beverages are all still there, as well as all the other types of plastic.  The idea that some system is made redundant or that its economics are radically altered is not true.  We recently did some analysis of this for UK non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and the net effect in terms of local government service tends to be marginally positive because of the cost of the disposal on the residual side and the marginal benefit in terms of litter clean up costs.  The cost of dealing with litter is not completely eliminated, of course.  I believe that point is overplayed.</p><p> I agree with the point about carbon if it was only justified on that basis.  The interesting thing is that we are starting to learn more about what the externalities associated with the disamenity effects of litter are, and we are starting to understand what they are in a marine environment.  That opens up a whole new area of research.  Litter is never both on the land and in the sea at the same time.  The same piece of litter moves from one place to the other, and there is a large amount of research that needs to be carried out to help us understand that better and to understand those externalities.  We do know that the effect is big.  It is much more important than climate change externalities on a tonne-for-tonne basis.  If an impact assessment of this nature is carried out it is not the case that it stands or falls on the climate change impacts, in our view.  It has to take into account the disamenity and the impacts associated with litter, which is something we are getting a better handle on.  </p><p> On the question of the markets, Ireland, the UK, the United States and other countries are suddenly getting a wake-up call that we are not collecting stuff very well and are not getting quality material out.  We are trying to sell this to anyone who will take it, and some people are saying that they are fed up and do not want to take it anymore.  In the context of a circular economy, if there is 30% to 40% contamination of plastics - and that happens - what can be done if one is trying to develop a reprocessing industry here?  If 30% or 40% of every tonne that comes in has to be thrown away over &euro;100 per tonne will have to be spent to get rid of it.  If it is shipped to China what is the disposal cost?  It is peanuts.  The transport of the material to China is effectively funded.  If the quality of the material is better it is more likely to stay here and it is more likely that people will come forward with a view to actually using it and actually developing the markets in reprocessing here.  This is not a straightforward issue.  </p><p> On the final points about the costs of recycling, when we did the work back in 2009 we had some very interesting discussions with Repak.  I welcome Mr. Tony O'Sullivan, who is at the back of the room.  Our discussions concerned the cost of recycling in the Republic of Ireland.  We did not ask what Repak pays to support recycling.  That is a different matter.  We were focused on the cost.  We carried out a piece of analysis, because - and I do not wish to take this into a completely different area - we feel that Ireland has a relatively expensive system because it is based on the open market, which in our view leads to inefficiencies in the delivery of the service.  I know that is a hot topic here and it opens up other issues.  The fact is that we do not have a really good handle on the cost in all cases. </p><p> I will make a final point on small retailers.</p></speech>

We carried out a report for an NGO around the impact of deposit refund systems on small retailers.  There are good systems and bad systems.  We always want to design a system well, and the Repak report makes some very positive contributions in that respect.  The good systems will always pay some form of handling fee to the retailers.  There may be a cost.  A reverse vending machine does not have to be in place.  Manual take back could be done as well.  One could be paid to recompense for the take-back of that material.  The gut instinct of governments is often to exempt small and medium-sized enterprises.  Imagine there was a deposit scheme coming in and that every person who returns a container gets 15, 20 or 25 cent back.  Do retailers want them to come back to their stores?  The footfall argument is a really important one for the small retailers, and if this system is going to come into place I suspect that the small retailers would prefer to be part of it rather than out of it, as long as it is well designed.</p></speech>

We have had damn lies and statistics, so I am very glad that the EPA is seeking real clarity now.  It was said in the presentation that 84% of plastic packaging waste is either recovered or recycled.  What percentage is recycled and what percentage is burned?  I would be interested to hear if the Department agrees with Mr. Hogg and indeed the European Commission, which released a report yesterday which does not take long to read and is absolutely definitive in saying that we should not send plastic towards incineration.  Does the Department agree with that?  Can the EPA give me the percentages of each?  Does it have statistics in terms of the percentage of our recycled plastic which goes to China?  I know that some goes to Europe, but what is the percentage?</p></speech>

Does that mean that 30% of the content in our green bins is the wrong content?  I would be interested to know from Mr. Hogg if there is then a cost for managing that.

The recycling portion of that is 34% and the remainder is recovery in waste incineration plants and energy recovery.</p> <p>  In terms of the exports, I do not have the percentage table here but approximately two thirds of packaging waste in total is exported.  Some 77,000 tons of plastic are exported for material recycling, and 68,000 tons are exported for energy recovery.  Those are the 2015 numbers that are on our website.  </p></speech>

What we find is that the contamination level in the cities and urban areas is far greater than in the rural areas.  That is predominately down to the collection process, but there are also many more apartments and there is less consciousness of the issue.</p><p>The cost associated with recycling means that there is a greater need for facilities to separate it.  Where there is significant contamination, the whole load collected can be lost.  If, for example, someone puts a container of oil into his or her recycling bin, it contaminates the whole truck and that is lost.  That is a continuous education issue that we are working with.  The industry is examining ways to track down and highlight this to consumers who are contaminating their recycling bins and we are very much in favour of that.</p><p> On the cost issue to which Mr. Hogg referred, we have started in the past three years to do detailed costings on the collection and recycling costs across all the different sectors and facilities.  There are nine main recycling facilities in the country.  We have a breakdown of those costs and we are breaking it down to material type in particular as well to better inform us.  The greater the cost of recycling a particular material, the greater the subsidy level.  Our subsidies are fixed until the end of 2018.  From then on we will seek to recalibrate those in line with targets from the European circle economy package.</p><p> China has not closed its doors, it has said that it is reducing the contamination factor to 0.3% for plastic and 0.5% for paper.  It is virtually impossible to get to that level.  The European norm for each of these is 2%.  The majority of the material leaving Ireland is within that 2% to 5% overall.  That is why the recycling facilities here are working hard to improve the technology they are using to create greater segregation.  Everyone in this room needs to realise there are still many people hand-picking recyclable material going through all these facilities.</p></speech>

It is considering it not in Scotland but in London.  I am not too sure exactly what is going on in the UK but it uses a producer returnable note, PRN, system, which is a trading.  I would be very interested to know what Mr. Hogg thinks of that because it definitely is not delivering in the UK.</p></speech>

It is very useful to have him here because he does have extensive international experience.  I am very concerned when certain of my colleagues say we need to test or we do not know the potential implications when around the world, in America, Australia and Europe, similar schemes exist.  It is not as if we are shooting for the moon.  There are numerous international examples of deposit and refund schemes.</p> <p>  One of the key questions the Department asks relates to what might be the cost.  I am not sure Mr. Hogg has done the mathematics in breaking down the cost of a deposit and refund scheme but let us say there was a 10, 15 or 20 cent deposit refund what would be the cost per bottle for operating the scheme?  Has Mr. Hogg done any work on that?  He said earlier that he is sceptical of the statistics for recycling rates here.  The recycling rates are uncertain.  I think that is why the public is also suspicious about this area.  We are not clear about what is going where.</p> <p>  Where does Mr. Hogg think best practice exists?  Where would we look for example?  My understanding is that the Scottish Government has agreed to commit and introduce this scheme.  It is not doing it on a trial basis but across Scotland and I understand the UK Government is about to do the same.  It will not do it on a trial basis but across the UK.  What would be the implications for the Border if there was a collection refund scheme in the North but not in the South?</p></speech>

In our view, a good system would be designed with a central element much as was suggested in the Repak submission.  That system would be entitled to retain the unclaimed deposits from those who decided not to return the beverage containers.  The fees to the producers, the beverage companies and the importers would have to make up the gap between the running of the whole system and on the plus side, income, the money coming from deposits that people did not claim and the revenue from the sale of the materials.  If there is a low level of return the value of the unclaimed deposits can fund the whole system.  We would like to see something in legislation that would push for high return rates from the scheme.  If it goes up to 90% or just above that and the system is very efficient, in our calculation the order of magnitude of the cost to the beverage manufacturers and importers would be of the order of 1 cent per container.</p></speech>

Those administrative fees vary.  The scheme could be designed very badly.  I hope that would not be the case if it is done here.  That is part of the trick.  The committee will probably be quite interested to know that in some states in the United States the unclaimed deposit revenue goes to the state and is used to fund political campaigns.  We will not see those return rates going up soon.</p></speech>

I have listened and I am learning.  What is encouraging is that we are all on the same page and everyone has the same objective.  There has, however, been very little conversation about the consumer.  It has been about what producers and retailers should do but we need to take cognisance of the role of the consumer and educating that consumer and explaining the challenges posed by littering.  It is a cultural problem.  We can invent compostable schemes and deposit return schemes and we can bring in levies but if the consumer does not react and continues to litter, as they are undoubtedly doing, the problem will not go away.  That is a real challenge.  I am disappointed that Deputy Lawless left, particularly as he is my local representative.</p></speech>

It has been a concern of retailers that the deposit return scheme will lead to extensive litter and waste building up around the machines and when I went to the centre over the Christmas period to return some glass bottles there were bottles all around the machine, as far as the eye could see.  The system could obviously not cope with the level of supply.  It will be unsightly and will drive traffic through their car parks unnecessarily.</p> <p>  It was suggested that innovation was at the centre of all this and retailers are innovating in this regard.  They work with suppliers to look at new packaging solutions and to reduce some of the unnecessary packaging to which Deputy Dooley referred.  It is not in our interest to continue to produce this packaging because we have to pay to take it off the market.  At the same time, we need to be cognisant of food security and consumer security, particularly in the case of coffee which is a hot, hazardous substance from which the consumer needs to be protected.  All these issues need to be borne in mind.</p></speech>

It concludes that most of the schemes were introduced at a time when refillables were still commonplace in those countries but the refillables schemes have long disappeared in this country.  The second factor is that they were introduced before kerbside recycling was undertaken.  In 2008 my colleague, Gill Bevington, authored a report for Repak looking at the same issues of whether a deposit scheme would be suitable for Ireland and she concluded that it would not, because of the same set of factors.  One has to ask what has changed in Ireland in the meantime.  Has there been any significant change?  What has changed is that there has been a growth in the kerbside and household sector, albeit with contamination issues.  Tonnage has been growing successfully in these areas and the cost of recycling has also improved.</p> <p>  The cross-Border situation is a big issue and the CSO undertook a module in 2010 on cross-Border shopping.  Many people from the deep south of Ireland, Cork, Kerry and Wexford, would journey to Newry and Belfast to do their shopping and the second biggest purchases by these people are alcohol.  They spend hundreds of euro, more than people from Donegal or Sligo, and this raises the question of dumping and how we handle the additional items.  If the North had its own scheme it would raise the question of co-ordination.  We are not in outright opposition to a scheme but we appeal to the evidence.  There has been a debate about that but we have to deal with the facts from official sources.</p></speech>

I have had experience of this in Michigan and have lived with it for 40 years.  A reverse vending machine is easy to use and the stuff can be used in big and small shops.</p> <p>  We have to deal with trade across state lines so we get bottles from Indiana, Illinois etc.  There is no deposit on them but this information can be read from the bar code so a person will not get any credit for it.  We really need to address single-use items such as straws, plastic cutlery etc. and think of banning such items.  Polystyrene is a scourge of the oceans.  We met with zero-waste people in San Francisco and Seattle and they all use compostable containers for food, such as wooden forks.  I asked if it cost more but they said that, as demand increases and there are more producers, the price comes down.</p></speech>

They can engage instantaneously via touchscreens and online and the data retailers can extract from a modern deposit refund scheme are at least as valuable to them as the scheme itself.  We are engaged in a study on what we would do if we were to design a recycling system anew today.  The technology has moved on in terms of quality, particularly in the case of the extraction of plastics from mixed waste sorting.  In the Norwegian example, they decided that having a deposit scheme for high-value containers meant they would not have to bother with the rest, which they would extract at the back end before the material went into an incinerator.  This also recognises that if plastic is left to go into the incinerator we would just be burning fossil carbon and sending it up into the sky.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister will look forward to detailed consultation with the dairy sector and farmers on that.</p> <p>  The EU plastics strategy makes reference to deposit schemes but it also references key measures to improve the economics and quality of plastic recycling and to put in place well-designed EPR schemes.

He said it would drive footfall but one of the issues for small retailers these days is that everyone tells them their thing will drive footfall to their stores but the retailers have to turn on the lights, pay the staff and organise the facility, training, etc., so talking about driving footfall is not good enough.  They have to know that it will be cost-effective and that they will be able to pay for the service.  I ask him to keep that is mind.</p></speech>

The 1,848 we have represent a ratio of 1:2,004, while the norm is 1:1,000 in continental Europe, though not in the UK.  Leixlip is a good example, where 15,480 people live but there is one bottle bank.  We have struggled to push local authorities and producers for more bottle banks and we hope the committee can take this on board.</p><p> Repak would welcome the committee taking on board Mr. Hogg's recommendations.  It is in recommendation No. 10 from his 2009 report.  If the committee looks at the executive summary produced by Dr. McCloughan, it will see that they are practically identical or compatible in terms of the detail that should be looked into so if the committee is going to look at this in detail, it should make sure a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is carried out in conjunction with dealing with and answering the questions they pose.  That would be a great starting point.</p></speech>

It has been a very useful meeting.  I did promise I would come back to Mr. Walker, which was difficult because I was listening to everybody.  According to the plastics strategy, the Commission will propose new rules on waste management.  These include clearer obligations for national authorities to set up separate collection and targets to encourage investment in recycling capacity and avoid infrastructural over-capacity for processing mixed waste, for example, incineration.  I could go through its circular economy package notes throughout the day.  The Commission could not be clearer that this is not the way we should be going.</p> <p>  Our Bill is political in the sense that this really is a political choice because it asks that we avail of the mechanisms within the Waste Management Act 1996.  It is really a political question in terms of whether we want to join the myriad countries that are looking at this issue in terms of both.  Ms O'Brien is right.  We concentrated on the deposit refund scheme and bottles today but there is the issue around the use of disposable throwaway plastic coffee cups, cutlery and other items.  We must address this across the board for climate reasons, environmental protection reasons and circular economy development reasons and to simply meet EU rules in terms of how we are going to get from 35% to 55%.  If someone has a better idea and if some other party will say that it has another mechanism which will help us do that, I would love to hear it and I would love to read cited international papers - such as the studies carried out by Eunomia and others - which fit in with what the Commission is saying.</p> <p>  What we are suggesting in this Bill is absolutely in tune with where European regulation is going and is also in tune with ensuring due regard is had and with the precautionary principle in terms of protecting our marine environment in particular but also our land environment.  I hope we can proceed to Committee Stage.  A lot of further work will be done.  We recognise that we want to do it in step with other international developments, particularly in Scotland and the rest of the UK because they are similar jurisdictions, and France.  Our nearest neighbours are legislating in this direction.  We are not saying it must be done tomorrow but I believe we should go to Committee Stage.  What this Bill does is signal intent and the desire to use the Waste Management Act 1996 and indeed work with Repak and other industry people here, particularly small retailers who will be at the centre of our concern in terms of getting it right going back to those days where when we went back with a bottle, it was to a small retailer.  This could be an opportunity to turn around the nature of the retailer-customer relationship.  It is not just about this bottle and the cups but this is an important part of the overall picture because it involves the public.  It is something we can all understand.  If we get the public behind us on that, it is so much easier to understand all the other different strands involved and the various changes we will have to make.  We have done good work in the past 20 years but now is the time to jump up to a much more extensive recycling circular economy system.  This is one part of it but it is an important part because the public would be with us on it and it will help us to do the other things we will need to do.</p></speech>

We advocate stronger enforcement of existing litter laws.  It costs money but one needs to spend the money on having ten more wardens.  One needs better education.  The educational campaign on gum litter more than halved the proportion of gum litter in all litter over a period of years.  IBEC was very supportive of that.

Mr. Branimir Zaimov" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018011700002#A00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  Please allow me to start by thanking you for your invitation to speak to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  It is a great honour for me to do so on the topic of the priorities of the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.</p> <p>  On 1 January, a little more than a decade after its accession to the European Union, Bulgaria took over the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first time.  For my country, it is not only a great honour but also a great responsibility.  During the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the period 1 January to 30 June the Republic of Bulgaria will strive in a positive spirit to achieve future-oriented realistic results, following the principles of transparency and accountability, and realise an open-to-all-citizens Presidency.  Bulgaria will try to find a balance between the specific priorities of the member states and the strategic priorities of the European Union to achieve real, visible results in active dialogue with citizens on European issues and respond to their expectations for greater security, employment, sustainable growth and a stronger EU presence on the world stage.</p> <p>  The leading principle of the Bulgarian Presidency will be maintaining unity and solidarity among member states by offering compromise solutions within the Community method.  The Bulgarian Presidency will work on youth and security issues as horizontal priorities, in view of the complex nature of the challenges facing young people and the contemporary security environment.  Our goal is to respond to the real needs of European citizens and turn challenges into opportunities.  Today Europe needs more security, solidarity and stability.  To that end, we will work to secure a secure Europe because the migration crisis and the terrorist acts in recent years have shown how vulnerable we are; a stable Europe because citizens want to know that the European Union is taking care of their prosperity and well-being; and a Europe of solidarity because all member states are faced with the main challenges which can be overcome only through joint action, not at national or local level.  How are we going to achieve this?  We will achieve it through applying the 3 Cs - consensus, competitiveness and cohesion.  We are convinced that they are fundamental for the future of Europe and to achieve them one will need courage, political vision and shared efforts.  </p> <p>  The key to attaining our common goals is unity.  It is not by chance that we chose "United We Stand Strong" as our slogan.  It is the motto of our national assembly and on the coat of arms of the Republic of Bulgaria.  It will be the slogan of the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and which our country will follow in each action as the rotational President.  We will work for unity between the member states, as well as between the European institutions.  Tomorrow Europe will be what we make it today.</p><p>The Bulgarian Presidency will work in a transparent manner, be open to all European partners and, above all, all European citizens.  Bulgaria will seek a broad consensus among the member states on issues of importance to the citizens of the European Union.  As President of the Council of the European Union, the Republic of Bulgaria will work on building and implementing effective mechanisms for enhancing the security of EU citizens, strengthening border controls and managing more effectively migration processes.  Achieving a sustainable migration management system and increasing the effectiveness of the return policy will be a top priority, the realisation of which will be pursued by enhancing dialogue with third countries.   </p><p> In the field of security and combating crime and terrorism, the efforts of the Bulgarian Presidency will be aimed at improving the interoperability of EU information systems and databases; finalising work on the proposals to amend the legal framework for the functioning of the Schengen Information System; and laying the foundations for the effective implementation of the passenger names record directive.  </p><p> One of our main priorities is the future of the western Balkans in the European Union.  As the committee will be aware, the European Union has a clear interest in the stability, security and prosperity of the Western Balkans where its rules and values are respected.  Delivering a tangible European perspective for all of the western Balkan countries, including dialogue based on the fulfilment of the conditions and principles of own merit, political will and decisive reforms by these countries, is key not only for the region but also for the European Union as a whole.  The Republic of Bulgaria attaches great importance to deepening regional co-operation and developing good neighbourly relations.  We share the importance of the so-called connectivity agenda - transport, communications, infrastructure and energy - with the understanding the aim is to improve the links with the Single Market.  The potential initiative for digital connectivity which the Bulgarian Presidency plans to offer is a step by step adoption of roaming rules within the European Union by the western Balkan countries also, passing through a gradual reduction in roaming charges and an increase in broadband Internet access opportunities for these countries. </p><p> Bulgaria will be a balancing player and promote the competitiveness environment that is important for the economic prosperity of the citizens of the European Union.  We will focus on the Digital Single Market as a source of growth and competitiveness in order to achieve a greater share of online service users and the rapid penetration of information and communications technologies across all sectors of the economy.  The main aims of the Presidency will be the promotion of entrepreneurship and social innovation; economic and monetary union in the European Union; a sustainable and future-oriented environment; a stable European energy union and a reformed multiannual financial framework post-2020.  Other aims include sustaining the cohesion policy after 2020.  The Bulgarian Presidency will make an effort to have an open debate on the future of the cohesion policy and its role in the implementation of the European Union's priorities post-2020 in working to preserve its leading role in the EU budget post-2020.  </p><p> Another aim is the simplification and modernisation of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  In today's conditions of globalisation and growing core populations the role for agricultural production and rural development as an important economic, social and political factor is growing.  It is of crucial importance for the future CAP parameters beyond 2020 to be defined in a way that will help to improve the sustainability of agricultural holdings and ensure stable levels of farmers' incomes.  During the discussion on the future CAP the Bulgarian Presidency intends to place the emphasis on preserving the CAP budget and the instruments of the current CAP structure that have proved their effectiveness, including the single area payment scheme and coupled support, as well as on developing sustainable agricultural production in the context of environmental protection.  Another aim is to have culture as a strategic resource for the better future of the European Union.  </p><p> The four main priorities for the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union will be, first, the future of Europe, its young people, economic growth and social  cohesion.  Economic growth and social cohesion are key to the future of Europe.  There are many challenges, but we shall overcome them together.  It is important that the member states' economies continue to grow and that all EU member states participate in the debate on the reform of the eurozone as equals, regardless of whether they are members of the latter.  </p><p> The second priority is security and stability in a strong and united Europe.  Security and migration policies are some of the topics on which we need consensus and to make joint efforts.  The Bulgarian Presidency will work towards long lasting and fair solutions in the area of asylum policy, efficient policies for return and readmission and a balanced approach between short and long-term measures, aimed at the source of migration, not only the consequences thereof.  That is why great emphasis in our efforts will be placed on security, whereby we will focus on strengthening border controls, the exchange of information between the various bodies and prevention.</p><p> The third priority will be the European perspective and connectivity of the western Balkans.  The ambition of the Bulgarian Presidency is to achieve a clear action plan with each of the countries without creating unrealistic expectations but with concrete steps.  That is the way to long lasting peace, security and  prosperity in the region.  The goal is to provide connectivity for the western Balkan countries through transport, air, energy, education and digital connectivity.  Bulgaria invests consequent efforts in this direction by promoting the digital policies of the European Union among the countries in the western Balkans through the gradual reduction of roaming charges and increasing the possibilities for broadband Internet access.  </p><p> The fourth priority is the digital economy and skills for the future.  Europe's role in the rapidly developing world is directly linked with the competitiveness of the European economy.  The Single Digital Market, access to innovation and the link between education and the requirements of the future labour market are the basis of technological development.  It is not by chance that they are a major element of the programmes of the trio of Presidencies, Estonia-Bulgaria-Austria, and a priority of the Bulgarian Presidency.  Electronic communication, the provision of transboundary services, particularly for the SMEs, copyright, e-privacy and cybersecurity are some of the items on the agenda that need to be decided on.  Linking the education of young people with learning the skills of the future is the way to achieve a competitive, flexible and successful Europe.  </p><p> On Brexit, I assure everybody here that the Bulgarian Presidency is aware that the topic will be of paramount importance during its Presidency.  If I have not mentioned it previously in my statement it is only because the Presidency as such is not directly responsible for the ongoing negotiations with the United Kingdom.  As the committee will be aware, the negotiations are due to move to the second phase during the Bulgarian Presidency.  Bulgaria is well aware of the importance of the negotiations for Ireland and the whole of Europe.  Members may rest assured that in my capacity as ambassador I have informed my government of Ireland's position and concerns which include that a hard border might not only have grave economic consequences but could also endanger the peace process in Northern Ireland and affect the island of Ireland as a whole.  I am pleased to inform the committee also that during his visit to Sofia on 5 January the Taoiseach personally informed the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Mr. Borisov, of Irish concerns regarding the negotiations on Brexit.  The Taoiseach and the Bulgarian Prime Minister agreed on the importance of continuing the second phase of the negotiations and promised mutual support in this endeavour.  We are greatly encouraged by the fact that the person leading the negotiations for the European Union side, Mr. Michel Barnier, pledged his support for the Irish position during his visit to Ireland and before the committee, as well as during his recent visit to Bulgaria.</p><p>We are pleased to hear the same position reiterated by both European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.  In this respect, please be assured the Bulgarian Presidency will do its part in assisting the negotiations in a most favourable way.</p><p> In conclusion I express my great satisfaction that as I mentioned, during his recent visit to Bulgaria on 5 January, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, expressed his Government's support for the priorities set by the Bulgarian Presidency of the European Union.  He stated he wished to support the priorities as set out by the Bulgarian Presidency and that Ireland will assist the Presidency in implementing these priorities.  I am now happy to hear comments and I will try to answer any questions from members of the joint committee on our priorities.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I wish Bulgaria the best of luck with its first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  I worked on the 2013 Irish Presidency and it was definitely a very rewarding part of my professional career before I entered politics full-time.  I know how important it can be for a host country and it is a great opportunity for all our Ministers to visit Bulgaria over the coming months.  I hope to join our delegation to the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, meeting in due course.  As the Chairman outlined, I know the Taoiseach really enjoyed his visit last week and got on very well with Prime Minister Borisov.  There is much to build on there.</p> <p>  There are some key areas and I will start with what the ambassador finished with in Brexit.  I fully appreciate the position of the rotating Presidency when it comes to the negotiations.  We have moved to the phase two aspect negotiations and this is where there is a trade element and everything starts to move into the various sectoral parts, with direct responsibility to the wider European Council.  It is important that all discussions in Bulgaria over the next six months would bear Brexit in mind.  If we are starting to plan elements like the single digital market or Common Agricultural Policy planning, we should always reflect on what our relationship will be with the UK after 2019.  It is very important for every member state and particularly Ireland that we ensure those discussions are future-proofed.</p> <p>  I will touch on three areas, based on the ambassador's remarks.  The first relates to energy.  I fully appreciate the matter of energy security and I stress its importance, as Ireland and Malta will be the only two member states that will not be connected to the continental European grid after 2019.  All our connectivity is currently through the United Kingdom.  We are working with our French counterparts to deliver the Celtic interconnector from Brittany to Cork.  We have received quite a bit of support from the European Commission in terms of funding and with the planning authorities on both sides.  However, this must be brought into the Council's discussion of energy security and policy.  If the worst was to happen in ten or 15 years, all parts of the European Union should be connected to essential energy supplies.</p> <p>  The second area relates to accession and particularly the ambassador's remarks on the western Balkans.  I have one question and one point to make.  I am very much of the opinion that the relationship between candidate, accession or applicant countries with the European Union must be formalised.  There must be a clear path to membership and it cannot be an unending possibility that is not obtainable to certain states.  There is a clear example with the Turkish application to join the European body, which has been in the mixer for two decades now.  It seems to have drifted so much that it is no longer necessarily something to which many in Turkey aspire.  Domestic politics have taken a step backwards there in this regard.  As Bulgaria is a very recent accession country, how does it feel the European Union can act better with respect to applicant and accession countries?  How can it ensure the relationship would be formalised and not be a vague aspiration?  It should have a material benefit.  The countries that hope one day to join the European Union or have ever closer relationships should be able to benefit materially from the process.  Rather than seeing benefit at the end of the road, staying the course as an applicant country should be worthwhile.  We need to prove to all member states, in light of Brexit, that being part of the European Union is absolutely worthwhile.  We need to redouble our efforts with applicant and accession countries to ensure that while membership in due course is really worthwhile, continuing along the accession process is equally worthwhile.</p> <p>  The final area relates to the debate on the future of Europe.  Although it may have clashed with another of the ambassador's engagements this morning, we saw a major speech from the Taoiseach at the European Parliament in which he laid out his vision for the future of Europe.  I suppose that was in response to French President Macron's slightly lengthier speech at the end of last year.  It is part of a wider process.  Senator Craughwell, the Chairman and I, along with others, attended the kick-off of the future of Europe events being hosted by the Irish Government in tandem with European Movement Ireland to get the discussion going among people.  This involves quite a number of stakeholders and various European Commissioners will address them and examine the five key areas as outlined by President Juncker.  They concern what is best for Ireland and what Ireland feels is best for the entire European Union, the 27 remaining member states.  Is anything similar happening in Bulgaria?  How much emphasis will the Bulgarian Presidency put on the debate around the future of Europe?</p></speech>

I warmly welcome the ambassador and his colleague today.  They have given a very comprehensive outline of proposals for the Presidency, on which I congratulate them.  Bulgaria is a recent member of the European Union and it is a great honour for the country to assume that Presidency for six months.  The slogan, "united we stand strong", is very appropriate in the current climate as we see developments from Brexit etc.</p> <p>  I have the honour of representing our Chairman, Deputy Healy-Rae, and the committee in Sofia at the COSAC meeting.  I look forward to meeting the ambassador's colleagues and colleagues from throughout the European Union to discuss objectives and plans, which we will do in detail.  The witnesses have set out their position comprehensively.  I have no doubt, having heard reports from the Taoiseach's visit on 5 January, that he had a very successful visit.  He outlined the policy of the State to fully support the objectives of the Presidency of Bulgaria.  I can say without any fear of contradiction that it would be the united approach of this joint committee.  We are with Bulgaria in its Presidency and we look forward to meeting colleagues.  I hope Bulgarian colleagues will visit us during the next six months.</p> <p>  This is an enormous opportunity for Bulgaria.  I know they are taking this very seriously and giving it 100% attention.  Connectivity is very important and I am delighted Ryanair flies to Sofia three times per week.  It is a big step forward and I again recognise the work of Mr. Michael O'Leary and Ryanair.  Ryanair has done much for Ireland and Europe by creating connectivity throughout the European Union.  I can say it has done more than any other airline in this respect, as it travels to every part of the European Union and beyond.  I recognise that work and commitment and, as Irish people, we are very proud to have an airline like Ryanair servicing Bulgaria.  When I meet the ambassador's colleagues and learn more about the Presidency, I will be in a better position to contribute to later discussions.</p></speech>

I thank the ambassador for his presentation.  As the ambassador is aware, this is a very historic occasion from the point of view of both Bulgaria and Europe.</p><p>We have something in common.  Bulgaria is on the eastern extremity of the European Union as it stands at present and we are on the western extremity.  Unlike Ireland, Bulgaria has direct access and it is possible to drive to any part of the mainland of Europe.  We cannot unfortunately.  We are a little bit isolated.  In the context of Brexit, we will be slightly more isolated.  As a result, we will have to try harder, work harder, influence more decisions, as we have done in the past in fact, and be good Europeans.  Bulgaria needs to do the same thing and is conscious of that.  </p><p>The ambassador's comments on the principles of security, stability and solidarity are well mentioned and well timed.  The <i>acquis communautaire</i>, and I take my cue from my colleague because I agree with him, sets down certain principles that we have to work towards and under that umbrella, we strive toward a goal.  It is important to accept the <i>acquis</i>both at accession time and during the course of one's membership.  Each country has a responsibility in that regard.  There are occasions from time to time during which one would review the degree to which all countries still aspire to and adhere to the <i>acquis.  </i></p><p><i></i>It might be no harm to remember that in some instances in the course of the Bulgarian Presidency.  I refer not to Bulgaria itself, but in respect of some other countries.  It is a nice way of saying that we join on the basis of one set of principles.  I believe that if we are to have a truly successful Europe, we must remain on the basis of the same set of principles.  The Single Market to which the ambassador referred is hugely important as well.  We emphasis that repeatedly.  Whatever country, region or part of the European Union in which we live, we must have access at all times to that Single Market.  We must have the benefit of that Single Market.  We must be able to show to our people that membership of the European Union is in their interest and that they benefit directly from it.  It is of huge importance.  The degree to which we utilise public relations in getting that message across is more important now than it ever was.  I refer particularly to times of populism, which usually involve short-term remedies to long-term problems.  We have history right across Europe which should teach us lessons in that regard.</p><p>The currency comes to my mind again.  I have always held the view that a single currency across Europe would be of huge benefit to the European Union.  I have used the comparison with the United States.  I cannot for the life of me understand why it would have been beneficial for any state in the United States to have its own currency.  I know we have technology tokens now that go beyond that, but the fact still remains that a single currency applicable right across the European Union would be far better than a multiplicity of currencies.  I hope that day will come.</p><p>Brexit is important.  It is a huge challenge for the European Union.  It is a huge challenge for neighbours like this country that are very close geographically to the UK.  We have very strong trade and political links.  We have borders which have been subject to a great deal of discussion in recent times.  It affects us greatly.  It would be a great idea if our UK colleagues had second thoughts.  There are huge benefits within a market of 500 million people.  It is not so easy to replicate that market outside it.  </p><p>My colleague has referred to the issue of energy.  The European grid is hugely important.  We are somewhat more isolated, as I said already.  It is now more important than ever for us to gain access to the European grid.  I think we have to have a change of mind ourselves as well.  We must recognise in Ireland that we must expect in the future to be obliged to rely on alternative energy, be that wind, sea, hydro energy or whatever.  Those alternatives will have to become part and parcel of our lifestyles.  To have access to the grid means continuity of supply.  Lack of access to the grid means that if we are dependent on wind energy, and we have calm for a couple of weeks, it will not be such a good idea.  It is like the yachtsman on the sea waiting for the next breeze to turn up.</p><p>The most challenging issues are the reaffirmation of the European ideals and I think the Bulgarian Presidency is in a good position to do that.  We have spoken about this many times in the past, and at every meeting that I have ever gone to in Brussels or in Strasbourg or wherever.  I will not say how many years I have been doing that for.</p></speech>

We must also consider the alternatives.  What we have is much better than any of the alternatives.  It is of huge importance that we as individual member states are in a position to be able to illustrate to the people that we represent the benefits of all of the things that we have come to expect from the Single Market, namely, solidarity, unity of purpose, cohesion and the standing together of 500 million people.  Hopefully, our British colleagues might even see fit to change their minds.</p></speech>

I wish Bulgaria well in its endeavours.  It is a big undertaking.  A comprehensive programme has been outlined, which the other member states will be happy to support.</p><p>I also welcome the ambassador's comments on Brexit.  He obviously appreciates the position of Ireland with regard to the negotiations.  Bulgaria's support in that regard is very welcome.  I can understand why Bulgaria will give migration serious attention.  It has a long land frontier with Turkey.  I note also that the European Council meeting in Brussels in December failed to reach any agreement on these issues.  I refer to the position in respect of mandatory quotas and reform of the Dublin Convention.  A lot of work needs to be done.  It is a big issue and Bulgaria could be quite central in trying to resolve these issues at EU level.</p><p>There was an article in <i>The Irish Times, </i>dated 2 January, by Daniel McLaughlin on how Bulgaria's EU Presidency will deflect attention from its domestic problems.  It mentioned that Bulgaria will &quot;nudge forward&quot; the prospect of its neighbours in relation to accession, which is welcome, but also mentions a position regarding &quot;rampant corruption, threats to press freedom&quot; and comments made by the deputy prime minister on the Roma and asylum seekers.  While this may be none of our business here, given that this article has appeared and is out there, the ambassador might like to comment on that and on what the Bulgarian Government is doing with regard to those issues.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018011700002#D00500"><p>I welcome the ambassador and apologise that I was a little late getting here.  The eyes of Europe are on Bulgaria right now as it takes over the Presidency.  I wish it well.  I am sure Bulgaria will rise to the occasion and it will all go fine.  On the issue of Brexit, as the ambassador is aware, we got through phase one as a solid cohesive unit in Europe.  As we move through the other stages of Brexit, there will be a natural tendency for each country to look towards its own specific economic needs.  On looking at the ambassador's words, "security, solidarity and stability", to my mind solidarity and stability are the two greatest things that are required now as we face into Brexit.  I am sure the Bulgarian Presidency will play its part.</p> <p>  I turn to the issue of security and migration.  While Brexit is a threat to the economy of Europe, security - and migration in particular - is a threat to the cohesiveness that holds Europe together.</p><p>We have many different views across the European Union as to how migration might be dealt with.  It has always been my view that we need to get away from the label of &quot;refugee&quot; and start talking about migrants.  We need to start talking about those who are economic migrants.  There will always be a home in all of our countries for genuine refugees who are running for their lives in fear of war and oppression.  However, in the case of economic migrants we differ as we move across Europe.  The Bulgarian Presidency will now be faced with the challenges involved there.  We cannot expect Italy and Greece to handle all of the migrants who present.  Nor can we set up border controls that are so rigid we finish up with massive bottlenecks in Libya and various parts of north Africa.<br/><br/>We need to take a proactive approach to economic migration.  We need to make rules and regulation that provide for orderly economic migration, be it on a temporary basis whereby people come to build a set of skills and go home to help their economies, or be it that we bring migrants for specific economic purposes.  We must manage the migration issue in a humane way.  That is something all of the countries in Europe have to do.  We all have to carry the load because, returning to the solidarity issue, it is one we must all face.  We must take the illegal aspect out of migration.  We have to put the traffickers out of business.  We can only do so by setting up proper European visa authorising agencies in north Africa and various parts of the world.  When I went to Italy late last year to look at migration, I was horrified to learn how far people had travelled only to finish up on some little rubber dinghy being pushed out into the Mediterranean and told Italy is a couple of miles over that way.  We know what that has left in its wake.  It is a big challenge for the EU Presidency to deal with.<br/><br/>On the issues of crime and terrorism, I constantly get attacked for my concern over terrorism.  We are living in a very dangerous world and no country is immune to or totally protected from crime or terrorism.  With that in mind, I am delighted to see that Bulgaria is committed to the development of an inter-European information system.  It will be vital as we move forward.  The passenger name recognition directive will be vital as well.  The quicker we get that through, the better.<br/><br/>On the issue of cyber-security, if someone wants to collapse an economy it can be done in cyber-space in a matter of hours.  We saw what happened when there was an attack on the health system in the UK last year.  The cyber-criminals are out there all the time.  It is no longer acceptable for Europe to have 27 different member states working on cyber-security.  We need a cohesive, single European-based cyber-security organisation that manages, trains and provides the level of security we need to maintain our economies.  I would hope to see something coming in on that front.<br/><br/>I note the interest of the Bulgarian Presidency in promoting entrepreneurship.  One of the issues I would like to see addressed is placing a greater focus on micro-economic activity, in other words, the very small start-ups.  The ambassador and I both know that a small business with one or two people today can turn out to be the Google or Microsoft of tomorrow.  <br/><br/>Having come from an education background, I am extremely committed to anything that would open up pathways for the young.  I would like to see the Erasmus programme extended to vocational as well as academic programmes.  I want to see apprentice bricklayers, carpenters, toolmakers and so on travelling from Ireland to Bulgaria and <i>vice versa</i>.  We need to share those skills and training methodologies across Europe.  While it is all fine and dandy for the academic high fliers, as they would be seen in this country, to travel across Europe, those who build and maintain Europe are the tradesmen and craftsmen.  We need a programme that will allow them to avail of Erasmus.  There is some work being done in that area already in the field of transport.<br/><br/>While the focus on the young is all very well, I came back to education in my 30s as a mature student.  We are living in an extremely dynamic world in which the skills of yesterday are long gone in a very short space of time.  The need for continuing professional development, CPD, upskilling and retraining is a phenomenal challenge to all countries.  As one economic driver dies, another is born.  While I am very committed to developing programmes for the young, I would also like to see an emphasis on the cohort that can very quickly become long-term unemployed, namely, those whose skills are no longer required by the economy and who remain unemployed for a period of one year or longer.  Somebody who is out of work for a year should be back in a training programme somewhere.  That is a function of the Union.<br/><br/>I wish Bulgaria well with its Presidency.  Our door is always open in this committee and we look forward to seeing the ambassador on a number of occasions over the period of the Presidency.</p></speech>

Mr. Branimir Zaimov" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018011700002#E00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I thank all the Deputies and Senators who have expressed their good wishes to my country and the Presidency we are to hold over the next six months.  I will briefly try to answer some of the questions.</p> <p>  Most of statements by the distinguished Deputies and Senators are in agreement with what I have said.  I would like especially to mention the statement by Senator Craughwell.  I really appreciate his ideas on dividing the refugees from the so-called economic migrants, Bulgaria is one of the front-line countries.  Although we have a long border with Turkey, we do not have as many people crossing over as is the case for Italy or Greece.  We know that this is due not only to the fact that migrants are not so much interested in coming into Bulgaria but rather in going on to the central and western parts of Europe, but also because of the agreement the European Union has with Turkey on border controls.</p> <p>  Although nobody can doubt that there are some problems at the moment with Turkey and the authoritarian regime which exists there, Bulgaria as a neighbour to Turkey is always interested in continuing the dialogue, especially in the aspect of Turkey keeping its obligations to prevent migrants from crossing over its land borders with Bulgaria and Greece.  We are understanding of the plight of the migrants and I am fully supportive of the idea that we should treat all of them in a humane way.  However, there are some concerns among central European countries that a new division should be made between real asylum seekers, who need all our support, and economic migrants who might be trying to reach our borders just for economic gain.  I fully support the proposition by the Senator that we should make a clear distinction between those two categories and that we should try to be more proactive in our approach to migration.  That is one of the priorities of our Presidency.</p><p>I thank Senator Richmond for his statement.  Of course energy security is one of the main topics of our Presidency.  We support the idea of a clean energy package, and the main point in our programme on the energy sector is to contribute to the establishment of a stable energy union in the European Union.  We aim to maximise the possible results of the negotiations with the European Parliament on the clean energy for all Europeans package.</p><p> Coming back to the topic of Brexit, we welcome the progress achieved during the first phase of negotiations on all three main topics.  Citizens' rights have been secured, investment financed by the EU budget has been secured and the peace process and the conditions of North-South co-operation on the island of Ireland have been secured.  The main task, in our view, for the coming months is the adoption of negotiating directives on transitional arrangements by the General Affairs Council, which is supposed to happen on 29 January, and the adoption by the European Council of guidelines on the framework for future relations on 23 March.  The Bulgarian Presidency has already scheduled all Council and COREPER meetings which will lead to the implementation of these tasks.</p><p> If all goes as planned we know the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union should be ready for signature in October 2018.  This gives enough time for ratification and entry into force before March 2019, which is the date set by the British for their withdrawal.  Unfortunately, Bulgaria and Ireland are not happy with the idea of withdrawal and hope something else might be arranged.  However, we still need clarification from the UK side on its intentions with regard to the future of its trade agreement with the EU, because depending on whether it stays in the European market or the customs union, which it has declared it plans to leave, the negotiations, of course, might take another path.  This would lead us to something similar to the trade agreements the European Union has with Canada or South Korea, for example.  If it remains in the Single Market or customs union it will be much easier to negotiate something along the European Union agreement with Norway, which, of course, would be a much better perspective for Ireland and all other EU countries.</p><p> With regard to young people, economic growth and social cohesion are key to the future of Europe.  The future of the Union is to continue efforts for social cohesion.  Our Presidency will work for an active and constructive debate on the multiannual financial framework.  We are aware the world is changing, and overcoming the challenges will require resources.  We are convinced we must look for balance between new and existing funds and between financial instruments and grant financing.</p><p> With regard to security and stability in a strong and united Europe, our Presidency will work towards lasting and fair solutions in the area of asylum policy, as I mentioned, with efficient policies for return and readmission and a balanced approach between short and long-term measures aimed at the source of migration.  We share the opinion of the Irish, which is we should try to deal with the source of migration, that is to say to provide more funds for African and Asian countries which might develop and, thus, stop the flow of migration to Europe by helping them in their development.</p><p> With regard to the topic raised by Deputy Haughey, of course we are aware of the negative reports.  I assure him the Bulgarian Government is treating these reports very seriously.  Very recently, just a week ago, the Bulgarian Parliament adopted a new law in the fight against corruption, which creates a new independent body that will examine corruption in high places. </p><p> We know of similar reports on the topic of migrants and mistreatment.  The Minister of Interior is doing his best to avoid having such accusations in future because some of the stories are, frankly, made up either by migrants or opposition parties in Bulgaria.  The Government is doing its utmost to prevent such stories spreading as fake news.  Bulgaria supported the idea of having migrant quotas.  We wanted to take our quota of migrants at the time, but things have changed and now there are discussions in Brussels on a new way of dealing with this situation.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, I am joined from the Department of Health by Ms Geraldine Luddy, head of the bioethics unit, and Mr. Paul Ivory, assistant principal at the bioethics unit, as well as some colleagues from the HSE: to my left is Mr. Liam Woods, national director for acute operations; Dr. Colm Henry, consultant geriatrician at the Mercy University Hospital, Cork, and national clinical adviser and group lead on acute hospitals; Dr. Jerome Coffey, consultant radiation oncologist at the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network and national director of the national cancer control programme; and Dr. Peter McKenna, former master of the Rotunda Hospital and clinical director of the national women and infants health programme.  I hope to provide the Chairman and these hearings with some background to the Government decision to approve the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017 and to outline briefly the main provisions of the scheme.</p> <p>  It is estimated, as I am sure the committee knows, that one in six couples worldwide experiences infertility at some point in their lives.  The rate of infertility and subfertility is increasing due to a range of both social and lifestyle factors - for example, due to delayed decisions surrounding parenthood to support the pursuit of careers and to ensure financial security - as well as higher rates of obesity and sexually transmitted infections, particularly chlamydia, which can impact a person's reproductive health and fertility.  From the Irish point of view, based on information we have from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the number of cycles for assisted human reproduction, AHR, procedures conducted in fertility clinics in Ireland is increasing.  For example, the provision of treatment has risen from 7,589 cycles in 2009 to almost 9,000 in 2016.</p> <p>  We understand the impact that the issues of infertility and subfertility can have at an individual level.  The ability to conceive a child naturally is a normal human expectation, and a diagnosis of infertility can be a source of severe emotional and psychological distress, discomfort and financial hardship.  These decisions and the impact they can have at a personal level have been brought to the fore in our engagements with various stakeholders on behalf of people with infertility and in the context of developing the general scheme as well as through a number of representations made to us in the Department, in particular to the Minister on behalf of citizens affected by infertility.</p><p>As the committee will be aware, work is ongoing in the Department on proposals for a potential public funding model for AHR treatments, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  The development of the general scheme and the work relating to a possible public funding model for assisted human reproduction, AHR, has generated debate.  While we endeavour to progress these important policy and regulatory issues we are conscious of the direct impact this work will have on individuals.  For example, people listening to these discussions who are currently undergoing AHR treatment, or who may be considering such treatment, may adjust or defer their plans in anticipation of impending policy changes arising from this work.  As such, we understand that we have a responsibility to provide a realistic and reasonable appraisal of what the Department is endeavouring to do in this space and the timelines involved.<br/><br/>The development of reproductive technologies means that children can be created outside of what may be seen as the normal male-female sexual relationship.  Sperm and eggs can now be manipulated and embryos created in laboratories.  While reproductive medicine is one of the most innovative and rapidly developing areas of medicine it also raises challenges from ethical and legal perspectives.  Advances in AHR technologies have increased the number of treatment options available to those affected by infertility and subfertility, for example <i>in vitro</i>fertilisation; the donation of gametes, either sperm or eggs, from third party donors; and surrogacy to name just a few.  The categories of people wishing to access such treatments have also expanded to include heterosexual couples, same-sex couples, single people and people wishing to avoid serious hereditary diseases.  Therefore, from a medical and social perspective, infertility and subfertility represent important issues that require a considered health service response and regulation. <br/><br/>As we know, we currently have no specific legislation in Ireland governing AHR.  There is limited existing regulation relating to the use of gametes and embryos.  In 2006 the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, was designated as the competent authority for SI 158 of 2006, the quality and safety of human tissues and cells regulations, which govern the quality and safety standards in the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells, including gametes and embryos.  These regulations empower the HPRA to authorise and monitor tissue establishments, which include some of the existing fertility clinics.<br/><br/>Of further relevance, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, the CFR Act, reforms and updates family law to address the needs of children living in diverse family types.  Parts 2 and 3 of that Act are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  These parts of the CFR Act, when commenced, will regulate aspects of AHR involving donation of gametes and embryos and are specifically concerned with the parentage rules for children born through donor-assisted human reproduction procedures, obligations applying to facilities providing such procedures and the establishment of a national donor-conceived person register.  We in the Department of Health are preparing draft regulations to facilitate the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the CFR Act 2015, and are working to resolve some final technical issues in order to ensure that the processes associated with these Parts of the Act can be commenced.<br/><br/>While the number of people accessing AHR treatments and services in Ireland is increasing, the provision of these services remains largely unregulated, as I have said.  This means that individuals are availing of often complex and sometimes risky procedures in a legal vacuum.  Legislation is therefore required in order to assist people to have children safely, to clarify the legal position of children born from these practices, and to ensure research and new reproductive technologies are carried out within a prescribed ethical framework.<br/><br/>While the vast majority of AHR treatments and services currently available in Ireland are provided through private AHR clinics, there is a limited specialist AHR service available through the HSE, which provides funding for fertility preservation for cancer patients whose treatment is likely to impact on their future fertility.  The Department intends to work with representatives from the HSE to ensure that there is a coherent approach to the development of the AHR legislation, which is consistent with the existing publicly available cryopreservation service.  In order to support the commencement of this legislation once it is enacted, the Department will work during the course of 2018 in parallel with the HSE to develop a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.  To provide for that we intend to establish an implementation committee to ensure that the drafting of the legislation, the preparation of the above service arrangements and the development of any specific eligibility arrangements that we might approve can all proceed in line with each other to allow for the timely commencement of the legislation. <br/><br/>The scheme we are discussing this morning represents the first time a comprehensive package of measures has been drafted for AHR that includes aspects of research.  The introduction of legislation in this area is a priority for the Minister and affirms the commitment contained in A Programme for a Partnership Government relating to the regulation of AHR and surrogacy.  <br/><br/>Moving on to the detail of the scheme, we adopted three principles to guide our work in this area, namely, the welfare of any children born through assisted human reproduction technologies, which is the most important, safeguarding the health of women undergoing those procedures and the promotion of best clinical practice.  Children born through AHR may be vulnerable as they obviously lack any control over the circumstances of their birth.  For this reason, and in recognition of Article 42A of the Constitution, as well as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR was a key consideration.  Equally, the well-being of women involved in these procedures also requires special attention, as women are the main recipients of AHR interventions due to their biological role in pregnancy and childbirth.  Finally, the promotion of best clinical practice should be standard in any recommendation put forward by the Government and, in the case of AHR, it has also been seen that adhering to this principle can positively impact the safety and well-being of women, for example, in the context of multiple pregnancies.<br/><br/>Officials in the Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in respect of the process of drafting this legislation.  Given the comprehensive scope of the legislation and the ethical, legal and social issues that arise with AHR practices, I anticipate that, as we go along, there will be areas of the scheme that will require further consideration and refinement, as is usual in the drafting of legislation. <br/><br/>The general scheme is comprised of nine parts.  Part 1 deals with standard provisions relating to the legislation such as interpretation and commencement matters.  Part 2 outlines the general principles that apply in the context of all AHR treatments and procedures, including requirements regarding informed consent and counselling, conditions regarding embryo transfer, and considerations involving the welfare of the child.  Part 3 outlines the conditions and restrictions relating to the donation of gametes and embryos for use in AHR treatment by other people, for use in research or both.  It also outlines specific requirements relating to people wishing to access AHR treatment involving donated material.  This part includes specific requirements relating to informed consent and counselling, age restrictions for donors, the prohibition of the donation of embryos other than supernumerary embryos, limits on the use of donated material, the prohibition of commercial gamete and embryo donation and the permitted storage periods that should apply for any gametes and embryos in storage.<br/><br/>Part 4 of the scheme deals with posthumous assisted reproduction, PAR, which involves the use of frozen gametes or embryos from a deceased person to achieve a pregnancy.  These provisions enable a surviving female partner to continue a parental project after the death of her partner, provided specific conditions are fulfilled.  For example, the relevant parties must have received counselling and given their informed consent and a period of time, in this case one year, for grieving has to have elapsed since the death of that relevant partner.  The scheme states that the deceased person would be recognised as a parent of any child born following PAR provided that child is born within 36 months of that person's death.<br/><br/>Part 5 provides for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, PGD; sex selection for medical purposes; and human leucocyte antigen, HLA, matching in the context of AHR treatment, provided certain eligibility or qualifying criteria are fulfilled.  For example, both PGD and sex selection would only be permitted where there is a significant risk of a child being born with a serious genetic disease.  The AHR regulatory authority established by this legislation will be responsible for maintaining a list of genetic diseases for which PGD and sex selection would be permitted.  In respect of HLA matching, the regulatory authority will also maintain a further list of eligible diseases but specific approval from the regulatory authority will be required on a case-by-case basis and will be subject to the consideration of any particular criteria in respect of those cases.<br/><br/>Part 6 outlines the specific conditions under which surrogacy will be permitted in Ireland.  The term surrogacy relates to a situation whereby one woman, that is, the surrogate, agrees to become pregnant, carry and deliver a child on behalf of another individual or couple, that is, the intending parent or parents.  This includes a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the regulatory authority.  This pre-authorisation process will help to safeguard the welfare of the parties involved in the surrogacy agreement, in particular that of any child who may potentially be born as a result of that agreement, as well as that of the surrogate involved.  The scheme sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate - and her husband, if applicable -  to the intending parent or parents.</p><p>Commercial surrogacy raises a number of concerns relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved as well as potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates.  In light of this, the general scheme explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy being conducted in Ireland.</p><p> Part 7 stipulates the conditions under which research involving embryos, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells may be permitted, subject to obtaining a licence from the regulatory authority.  This part prohibits the creation of embryos specifically for research purposes and also prohibits certain practices that may be associated with embryo and stem cell research, for example, reproductive cloning.</p><p> Part 8 provides for the establishment of the AHR regulatory authority and outlines its functions in terms of the oversight and regulation of compliance with the legislation.  This includes the issuing of licences to AHR treatment providers and researchers.  As previously mentioned, the AHR regulatory authority will be essential to the successful implementation of the legislation given the complexity of the issues involved in regulating this area and the rapidly evolving nature of AHR and research technologies.  A key function of the regulatory authority will be the collection of statistical information from AHR providers, beyond that which is currently available, on all AHR activities and their outcomes, such as the number of children born from such procedures.  The collection of this detailed information would enable the regulatory authority to monitor and assess the safety and effectiveness of AHR practices and would also help to inform future policy-making in this area.</p><p> Part 9 outlines the various offences that apply in respect of contravening specific heads within the scheme and stipulates the level of penalty that could apply in each instance.</p><p> I reiterate that the provisions outlined within the scheme and, in particular, the establishment of a dedicated AHR regulatory authority will ensure that AHR practices and research in related areas will be conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight.  As I outlined earlier, the commencement of the legislation is one element of the development of a model of care for infertility, which will ultimately aim to embed the provision of safe, effective and accessible AHR treatments and services into the broader range of obstetric and gynaecological services available through the public health service.</p><p> I thank the committee for undertaking this review of the general scheme.  We are available to answer any questions members may wish to pose.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Reilly is first.</p></speech>

I have provided more detailed questions to which the witnesses might be able to reply in writing.  They are fairly general and any replies would be for my own information.</p> <p>  I have a concern that the prohibition on sex selection other than where there might be a significant risk to the child being born one sex or the other may be hijacked by people seeking to inject a bit of misinformation into the system.  There are people who are opposed to assisted human reproduction.  I will not name them but I am sure the witnesses have an idea of whom I am speaking.  It needs to be made crystal clear - and it is not possible to say it enough - that the purpose of this will not be to engage in some form of gender-based selection and, indeed, that it will not happen save in very discrete and distinct circumstances.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that if possible.</p> <p>  Head 36 relates to surrogacy.  I note the potential for forced surrogacy.  In that scenario, we have all heard stories in the media and I have some experience of hearing first hand about vulnerable migrant women who may have been forced into surrogacy.  Certainly, that has been suggested.  Where this happens and it becomes apparent halfway through the pregnancy, there is very little that can be done.  The pregnancy will proceed.  However, it is a very severe violation of a woman's human rights.  Indeed, it does the poor child no service either.  Can the Department outline what legal provisions can be made and should be to dissuade people from doing that and also to impose punitive sanctions?  What scope is there for including those to ensure that this will not happen?</p> <p>  I raise the these points because there are people who are opposed to the legislation who will settle on any small aspect of it to criticise the whole.  I have had people approach me and I know there are individuals watching who are desperate for the legislation to go through.  We all want to see it go through and we want to see it happen quickly and properly.  If we are to answer the detractors in advance, we need to be able to deal with issues like forced surrogacy and sex selection.  I have submitted further questions and I can wait for the answers in written form.</p></speech>

Can the witnesses comment on how that will be dealt with in the Bill?  Before asking the Department to respond, we will go to the second contributor, who is Senator Colm Burke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018011700002#E00500"><p>I thank the Department's representatives for their presentation and for the work they have done in this area.  I welcome them to the meeting.  It is just information that I am looking for really in the context of the point that, with regard to treatment, there were approximately 9,000 cycles in 2016.  That was within Ireland.  There are also huge numbers of people who travel abroad for treatment.  Do we have any idea of the figure in that regard?  Has any research been done on that?  No matter what regulation we bring in, people will still have the option of travelling abroad.  It is a big issue now due to the costs people are incurring here.</p> <p>  The next issue I want to highlight relates to the cost of medication.  Has an analysis been carried out on the cost of medication here relative to the cost in other EU jurisdictions?  My understanding is that it is extremely expensive and that the cost here is far above that which obtains in other countries.  In introducing the scheme, do we not need to watch carefully to ensure we are not suddenly backed into a corner by pharmaceutical companies which see it as another opportunity to be on the winning side?  It is one of the concerns we need to watch.  As such, I wonder if an analysis has been carried out in that regard.</p></speech>

I take her point on sex selection.  The legislation is very clear that sex selection can only relate to those diseases that are, in effect, inherited diseases relating to the sex genes.  It is not at all for the purpose of choosing whether to have a boy or a girl.</p></speech>

There are also significant provisions with regard to consent and counselling in the context of surrogacy agreements.</p><p>All surrogacy arrangements will have to be pre-authorised by the regulatory authority that is to be set up under the scheme.  We have also said that both the surrogate, as well as her husband if she is married, and the intending parents should take legal advice.  Surrogacy means a woman is going to carry a child for another person and that she does so freely.  For medical issues there is the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act and forcing treatment on a woman is covered by significant penalties in other legislation.  There are checks and balances and the authority will have to authorise the agreement before it can continue.  There are steps at each stage and we have done as much as we can do.</p></speech>

The legislation is clear that the only embryos eligible for donation will be supernumerary ones which have been created through a process of AHR.  The legislation is very clear on the criteria that must be satisfied, either for the purposes of donation or their use in research.  The length of time for which they can be stored is limited to 14 days and clear criteria apply to their disposal.</p></speech>

Some will be used again in another cycle of assisted human reproduction while others may be used for research and others destroyed.  If people wish their embryos to be stored they can be stored for a period of time.  Embryos cannot be created purely for research and research can only be undertaken on embryos that have already been created for AHR treatment and are supernumerary.  There would have to be a submission to the regulatory authority, on a case-by-case basis, for any such research which itself would have to be cleared by the institution or the clinic's ethical committee.</p></speech>

We do not have good information or hard data on any pattern of people travelling outside the State for AHR services.  Some of the advocacy organisations may have a better understanding of that practice.  When we brought the policy proposals to Government in 2015 we did some work on this and some of the data we have suggest the population rate at which AHR takes place in this country is below the average in the rest of Europe, though I would be cautious about interpreting these data in too detailed a way because the rate is not substantially lower.</p> <p>  On the cost issues, we are doing work which we are going to bring back to Government relating to funding and eligibility criteria and I would be happy to elaborate on that.

The advances in medical science are also eagerly awaited and we have all had representations from constituents on the matter.  We have to be positive and constructive and recognise that there are also some pitfalls which we need to avoid so that we can reassure the general public, particularly those who become parents in this context, that everything is in order and regulated for.</p> <p>  How will the regulatory authority be constructed?  I assume legal, medical and scientific interest will have to be represented.  Consent relating to storage and disposal is fine if one can get consent but it may well be that the people concerned are no longer with us.  I would like some clarification on this matter as I am aware of a number cases, internationally, which have been very hard fought in this area.</p> <p>  I assume birth certificates will eventually be as normal, with no reference to the methodology, and I assume they will just show the parents.  Might they also show details of a surrogacy?  I do not want to go into the question on sex selection as it has already been discussed, other than to emphasise the importance of ensuring there is absolute clarity as to what the purpose of the exercise is.  We recognise that, in certain cases, a gene might be carried in one line but not in another and this might be of huge importance to a potential parent in avoiding an inherited difficulty that they might have cause to regret for the rest of their lives.  We need to ensure, however, from an ethical viewpoint that everything is done as it should be done.</p> <p>  There are provisions for relevant parties to have received counselling and to have given their informed consent, and there is a requirement for a one-year grieving period to have elapsed since the partner's death.  Can the witnesses elaborate on that and give the committee an indication of the thinking behind these provisions?  We have an idea of what they are but it is important to explain the detail so that participants and the general public may be reassured.</p> <p>  There were a number of cases, though not in this country, where relationships had broken up and legal cases were taken in which consent was sought after the break-up.  Can the witnesses clarify how we anticipate dealing with such situations?  These things do happen and, under Murphy's law, if it can happen it will happen.</p><p>That is not a reference to my colleague.  Suffice it to say it would be very important to have reassurance in this area.  With all due deference to my legal colleague, who has just left, when there are legal possibilities, they could well become legal realities and major difficulties in what we are trying to do.  We have referred to storage issues and further counselling.  Will the witnesses give some further clarification on age restrictions on donors, which is important?  It will be a matter for query.  The age restriction could be a major issue in some cases.  I have many other questions but we might get some answers to those for a start.</p></speech>

I was very heartened by the start of Dr. Holohan's presentation, when he acknowledged the dire hurt and pain that couples go through to come to this decision to seek help.  I would like to see something with regard to well-being or people's mental health forming part of this, particularly if things do not work out for couples.  They will have gone through a lot to get to this stage and if things do not work at the final stage, it can be very harrowing for couples.  Could something concrete on this be put in at this stage?</p> <p>  What is the timeframe for this scheme?  People may be postponing treatment waiting for this to happen and when we consider the pain they have gone through, such waiting can sometimes be very hard.  Couples may be getting older and if they have reached the decision to do this, they probably want to do it now.  Is it possible to have backdating or retrospective compensation?  I would hate it if people put off seeking treatment because of this not being currently available.</p></speech>

There would be committee structures to deal with some of the kinds of representation and expert input of the kind being asked about.  Ms Luddy will talk us through some of the provisions relating to consent, which is a key process.  Informed consent operates through all the relevant sections of the Act and nothing can happen without the informed consent of all the parties involved in any stage of the process, whether it is in terms of donation, research, etc.</p> <p>  With respect to birth certificates, the scheme provides for a court-based process through which an application can be made either by a parent or both intending parents or the surrogate.  Ultimately, there are powers for a court to issue a parental order, including notice to the registrar of births, marriages and deaths, and there would be provision for changes to be made with respect to birth certs.  Amended birth certs can be issued in line with that change in parental orders.</p></speech>

It might appear to some as an ability for people to make a choice as to whether they have a male or female child but it is very much about limiting the risk of transmission of very significant genetic diseases related to sex chromosomes.  Ms Luddy can deal with the matter of posthumous assisted reproduction.  There was also mention of age considerations and restrictions that apply throughout to the process of donation and assisted human reproduction.  Different age restrictions apply that relate to the evidence we have with respect to biology and likelihood of success etc.  Any differences between the sexes or within one sex in different parts of the legislation all relate to evidence with respect to biology.  We can speak to any of the details that members wish.</p></speech>

Are we mindful of these possibilities and what can we do to try to protect ourselves?</p></speech>

When we devised the scheme, we looked at court cases both here and abroad in order to consider how we would seek consent.  It is informed consent, so people must have information in order to give consent.  There will be counselling as well beforehand.  Whether it is a couple involved or a single woman, there will be full counselling at every stage.  Counselling will give options on what happens after the embryos are created, including what would happen if a relationship breaks up or if there is a donated gamete.  If the embryo is created by donated sperm, the donor would also have to give consent.  We have covered it very clearly, including all the options as to what would happen in the event of a break-up or somebody dying.  That is covered in as much as we can.</p> <p>  We are also conscious that we have a new data protection directive coming, which must be in law by May this year.  There are specific provisions there relating to informed consent and we have taken those into account in the drafting of the scheme.  We will also be drafting the Bill provisions with the Office of the Attorney General and we will make sure that consent provisions are as tight as they can be.</p></speech>

In cases of surrogacy, the scheme does not change the law about who is the mother on the birth of the baby.  In this country, the birth mother is the mother.  That is not changed in surrogacy cases in the scheme.  The surrogate must transfer her right.  If she does not do so, she remains the mother.</p></speech>

This would provide for consideration of what the Deputy was raising about well-being and all of those important issues.</p> <p>  In terms of the timeframe, I hinted earlier that we intend, when we have further work completed on this, to go back to Cabinet in the next two to three months for permission to bring greater certainty to the question of timeframe.  We will be in a better position to set a time.  Our intention would be, because it will take time if we go along the road that we are going with the legislation and to provide for the commencement of that legislation, for the public services to build up but also to have a mechanism that, at the point of commencement of that legislation, does not have people who would otherwise be eligible for the service waiting for those public health services to be developed.  Given that it will take time with the best of intentions to develop the capacity in the public system to get it to the point that we would like it to be, we would want to see the commencement of those services.  I would not put a date on it right now.  That is one of the matters that we will talking to the Minister and Cabinet about, and on which we intend the Minister will bring proposals before the end of this quarter.</p></speech>

The consent process is all the way along with the surrogate and the intending parents, and the regulatory authority will have a pre-authorised agreement, but the actual transfer of the parentage will happen in a court.  It is a very robust system that we have put in place.  The transfer of parentage will only happen before a judge in a court.  It is to protect both the intending parents and the surrogate.  It is quite a robust system that we have put in place.</p></speech>

To deal with the last bit, the suitability assessment will be part of it in accordance with best clinical practice.  One of the principles that we talked about will apply, that persons are appropriately selected and have a health profile.</p> <p>  On age, there are specific age parameters in the legislation for both males and females in respect of various aspects, whether it is for donation or whether it is for access to the services.  Did Ms Luddy want to add to that?</p></speech>

We do not have a specific age limit for a man, and that is purely because of biology, evidence and everything else.  Obviously, as the CMO has said, it is down to a clinical assessment and the reasonable opinion of the medical practitioner who is dealing with the couple or individuals as to what is the most appropriate treatment.</p></speech>

Different countries have different regulations.  There is not any proposal at this stage, from a European point of view, to have a common set of rules across Europe.  Are there any discussions at European level on that issue?</p> <p>  It refers back to my earlier question about people travelling abroad.

We do not have that on either assisted human reproduction or surrogacy.  We can only legislate for what takes place in this State.</p> <p>  It is being examined at a European level.  The Commission has formed a group.  The WHO is also looking at it because it is a difficulty, particularly for commercial surrogacy.  We all will have heard of countries, such as India, where there are many issues with women who are put forward as surrogates.  On the other hand we are aware that there are problems around it, because we have a system where couples go abroad, come back to Ireland after having a surrogacy arrangement abroad and need to get passports and register citizenship for the children.  We hope there will be some more European level jurisdiction legislation on it but at present there is not.</p></speech>

I remind members - and myself - to please switch off mobile phones as they interfere with recording equipment.  I have received no apologies.  The purpose of this meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality is to consider a Government motion to exercise the right to opt in, pursuant to Protocol 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to a measure in the civil justice area.  The proposal is to accept Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection.  I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his officials this morning.  I will now invite the Minister to address the motion before us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.207" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018011700002#A00300"><p>As this is the first meeting I have had the pleasure to attend in 2018, I acknowledge the work of the committee over the past 12 months and I wish everybody a happy and productive new year.  That said, I am pleased to be here before the committee today to present the Government's proposal that the State opts into the EU recast Reception Conditions Directive under the terms of Protocol 21, annexed to the EU treaties.</p> <p>  At the outset, I reiterate that the directive that is under discussion pertains to asylum seekers.  An asylum seeker is a person who comes to Ireland seeking international protection status - refugee status or subsidiary protection status - under international law on grounds that they fear persecution in their own country for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion or where they would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to their country of origin.  When an asylum seeker comes to Ireland seeking international protection status, the person enters a legal process.  Opting into this directive will align that process fully with European Union norms and it will be an important and progressive step that reaffirms our commitment to continue to implement our programme of reforms to Ireland's international protection system.  Reforming the protection process began with inviting Judge Bryan McMahon and a group of experts to review our protection system, including supports for applicants.  They made 173 recommendations and the Government committed to undertake a process of reform that has seen positive action across many Departments and services to improve what we do for people in need of protection and the way in which we do that important job.</p> <p>  The Government has made a strong commitment to playing its part in addressing the refugee crisis arising from the protracted conflict in Syria.  The committee is also aware of our voluntary opt-in to the European Union resettlement and relocation programmes, which will see 4,000 people coming to Ireland to begin a new life here and the commendable work of our Naval Service, which has come to the aid of those fleeing conflict as they perilously cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe.  As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am particularly familiar with our international aid programmes and the committee will be aware that since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis.  I want to clarify any misunderstanding that might arise in respect of those fleeing conflict in Syria.  Those who come to Ireland from conflict zones have come under the Irish refugee protection programme.  Some of those involved with the resettlement programme arrive with refugee status.</p><p>Others are part of the relocation programme.  They will have their status quickly, usually within a period of three months.  Separately, based on the current situation, those who come to Ireland of their own volition and make an application for international protection upon arrival, and often times done spontaneously, generally come from different areas and regions and not from Syria.  At the moment, for example, Georgia, Albania, Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Nigeria constitute the top five countries of origin for applicants for international protection who present, in a spontaneous manner, at our borders or frontiers.  </p><p> Like many Members, I am concerned about the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process awaiting a final decision.  To address this issue, the Government undertook the biggest single reform of our legislation by introducing a single applications procedure under the International Protection Act 2015 - the most significant reform of our international protection procedure in over ten years.</p><p> Ensuring that we have a simplified and efficient independent protection process is part of our commitment to reform.  The other part is to ensure that we continue to improve the living conditions and the opportunities for regular family life, in so far as possible, for applicants and their families while they await a final decision on their application for protection. Many of the McMahon recommendations go to the heart of the issue.  I am pleased that we have responded positively to enable enhanced family living in our accommodation centres and in the range of supports and services that we provide to international protection applicants.</p><p> I want to inform the committee that the McMahon group continues to be actively involved in the process of reforming direct provision, including, for example, by playing a role in the standards development process that is currently under way.  This process is being led by senior officials in my Department.   Those who participated in the McMahon process are giving of their expertise to ensure that the standards under development for direct provision centres result in concrete improvements and greater consistency across the system. I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their ongoing contribution.</p><p> When the Supreme Court gave its judgment in the N.V.H. case on 30 May last, the outcome was that the court declared section 16(3)(b) of the International Protection Act, which prohibits access to employment without any temporal limit for applicants, to be unconstitutional in a protection process.  The Government could have chosen to interpret this decision narrowly.  We could have simply amended the provision prohibiting access to the labour market in the Act by way of primary legislation. Instead, the Government listened to the calls from Deputies and Senators, members of this committee and others, the McMahon group and NGOs that Ireland should align its bespoke system with European norms.  It decided that the State would give effect to the judgment by way of opting into the EU recast reception conditions directive.  In doing so, the Government has chosen to be ambitious and to enhance and protect the rights of international protection applicants and their families.  We are using the opportunity afforded to us by the Supreme Court's decision to continue our programme of reforms undertaken since 2014.  The directive not only provides a framework for effective access to the labour force but reaches into many other areas, which the Government feels it is timely to have validated by the European Commission that we do reach and comply with European standards.</p><p> In addition to labour market access, the directive also includes important provisions on children's rights, health, education and material reception conditions for applicants, which includes housing, food, clothing and a daily expenses allowance.  Participation in the directive will place the provision of material reception conditions for applicants, which are currently provided under the executive system of direct provision, on a statutory basis, underpinned by EU law, for the first time.  I am aware that some of the committee members have called for this action publicly in previous debates in the Houses.  I do not wish to predetermine the outcome of the Oireachtas approval process as part of the opt-in procedure to the directive but, if approved, the State will be required to fully demonstrate its compliance with all of the provisions of the directive to the European Commission before it confirms our participation in the directive.  This will be a rigorous and transparent process, which will allow us to align the supports and reception conditions provided to applicants with the norms across the rest of the European Union's  member states.  I can assure the committee members that we will make any changes required of us by the European Commission in order to confirm our compliance.  We are committed to this process.  My Department is leading an implementation group, established by the Government, to oversee the opt-in procedure and the compliance process within the timeframe set by the Commission, which is a period of four months.</p><p> The directive provides for access to the labour market for applicants who have not had a first instance decision within nine months of making their application, and provided that the delay cannot be attributed to the applicant.  In determining the level of access to be provided to applicants, the implementation group, membership of which is drawn from across a wide range of Departments and services, will be cognisant of a number of important factors.</p><p> The State already has a functioning employment permits system for third country nationals, which we must be careful not to unduly interfere with and certainly not to undermine.  Nor must we take any action, which would be detrimental to our legal migration system and the court's judgment acknowledges our role in setting these parameters.  However, we all recognise that the Supreme Court has adjudged that protection applicants have constitutional rights, one of which is to seek employment, a right that is not conferred on other third country nationals who legally reside in the State.</p><p> While the court was also clear that this is not an unfettered right, the Government and I consider that it is appropriate to apply a balanced approach under the scope of the directive where access required will be in excess of that provided under our employment permits system.  Once the State's participation in the directive is confirmed, I intend to provide for access for eligible applicants by way of an immigration permission, which would exempt applicants from the employment permits system and the associated fee.  In determining the list of sectors of employment to which access will be granted, regard will be had to labour market gaps, as well as the skills set of applicants and the expert advice of front-line Departments.  We must also be cognisant of any potential pull factors this might create, including consideration of the impact of the withdrawal of our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, from the European Union.</p><p> The outcome of the current review of the employment permits system by the Department of Business,  Enterprise and Innovation, which is expected to be finalised in April, will be an important consideration and will also inform these deliberations.  Government has agreed that eligible applicants will also have access to self­employment and eligible applicants will now qualify for further vocational training, which was previously unattainable.</p><p> At the Supreme Court hearing in November last, the State outlined its plans to the court to opt into the directive, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, and the four-month process necessitated by the European Commission to confirm the opt-in following formal notification of our wish to be bound by the directive.  We, respectfully, asked the court to adjourn making its final order until this process was completed.  However, the court was not minded to grant this request and decided that the prohibition on international protection applicants accessing the labour market, under the International Protection Act 2015, would be struck down on 9 February of this year.  The participation of the State in the directive will not be confirmed by the court's deadline as we await the committee's support and approval by the Oireachtas.  As a result, access to the labour market for applicants will now take place under a two-stage process.  Intensive work is under way to pave the way for the implementation of the directive pending its formal entry into force.  I will announce further details in the coming weeks following further consultation with my Government colleagues.  In making this process a success I want to engage with this committee.  I want to work with the committee, NGOs, employers and all of the other stakeholders in this process.</p><p> In conclusion, I believe that participation in the directive would be a positive step forward in bringing our international protection system and supports for applicants more closely in line with EU norms and standards.  It should be noted that there are some areas of the directive, particularly around health and education where we already apply more favourable provisions than would be required and these will be maintained.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and I are committed to ensuring that our protection process is fit for purpose, and that applicants are treated humanely and with the dignity that they deserve while their application is being decided.  We also aim to reduce the backlogs and to issue a first instance decision within a period of nine months for the majority of applicants.</p><p> I hope that this committee and the entire Oireachtas will look favourably on the proposed opt-in and the benefits which it would quickly bring to applicants and their families.  I look forward to the debate and my officials and I are happy to deal with any questions and queries.  </p></speech>

I wish to make a point about the right to seek employment, which was one of the elements that was referenced.  It is not only the members of this committee who have reflected on the issue in previous D&aacute;il contributions.  The committee made a substantive recommendation about the right to the Minister's office during the course of the previous 12 months.</p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly was the first to indicate and other members may indicate.  I shall call Deputies O'Callaghan, Chambers and &Oacute; Laoghaire in that order but first to speak is Deputy Daly. </p></speech>

I welcome that we are finally opting into the reception conditions directive.  However, we should point out that it was published 15 years ago.  It was beefed up five years ago.  Asylum seekers used to have the right to work in this State.  It was taken away from them 20 years ago.  For the guts of those 20 years we have been an outlier on this issue.  We would still be, if it was not for the intervention of the Supreme Court.  I welcome its decision because, without it, we would still be denying the right to work to asylum seekers as punishment for having the cheek to try to assert their rights under the Geneva Convention.</p> <p>  It is apparent that the Government seems intent on imposing the maximum wait period possible of nine months before an asylum seeker can have access to the labour market.  This is in sharp contrast to Greece and Sweden who allow immediate access for asylum seekers to the labour market.  Italy has a two month wait.  Germany and other countries have six months.  I am not saying that those countries are perfect.  However, I would like to hear a bit more on the maximum nine months wait.  We are doing the absolute minimum and I do not think that is good enough.  </p> <p>  The Minister's statement says that those who receive a first instance recommendation within nine months of applying for asylum, and who avail of the right up to appeal or review, will have no right to access the workforce before a final determination is made in their favour.  I note that the directive says "access to the labour market shall not be withdrawn during appeals processes".  Can the Minister clarify whether this means that refugees who appeal a recommendation before nine months are up will not have the right to work?  Does it mean that only a person who is in the labour market, gets a recommendation and then launches an appeal will be allowed to continue working?  If the answer to that is "yes", how does this square with the spirit of the directive and the Supreme Court ruling?  </p> <p>  Will I put all the questions together Chair?  </p></speech>

The statement says that member states that have opted in can require the applicant to contribute towards the cost of accommodation, and so on, if the applicant has sufficient resources, including if they have been working for a reasonable period.  The directive seems to set the bar of sufficiency as being to "enable their subsistence".  I have a lot of concern that asylum seekers, who probably do not have very much at all, will be judged by the State to have sufficient means and then denied help.</p> <p>  I am looking for an assurance from the Minister in terms of what level of sufficiency we are looking at.  We know at the moment, in direct provision, the bed and board deduction leaves the asylum seeker with &euro;21.60.  Dear God.  In any case, when we go to this system, are they going to be paying that cost plus a contribution to the profit of the provider?  How will that be adjudicated?  The direct provision allowance is not on a statutory footing.  It is unclear how we intend to proceed in terms of the so-called sufficient criteria in a transparent way.  Is there a plan to means test all asylum seekers?  How will that be done?  </p> <p>  I will add to my last two points in my next question.  Will those asylum seekers who do enter the labour market and are subsequently made unemployed be entitled to full social welfare payments, sickness benefit, maternity allowance and so on?  Could we have some clarification?  </p> <p>  Nasc, the Irish immigrant support centre, and others who have been hugely helpful to this committee in terms of our recommendation that the right to work should be delivered as quickly as possible to asylum seekers, points out that another huge area of concern is the temporary scheme that will be set up until the directive is in place.  Applicants access to the work market is going to be incredibly limited.  They have to apply under the Work Permits Act 2003.  In short, that means that applicants will have to attain employment with an annual salary of &euro;30,000 a year.  There are huge excluded categories.  On top of that, the cost is &euro;500 for a six month permit and &euro;1,000 for an annual permit.  It might be temporary but there is a lack of clarity in the briefing note and in the opening statement.  I refer to whether the retrospective application of the right to work will still apply to all asylum seekers regardless of the date of their application once the directive is in.  It is the phrase "during this period" on the last page of the Minister's remarks that raised this concern.  Can the Minister clarify what the final right to work will look like and what the Government is considering in terms of the excluded categories mentioned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018011700002#C00800"><p>I want to acknowledge the support of Deputy Daly.  In respect of the questions raised, the position of nine months was a decision that Government took having regard to the situation across Europe.  The Deputy mentioned a number of countries that have a different timescale.  We were conscious here of the situation in our nearest neighbour in Britain.  I refer in particular to Brexit and having regard to the common travel area and the common travel arrangements that we intend to see continuing after the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  Nine months was considered appropriate in order to ensure that we were in a position to manage that situation adequately and properly.  I refer to our numbers and the new regime.</p> <p>  There will be an appeal process.  Once a decision has been made, and once that decision is under appeal, it is not considered likely that during that appeal process the right to work will be applicable.  The decision has been made within the period of nine months.  I would like to keep the timeframe to an absolute minimum and ensure that every effort would be made, in the context of the legal position, to have a decision made within a period of nine months.  That decision would be conclusive.  After a period of nine months, should a decision not be forthcoming, then the right to work would apply.  </p> <p>  There is no requirement on foot of the Supreme Court decision to extend access to the social welfare system to applicants for international protection.  However, the Deputy will be aware that, under the existing arrangements, international protection applicants with a right to seek employment may have an entitlement to the following social protection supports.  That is the family income supplement for families with children, payment of PRSI by persons in employment, leading over time to eligibility to other benefits such as jobseekers benefit, illness benefit, invalidity and access to public employment services.  </p> <p>  I refer to the question of working applicants making a contribution toward the cost of the direct provision.  There is the implementation group that I have mentioned.  This issue is currently being examined by that implementation group.  The intention is that a reasonable approach would be adopted, taking into account the position of applicants in direct provision accommodation.  I refer also to the needs of the wider workforce.  Should this committee wish to make a submission to the implementation group, I am sure that will be given due consideration.  I would be happy to keep the committee informed.  </p> <p>  On the matter of the payment or the entitlement, this will be examined by the implementation group.</p></speech>

The court made its declaration then and gave the State six months to get its act together.  The response came on 30 November.  From what the Minister has said in his speech, it appears that the court was not receptive to the idea of waiting until the legislation was in place, and ruled that on 9 February 2018 the law will be struck down.  What will applicants be able to do on 10 February that they cannot do now?  Will they be able to look for work?  How is the change going to manifest itself on 10 February, the day after the declaration of unconstitutionality becomes operative?</p></speech>

I believe it is important that every effort is made to ensure that the process is as streamlined as possible and the delays are minimised.  A period of nine months is considered not undesirable.  I am very keen to ensure that every application is dealt with within that period of time.  I am also keen to ensure that we look at how best to reduce that period, having regard to the legal entitlement of any applicant to engage in a process of appeal or judicial review, should the applicant or their legal advisors deem that appropriate.  Within a period of nine months, I would like to see all applicants dealt with and initial decisions made on their cases.</p></speech>

Everyone wants to have the initial decision made within a period of nine months.  Can we do anything to speed up the review process that follows if somebody decides to seek judicial review before the courts?  Has the Minister contemplated appointing more judges to deal with this, given the lists of asylum seekers outstanding?</p></speech>

Part of what the Minister has discussed is still unclear.  There will obviously be a vacuum after 9 February.  How long will the projected timeframe for the implementation of these measures be?  That is unclear.  For how long does the Minister expect the interim arrangement he has proposed to be in existence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018011700002#D02000"><p>The Government has set up an implementation group which will oversee the Oireachtas approval process.  I would expect that to happen pretty shortly.  Following that will be the four-month compliance procedure with the European Commission.  That will commence following the formal notification of our wish to enter into the directive and be consequently bound by it.  Approval is a matter for the Oireachtas, but it would be on my recommendation.  If it is approved, I would expect the scheme to be in operation by June.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018011700002#D02100"><p>There are obviously many delays for applicants through the Minister's Department and the process within it.  Does he think that the projected nine-month application process is achievable?  Can the Minister give the committee an indication of some of the current wait times?  The experience of many of my own constituents, who apply for various visas and other immigration matters, is that the period is in fact beyond a year in many cases.  I have concerns that the nine-month timeline the Minister is proposing will not be achievable, based on other examples I have seen.</p></speech>

Currently, the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT, has up to 80 tribunal members, as against the former membership of 30.  There is a backlog in the International Protection Office, IPO, of approximately 5,000, which is not inconsiderable.  However, everybody associated with the project is anxious to make sure that this is dealt with.  I am most anxious to ensure that the nine-month period is achievable, and that is my intention.</p></speech>

Could somebody take a case if a decision is not made within nine months, or is that just the Minister's preferred period?</p><p>We should work on that.  Obviously, to be bound by legislation would not allow for particular situations which may, from time to time arise, on the basis of an application; be it a technical issue or special circumstance that might involve a timeframe which is not within the nine month period.  The stated aim is to have applications dealt with within that timeframe.</p></speech>

Across the Minister's own Department we see that people face serious delays which is having an impact on their capacity to live a normal life in the State.  We should set down a legislative timeframe in the context of the transposition of this directive.</p></speech>

That will be the target timeframe.  On the matter of Oireachtas approval, I note that the formal notification letter to the Council and the Commission will be sent immediately after the Oireachtas makes its decision, if, indeed, it does.  The four-month compliance procedure will then commence.  If the notification letter is sent at the beginning of February, we can expect our participation under the directive to commence towards May with formal entry into force in early June.  I assure the committee that this will be an intensive piece of work with the Commission to ensure we demonstrate that we are compliant with all of the articles of the directive.</p></speech>

Some of the questions so far have already clarified the situation in so far as it can be clarified.  Certainly, until the legislation is in place, things could be quite messy.  Much of the language in the notes gives the appearance of enthusiasm for and anxiousness to reform the area whereas in reality the Government is seeking to put a brave face on the fact that it was defeated in the courts and was, in essence, forced to legislate.  In doing so, it appears the minimum possible is to be provided for.  I agree with Deputy Clare Daly on the times involved and I am concerned, while there is no specific note, at the Minister's statement that in determining the list of sectors of employment to which access will be granted, regard will be had to labour market gaps as well as the skills sets of applicants and the expert advice of frontline Departments.  We should not be doing this to plug gaps in the labour market.  This is a matter of human rights and the ability of people seeking international protection to integrate into our community.  We should not be looking at restricting access to the labour market to a small number of sectors and there should be a wide right of access to work.  If there are to be restrictions, they should be absolutely minimal.</p> <p>  Other questioners have received answers on the timescales.  The interim arrangement sounds potentially messy.  Is the Minister aware of whether transposing the directive will require legislative changes beyond access to the labour market?  Will there be other primary legislation beyond legislation on access to the labour market to transpose the directive?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018011700002#E00500"><p>This will be a very positive and progressive action.  We spoke about labour market access but the directive includes important provisions on the rights of children in respect of health and education.  The Government has decided to go beyond what is simply required of it in the matter of the Supreme Court decision.  As part of the opt-in procedure, we are going beyond the parameters of the Supreme Court in order to incorporate the directive, which will be seen as a very positive move.  The issue of sectors of employment is one the implementation group is carefully considering.  Under the directive, member states must provide for what is described as "effective access to the labour market".  I do not disagree with what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said.  While regard will be had to what are described as "labour market gaps", there will also be consideration of the skills sets of applicants and those seeking employment.  I am anxious to ensure that every effort is made to create a broadly based scheme.  We are anxious to ensure that the temporary scheme in the interim period will reflect as closely as possible what the directive allows.  We will not be required to introduced primary legislation because of the opt-in which will be done by way of statutory instrument.  The implementation group is working on these areas.  Obviously, this goes beyond the Department of Justice and Equality and there is also an important role for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The current review is expected to be finalised in April.  I assure the committee that eligible applicants will also have access to self-employment.  I mentioned in my speech the importance of vocational training which is not currently available.</p></speech>

The directive does not deal solely with labour market access and, as the Minister said, there are a number of other areas including children's rights to health and education.  Some of those areas may well be covered by existing Irish legislation, but my question is whether any of the directive's requirements other than labour market access will require new legislation.</p></speech>

I do not have a question but I record my slight disappointment that the period from which asylum seekers can work will be set at nine months.  The Minister said he wanted to align fully with European norms on this, which is great, but research from the Irish Refugee Council shows that most EU member states provide for a right to work after six months or less.  I ask the Minister to consider in particular the huge mental health benefits of being able to work, in particular where a person is in direct provision.</p></speech>

Having regard to the fact that when the UK leaves the European Union our relationship with the UK will still be very much governed by the common travel arrangements, I would be concerned if there was a significant divergence between our regime and a set of laws in the United Kingdom.  That is why I am anxious to keep the period here as close as possible to that in the UK with respect to nine months and 12 months.</p></speech>

We would have had a fair degree of contact directly with people in direct provision.  With respect to the Minister's temporary measure whereby people will be able to apply under the Work Permit Act 2003, we have not met any people who will be able to avail of that.  As for the notion that they would be able to get jobs that pay &euro;30,000 a year or come up with &euro;500 for six months, they must be hiding somewhere because we certainly have not seen them.</p> <p>  Given that the Supreme Court has ruled that it will be unconstitutional to bar those people from working after 9 February, has the Minister sought legal advice given that at least 99% of those people will not have any opportunity to avail of the ruling of the Supreme Court?  Has the Government sought legal advice around that?  Has it no fear of reprisal or of people seeking to have justice restored at a later date?</p></speech>

I am also anxious that the entire process be as streamlined as possible and that people will know at any early date, in so far as possible, what the various timeframes will be.  On 9 February, for the first time, applicants will come within the term of "foreign national" for the purposes of our employment law.  The normal fee is &euro;500 for a general employment permit valid up to six months and &euro;1,000 for a duration of six to 24 months and conditions of employment will apply as it will for all third country nationals.  Once the directive is confirmed, I intend to provide for access to the labour market for applicants by way of immigration permission.  That, in effect, would exempt applicants from the employment permits system and any associated fee, which, in the circumstances, will be helpful.</p></speech>

If a first instance decision has not been taken within that period of nine months and if no delay can be attributed to the applicant, that person will be entitled to avail of the framework of the directive and apply for a job.

For example, if this is all done and dusted on 30 June, will the people who are in direct provision since 30 June 2017 automatically be able to get work there and then or will having already served their time, or will they have to wait nine months and apply for the opportunity to work?</p></speech>

We would not be starting the clock on the nine months from 30 June.  I expect that anybody in the system who has their application in train for a period of nine months, without a decision having been made in the first instance, would immediately be in a position to benefit from the new regime.</p></speech>

As the scheme will not be done and dusted on 10 February and it will not have gone through the Oireachtas, and given that the Minister is introducing a wall that these people will not be able to get over, what is the main thinking behind not allowing them to be able to avail of work there and then on 10 February?  What is the main Government thinking behind this arrangement whereby it will make it impossible for them to get work until this is all done and dusted perhaps sometime in June?</p></speech>

We will be working with the European Commission in order to ensure that we fully comply with that process.  I would not expect that we would be making any premature decisions prior to our entry into the EU framework but I would expect that from June the new regime will be firmly established and people who have been in the system for a period of nine months will then be in a position to apply to work.  Also, by the expiry of that time, we will have completed our discussions and deliberations across the implementation group with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Employment and other stakeholders and we will have arrived at a list of categories which will be available for all applicants to consider having regard to their own skills set.</p></speech>

It is important that there would be a regulatory framework.  It is unlikely that we would have that until we are satisfied that the European Commission is of the view that we have complied with and are in a position to opt in fully with the EU directive.  That is the framework under which we intend operating here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018011700002#G00100"><p>The entire process seems to be deliberately confusing which is not a good development, but the impression is being given that nine months is the maximum amount of time anyone will have to wait before being able to access the labour market because the first instance decision will be made within that period and if he or she is allowed to stay, he or she will be able to work or, if not, he or she will be able to work after nine months.  However, that is not entirely true because if the first instance decision is made within nine months and is under appeal, he or she will not be allowed to access the labour market.  The point I made was that that was in contradiction with the directive, which states the appeals process should not impede a person's ability to access the labour market.  Can we do something to sort out the anomaly or is it in place deliberately?</p> <p>  My other question is about the temporary period about which I am now even more concerned because it is obvious - I do not say this in a smart way - that nobody will be able to access the labour market on 10 February because no one is sitting around with money in the bank and no one will give him or her a job on a salary of &euro;30,000.  We do not know all of the jobs from which people are excluded.  Most of the jobs for which they could apply will probably be excluded.  The Minister has said that when the directive is in place, the fees linked with work permits will be removed, but will all of the other restrictions be removed?  For example, will the exclusion list - we do not know what jobs are on it - still be in place?  If it will, I accept that someone will not have to pay the fees, but we could probably count on one hand the jobs for which he or she will be able to apply.  That is a concern.</p></speech>

I would look at it as being a very positive step, rather than, as the Deputy described it, an exclusion list.</p> <p>  When an appeal is made after a period of nine months, there will be an entitlement to work.  The issue will arise where an appeal is made within the nine month period.  It is not envisaged that the appellants will be covered by our interpretation of the directive.</p></speech>

I believe they should be and would like the issue to be examined.  The Minister has drawn up a list and said if someone is a forensic scientist, a nurse, a vet, a doctor and so on, he or she can apply for a job, but if he or she is a chef, an ordinary Joe or whatever else, he or she will not be able to apply for a job.  That is an exclusion list.</p></speech>

If there is a shortage of chefs, presumably the Government will include them in the list, but my point is that that is what we are doing.  We are allowing people to work in areas in which there is a shortage of people with a particular skill set, but many people will be excluded from applying for more ordinary jobs where a particular skill set is not required.  However, they still need the money and the dignity that comes with having the ability to work.</p></speech>

I remind Deputies that as we are in public session, all mobile phones should be switched off as they cause interference with the recording equipment.  The meeting has been convened to resume Committee Stage of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his officials to the meeting.  When we last addressed the legislation, we were considering amendment No. 8 under section 2.  The amendment is grouped with amendments Nos. 84, 85, 162 to 172, inclusive, 175 to 179, inclusive and 181 to 183, inclusive.  While we had commenced to address the grouping, it is appropriate to reopen the opportunity to discuss amendment No. 8 in the names of Deputies Jim O'Callaghan and Jack Chambers.  Accordingly, I invite either Deputy to outline once again the purpose of their proposed amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#A00500"><p>Amendment No. 8 is linked with a number of others, which I have just looked at.  A lot of them are in my name and some are in the name of Deputy Wallace.  The purpose of amendment No. 8 and many of the others in the grouping is to simplify the process set out by the Minister in the Bill.  From the last occasion, it may be recalled that one of the arguments I made was that a very complicated statutory scheme has been set out.  The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to try to simplify it.  The reason I say it is complicated is that under the Bill there are a number of committees.  There is a procedures committee and another section refers to a "relevant committee".  The procedures committee is supposed to set out the procedures for the operation of judicial advisory board.  The purpose of the amendment is to simplify matters to make it one board.  It is not a body which is appointing hundreds of people each year.  The Minister may have more accurate figures, but I think it will be ten to 15 appointments to the Judiciary each year.  What is the point of having a procedures committee and some other one?  I know there is a dispute about who should be on the body, but let us just put together a body which makes decisions as to who should be recommended for judicial appointment.</p><p>It is for that reason, in amendment No. 8, we seek to delete the definition of the Procedures Committee in section 2, which states the &quot;&quot;Procedures Committee&quot; has the meaning assigned to it by <i>section 19(1)</i>.&quot;<br/><br/>Amendment No. 84 is in the name of Deputy Wallace and amendment No. 85 is in the names of Deputies Sean Sherlock and Mick Wallace.  One can see that after amendment No. 85 that the proposal put forward by myself and Deputy Jack Chambers is that section 19 should be deleted.  Section 19, on page 17, deals with the &quot;Procedures Committee and other committees of Commission&quot;.  Again, the purpose of our proposal is to simplify the matter.<br/><br/>I might as well deal with the other amendments in this group now rather than have to talk about them later.  Amendment No. 162, in section 53, states: &quot;In page 36 to delete lines 2 to 5.&quot;  Again, the amendment seeks to remove references to the Procedures Committee and to remove, in particular, the first part of section 53(1) where the Procedures Committee can &quot;consult with the President of each court&quot;.  If one is going to get rid of the Procedures Committee then there is obviously no need to do that.<br/><br/>Amendments Nos. 163 to 165, inclusive, relate to section 53.  They also seek to delete references to the Procedures Committee.<br/><br/>In terms of Section 55, Deputy Jack Chambers and I have proposed amendments Nos. 166 to 172, inclusive.  Again, they deal with the preparation of statements under the Act and the role of the Procedures Committee.  <br/><br/>Amendments Nos. 175 to 179, inclusive, seek to get rid of references to the Procedures Committee.  Again, what will be mentioned simply is that it will be the Commission as opposed to the Procedures Committee.  <br/><br/>Members will note that Deputy Jack Chambers and I oppose section 56 in its entirety.  We oppose it because we do not think there is a necessity to include section 56 if it is the case that the Procedures Committee will be removed.  <br/><br/>Finally, amendments Nos. 181 to 183, inclusive, are the last amendments in my name and that of Deputy Jack Chambers in this group of amendments and they concern section 58.  Again, they refer to the review by the Procedures Committee and recommendations.  We have proposed that we should, in amendments Nos. 181 to 183, inclusive, remove the reference to the Procedures Committee and substitute the word &quot;Commission&quot;.<br/><br/>We have tabled many amendments but they all seek to do the same thing - remove references to the Procedures Committee and just have the Commission perform the function.  Our rationale is that it is complicated to have a separate committee within a commission, which is already doing a fairly net short job.  That is my overview of the grouped amendments.  I know the group of amendments contained a number of amendments tabled by Deputy Wallace but I think they are on the same topic and seek to have the same effect.  </p></speech>

I am not sure the extent to which we need to go back over, in its entirety, the debate on the last occasion that took place on group three.  Of course, I accept the need for a refresher, which we have had from Deputy O'Callaghan.</p> <p>  On the last occasion, just looking at the transcript, I had given my response to the various amendments in group three, which seek to remove from the Bill references to the Procedures Committee, the creation of the Procedures Committee, the role of the Procedures Committee, and the function of the Procedures Committee.  I had indicated that I was not minded to accept the amendments because I do not accept the Opposition's view, or the proposers of the amendments' view, that the structure envisaged under the Bill is overly complicated and overly cumbersome.  I believe it is important that we have a Procedures Committee under section 12(2), and that that committee would approve its statement of selection procedures and its statements of appropriate skills and attributes for inclusion in the published statement.  That performance of the functions of a Procedures Committee is under section 19.  </p> <p>  I want to reiterate the importance of the setting up of the Procedures Committee and, indeed, the functions of the Procedures Committee.  I have to say that I would regard this committee as being a core element of the Bill and I am not inclined to accept the change in approach, as proposed by the Deputies.  I did, on the last occasion, make reference to amendment No. 84 by Deputy Wallace and amendments No. 85 by Deputies Sherlock and Wallace.  Again, amendments Nos. 84 and 85 seek to remove from section 19(2) and 19(5) the stipulation that the procedures committee or, indeed, any other committee should contain a majority of lay members and, indeed, a lay chair, as determined by the commission.   Without reopening the debate, Chair, let me just say, as succinctly as possible, that I reject the import of the amendments because I do not accept that the structure envisaged under the Bill is unduly complicated, and I think this is a really important committee within the legislation.  Therefore, I am unable to accept the amendments.  </p></speech>

The rationale for removing the requirement that the Chairperson be lay was explained earlier.  Similarly, the other amendments allowed the commission to regulate itself for the reasons set out earlier as well.  The Bill focuses too much on having a lay majority.  We may well end up with a procedural committee with a lay majority and a sub-committee with a lay majority.  However, I do not see the need to require them in advance in legislation.  My colleagues and I have proposed that the chairpersons are selected by the committees themselves thus giving them a bit more independence.</p> <p>  The Bar Council submission refers to the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and its statement that the procedure for the appointment of judges should be transparent and independent in practice.  The authority taking the decision on the selection and career of judges should be independent of the Government and the Administration.  In order to safeguard its independence, rules should ensure that, for instance, its members are selected by the Judiciary and that the authority decides itself on its procedural rules.  That shows that the Bar Council encourages greater independence.  </p> <p>  I believe that there has been a deliberate focus on the lay versus legal aspect.  Obviously this Bill was very much driven by Lord Ross.  He argued that this legislation would de-politicise how judges are appointed and diminish the legal powers over same but, in fact, that completely depends on the lay people appointed.  If we want to stop this but have the usual types and civil servants, then they will be creatures of politics.  The measure will not remove political influence from this area.</p><p>While we may diminish the legal influence over who becomes a judge and when, we may increase the political influence in the whole area.  I would argue, and I would have thought Lord Ross would have argued the same a year ago-----</p></speech>

Regarding some of the points made by Deputy Wallace, we support the idea of a lay majority on the judicial appointments commission.  We believe it is in line with what is in place in many other jurisdictions and in many other professions and organisations, and that is something that we will be supporting throughout this process.</p> <p>  A point that was clearly made is that lay appointments often are made through the standard process.  In order to reform the appointments of judges and any impact that would have on court procedures, there needs to be a much broader representation in the appointments.  There are a number of amendments in my name and the names of other members to address that issue. </p> <p>  Regarding Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments, there is a substantial degree of duplication in the different committees for the appointments of judges to different courts.  I made that point on the last occasion we discussed the Bill.  That is something that could be considered.  Of all the additional committees outlined in the legislation, and there may well be too many of them, the procedures committee is probably the one that has the most to offer.  The appointments of judges to different courts might have different considerations but, ultimately, the principle would be the same.  The procedures committee would have a value in addressing consistency in appointments to the different courts.  There is a great deal in this legislation about diversity and the representativeness of the Judiciary.  If there is any structure that is appropriate to address that, it is the procedures committee.  However, I would be open to supporting some of the other amendments that relate to consolidating some of the committees for the appointments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#C01200"><p>I wish to touch on the same point and I spoke about this at the last hearing dealing with this legislation.  It is hard to remember back to where we were at.  Fianna F&aacute;il's bigger group of amendments, or the next group, deal with getting rid of the relevant committees.  We examined that and I have some sympathy for that but my understanding is that this group of amendments relates to getting rid of the procedures committee only.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, I have less sympathy for that argument than I have for the argument made in the next group of amendment dealing the other relevant committees.  There is a logic in having the commission as a whole doing all the decision making.  What is the point in setting it up and having another gang of little groups all over the place?  I am seeking clarity on whether the idea of having a procedures committee only set up at the start is to decide the criteria of selection.  Is it dissolved then?  Is that it?  The procedures committee has one job and one job only, which is to set up the criteria for selection.  There is more logic in the idea that a smaller group might be better at doing that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#C01400"><p>One of the main purposes of the procedures committee is to reflect, in respect of the overall commission that we will have here, the opportunity to specialise in research and in the design of the professional selection process for judges.  It is important that the composition would be reflective of the overall commission in respect of its membership.</p> <p>  On Deputy Wallace's reference to other members of the Government, lest he be of the view that this Bill is under the sponsorship of one individual Minister, this is a Government Bill and is not the property of any one Minister or any one arm of the Government.  This is a Government Bill, having enjoyed the full support of the Government in accordance with a specific commitment given in the programme for Government.  Therefore, reference to any one Minister would not be reflective of the actual situation as far as the Government is concerned.  This is a Government-sponsored Bill.  </p> <p>  I must take issue with suggestions that this committee - or the commission but we are dealing with the committee in so far as what Deputy Daly has said - will not be occupied by people without expertise and certainly will not be occupied by civil servants, as suggested by Deputy Wallace.  In section 15(7), specific reference is made to areas of Irish life, including human rights, equality, issues concerning diversity, private sector organisations, commerce, finance, administration, public administration, experience in respect of board membership, corporate governance or areas such as mediation or professional dispute resolution.  What we are doing here is important in ensuring that we have a level of expertise and that they would be non-legal persons.  We had this debate to a great extent in the past but it is important that we have people who are other than simply legal practitioners or former legal practitioners.</p> <p>  I cannot accept the amendments because it is important that we would retain a stipulation that this procedures committee or any other committee of the commission would have a lay majority, a lay chair, as determined by the commission.  It is important that we do not depart from what is a core function of the Bill.  </p> <p>  On Deputy Daly's specific question, the procedures committee will not be just a once off.  We will see the application under the Bill as different criteria and different emphases for the different courts.</p><p>It may even be for posts within the courts where a vacancy may arise from time to time depending on the particular requirement of the court.  Having regard to the entire gamut of our courts system now and the way that over recent years, they have become more specialised with different divisions, it is important to continue to move in that direction.  For example, having a particular family law division is importance.  In that regard, where vacancies arise from time to time, there will need to be reference to the particular requirements of the court at that given time.  As such, there will be an ongoing role for the procedures committee but its most important work will be at the commencement.  Of course, the procedures committee will also have a role under section 58 in monitoring and reviewing on an ongoing basis, which is necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#D00200"><p>If we take a step back, the Government's Bill is being overly prescriptive to an excessive degree.  We are talking about ten to 15 appointments per year but the Bill provides for five specific committees under the remit of the commission and a further procedural committee, which is what we are talking about here.  Under section 19, there is a further proposal that other relevant committees may be established.  In effect, the commission could have as many committees as actual appointments.  If that does not alarm the Minister about the superstructure and layers he is creating and the discretion he is giving the commission to establish more committees, where will it end?  What is the rationale for giving the commission a discretion in addition to the committee's specified in the Bill to establish as many committees as the number of appointments it makes?  The Government is over-complicating what could be a much simpler commission.  That is why Fianna F&aacute;il considers that while there should be a discretion to establish a committee, it should be for the commission to decide what committees it requires rather than to establish a prescriptive process from the get go that is going to cost enormous amounts of public money.  On what basis is it being done?  If one is going to equate the number of committees with the number of appointments, it is excessive in the context of the Bill.</p></speech>

I state formally that I support Deputy Wallace's amendments Nos. 84 and 85.  I will not get an opportunity to speak on them again but I think I spoke on them before.  I will be supporting them.  There are many amendments on the procedures committee, but it all comes down to one issue, which is whether we need one.  I do not know if members have the Bill before them, but the functions of the procedures committee are dealt with in section 58.  It is on page 39 of the Bill.  The section provides that the procedures committee will be responsible for monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the Act, the practical operation of the published statement, the diversity among candidates for judicial appointment, the effectiveness and application of the qualification requirements, the effectiveness of the administrative support, the adequacy of the functions assigned to the commission and international developments.  Those functions should be carried out by the commission itself.  We will have a judicial appointments commission and a separate procedures commission.  I assume every member of the judicial appointments commission will be on top of the items I have just outlined.  I would not like to see a situation in which one could be a member of the commission and say, "The issue of diversity among candidates is not an issue for me because it is a matter for the procedures committee".  It complicates matters and is unnecessary.  It is one commission with 13 individuals.  If one is on it, one should have a full, broad overview of the functions one is being asked to carry out by the Oireachtas.  It is not necessary to have separate committees to deal with it.  I am conscious of what Deputies Daly and &Oacute; Laoghaire say about the procedures committee.  They appear to be more favourable and if that is the case, so be it.  We can deal with the other things in the next grouping of amendments.</p></speech>

I cannot understand why it could be so opposed to the establishment of such a committee while pointing out at the same time that it has no problem if it is established by the group itself.  It seems to me that there is a contradiction.  If there is no reason to have the committee, why is it fine if, after the appointments commission is established, it establishes one itself?  Deputy Chambers said in his contribution that the commission would have the right to establish a relevant committee and therefore could do it.  There is no problem he has with the commission establishing committees.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what Deputy O'Callaghan said in his concluding comments.  I reiterate that the procedures committee has a very important role not only in section 58 as mentioned by Deputy O'Callaghan, but also under section 55, which is important as far as the preparation of statements setting out the selection process and procedures is concerned.  It also covers a statement of the appropriate level of attributes and skills.  I would not like the committee to be of the view that there is not much to be done here, that there are as many committee as there are appointments and that it is too cumbersome.  There are hundreds of applications annually.  I look in particular at the number of applications to the judicial appointments board where there is a District or Circuit Court vacancy.  There is a huge amount of work to undertake.  There will be hundreds of applications.  Having a sub-committee of the procedures committee will ensure that the work is done effectively and efficiently.  I see every reason that it is important to provide an option to have a smaller group in the form of a committee to look at these issues.  Therefore, I am not minded to accept amendments which would delete all reference to the procedures committee because we need one.</p></speech>

As I indicated earlier, this is, by my experience, an extraordinary grouping and I am obliged to read it into the record.  The following amendments are grouped for address at this point.  They are amendments Nos. 9; 12; 22 and 23; 44 to 48, inclusive; 73 to 75, inclusive; 77 and 78; 81 to 83, inclusive; 86 to 93, inclusive; 99; 102; 104 to 108, inclusive; 116 to 118, inclusive; 123; 126; 129 to 132, inclusive; 135 and 136; 138; 152 to 156, inclusive; 185; 188; and 190.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#E00300"><p>I move amendment No. 9:</p><blockquote>In page 8, to delete line 32.  </blockquote> <p>The Chairman referred to this as an extraordinary grouping.  An extraordinary grouping requires an extraordinary response.  I do not propose to go through each one of these amendments by way of an individual debate because they are all in my name and that of Deputy Chambers and they all concern the same net issue.  Rather than saying &quot;amendment No. 9 deals with this&quot; and going through each one individually, I will deal with them broadly and it will cover all of them.  </p><p>If members have the Bill in front of them and look at page 11, sections 11 and 12, they will see the purpose of all of these amendments.  In effect, amendment No. 9, all the other amendments being consequential on it, seeks to remove from the piece of legislation this definition of relevant committees of the commission.  We know a commission will be established but what happened after the heads of Bill were published is that the Government made a decision that it was going to include within the commission all these groups of relevant committees.  Those relevant committees are set out on page 11 in section 11 of the Bill.  Members can see that there are five relevant committees of the commission.  They are the Supreme Court appointments committee, the Court of Appeal appointments committee, the High Court appointments committee, the Circuit Court appointments committee and the District Court appointments committee.  All the other amendments that come after amendment No. 9 are consequential.  They remove references to the relevant committee.  </p><p>What I propose should happen is that instead of having five different committees within the commission, we should just have one body, which would be the Judicial Appointments Commission.  The reason this committee structure was introduced after the heads of Bill were published by the Government was because the Government recognised that membership of the commission was inadequate.  If members look at section 12 on page, they will see that the commission is to be made up of 13 members.  One of my criticisms and that of others is that it was wrong that the president of the Circuit Court and the president of the District Court were excluded from the commission since they are the presidents of the courts that have the largest number of judges and have the greatest amount of interaction with members of the public and because they are people who know what is required in a District or Circuit Court judge.  That was a legitimate criticism.  I think the Government recognised that there was legitimacy in that criticism but because of that, it responded by trying to set up all these different committees.  The Government's purpose in setting up all these different committees is that when the Circuit Court appointments committee was meeting, it would be able to invite in the president of the Circuit Court and similarly, when the District Court appointments committee was meeting, it could invite in the president of the District Court.  That was the way of getting around not having the presidents of both those courts on the commission.  It would be much simpler and more appropriate if the presidents of the two busiest courts were members of the commission.  </p><p>Another reason I think it is a bad idea to have relevant committees, and the Minister knows this more than anyone else in the room, is that sometimes, one could get a person who could apply for a job as a Circuit Court judge, the Minister may think a better candidate for the Circuit Court exists but there is a District Court vacancy at present and that would be a very suitable person to be a District Court judge.</p><p>One is not going to have a capacity for the committee to consider that someone who did not get a Circuit Court appointment might be a good District Court judge.  For that reason and because of the limited number of appointments, it is more appropriate to have one commission as opposed to five committees.  We seem to be obsessed in this country with having committees for everything.  For instance, how often will the Supreme Court appointments committee meet?  There may not be a Supreme Court appointment for two or three years whereas the really busy one is the District Court.  The media pays more attention to who is appointed to the Supreme or High Court but far more important appointments from the point of view of members of the public are to the District Court because they are the judges with whom they have the most interaction.  Their appointments deserve as much scrutiny as appointments to the Supreme Court.</p><p> I will not go through all of the amendments individually.  They are all consequential on this proposal.  We should get rid of "relevant committees" and have one commission which considers applications and nominations for appointment to all the courts.  It will allow them to suggest that a person who applied for the Court of Appeal should go to the Supreme Court.  It is a small country and there are a small number of positions on the Bench.  It is wrong to exclude the Presidents of the District and Circuit Courts from the commission, which is something that can be perfected later.  The Government has brought in this committee structure to allow them to come back in, but it would be much easier to put them on the commission.  While there are a huge number of amendments here, they all relate to the same thing.  That is my contribution on each of the proposals.  I recognise that when we make a decision on amendment No. 9, it will deal with the rest of them.</p></speech>

In fact, there are more than 50 in the grouping.  In response to Deputy O'Callaghan and for the benefit of members who have not yet made a contribution on their amendments, I will set out briefly and clearly the structure of these sections of the Bill and their purpose.  Section 9 of the Bill establishes the relevant committees.  Section 10 is the enabling provision requiring the commission to select and recommend to the Minister persons for appointment to judicial office through the relevant committee as set out in section 11(2).  I remind members that section 10 is being opposed through these amendments.  Section 11 provides for the membership of the relevant committees.  I note the section is also opposed.  Section 11 sets out the committees to be established under section 9.  I will not repeat what Deputy O'Callaghan said in that regard.  He draws our attention to the section, the content of which is self-explanatory.  Section 11(2) provides in the table for the role of each committee in making a selection and recommendation.  Section 13 provides for the membership of the relevant committees and other provisions in relation to them.  Section 13 is opposed.  Section 13(1) sets out the composition of the committees, each of which will have a total of 11 members.  All committees will have as members the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, a nominee of the Bar Council and Law Society, respectively, and the lay chair.  A committee will also comprise five of the lay persons.</p><p>The second judicial member provision is set out in section 13.  Section 13(2) provides the detail to ensure that the selection and recommendation of appointees to judicial office in a particular court will be conducted by a committee whose membership includes a judge serving at the level of the courts system to which the committee's business relates.  There are obvious and important reasons that should be the case.  In the case of a Supreme Court appointments committee, the additional member shall be either the President of the Court of Appeal or, with the concurrence of that President, an ordinary Supreme Court judge nominated by the Chief Justice.  Deputies will be aware that these important provisions were not included in the Bill as published.  I acknowledge what Deputy O'Callaghan has said.  These provisions were included following careful consideration and having regard to what Deputies, including Deputy O'Callaghan, had to say in the course of pre-legislative scrutiny about the need to have all court Presidents as well as the Chief Justice involved in the function of selecting and recommending persons for judicial appointment.  The provisions were also developed following a period of consultation with members of the Judiciary at senior level.  These sections and related provisions create a structure whereby the selection and recommendation function will be carried out within the framework of the five relevant committees designed to address judicial vacancies in each of the five court levels.  This architecture reflects concerns raised by the Judiciary in the consultation process.</p><p>Deputies will be fully aware that the Judiciary is opposed to having a majority of lay persons on the commission and to having a lay chairperson presiding over a commission of which the Chief Justice is a member.  I am conscious that we will be addressing issues relating to the composition of the commission on a separate basis but I must advert to a particular concern the Judiciary had that all five court Presidents, including the Chief Justice, should be involved directly in the selection and recommendation process for the appointment of persons as is currently the case with the judicial appointments board.  Having listened to the views of the Judiciary on the matter, having reflected on the point during the pre-legislative scrutiny debate and having regard to the input of my predecessor, I am of the view that it is desirable to meet this particular concern in the manner set out in the Bill.  Rather than to provide for a consultation arrangement with, for example, the President of the District Court, as the <i>ex officio</i>arrangement under the general scheme of the Bill originally provided, a direct decision-making role for each President should be retained.  That is what we have under the current process.</p><p>Sections 11 and 13 provide that the commission shall act in the form of a relevant 11 person committee, one for each of the five courts.  In the case of an appointment to the Circuit Court, for example, the committee will comprise the commission members, with the President of the Circuit Court replacing the Presidents of the Court of Appeal and the High Court and with five ordinary lay members instead of six.  It is that committee which will conduct the selection process and recommend persons for appointment to the Circuit Court in that example.  While all Superior Court Presidents, including the Chief Justice, are permanent members of the commission through the appointment committees format in the Bill, all Presidents will form part of the decision-making process through the relevant committees in selecting and recommending persons for appointment to the relevant courts.  Under section 10 of the Bill, the relevant committees will perform the functions of the commission in respect of the selection of persons for each court.  In that sense, they will be the statutory iteration of the commission itself and be empowered to select and make decisions as to who to recommend.  I refer again to the programme for Government in that regard.</p><p>The chair, the Chief Justice and a number of other members will be common across the relevant committees.  There will be a perspective across the entire gamut of selection applications.  I say this in response to the point raised by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan who spoke in terms of there being silos in this respect.  That will not necessarily be the case because there will be common membership and a common secretariat across all the relevant committees via a judicial appointments commission office, which will be established under the Bill.</p><p> I have listened to Deputy O'Callaghan in particular, as well as other members, but I am not minded to increase the number of members of the commission beyond the 13-member composition that the legislation now provides.  Nor am I in a position to pull back on the key programme for Government commitments in this regard.  I am therefore unable to accept any of the amendments, including amendments Nos. 9, 22 and 23, which have the effect of removing the relevant committee structures in the Bill.  I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that this is the core matter and many of the other 50 amendments are related or consequential.  It is important we retain the relevant committees as in the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#G00200"><p>These are incredibly difficult and confusing.  There are aspects of amendments that could be supported but they have a knock-on effect for other parts of the legislation, which makes it very difficult for us in handling them.  As I said in a previous discussion, this is an area we actively examined in preparation of our amendments.  It is the idea of getting rid of all the relevant committees.  There is a very compelling argument for that, not least of which is the idea of having a commission of 13 people and a plethora of committees made up of 11 people.  That sort of goes against the grain of the establishment of the commission in the first place.  It is still unwieldy, even with a few people taken out, but most of the people on the committees would be on the other body.  Are we not better off just leaving it at the commission itself?  It is quite a compelling argument.</p> <p>  We wanted to hear the discussion and I am not sure the reasons we did not put down specific amendments stand up.  There may be other ways of achieving the goal that we cannot do in the course of these amendments.  I suppose we decided against proposing getting rid of them because the Bill, as currently constituted, precisely excludes the presidents of the District Court and Circuit Court from membership.  There are committees that allow them to come in through an elegant way to be part of the process under the headline of an additional member.  That is without making the commission so big by adding them on.  That is too messy, although I know it is the logic behind the process.  I would like the involvement of the two presidents and I note Deputy O'Callaghan provides for that.  If he is providing for extra lay people etc., we could suddenly be talking about 17 people, which is too big.</p> <p>  This comes back to the idea of the lay majority and how important it is.  In some ways, it is kind of a matter of preference.  That said, I still like the idea of a lay majority.  We made the point before that focusing really gets away from what we should be looking at, which is who gets appointed as a judge, rather than necessarily how such people get appointed.  I echo very much the points made by Deputy Wallace earlier that we are talking about a lay majority but the criteria for those lay people is really such that in a different way they will replicate certain sections of Irish society that are already over-represented.  The points about the Civil Service are not meant to be derogatory in any way but many of these State bodies tend to have people from those types of backgrounds.  In many ways they are as institutionalised, if not more, than the Judiciary or the legal profession.  Would we get a diverse balance and would it really be a lay representation?  It is more of the same.</p> <p>  The Judiciary should not be a career progression for people in the legal profession as such.  We should not have a position where judges are a class apart but they are.  If there was a different way we could get representation for the presidents of the District Court and Circuit Court to become involved in the commission, I would be open to considering it.  It is not a strong enough reason to maintain the relevant committees.  They will create mayhem.  The legislation will be made chaotic by having these multiple committees with 11 people when there is a commission of 13 people.  It will not work.  I will have to do some work on this to bring about a different way for the presidents of the District Court and Circuit Court to have a role in this process without relevant committees.  They are a really cumbersome way of trying to get over that point and they will not work.  I am strongly against them but we must find a different way of getting the other two involved in the process.  Those are my initial thoughts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#G00300"><p>As I noted with the previous set of amendments, the procedures committee would have a very specific role to play in guiding the diversity and representation of the Judiciary and it was worth preserving.  Having said that, the multiple committees of 11 members drawn from a commission of 13 members amount to an overly complex system.  It is unnecessary.  It would be desirable for one body to look at all appointments, with different considerations for every level.  There would also be considerations that would be the same in all appointments as well.  The example given by Deputy O'Callaghan of identifying a judge interested in one position who may be more suited to another position shows that such considerations are relevant.  The commission should be responsible for the nomination of judges as a whole and the main body is suitable for that.</p><p>Deputy Daly has indicated very clearly that acceptance of these amendments will require a cleaning up exercise in subsequent Stages but there would be no problem with that and it is the reason we have multiple Stages when considering legislation.  I am quite open to the original proposal of the presidents of the two courts attending <i>ex officio</i>but I am not of the view that 17 members would be excessive.  There are ways around this and the matters can be resolved if the amendments are accepted.  I do not see any compelling reason for this number of committees to exist in the legislation.</p></speech>

This amounts to appointments by the back door and the Minister is creating sub-structures in that respect.  In section 13 it states that each relevant committee may establish one or more sub-committees.  This means there would be committees, which everybody has stated are excessive, and then there could be multiple sub-committees of the committees from the commission.  The Minister is making this overly complicated and he should re-examine the matter.  That is why the amendments need to be progressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#H00100"><p>I do not think there is a huge amount of disagreement here.  The Minister recognises that the presidents of the District Court and the Circuit Court should be involved.  I think everyone agrees with that.  Deputy Chambers and I believe that the committee structure is too complicated for the level of work that the Commission will have to do.  If I was going to have any judge on this Commission, I would have the president of the District Court, considering the number of candidates who are appointed to that court.</p> <p>  Part of the reason we are here is that politics is damaging the legislation.  The Government wants to have a lay majority on the Commission, and it is entitled to have that view.  That is the reason the presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court were originally excluded.  The Government was concerned about the size of the Commission.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, if we must add the presidents of the District Court and the Circuit Court, as I think we should, and we want a lay majority, then two more laypeople must be added.  I think that is inappropriately large, but for some reason this lay majority is said to be politically necessary and of public benefit.  I disagree with that.  If the Minister believes that then it can still be done, but the presence of the District Court and Circuit Court presidents, who know their courts better than anyone else, should not be sacrificed. </p></speech>

Simply deleting reference to the relevant committees is not in itself advisable.  I do not accept that this is unduly cumbersome.  I do accept that there are a number of committees that have different functions, and which might, at face value, appear to be somewhat technical in nature.  In practice, however, the relevant committees are effectively the Commission itself.  It is a function of the Commission to select and recommend people for appointment.  Under section 10, this function is performed by the relevant committee only.  As such the relevant committees are in effect iterations of the Commission.  It is not as though we are introducing significant layers of bureaucracy.  Circumstances are such that there will be common membership across a range of relevant committees.  However, I agree with Deputy Daly that ultimately the objective here is to reform the process of appointment.  That is the main thrust of the legislation.  It is the manner in which we arrange structures in order to facilitate that objective that we are discussing here.</p> <p>  I said at the outset of this debate that I did not come in here with a closed mind.  I have not changed that view.  There may be different ways of achieving the objective we all share, as noted by Deputy Daly.  I am prepared to further examine the balance between having a manageable number on the Commission and ensuring the membership of the presidents.  We all agree that the direct involvement of the presidents of the courts is extremely valuable and will be very important in the new process.  The question is how we can best avoid having an unwieldy overall Commission with large numbers of people, while meeting the obligation to have a lay chair and a lay majority, assuming that members of this committee are minded to continue with that central thrust of the legislation.</p> <p>  To my mind, the current relevant committee process is the most effective way of involving the presidents as experts in their own court area.  I do not accept Deputy O'Callaghan's contention that we are creating indivisible silos, considering the common membership across the relevant committees.  We will continue to have a perspective across the whole gamut of selections and applications.  We will also have a common secretariat across all of the relevant committees, which will be the Judicial Appointments Commission office.  Should we delete all reference to the committees and deny ourselves the opportunity to avail of expertise of the presidents?  I believe that expertise is essential, as the presidents themselves have said.  I would be reluctant to depart from that.  If we are not going to proceed by way of the relevant committees, as allowed for under the Bill, we return to the structure of the overall Commission.  I believe that we envision a membership number that will ensure that the Commission is efficient and effective in the manner it goes about its business.  It also respects our central tenets, a lay majority and a lay chair.</p> <p>  However, I am open to giving the matter further consideration in so far as I can. </p></speech>

We all agree that the experience of the presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court must be taken on board.  However, we have tabled an amendment removing the Attorney General from the board, reducing duplication of effort.  The Attorney General has a say when the three nominations go to the Government.  There is not much rationale in the Attorney General having a say at both stages.  If the Attorney General is removed, it is not as cumbersome to include the two presidents in the Commission.  It gives us an opportunity to get rid of some of the bureaucracy surrounding the extra committees.</p></speech>

At the heart of our position will be support for a lay majority, but I think there are other ways of doing this.  I have no problem with a commission of 17.  Perhaps the Government does, but I certainly do not.  One of the issues arising from this bureaucracy is that there would be six lay members, but only five on each committee.  There would be lay members, whom we hope will influence the diversity and representation of the judiciary.  However, there might be somebody who is perfectly well equipped to deal with that who would never have a say in a District Court or Supreme Court appointment, merely because they are not on that committee.  If the model of the Commission as a whole was adopted, all six of the lay members currently proposed would have a say in each appointment.  That is something of an anomaly.</p></speech>

It is not a case of a win-win situation regarding any amendment or set of amendments.  It is about helping the process to get the best result.  I wonder is there, in the Minister's indication of a willingness to look again at this, the prospect of not dividing on this and allowing Report Stage to be an opportunity for substantive address.  I am only teasing this out because the question should be put.  As things stand, we will drive into a division situation.  Report Stage will still stand, but what suggests itself to me is a very strongly shared view of the committee that this matter be revisited.  I am trying to interpret what the Minister said, but my sense is he is indicating a willingness to look again at this as best as he may be able.  Is there something in this whereby we could reach some agreement here at this point?</p></speech>

I am certainly prepared to consider the matter further for Report Stage, on the basis there may well be a number of options available to us to achieve what, in effect, is the same objective, which is the balance between having a commission with a number of people, or membership, that is not considered so unwieldy as to be unworkable or problematic and, at the same time, acknowledging the importance of the membership of the presidents of the courts.  I really feel we should do that.  The original scheme, as committee members recall, had <i>ex officio</i>participation of Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court in the selection process, but that was seen as distinguishing between presidents who are commission members and those who are not.  There is an issue there about fairness and the need to be representative.  I am minded to give this matter further consideration to see how best we can achieve that balance between, on the one hand, the commission not having such a large number of members as to be problematic and, on the other hand, the need to ensure we can have the input and draw on the experience and expertise of the presidents of the courts.  We can only do this by having their active engagement and involvement, and that would be through membership.</p><p>Reference was made to the Attorney General and whether we might reflect on the membership of the Attorney General and the role and function of the Office of the Attorney General.  I very much caution against this.  The Attorney General has a very important role to play and brings a special perspective to the process.  It is important this is acknowledged in the context of the legislation.  I would not be minded to dispense with this very important role.</p></speech>

I am endeavouring to find a situation to allow us to move forward, in the hope there would be consensus reached at least on Report Stage.  How does Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan respond?</p></speech>

All we can do is table the amendments which the committee thinks are suitable, have a vote on them and see how they are.  Everyone recognises further thought will have to be put into the legislation after Committee Stage concludes.  No matter what happens, the Minister recognises this.  In terms of the group of amendments we are considering at present, dividing the body into five different committees is not a good idea.  We have gone through the reasons for and against, and the Minister will consider all of this, but the committee should make a decision on it.  What the committee decides will not be the end of the world.  The Minister will have to come back and reconsider it.  I am not sure what the outcome is going to be, to be frank.  If the outcome is to remove these committees the Minister will be able to come back with a proposal on how the presidents of the two other courts should be included.  They should just be made part of the commission.  I do not agree with a lay majority because, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, if it needs to increase in number then it needs to increase in number.</p> <p>  I am a conciliator by nature, but if I am being asked to withdraw the amendments in the prospect that the Minister will come back in due course, that sounds great today but with the passage of time things change and before we know it we will be on Report Stage and I will be stating that I thought we had an arrangement.  The committee should send a message to the Minister as to what we think of the legislation.  It is either voted down or it is not.</p></speech>

We are all very clear that the view of this committee is that the relevant committees will not work and Report Stage will not change this, but that we are very open to looking at how, in a different format, the presidents of the two courts can be given a role on the commission.  I agree we should make the decision today in order to advance the issue.  If we do not, we will be left with a Bill that is largely unworkable and will be very difficult to reform at a later stage when we have to take out all of these bits to take on board the fact we do not agree with the committees.  We should just decide that now, and all of us should engage seriously on how we get a role for the other two presidents.</p></speech>

We have had an interesting exchange on these amendments, the import of which is the change proposed to the relevant committee structure.  I reiterate a huge amount of work has been undertaken on this precise issue in terms of active engagement on the part of the Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  These arrangements were certainly not made lightly.  My concern is that should Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments and other amendments be now put to a vote we run the risk of unravelling what is a very carefully constructed piece of legislation in a way that might not be fully mindful of the consequential knock-ons for other parts of the Bill.  It is important that integrity be maintained at this stage.  I am not for a moment suggesting any aspect of the Bill is in any way less than workable.</p><p>However, my concern is that a number of amendments would be passed on Committee Stage in a way that might not be fully reflective of the end product.  Therefore, if Deputy O'Callaghan is minded to press the amendments, I must oppose them.  I would see the removal of what currently is an important piece of its architecture, which is the relevant committees, as an unravelling of the entire Bill.  I will acknowledge the disposition of the committee, however, as it would expect me and instruct me to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#K00200"><p>It is a bit harsh to say that we are trying to unravel the Bill.  I think that is the job of the committee.  We agree that we need better legislation and a better arrangement on how we appoint judges, which is what we are teasing out.  The reason we have this on Committee Stage is to debate it.  We are not trying to destroy or unravel the Bill; we are trying to make it better.  Perhaps the Minister does not agree but that is what we are trying to do.  We are on the committee and entitled to make a rational argument and we think that our argument is more rational than the Minister's defence.  I do not think it is counterproductive for us to take a position where we think improvements can be made to the Bill.  We want the Bill to be as good as possible.  We have put a lot of work into it and thought a lot about it because we care.  We want it to be good legislation.  We are not trying to unravel it but improve it.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is an unravelling.  The committee considers the Minister's committee structure as unwieldy and overly complex.  If anything, despite differences in terms of the lay majority or otherwise, even members who agree with the thrust of what the Minister is proposing recognise that there should be changes at the commission level and the removal of the committee structure proposed by the Minister.  They are trying to be constructive rather than trying to unravel what the Minister has proposed.  It is for the Minister to return on Report Stage to reform and restructure what we see as overly complex rather than us relying on the Minister to bring forward amendments.  As Deputy Daly said earlier, if we were to rely on the Minister, we could end up with the committees on Report Stage.  It is clear that the Minister wants to maintain the committee structure more or less as he proposed it.  It is important that members understand that the Minister wants that now and will want it on Report Stage also.  It is important that members understand that there is no commitment to change or reform the committee structure going into Report Stage.  It is, therefore, important that we address that now.</p></speech>

In practice, the process will be quite straightforward.  Deputy O'Callaghan and other Deputies mentioned, for example, the appointment to a vacancy in the District Court under the new framework.  This court is perhaps most relevant to the day-to-day lives of individuals.  Hundreds of thousands of people appear annually in District Courts up and down the country.  If the committee forms the view that the relevant committees under the Bill would have no function and would be non-existent, we would then have a situation in practice where there might be up to 200 applications for consideration for a vacancy in the District Court from all over the country.  Without the relevant committee structure, these applications would be put to the entire commission for due consideration.  There is real danger that much other work of importance that might be undertaken by the commission would not take place because of a concentration by the commission on dealing with one appointment to the District Court.  That is one of the important reasons we have carefully arrived at after significant consideration at the relevant committee structure.  It is to ensure efficiency and expertise and it would provide for the membership of the president of the court to which the appointment is to be made.  I believe this could be done in a way that would not involve the overall commission unduly in the process.</p></speech>

I think that is crucial and central.  There are strong views reflected here on the proposed methodology.  I favour a more integrated engagement on the consideration across any and all of the appointments to be made.  I share that view in advance of taking the vote.  Is the amendment being pressed?</p></speech>

I will briefly make reference to section 5, which concerns the review of operation.  As we know, the Bill is new, innovative and ground-breaking in the extensive changes it introduces in the process of judicial appointments.  We are moving to make an important step forward.  This is a very innovative adjustment to the manner in which we deal with such matters.  I only have to mention the significant reduction in the number of recommendations that the Government receives and the extension of this system to all judicial appointments, including the further appointment of serving judges.  There would be increased lay participation in decision making and a developmental function in the commission.</p> <p>  In a short period following enactment, the landscape will change in a most significant manner.  It is worth pointing out that the review arrangements envisaged in section 5 will have close interaction with later provisions in the Bill.  I refer specifically to the requirements of section 58, which requires the procedures committee, to which we made considerable reference earlier, to be charged with responsibility to monitor and review the implementation of the Act, having regard to the various factors.  That review should be conducted two years after commencement of the section and thereafter from time to time as the commission might request.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.384" nospeaker="true" time="10:20:00" ><p>Those factors include the operation of statements on selection procedures and skills and attributes which the procedures committee is required to publish under section 55, which we referred to earlier.  Other factors include diversity among candidates for judicial appointment and the adequacy of functions assigned to the commission.</p><p>Section 58(3), as I have said, mandates the review to be conducted within a two-year period.  This process will be followed by a report, including any recommendations, to the commission.  That report, and any recommendations, will be submitted by the commission to the Minister with observations of the commission.</p><p>It can be assumed that the process of review will serve as a reference point for the review by the Minister of the Act, as provided for under section 5.  To adequately take account of the entire experience and workings of the Act, including the review, and reporting process, I am of the view that a period of five years is appropriate.  This is typical of such provisions which have been used from time to time in statutes where it is considered that a review clause is deemed prudent.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire suggested three years.  In principle, that of itself is not objectionable.  I appreciate the support that is implicit for the review concept but one factor behind the five year mark is that we need to see a sufficient throughput of selections and appointments over an adequate period of time.  The more appointments that become the subject of a review, for example, with reference to matters such as diversity which is referenced in Part 8 of the Bill, the better picture we will have of developments.  It will also give us a clearer picture of trends in these areas which are important to us all.  It is critical to have had adequate experience of the new procedures and skills and the frameworks that we are developing, and that the procedures committee has that bank of experience under section 55, before we are in a position to make an objective and clear assessment.  It is my view that three years, as suggested by the Deputy, is too short.  An extra two years, that is, a total of five years, would allow for a second review and perhaps even a request by the Minister for a report to look again in that period at key factors in the selection and recommendation process, as provided.  Of course, how the matter of ongoing review is approached will, in essence, be one for the commission itself to decide.  I am of the view that in the five-year mark, allowing for adequate time to carry out that review and to process and analyse the outcome of the review, and, indeed, to allow 12 months before the results of that in the form or a report to the Oireachtas is to be furnished, we have struck an important balance here having regard to the new ground that will be travelled here.</p><p>In that regard, I would ask Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to accept what I am saying and not to press the amendments.</p></speech>

First, I will deal with my proposed new section and then I take into consideration arguments that are made by Deputies on their amendments.</p><p>The amendment I have proposed is based largely on a proposal from Dr. Patrick O'Brien who, I believe, corresponded with us all.  His submission on this legislation quite articulately outlined some improvements that could have been made to it.</p><p>This, specifically, is to make it more explicit to be representative of the population as a whole.  It closely resembles the existing provision in section 7.  However, it introduces the concept of the merit principle, and obviously, that every candidate for proposal would have to meet the merit principle, but also that the judicial appointments commission should always have regard to the diversity principle that membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women and the objective that the membership of the Judiciary should reflect the diversity within the population as a whole.</p><p>It is important to emphasise, as laid out in subsection (3) of the proposal, that that would always be subject to the merit principle.  There would never be any question of an unqualified incapable person achieving such an office.  There would always have to be that qualification.</p><p>This is germane and appropriate to the intention and approach of the entire Bill which is to ensure that appointments to the Judiciary are independent but also that they are representative, diverse and proportionate to the population as a whole.</p><p>I commend the amendment to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#M01200"><p>I am supportive of putting expressly into the legislation a requirement that any recommendation should be based on merit.  That is extremely important.  The objective of every person in this room is to ensure that those appointed to the Bench get there because of their ability and the type of judge that they will be rather than any political affiliation, friendship or other connection that they may have.  We all want the best people to be made judges.</p> <p>  It is interesting that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire mentioned Dr. Patrick O'Brien who has done a lot of research in the area of how they have changed the system in England.  I met Dr. O'Brien as well.  He made an interesting point about the emphasis of the merit principle in England and Wales at present.  He stated that one of the consequences of having a completely autonomous body that recommends people based solely on merit is that one gets a lot of people who are similar being appointed.  He stated that one gets a lot of highly intelligent people who got firsts in Oxbridge being recommended because on the principle of merit they appear to be come out on top.</p><p>However, that has a consequential downside in terms of how the Judiciary must reflect diversity in society and shows where the advantage lies with Government.  A Government does not operate the same way as a statutory body that must operate on the basis of merit.  A Government will take into account diversity.  Many appointments in recent times recognise that more women must be appointed to the Bench.  That is a benefit.  It is important to link merit and diversity together.  In section 7, as it stands, there is reference to how appointments should be based on merit and how they should reflect diversity.  My only problem with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment is that, if passed, it will have the effect of knocking out my amendment No. 20, although I know that was not his intention.</p><p> Amendment No. 20, which was tabled by me and Deputy Jack Chambers, requires that when judges are being recommended by this body, consideration will be given to ensuring the objective that there is proficiency in the Irish language among members of the Judiciary, which is a practical problem at present.  Every person is entitled to have his or her case heard in Irish, whether in the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court or on appeal.  It is difficult enough to converse in Irish but running a case in Irish is extremely difficult.  I could not do it.  However, it is important that we have judges with proficiency in the Irish language so that those who want to exercise the constitutional right to have their case heard through Irish can do so.</p><p> On a number of occasions judges have to come down from higher courts to hear cases and three judges who are proficient in the Irish language are needed to hear an appeal in the Court of Appeal.  Previous Governments have not given sufficient recognition to this factor but it is now an issue - not a problem - for the courts.  It is important that this body recognises, when recommending people, that it must consider that proficiency in a court.  For instance, if someone wants to have his or her appeal heard through Irish, we have to ensure that there are three judges on either the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court who can hear such cases.  This amendment would knock out my amendment No. 20.  However, I will not oppose Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment because I agree with the principle of it.  I also think Deputy Clare Daly's amendments No. 17 and 19 and perhaps amendment No. 21 - I do not know if it is in this grouping - achieve the objective Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is seeking to achieve.</p></speech>

These amendments are seeking to do the same thing in some ways.  Ours might be a little less complicated than Sinn F&eacute;in's in that it allows for recommendations for the appointment to be based on merit while having regard to objectives of gender equality and diversity.  They might be less complicated than the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal, although I am open to looking at it.  This gets to the heart of a lot of what we are talking about and what we want to see.  The outcome in terms of the judges that we have is more important than the process, which we have all been absorbed in until now.  What do we get out of the end of this process?</p> <p>  As it stands, the Bill states that, in decisions to recommend persons to the appointment of judicial office, regard shall be had, subject to merit, to "the objective that the membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women" and "to the extent feasible and practicable, reflect the diversity within the population".  In revising this section, we are proposing that the objectives of gender equality and diversity are not subject to the principle that all appointments must be made on merit.  The reason is to emphasise that diversity, be it social or gender, is as important as merit in making appointments.  At the same time, these amendments do not have the effect of allowing the recommendation of less worthy female appointments or appointments of people from ethnic minorities or under-represented classes.  It is trying to balance the two and to equate them.</p> <p>  We propose to delete the words "feasible and practicable" in the subsection on diversity because there is no clear reason for it.  This is all the more so if we are saying the Judiciary should be made up of equal numbers of men and women where we do not have that caveat of "feasible and practicable" but it is there when it comes to broader diversity.  That should be removed, which is straightforward enough.</p> <p>  We are taking a lot of guidance on these amendments.  The English Constitutional Reform Act 2005 places a specific onus on the judicial appointments commission in performing its function to have regard to "the need to encourage diversity in the range of persons available for selection", which I think is what we are all trying to do here.  Arguments about merit started to take off in the UK and Australia a couple of years ago, after their merit-based systems were in place.  They found that the judiciary being appointed after introducing a merit-based ground looked very like the judiciary they had before it.  They all tended to be the same type of middle class white males.  Jack Straw, a former Minister for justice, said that merit can too easily mean "people like us", which is what we are trying to get away from.</p> <p>  We are not encouraging diversity for the sake of it.  Judges who are drawn from a wide range of backgrounds and life experiences bring varying perspectives to bear on critical legal issues.  That is important.  That is what we are trying to do here.  The Bar Council was of the view that "justice is best served when the judiciary [is more reflective of] the collective morals of society and when they, as a group, have wider perspectives and a broader experience of life".</p> <p>  The inclusion of diversity as an element of merit enshrines its importance and moral legitimacy and, in that sense, would achieve an enhancing of public confidence in the Judiciary, which is supposed to be the concern of the Bill.  Therefore, why not make a firm commitment in that regard?  Rather than hiding behind "feasible and practicable", let us put it on an equal footing.  If other amendments with regard to the appointment and background of lay members of the commission fall, we run the risk of ending up with quite a narrowly defined version of merit which is "people like us".</p> <p>  As currently constituted, the Bill provides for a lay majority made up of ex-civil servants, human resources managers and CEOs.  Those are the criteria in the Bill as it stands.  Those are the types of lay persons we would be selecting.  The vast number of them will come from a particular background and a good number of them will see merit as meaning the person attended a good university and had a career at the Bar and that is about it.</p> <p>  We should be saying that merit is a lot more than that.  It is about appreciating and really understanding cultural and social diversity.  It is about having experience of a wide range of different circumstances as well as a deep knowledge of the legal system and the law.  With these amendments, I am trying to put diversity on an equal footing, and not a lesser one, with merit.  It is not seeking to discount merit or anything like that.</p> <p>  I will not labour the points but this is critical.  Three of six current Supreme Court judges went to fee paying schools.  I cannot find the details on one of them so I am not sure but potentially more than 50% of the Supreme Court judges had a private education.  Only 7% of the population has a private education.  Therefore, we need to address those aspects.  It is very important.</p> <p>  The other matter is slightly different but it is related.  I am referring to amendment No. 21.  This is similar to Deputy Wallace's amendment No. 189 and a little like Deputy Sherlock's amendment No. 15.  I think the reason all of us tabled these amendments is pretty obvious.  The whole aim of the Bill should be to remove political meddling as far as possible or, at least, the perception of political meddling from the judicial appointments process.  The reasons are well rehearsed but I will run through them briefly.  I will not labour the point but removing political influence from the judicial appointments process is key to giving us a more diverse Judiciary and to ensuring that the perception of judicial independence is not compromised.</p><p>The Bar Council, for its part, supports an explicit statutory prohibition on consideration of a person's political affiliation in determining his or her suitability for appointment in order to dispel the apprehension that party politics plays a role in the appointment of judges.  It is about more than perception.  Dr. Eoin Daly of NUI Galway made a good point that we must factor in the role that judges play in shaping the law as well, where he states:</p><blockquote>Far from mechanically administering laws laid down by the legislature, judges are, in reality, responsible for developing the law.  And the question of how the law should be developed in this way raises fundamental &quot;political&quot; questions about the nature of justice and injustice, the distribution of power and opportunity in society, and so on.  ...judging at all levels involves sometimes significant elements of discretion &ndash; which means that judicial power is not always guided by strictly &quot;legal&quot; standards.</blockquote><p>In that sense, we must also factor in that the nature of the legal system is such that the Judiciary has far more far-reaching powers, such as constitutional powers, than its counterpart in England.  The political nature is key.  My other amendment seeks to deal with that issue also.  It is quite important.</p></speech>

That, to my mind, is a positive.  Section 7 of the Bill is an important section setting down in statute for the first time the explicit stipulation that a decision to recommend a person must be based on merit, as expressly contained in the section.</p> <p>  The Deputy's amendment effectively requires under subsection (1) that recommendations made by the commission shall be based on merit.  It refers to this stipulation as being the "Merit Principle".  I have no particular objection to that terminology but, right through these amendments on the issue of merit, it is important that we are mindful of the need to retain certain flexibilities.  I would be concerned about a series of amendments that would have the effect of constricting the commission in a way that is not intended but could ultimately have the effect of some form of hamstring.</p> <p>  Subsection (2) of the proposed new section has the effect of benchmarking the merit-based recommendation against the objectives of equality of men and women in the membership of the Judiciary and diversity among membership of the Judiciary.  These objectives are denoted by reference to a diversity principle.  The proposed terminology is not in any way objectionable, but terminology of itself does not change the basis on which the recommendations are to be made, as provided for under the Bill.  What is new in the amendment is the stipulation that a list of persons recommended for appointment to office under the Act shall include at least one person whose appointment would further the objectives of the diversity principle.  While the naming of merit and diversity principles would not perhaps be unwelcome, I am much less sure that the hand of the commission must be compelled or mandated to select in a particular direction.</p> <p>  It is important that we step back for a moment to describe broadly how the Bill addresses what is an important, but also a sensitive, issue of diversity.  There are a number of elements to the manner in which these issues are addressed.  First, the provisions of section 7 develop significantly from what was contained in the general scheme of the Bill, moving from guiding principles to a direct stipulation with regard to merit-based recommendations.  The Government, to my mind, made the correct decision when publishing the Bill that guiding principles were not sufficiently strong as far as this issue was concerned.  The public consultation phases of the reform process clearly signposted the need for merit to be very much to the forefront in the matter of our reform proposal.  It is also significant that, subject to the merit-based recommendation only, the concerns around gender balance and diversity in the membership of the Judiciary are brought up and that they be dealt with in a front and centre way - to borrow a term from the Act.</p> <p>  Regarding gender equality and diversity, section 15(7), which is the subject of a separate debate, provides one area where knowledge and experience will be to the fore in the selection of the lay members with regard to "human rights, equality or issues concerning diversity amongst members of society".  The Bill signals the critical importance of taking account of that perspective in appointing the lay members of the commission.</p> <p>  A third area that is worthy of mention relates to the requirement under section 55 of the Bill.  This requires, in the preparation of the statements of selection, the procedures for selection and the requisite skills and attributes, that regard will be had to the following two objectives: in subsection (5)(c) "the objective that the membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women,"; and "the objective that, to the extent feasible and practicable, the membership of the judiciary should reflect the diversity within the population as a whole".  There is a direct co-relation between the objective set out in section 7 and the requirement of the commission to cater for this in its own published statements.  In this context, Part 8 of the Bill will ensure that the judicial selection procedures and the qualities of persons selected will take full account of the gender equality and diversity objectives which are integral objectives in everything the Bill is aimed at achieving.  The final element I should mention in this matter is that, in the section 58 review process that we discussed earlier, diversity must be monitored and reported upon to the commission and to the Minister.</p> <p>  All in all, I have no specific difficulty with a variation in terminology denoting the principles that are framing the Bill, but I am not inclined to accept what will be a prescription that subsection (3) in the amendment implies.  I do not intend to support the amendment.</p> <p>  I acknowledge Deputy Clare Daly's amendments Nos. 17 and 19, which propose the deletion of aspects of the phraseology of section 7.  I accept that it is not just a question of removing or changing words, but there are significant adjustments.  Amendment No. 17 appears to delete the provision that the objectives of subsection (2) around gender equality and diversity are subject to the merit-based recommendation principle.</p><p>The intention behind this appears to be to remove the element which makes the gender equality and diversity objectives in section 7 subject to the overall principle of selection on merit.  The purpose of the existing provisions of the Bill is to ensure that the overarching consideration in the selection of people for appointment to judicial office is merit and to make any consideration of gender equality and diversity clearly subject to that overarching principle.  Having it subject to that provision serves merely to underpin the primacy of the merit based recommendation provisions.<br/><br/>What is merit?  I cannot see how the concept can be compromised in any sense by reference to any competing principle.  Merit is merit.  It is fully acceptable to associate the concept with the specified objectives.  That is what we are doing in the Bill.  I am sure the members and Chairman will testify to the huge advance we are making in specifying those very objectives.  It is important to have no misunderstanding about the single criterion to be referenced in the recommendation process.  Dropping the term &quot;subject to subsection 1&quot; is unhelpful in respect of the core principle of the section.  Looking at merit or a definition of merit, it can to many be a fluid concept.  According to 2012 research, merit is often invoked in the eye of the beholder.  Oftentimes, merit does not necessarily equate to the <i>status quo</i>.  I refer briefly to Paterson 2012, a research study, which stated that historically what has been put into the definition of merit for judicial appointments has constantly shifted.  In Lord Halsbury's day, it included, apparently, coming from the same party as the Lord Chancellor.  At a later point, it was deemed to be a good thing to have had previous political experience before appointment as a judge in the House of Lords.  More recently, however, it has been and remains in large part the case that merit is regarded as coterminous with having been a junior or Queen's Counsel at the bar for a period of 30 years.  I merely make the point by way of that short reference that merit is a changeable feature.  In many respects, it is subjective.<br/><br/>I am unable to accept the amendment which dilutes the overall stipulation of merit as the overarching criterion for selection.  At best, the effect of Deputy Daly's amendment would be to create confusion as to the relative status of merit, gender equality and diversity, respectively, in the selection process.  At worst, we could have a situation in which candidates were selected primarily on gender or diversity considerations, with merit not constituting the primary or overarching criterion but rather being somehow secondary to other issues.  I am not sure to what extent that is intended.  I have no doubt that the Irish people are entitled to be assured through the legislation that the overarching basis for recruitment to the Judiciary is merit.  They are also entitled to be assured that diversity considerations and gender equality are taken into account in the selection process.  It is important that there is no confusion as to merit being the main deciding factor.  The section was carefully drafted and a lot of work went into it.  A great deal of consideration has been given to these matters by the drafters to deliver on this.  It would be unwise for us to change it.  The Judiciary has asked repeatedly that legislation contain a stipulation as to the overarching status of merit and I accept their position on that fully.<br/><br/>The aim of amendment No. 19 is to remove the wording from section 7(2)(b) which stipulates that the achievement of the diversity objective in relation to the Judiciary is &quot;to the extent feasible and practicable&quot;.  The words &quot;to the extent feasible and practicable&quot; are no more than a reflection of the task to which the commission will have to have regard in the attainment of this objective.  The amendment, if made, would require the selection process to have regard to the need for diversity in the Judiciary whether or not the achievement of such diversity was feasible or practicable in all of the circumstances.  That could be problematic.  The achievement of a diversity among the Judiciary which reflects the diversity of the population as a whole is a medium to long-term desirable objective based on the premise that all cadres and groups in society should be able to identify with those who are appointed to judicial office and have the confidence that our judges are in a position to understand and reflect their particular needs and aspirations.  That objective must be subject to what is feasible and practicable.  That qualification is important because of a whole range of things, not least the availability in a particular judicial selection process of diversity within the ranks of the highest performing lawyers who choose to apply and from among whom members of the Judiciary are chosen.  I am satisfied that the provision in place is sufficient as it draws attention to the important matter of diversity, requires that it be acted on and will ensure it is taken into account in the selection of appropriate candidates for the Judiciary.<br/><br/>The effect of amendments Nos. 19 and 20 taken together would be to insert in the Bill express statutory provisions governing requirements for proficiency in the Irish language.  If members wish, I am happy to wait before addressing this.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  I am not inclined to accept amendments Nos. 19 and 20 in the context of the Bill before us.  Making the amendments would mean that, subject to the existing fundamental requirement in section 7 that merit is the basis for any decision to recommend a person for appointment to judicial office, regard would also have to be had to an additional new and third objective that there be proficiency in the Irish language among the Judiciary.  Deputies will know that the Law Reform Commission's 2010 report on the consolidation and reform of the Courts Acts examined existing provisions in sections 44 and 71 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 which provide that, where practicable, a person assigned as a judge to a district or circuit where the Irish language is in general use must possess such knowledge of the Irish language to enable proceedings to be conducted without the aid of an interpreter.  The Law Reform Commission examined these provisions in light of the requirements of sections 8 and 9 of the Official Languages Act 2003 which deal with a person choosing to use the national language of his or her choice when dealing with a public body.  The commission recommended that its proposed courts (consolidation and reform) Bill should enhance the provisions of the 1924 Act.</p><p>It recommended that its proposed courts consolidation reform Bill should enhance the existing 24 statutory provisions and should provide for a Circuit Court or District Court judge assigned to a Gaeltacht area to be registered in the Irish language registers provided for under the Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Act 2008 without prejudice to any right or obligation under the Official Languages Act - sections 8 and 9 in particular.</p><p> It has not proved possible to put such proposals into current substantial legislative reform programme.  However, if and when it arises, it could be a more appropriate place to examine further where there is a need for the Deputy's proposed reforms not in the stand alone piecemeal way peculiar to the judicial appointments process, but in the broader context of the provision of courts services through the Irish language generally in the existing law as set out in 1924 and more recent statutes not under the direct remit of my Department as well as wider aspects of the European Union law.  The language issue is wider than the appointments process, looking at the scheme of the courts services Bill - the scheme of courts services as published in the 2003 Act detailing the courts services existing policy in practice regarding the delivery of services in the Irish language.</p><p> Deputy Clare Daly makes her point in amendment No. 21 dealing with political affiliation.  That is similar in effect to amendment No. 189 to section 64 proposed by Deputy Wallace.  That amendment seeks to prohibit any consideration of political affiliation in the judicial selection process.  I accept the thinking behind the amendment to the effect that political affiliation should not in any way be reckoned as better qualifying a candidate for appointment to judicial office, but a stipulation in section 7 of the Bill, which sets merit as the overarching criterion for recommendation with a requirement also but subject to merit the issue of gender equality and diversity into account, that makes my mind clear that political affiliation will play no role in the process of selecting persons for judicial office.</p><p> I have a concern about Deputy Daly's proposed wording that the complete prohibition on consideration of a candidate's political affiliation could be counterproductive to the intention of the amendment.  For example, as political affiliation is not defined, could the Deputy's proposed amendment mean that the commission's processes would be prohibited from considering the political affiliations of a candidate who may be a known member of an extremist political group with views that would make him or her patently unsuitable to be a member of the Judiciary?</p><p> I have a number of amendments and having regard to time, we will probably have a further opportunity before these questions are put.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018011700002#Q00200"><p>I wish to refer to two amendments about which I have not spoken previously.  The first is amendment No. 21 in the name of Deputy Clare Daly on which the Minister has just spoken.  This proposes including an express reference to the fact that a person's political affiliation should not be considered when the recommending body is considering their application.  The purpose behind the legislation is to ensure people are appointed on merit.  There is a public concern that sometimes people are appointed to political office because they have political connections or because of their political affiliations.  I am sure that has happened in the past.  I do not think it is a good thing.  Therefore, there is benefit in including within the section on recommendations based on merit a reference to the fact that somebody's political affiliation should be irrelevant and should not be considered when it comes to an application.</p> <p>  I hear the interesting point the Minister just made about extremist political views.  Consideration should be given to whether that would preclude an individual.  On balance, I would have thought that would be a factor that would exclude a person from consideration because they did not display the type of independence or integrity that would be required of somebody being appointed to the Bench.  On balance, I am favourably disposed to amendment No. 21.</p> <p>  What I like about amendment No. 21 is that it does not assume that just because somebody has a political affiliation they should not be made a judge.  Some of the best judges we have had are people with political affiliations.  In some instances, I am sure members of the public who come before a judge would prefer to be before an individual who has experience like all of us.  Sometimes we denigrate politicians and politics too much.  We have the advantage of having an exemplary insight into the public's thinking.  People sometimes think the media have a better insight; that is wrong.  Politicians have a much greater insight into what is happening on the ground with the public and how the public are thinking on certain issues.  We should not be nervous about the fact that somebody who had a political affiliation or was involved in politics then decides to get into the Judiciary afterwards.  I have no interest, myself, Chairman, just in case you think this is a defence.</p></speech>

In other countries, many people who made excellent judges previously had political affiliations.  The same is true in this country, but we will not go into that.</p> <p>  I have not yet referred to my amendment No. 124 which is in this grouping.  I know the Minister did not have an opportunity to discuss it.  In amendment No. 124, Deputy Jack Chambers and I seek to set out the characteristics that would make a good judge - the basis and the factors that should be considered by the commission when it is making a determination to recommend a person based on merit.  Obviously, it is difficult to set out the characteristics that constitute merit.  In many respects, a good judge is like an elephant: it is hard to describe, but when one sees it, one knows it.</p> <p>  I have sought to identify the characteristics that I think are important for somebody to be a good judge such as integrity; independence of mind; intellectual skills; sound temperament; ability to exercise sound judgment; impartiality; and an ability to interact with people in a courteous and considerate manner.  That is not something that can be overemphasised.  It is a public job dealing with members of the public and a judge must have an ability to deal with people in a courteous and considerate manner.</p> <p>  I have set them out in amendment No. 124.  I do not know what the Minister's views are on it.  I also follow it on with the fact that a judge needs to have a certain level of legal knowledge to be a judge.  Sometimes people view judges as they view the current President of the United States - anybody can do it.  Someone needs to be a lawyer and have a good knowledge and understanding of law in order to be a judge.  It might be important to set that out.</p></speech>

I will reintroduce and press it on Report Stage but I wish to facilitate the subsequent amendments now.</p><p> What I want to emphasise is why I think this is necessary and proportionate.  Essentially, the new section 7(3) would require that the net be case a little wider.  There is no question of anyone who is not qualified and who does not meet the merit proposal being appointed.  However, the short list of persons who could be appointed would have to include at least one person who satisfies the diversity criteria.  I think this is quite a low threshold.  In fact, I do not believe the Minister or anyone else would be satisfied if the Judicial Appointments Commission was producing short lists that were exclusively made up of middle-aged white men.  I do not think that would be satisfactory for the purposes of what we are trying to achieve and I am of the view that if we address it by means of casting the net wider, then at that point the commission may appoint whoever it wishes to appoint.  That is the separate issue but it is forcing the commission to cast the net wider and that is entirely in keeping with the spirit of and intention behind the legislation.  It is for this reason that the amendment, as worded, is valuable.  I am of the view that it can be of assistance and make it more explicit that the commission would take account of diversity and would serve the agenda relating to and purposes of the legislation.</p></speech>

His amendment is stronger than mine in some ways but both seek to achieve the same thing.  In respect of amendment No. 19 and the debate regarding the term &quot;feasible and practicable&quot;, the issue here that, under paragraphs (a) and (b), there is an objective to have equal numbers of men and women and to reflect diversity.  However, it is only in the provision relating to diversity that we include the caveat &quot;feasible and practicable&quot;.  What I am saying is that if it is not necessary to include the &quot;feasible and practicable&quot; bit with regard to the equal numbers of men and women, which is also an objective, why is it included in the context of diversity?  It is putting it down the pecking order.  I do not think there is any merit to it at all.  I do not think it is a big deal.  It is only putting it on an equal footing.  I would not have thought that was controversial at all.</p><p>In terms of the other one about merit and diversity, this is putting them on an equal footing.  I think that is important.  Senator Michael McDowell, who is one of the biggest critics of this Bill in the Seanad, made the point that he did not understand why we needed diversity at all because we have loads of excellent judges as matters stand.  In their submission, the judges said that diversity is a non-issue but that proves the point.  The fact that one has to make the argument for diversity shows that the nature of privilege is not being understood here.  I will put one quote on the record because I think it is very relevant.  It is from Dr. Laura Cahillane in UCC who said:</p><blockquote>Diversity is not about expecting different decisions than those that are given now but about providing equality of opportunity, democratic legitimacy, which feeds into public confidence that judges are representative of the community as a whole and can understand a vast array of issues, and also about providing diversity of opinion and divergent views.</blockquote> <p>In order to have that kind of equality of opportunity, we must ensure a diverse Judiciary.  I am glad to see stuff from the Bar Council and the Law Society of Ireland to the effect that there is a responsibility to get more people into the profession from those sections, so it not singly the responsibility of this Bill but it is key.  It is as equally as important as merit and not of lesser consideration.  That is not to say that people who are not qualified and do not have an understanding of the law should be given positions.  Nobody is arguing for that but it is saying that it is at least as important that people would have a broad range of experience of different cultural backgrounds and so on.  That is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 124 proposes to insert into section 38 a requirement that the commission ascertain which candidates for judicial office demonstrate specified qualities and characteristics and also have regard to the necessity for candidates to possess specified legal skills or competencies.  I have a number of difficulties with the amendment.  I am concerned that it would have the effect of detracting from the prevalence of the merit principle in section 7.  The latter establishes clearly that recommendations be based on merit and that merit assumes full consideration of equality as between men and women and diversity within the population.  The very detailed provisions in the amendment could be construed as overriding the crucial section 7 principles and objectives.  I invite Deputy O'Callaghan to agree that there are issues relating to what is a very wide-ranging amendment that go beyond merit.  I refer specifically to subparagraph (viii) concerning sensibility and cultural sensitivity.  There is also reference to "sound temperament and common sense" in subparagraph (iv).  I am not saying that these are not important.  However, I am saying that we have gone beyond the section 7 merit principle.</p> <p>  The amendment is simply too prescriptive and comprehensive to have an application in primary law.  It also runs contrary to the approach in Part 8 of the Bill, which tasks the procedures committee with defining and drawing up statements of skills, competencies, personal attributes and characteristics that an aspirant for judicial office must possess.  The Bill recognises that different statements may apply to different judicial offices and different classes of business.  If people read section 55 (5) and (6), they will see that we have covered much of the import of Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment without actually specifying matters in the detail into which he goes.  In the circumstances, going into such detail is problematic.  Section 55(6) sets out clearly for the procedures committee some specific issues to which regard should be had at the design stage.  I refer here to knowledge of the law, the proper and efficient conduct of proceedings, decision-making and awareness of the needs of those persons who use the courts.  I am of the view that this is sufficient.  The Bill recognises the different statements that may apply to various judicial offices.  There is a danger that what is proposed in Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment could prove too onerous should all of these issues become part of the legislative process.  In the UK - or at least in England and Wales - the Judicial Appointments Commission has developed merit criteria.</p><p>It deals with, for example, intellectual capacity and personal qualities of sound judgment, objectivity, decisiveness, an ability to understand and deal fairly, authority, and efficiency.  It is at that level that our new body might be charged with those responsibilities rather than have it in the primary legislation.</p></speech>

We can come back to this because it is important.  On the matter of diversity, it is easy-reach targets.  There are areas which have been referred to where there will be a difficulty in setting particular targets but there is no doubt that there is a compelling constitutional rationale and objective to have diversity in the Judiciary.  This is well documented in public commentary but it is not something that can be laid down and done in a prescriptive way within a clearly defined timeframe.  What we have done in the Bill is laid down clearly, through the two-pronged approach, at selection stage and at design stage.  That is in section 7 on merit and section 55(5).</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting us here today to discuss governance in funding in the arts sector.  </p> <p>  In 2018, the Arts Council will receive &euro;68.2 million in funding from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The Arts Council's role is to support the development of the arts in Ireland.  We do this through a range of grants and awards towards the production and creation of artistic work, by supporting organisations, supporting individual artists, and working in partnership with other agencies, for example local authorities, to develop the arts. </p> <p>  The governance regarding how the Arts Council awards funding to an individual or an organisation falls under a number of specific steps.  The first of these is the application process.  A call for applications with published criteria is issued, with an application window of, on average, six weeks from the call to the submission of the application.  All applications for funding are submitted using our online system.  The application is checked to ensure it is eligible, and is then moved to the assessment process. </p> <p>  The application is then internally assessed by an art form team, with at least two people contributing to the initial assessment of the application against the published criteria.</p><p>The application is then internally assessed by an art form team, with at least two people contributing to the initial assessment of the application against the published criteria.  The assessment is logged in our customer relationship management, CRM, system.  The assessments are then brought to the appropriate decision-making process, which is also publicly advertised.</p><p> There are three decision-making processes used by the Arts Council.  The first is the council plenary for grant decisions relating to annually or multi-annually funded organisations.  The assessments, with recommended amounts, are brought to the council for deliberation and decision.  Peer panels are typically used for grants to individuals and project grants.  Panel members for each panel are selected from an approved panel master list.  Peer panels are chaired by a current or former member of the Arts Council.  Panellists are nominated on the basis of their expert knowledge.  In order to safeguard effective and objective decision-making and provide a wide range of opinions, a different panel is appointed for each assessment round.  All decisions are brought to the council for noting.  The executive panel process is used for travel and training and small festivals grants.  All decisions are brought to the council for noting.</p><p> All applications for funding, regardless of the decision-making model, are scored against the application criteria so that organisations or individuals understand the rationale behind the decision.  All decisions can be appealed, with the appeal heard by an independent appeals panel.  All funding decisions are published on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website within ten days of their being made.  Once an award has been made, organisations or individuals must formally accept the award in writing and formally indicate that they comply with our conditions of financial assistance.  A payment schedule is then agreed on the basis of specific reporting requirements, such as submission of audited accounts, reports on activity and so forth.  The final payment is always withheld until the Arts Council is satisfied that it has received all the required documentation and assurances that the grant funding was expended in accordance with the purpose for which it was granted and any conditions attaching to the grant funding were met.</p><p> The conditions of financial assistance are in two parts.  Part 1 of these conditions applies to all recipients of Arts Council funding.  Part 2 applies only to annually or multi-annually funded organisations.  Part 1 includes clauses dealing with: the funding offer; managing payments; reporting and assurance; keeping of accounts and making inspections; acknowledging the Arts Council; termination of the grant; and compliance with all laws, specifically as they relate to child protection, safety, health and welfare at work, employment, data protection and freedom of information, FOI.  Further clauses deal with intellectual property rights and value for money.</p><p> Part 2 outlines specific additional conditions applying to recipients of grant funding, including ensuring that the Arts Council is provided with a copy of the organisation's constitution, that organisations shall hold no less than quarterly board meetings and that where any matters of material interest to the Arts Council are reported at a board meeting or otherwise the recipient has a responsibility to furnish to the Arts Council the relevant documentation and explanation in a timely fashion.</p><p> There are specific conditions on the financial reporting required for grants less than &euro;25,000 and those over &euro;25,000 and deadlines for their submission.  For all grants over &euro;100,000, the Arts Council can also appoint an independent auditor to: ensure that public money is managed properly and is expended on the purpose for which it was awarded; provide assurances on the system of internal financial control, ensuring that effective and efficient systems are in place to make sure there is value for money; examine whether the recipient conducts its affairs with probity and sound corporate governance; and establish that the board is furnished with adequate financial information and that all related party transactions are properly disclosed in the accounts.</p><p> Part 2 also outlines specific conditions as they relate to governance, including confirmation that the recipient will co-operate fully with the Arts Council by implementing policies and procedures in areas which include internal audit, risk management, public procurement, financial reporting and quality of service.  Part 2 also requests that organisations comply at all times with governance arrangements based on: specific principles relating to strategy; compliance with statutory obligations; ensuring and managing risk; establishing and managing internal controls; clearly documenting procedures for the appointment and disqualification of board members; ensuring that appropriate financial management and oversight are in place; annual review of board performance; maintaining a code of conduct for board members setting out standards of integrity, conduct, ethics and concern for public interest; and confirming in writing that the recipient is complying with the Arts Council&rsquo;s governance transparency scale.</p><p> Furthermore, part 2 outlines that where any board or staff member behaves illegally, wrongfully, inappropriately or in breach of relevant policies or procedures of the recipient, whether by act or omission, all action will be taken to deal with any allegation or complaint against a board or staff member to ensure the safety and protection of such person and members of the public generally and shall report the matter to all relevant bodies.  Part 2 also outlines that where a serious concern relating to governance is identified, it shall be notified in writing to the Arts Council with a proposal for dealing with the issue.  As part of the Arts Council&rsquo;s ongoing relationship management, organisations in receipt of strategic funding will now also have to sign a formal funding agreement that will outline specific conditions attaching to the specific offer of funding.</p><p> The Arts Council has been leading best-practice governance support within the scope of our authority for arts organisations over recent years, particularly as changes brought about by the Charities Act and the appointment of the Charities Regulator in 2014 have been introduced.  As the Arts Council is not a regulatory body and given that there are regulatory bodies in place for both charities and companies, our role is to provide best practice advice and support to arts organisations.  To this end, we have published A Practical Guide for Board Members of Arts Organisations.  We ran a governance seminar in 2016 and developed a draft constitution to support organisations to comply with the new charities legislation and the companies legislation.  We have also developed a governance transparency code that organisations must sign up to as well as a suite of other corporate governance documents.</p><p> The Arts Council takes its role in managing and awarding public moneys very seriously.  We make transparent decisions in terms of awarding funding to those artists and arts organisations that make the most compelling and ambitious applications for funding based on the Arts Council&rsquo;s published strategy and funding criteria.  Our decision-making processes are open and rigorous and our ongoing processes for monitoring, reporting and managing the funding once it is awarded are robust.</p><p> I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to outline the governance relating to how we award funding to the arts sector.</p></speech>

I am assistant secretary general of the culture division in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I am accompanied by Mary Nash, principal officer in the arts, film and investment unit, and Sinead Copeland, principal officer in the Creative Ireland unit of the Department.  I thank the joint committee for inviting us to discuss governance of funding in the arts sector.</p> <p>  The culture division of the Department is responsible for overseeing much of the State's cultural services as well as leading on the programme for the decade of commemorations up to 2023.  As the State&rsquo;s cultural services are, in the main, delivered through agencies it follows that the majority of the Department&rsquo;s funding is channelled through them.  The current programme budget for 2018 is just under &euro;130 million.  This funds ongoing operations and funding schemes of the Department and its agencies.  The capital budget provision for 2018 is just under &euro;30 million.  This funds investment in national cultural institutions, arts and cultural centres and funding support offered by the Irish Film Board.</p> <p>  Of the total programme budget of &euro;160 million in 2018, &euro;68 million is provided for the Arts Council, &euro;18 million for the Irish Film Board and &euro;45 million for our national cultural institutions.  These include the National Museum of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Chester Beatty Library, the National Concert Hall and the Crawford Gallery in Cork.  Funding of &euro;4.5 million is provided to the culture Ireland unit of the Department to promote Irish arts and artists on the world stage and &euro;6 million is provided for the Creative Ireland programme.  The Department also supports a range of smaller institutions and organisations with funding, such as the Hunt Museum in Limerick, Marsh&rsquo;s Library and Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, as well as operating capital grant schemes for investing in arts and cultural infrastructure.</p> <p>  The governance relationship between the Department and its agencies is covered by legislation and policy.  The Arts Council, Irish Film Board and many of the national cultural institutions are established by legislation which sets out the role of the Minister, the board and the director with regard to their powers and functions.  In addition, the Department and its agencies are subject to relevant Government policy.  The Department communicates policy direction to its agencies through annual finding letters, performance delivery agreements and annual oversight agreements.  The allocation of funding by the Department is subject to certain conditions including compliance with public financial procedures, the public spending code, the code of practice for the governance of State Bodies, national and EU procurement rules and procedures, pay and employment procedures and other circulars issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> A significant part of the work of the culture division entails ongoing interaction with all its agencies on funding, reporting, staffing, the appointment of boards and directors, the delivery of services and overall compliance.</p><p> In the context of the arts specifically, the Arts Council is the body established by the Oireachtas as the national agency for promoting and developing the arts in Ireland.  At &euro;68.2 million, the Arts Council will receive the majority of the division's current funding in 2018.</p><p> It should also be noted that the Arts Act 2003 empowers the Minister to promote the arts both inside and outside the State.  The Act enables the Minister to set the overall policy framework for arts and to channel public funding to the Arts Council.  Furthermore, the Act recognises the role that local authorities and other public agencies have in promoting the arts.  For example, public service broadcasting plays a key role in this area.  The work of promoting and cherishing the arts and our culture is a task shared by many public and private bodies.  It should be noted that the Arts Act 2003 specifically provides that the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions and the Department cannot become involved in these decisions.</p><p> On recent initiatives taken by the Department, the most notable has been the establishment of the Creative Ireland programme, which was launched in December 2016.  This followed the success of Ireland 2016 centenary programme.  The year 2016 was one of extraordinary cultural reflection and inclusive celebration.  The Government recognised that it was important to harness that energy with a new programme.  The Creative Ireland programme also served as the vehicle to implement much of what was set out in the draft framework policy document, Culture 2025.</p><p> During last year, the first year of the Creative Ireland programme, there were many successes.  It was also a learning opportunity for the Department to make new connections, explore new policy areas and provide an opportunity to work right across Government.  Collaboration is at the heart of the Creative Ireland programme and provides a framework within which new ideas can be explored, such as cultural and creative education, the creative economy, health and well-being.  The Arts Council, Irish Film Board, the national cultural institutions, other Departments and local authorities are key partners in this collaboration.  The Creative Ireland programme is also about the future, when many of today's jobs will no longer exist.  We know that the most valuable economic resource will be the human imagination - the capacity of every individual person to innovate and create, to solve problems.  Developing imaginative and creative skills is crucially important.</p><p> There were some significant successes last year on which we will build on in 2018.  I refer, for example, to the establishment of Creative Ireland co-ordinators and culture teams in every local authority area.  This development was assisted by &euro;2 million in funding provided by the Departments of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The local culture and creativity plans listed over 750 projects, events and initiatives which took place nationwide in 2017 of which an estimated 250 were directly attributable to the Creative Ireland programme.  The Department will double its funding for this element of the programme in 2018.</p><p> Education is at the heart of the programme.  In December 2017, Creative Youth - A plan to enable the creative potential every child and young person, a joint effort between the Departments of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs, and our colleagues in the Arts Council, was launched.  The Arts Council will be launching its creative schools initiative shortly to encourage further creativity and culture in our classrooms.</p><p> A pilot scheme giving professional artists and writers easier access to social welfare supports was launched in June.</p><p> A widespread and comprehensive communications strategy was embarked on to engage citizens with the programme using traditional and digital platforms.  To complement this, the Department took part in various major events in 2017 as part of the Creative Ireland Programme.  These were chosen in order to promote the objectives and underlying values of the programme.  For example, the live streaming of the ILLUMINATE talks and performance programme at Electric Picnic was attended by 11,000 people but attracted over 271,000 online views on the Creative Ireland programme Facebook live stream.</p><p> The Creative Ireland programme is an initiative that is driven by a unit within the culture division of the Department.  The objectives of the programme extend right across the full spread of the Department's functions as well as that of its agencies.  It also spreads right across Government, as seen at the Creative Ireland forum last month.  The latter was addressed by the Taoiseach, the Ministers for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills, Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Health, and appropriately, the European Commissioner for Education, Youth, Culture and Sport.  It is an initiative which will strengthen the place in Irish society of culture and creativity and bring to the fore the important role that the Arts Council, Irish Film Board and national cultural institutions all play in the life of the nation.</p></speech>

There is so much wonderful activity happening in the arts sector and we do not spend enough time focusing on all of that.  Much of that work happens as a result of the funding and the development that is facilitated by these organisations.</p> <p>  One of the reasons we looked to have this discussion is because the arts sector has been rocked in recent months by allegations of bullying and harassment.  It would be useful for the members to be able to see what we can do to strengthen the protections that exist for workers in this area.  My questions relate to that.  One of the protections that could be used is the withdrawal of funds.  In other words, if an organisation was not fulfilling its responsibilities according to employment law and it was adjudicated not to be doing so by an independent organisation, such as the Workplace Relations Commission, perhaps the Arts Council could withdraw funds from that organisation.  Does the Arts Council have the power to do that and has it ever done it?</p></speech>

Every organisation that we offer funding to has to accept those conditions of financial assistance as part of the offer.  Essentially, the payments are conditioned to be released on satisfactory compliance with those conditions.</p></speech>

That is the first point.  We have detailed guidelines around governance and what organisations must have in place.  The bodies that we fund are companies limited by guarantee.  The board members have the responsibility - as the fiduciaries of the members - to run the organisation, along with the governance standards that we clearly set out in our conditions of financial assistance.</p></speech>

Would they be part of the criteria by which the Arts Council adjudges whether or not an organisation should get funding?  Second, because it could be a Bill that we could bring in, for example, to give the Arts Council the power to potentially withdraw funding if they were not met, does the Arts Council already have that power and has it already used it?</p></speech>

It is a big budget and it comes with heavy responsibilities the Arts Council obviously takes seriously.  Interestingly, it was asked of me would it be a good idea for the chairperson of the council to have the same duties as an Accounting Officer with regards to the disposal of funding so that he or she would be considered an Accounting Officer in the eyes of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts, etc.  It is a good chunk of funding and maybe there would be greater scope for the House to tease out how moneys are spent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.464" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin O'Sullivan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018011700002#D01100"><p>The director is the Accounting Officer for the Arts Council.  The council is the decision maker in terms of the ultimate funding decision that is being made.  Of course, as the Chairman will be aware, under the Act, the council is independent in that role.  The process is clear.  It is awarded on a merit basis in terms of the various assessment processes that the director read out earlier.</p><p>The recommendation is sent to the council for its final consideration.  I think the processes are very strong at present.     </p></speech>

The arts space is small and, therefore, people get to know each other very well.  How often is the board of directors for the Arts Council, for example, renewed?  Is it renewed every five or ten years?  How regularly would a board member step down?  Can he or she rejoin after a couple of years?</p></speech>

The Minister, through the Public Appointments Service, appoints the recommended members to the board.  Appointments are made on a split basis.  That means half of the board steps down every two and half years.  It is a very robust appointment process.</p></speech>

Those elements the Chairman mentioned, such as funding directed towards areas of deprivation, geographic spread, gender balance and so on have become gradually integrated into our decision-making process.  This approach needs to be further formalised but it certainly forms part of our thinking.  One can see from our past decisions that there is widespread funding throughout the country.</p></speech>

It should be built into the culture of the organisation.  For example, in the spring we will provide a series of workshops to arts organisations around the country because we want to ensure the best policies and procedures are in place to protect their workers against any kind of discrimination, bullying or harassment.  Working with organisations to ensure that that is built into the culture of the organisation would be much more effective than using an inspectorate-type process to ensure that is in place.  Building it in from the outset is the piece that is really important because that is the bit then that will reach people in an organisation who may be experiencing something that is unpleasant and want to bring it to someone's attention.  That is the process that we will implement in spring 2018.</p></speech>

The previous Minister, Deputy Humphreys, indicated that she would develop a forum comprised of the heads of the theatres.  Can the Department update us on the matter?  It might be a good idea were a longer and more embedded industry-wide forum to be developed.  Some of the problems that have happened in the arts sector and in the film sector, which is similar, are due to the precarious nature of the work.  Workers work on a particular project and when that employment ceases, they must pitch for the next project.  There is a risk that if one uses the mechanisms of the State to defend one's rights, one would get a name for oneself, be blacklisted and not be re-employed by the organisation.  This issue is particularly prominent in the film industry.  Would it be useful to ascertain whether a forum could be constructed that included all of the stakeholders, including unions, representatives etc. in the film and theatre sectors, to consider ways to eradicate the precarious work practices while still allowing the sectors to grow and strengthen?</p></speech>

On that occasion there was a particular focus on the theatre sector.  It was agreed that the Department would assist the sector in coming forward with proposals that might help to deal with this issue of culture.  Arising out of that meeting, the Irish Theatre Institute, which offers support services to the industry, has worked to develop a number of proposals to put forward a positive engagement, which would be forward-looking in terms of what the sector can do or what can be done to assist the sector.  The questions the Chairman has raised would be central to the discussion.  The initiative will come from the theatre sector.  The Department does not control it but has offered to help.  We are very close to agreeing a proposal and the Irish Theatre Institute will announce some proposals in that regard, which may lead to a longer-term process.  The Department has facilitated a safe space for discussion, thus allowing the sector to identify proposals for a better way forward.  I think the Department will be supportive of any proposals.</p></speech>

While I acknowledge that part of being a member of the committee is to be educated and informed, one could have read her statement in a pamphlet.  As for decision-making, accounts, plenary councils and peer panels and application processes, I am aware the Arts Council does things absolutely correctly but I would have liked more funding examples.  The Arts Council does extraordinary work in disadvantaged areas and is cognisant of geographical spread.  She might give us an example of that.  I would particularly like to hear about something the Arts Council took on from its inception that went on to achieve great success due to the council's intuition, processes, etc.  I felt we lost out on an example even though I acknowledge Ms McBride was outlining the governance background.</p><p>How much time must the Arts Council spend on grant applications and decisions and how much does that eat into what the council would prefer to be doing by way of developing ideas?  How could we best facilitate that?  Ms McBride stated such matters should not be separate, that there should not be an organisation sitting in an annexe doing all that but that the work should be integrated.  How much does that eat into the Arts Council being a purveyor of great ideas and voicing them, instead of being the place to apply to or where someone's application was turned down?  Could Ms McBride talk about that balance and whether she needs more staff for that balance?  </p><p> Has there been a recent survey of what agencies, artists or artistic organisations think of the Arts Council and what it has learnt from that?  I am not talking about hearsay at bus stops.  How long do all the checks and assessments take?  </p><p> I thank Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh for his contribution.  There is a new Minister.  I wish her and the Department the best of luck in her new portfolio.  </p><p> Can Ms Copeland outline her role in Creative Ireland?  What does it intend to do?  Where will the &euro;6 million be spent?  Where stands the arm's-length approach of the Department?  It it getting into the territory of giving out money to artists and agencies and deciding on cultural programmes around the country?  I felt Creative Ireland was happening anyway and it was not the Department that purveyed it.  The St. Patrick's Day parades, for example, show what is happening artistically in every area of Ireland up to Carndonagh and further.  Where does encroachment begin and Creative Ireland end, for example, in giving money to cultural organisations?  Is it the new Arts Council?  Is it an annexe to the Arts Council, which will make decisions?  How will it make these decisions?  I know the Department makes decisions on the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery, the National Concert Hall, our orchestras and so on, which is very important but where does that begin and end? </p></speech>

The turnaround for applications depends on the type of application.  We can turn the small applications around relatively quickly but the big ones for significant sums of money as part of our annual funding take approximately 16 weeks from the date of receipt of the application, which would normally be in September, until the decision is made and communicated in December.</p> <p>  We have procured a company, CARA Consulting, which has conducted the first open survey of organisations and artists that have either received or not received, applied or had difficulty applying for, Arts Council funding to ensure that we do not just ask people who have been in receipt of funding what they think of the Arts Council, the service, the experience etc.  We were invited to speak on governance and we presented that in the strictest sense of the word but if the committee wants to talk about the kinds of organisation and the experiences we have funded in recent years, we have made participatory arts a priority.  They are arts activities happening in different communities and locations, for example, we invested a large sum of money in Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland in recent years.  It has transformed the capacity of people with disabilities to access the arts and to make extraordinary art.  This year, and in recent years, we have prioritised funding for children and young people.  This year, as part of our new strategic funding programme, we have increased funding from 15 organisations annually to 30.  They work with children and young people, in areas of disadvantage and rural communities doing youth theatre and dance.  We are also going to launch the Creative Schools programme in the coming weeks, which will reach into 150 schools around the country in 2018.  We have identified schools that participate in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, scheme, as well as in rural, urban and Irish language communities and so on.  We are beginning to ensure we are reaching out as far as we can within the available resources.  Between 70% and 80% on the Arts Council's internal resource is spent on funding.  That is too much but we lost one third of our staff and are only now building the staff up to ensure we can spend more than 20% or 30% of our time thinking and imagining how we develop and support artists and arts organisations for the next ten years in Ireland.  </p></speech>

It does not have the same emphasis on who and what it is, as Ms McBride described it, dealing with disability, children, age, for example, the Bealtaine Festival for older people.  Is that changing and if so how quickly?</p> <p>  Has the CARA survey come out yet? </p></speech>

Would Ms McBride agree with that?  How does the council get out of that?</p></speech>

That is where the extraordinary work is happening around the country.  That is where people from Donegal to Kerry are participating in the arts, children from nine months of age to people involved in the Bealtaine Festival are participating in arts experiences.  By working with organisations we understand how we can make an impact on the lives of people around the country through the arts and culture.  It is a balance because they are the people making and creating the work.  It is a question of how we work with them and them have thinking time to begin to look to the future.</p></speech>

There is no attempt within the Department to rival the Arts Council.  The ambition of the Government through the Creative Ireland programme is to make arts, culture and creativity more central to all Departments.  That in itself should help release resources for the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board.</p><p>Where we are trying to get in the Creative Ireland programme is to a space of greater collaboration.  While we respect the arm's length principle in Arts Council decision-making, there is nothing to fear from the Arts Council and the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs working collaboratively on new initiatives.  That is part of it.  A significant element of our funding goes to local authorities.  The Arts Council also provides funding to local authorities.  However, we are going through culture teams which encompass not only arts officers but also heritage officers, librarians and archivists.  In the past, they have all been funded through separate streams and we are bringing them all together.  It is very much a result of how that worked in the 1916 centenary commemorations.

I appreciate what Ms McBride said about looking into who has and who has not received funding down through the years.  That is hugely important, in fairness, because there seems to be a lot of money out there which might be made available to community and voluntary organisations.  In my constituency, Cork South-West, I receive a lot of criticism that organisations do not get enough funding for the arts whether through the council or the Department.  Perhaps they do and they are not acknowledging it.  That might be something the witnesses could discuss.  How is it filtering down to the rural community and voluntary organisations?  Are they getting the funding or are they misleading me?</p> <p>  Slightly differently to the Chair, I note the following.  It is obvious that we must have regulation, but we have to be careful too in that a lot of these voluntary organisations are stretched to the limit.  They are overly regulated and trying to comply with the rules of companies limited by guarantee, constitutions and Garda clearance, which one has to get to sit at a meeting.  One has to get another Garda clearance to drive the bus and a further one to do meals on wheels.  Where are we going to stop?  In the name of God, these are voluntary organisations and people are stretched to the limit.  I am in one voluntary organisation in Goleen where we pay &euro;7,000 between insurance and accounts and up to &euro;8,000 and &euro;9,000 to run a festival.  There is little or no help out there.  Where does the money come from to pay &euro;3,000 to accountants and &euro;4,000 to an insurer before the year even starts?  It is coming from the community.  I would appreciate it if the witnesses directed me as to how these funds are filtering down to rural community voluntary organisations as well as those in urban areas.  They are working hard and finding it very difficult.  If they continue to be squeezed, a lot of people will walk away from the organisations with which they are involved.</p></speech>

For example, we demand much more of West Cork Music in terms of assurances about the use of the resources than we do of Fit-Up, a small theatre festival in Deputy Michael Collins's constituency which gets approximately &euro;8,000 from us.  We ask much less of them because they are getting far less money.  We have a small festivals scheme for small voluntary organisations and it covers approximately 150 to 160 festivals, which are tiny events.  Some of them get only &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 a year but for them it is a huge amount of money.  There is other funding at local level and we also work very much in partnership with local authorities to ensure they support the local and voluntary sector.  As such, the reporting requirements are relative to the amount of funding.  An organisation in receipt of &euro;4,000 is not asked for the same level of reporting as an organisation in receipt of &euro;250,000.  We have schemes which are focused on smaller voluntary organisations which do not have a whole structure surrounding them.  They simply involve people giving of their time and making applications.  We understand that as much as we can.</p></speech>

The Department provides capital support primarily.  The West Cork Arts Centre is an example of a major investment by the Department in recent years.  The other arm of the State which the Department supports is local government to strengthen the role of arts, culture and creativity in the local government sector.  That is where we are trying to focus a great deal more attention to utilise the resources the Arts Council is providing.  We seek to bolster creativity and culture at local level.  It is only a small amount of money when it is divvied up between 31 local authorities, but they also have a role to play.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Sullivan and the Chairman discussed conflicts of interest.  My question is a general one in that regard.  If I were on the board of the Arts Council and had previous involvement with a traditional folk band, would I remove myself from conversations specific to that application or from the competition entirely?  That might not be relevant to larger funding schemes, such as those for theatres, but it may be relevant to festivals or traditional music.  Would the person with the conflict of interest remove himself or herself from the entire competition or leave the room solely for the conversation around the group with which he or she was involved?</p></speech>

What the Arts Council wants in its membership is balance.  In order to get the breadth of discussion on traditional arts, it is very important that the traditional artists on the council are there not to influence but to give the perspective of the sector.  "Artist" is a broad term so there are members from different areas.  The best decision-making happens through that type of process, but there is no doubt that for any discussion of particulars and any decision, the person leaves the room.</p></speech>

I accept that it is the first year of the initiative and that designers and printers, etc., play a part in marketing as well, but is it quite lavish to spend so much on this rather than directly supporting the work of artists?</p></speech>

We broke that down under national and regional headings to try and get a really wide spread.  There is so much more uptake of information on digital platforms now, and we felt that, based on previous experience - in particular the Ireland 2016 centenary programme - it was a good investment in the first year in order to try and get good quality content and products.  That is why we chose to do this in the first year.</p></speech>

Bodies such as the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board provide necessary finance for artists.

There is an analogous position for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in that RT&Eacute; is also an arm's length body.  I understand that in the first instance it is an internal review, but the Department and the Minister are very mindful of the importance of orchestral music and the employment that provides in the sector.  We keep in close contact with our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  When RT&Eacute; finalises its review I am sure that it will be subject to further discussion.</p></speech>

I met with an artists-led studio spaces initiative in the city centre.  Block T has closed.  Others in Cork have closed.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for an artists' studio spaces scheme.  Is space for artists something the Department is mindful of?  It does not require as much current funding following the capital construction allocation.  Artists are concerned about capital infrastructure, and that is fair and valid because the current funding is lacking.</p></speech>

We have had some discussions with the Arts Council and Dublin City Council.  It is something we are open to looking at if any concrete proposals come forward.  Many local authorities do good work in trying to identify spaces.  Our existing capital grant scheme, under which we awarded grants in 2017, provided supports for a number of studio spaces, so it is absolutely something we are open to.</p></speech>

As part of that we have developed Creative Schools.  Creative Ireland has provided separate funding to roll out the Creative Schools programme.  We have also received quite significant funding from the Department of Education and Skills, which for us is an extraordinary achievement.  The Arts Council is also investing some of its own resources in it as well.  That is starting this year.</p></speech>

The initiative is being rolled out to 150 schools this year, but there are 3,000 primary schools and 900 secondary schools in the country, so significant resources will be required to roll this out as a national programme.  We believe that the programme will be so good that once the first 150 schools experience it, it will become a national programme.</p></speech>

T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm nach raibh m&eacute; anseo ag t&uacute;s na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta.  I apologise for not being here at the beginning, but I have read the statements.  When I was involved in theatre many years ago a very good friend of mine, who was a set designer and who went on to win an <i>Irish Times</i>award, was in the middle of building a set for one of our productions and had to go and sign on the dole.  The lady in the dole office asked him how he was doing, and his answer to him was that he was flat out.  She looked at him and raised her eyebrow, but she signed him off anyway and he got his dole for that week.  That was back in the 80s, when we would have described the Arts Council as a F&Aacute;S scheme or the dole because many artists were dependent on that.</p><p>The budget announced the &quot;artists' dole&quot;, as it has been called, as a pilot scheme.  I would appreciate an update as to how that is working, how many people have applied for it, whether it is successful and whether it is going to be extended.  Many artists say to me that they are living hand to mouth and are very much dependent on the jobseeker's allowance, but they have the indignity of having to apply for it every time they finish a commission, for example, and the uneven nature of their income really affects it.</p><p>Another issue that has been raised with me by many local artists is the Per Cent for Art scheme, where capital projects can spend moneys on art.  We have seen some wonderful pieces of art and also seen some fairly unwonderful pieces of art under that scheme, but I know that it has been used in nursing homes and schools, etc.  I get a sense that not all potential capital projects are availing of that opportunity and that it would be a fantastic source of income for many artists who are really struggling at the moment, particularly smaller artists, and that it would bring arts to rural areas.  Who is pushing that scheme?  Who is overseeing the scheme?  Why are we not seeing more art happening under the scheme?  </p><p>On the issue of governance, the role of Aosd&aacute;na and its independence under the funding scheme available through the Arts Council arises.  It is important to ensure that Aosd&aacute;na is a relevant organisation.  I understand there is a review ongoing.  This may have been mentioned already, and I apologise if that is the case.  Could the witnesses talk to us about the future of Aosd&aacute;na and how it is looked upon?  </p><p>Obviously, t&aacute;im tiomanta do ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an airgead a cuireadh ar f&aacute;il d'Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.  The funding for Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta is absolutely essential, but what is the Irish language policy as it relates to the arts, the Department and the Arts Council?  We have a national theatre which has not produced an Irish language production in almost 20 years, which I think is absolutely disgraceful.  I wonder, from a policy perspective and Government perspective, why national organisations are not encouraged to do more work through the medium of the Irish language.  </p><p>There is a sense among the arts community that there are quite a few large clients of the Arts Council who get a huge chunk of funding on an annual basis.  Some would say it is warranted, while others ask why these clients get the same amount every year and call it a closed shop.</p><p>A number of stakeholders seem to lionise the available funding which makes it very difficult for newcomers or new and creative artists to break into the existing funding models.  What is being done from a governance perspective to ensure the bigger organisations will not get too comfortable with the funding they are receiving and that space will be given to new groups?</p></speech>

The artists scheme in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is scheduled to be reviewed after a year.  We will begin to look at that issue.  I do not have the numbers with me, but we can come back to the committee to see how the scheme is operating.  We do not believe a huge number of artists are availing of the scheme which is focused on visual artists and writers, but that matter needs more consideration.</p> <p>  The percent for art scheme has been very successful.  I suspect that one of the things that happened in that regard was that artists lost out hugely when capital investment in the State generally collapsed, but it is beginning to ramp up again.  The Minister very recently committed to considering the scheme which needs to be refreshed.  We will work with the Arts Council in that regard.  Most public sector organisations still utilise it, but a couple of gaps are emerging.</p> <p>  I dtaca le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge, t&aacute;imid sa Roinn tiomanta don Ghaeilge freisin.  Is &eacute; seo Bliain na Gaeilge chomh maith.  We are going to integrate bliain na Gaeilge and the Creative Ireland programme a oiread agus is f&eacute;idir linn.  On the small amount we give in support to local authorities to help to develop their Creative Ireland programmes through the cultural teams, we will be asking them to ensure they make provision for events as part of Bliain na Gaeilge.  It is of great benefit because it involves the Gaeltacht and cultural sections of the Department working very closely together.  We are happy to try to deepen that relationship as much as we can.  S&iacute;lim gur sin an m&eacute;id ar mo thaobh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.533" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orlaith McBride" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018011700002#J00300"><p>We met Foras na Gaeilge approximately two weeks ago to consider how we might work together during Bliain na Gaeilge.  As regards the Arts Council and artists and organisations which happen to be in Gaeltacht areas such as Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta, we are not investing in such organisations because they are using Irish as part of their work; therefore, we have to be very careful.  That is why it was very good to meet Foras na Gaeilge to be very clear on what our respective responsibilities were and to then look at ways in which we could support each other and work together.</p> <p>  As regards the Irish language, the Abbey Theatre was mentioned.  As members know, two years ago An Taibhdhearc brought its work to the Abbey Theatre.  Anne McCabe has now been chosen for the Irish language 5x5 award as part of the Abbey Theatre's outreach projects.  The Abbey Theatre is beginning to open up in that way to Irish language artists.</p> <p>  We do not stop funding an organisation just because it is a large client and has been in receipt of money for many years.  For example, we are not going to stop funding the Irish Traditional Music Archive or the Galway Arts Festival just because they have received money for many years.  If they continue to be relevant, produce work, engage with the public and be the best they can, we will continue to fund them.  The issue in recent years is that new organisations have been knocking on our door but have not been able to get in because we have not had additional resources.  This year we reformed our full funding framework and programmes and have two new funding schemes - strategic funding and arts grants funding.  That arts grants funding scheme is being established to ensure organisations that might have received a small amount of project funding this year, that will receive none the following year and a small amount the year after that will now be able to receive funding on a more regular basis to produce work and, it is to be hoped, in a number of years a big event such as the Galway Arts Festival, the traditional music archive or the Wexford Festival Opera.  However, it all depends on the available resources.</p></speech>

Joining Aosd&aacute;na is, first and foremost, an honour for an artist, but we understand the Cnuas grant is a very important element of it for artists.  The award of the Cnuas grant is one of the very best ways we can support artists in their middle and later years.  It has never been under question or threat and the council is completely committed to it.  We are in ongoing discussions with Aosd&aacute;na about a certain amount of reform of the system whereby people would be elected or invited to join, etc.  However, the Cnuas grant is sacrosanct.</p></speech>

I thank all participants for their contributions.  </p> <p>  I come from Galway east.  People in that area - Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh has just left the meeting - often say we are the poor relation compared to Galway city when it comes to the arts.  The delegates mentioned the Galway Arts Festival, but there was a Tuam Arts Festival which ran for one year and had to give up because it failed to secure funding.  It died about five years ago because it totally lacked support.  It goes back to the point about how one deals with smaller groups when the larger, successful groups have received funding.  We do not want the Tuam or Loughrea arts festival to be like the Galway Arts Festival, but we want them to be able to do what they can in the right way with support.  As a former councillor, my impression is that the Arts Council is in place for the big people and organisations and that the small or emerging artists are left to either make or break it on their own.  There should be a change of emphasis in the percentage of funding we give out.  I am not saying we should stop funding the bigger guys but that a larger percentage of the overall cake should be given to smaller and emerging artists on an ongoing basis because we do not want to have elite organisations and then nothing else.  I am impressed by and very confident in the schools programme and all that goes on in that regard, but we need a shift such that people who are thinking about starting something in places such as Tuam, Loughea, Gort or any other small town will have a sense that help will be available and will have the confidence to take it on.  As Deputy Michael Collins said, a lot of labour-intensive work goes into such initiatives.</p> <p>  Another issue in smaller places in which shows or something similar are put on is that there is no designated place to store sets or equipment in order to use them again.  Groups are storing them in houses or sheds attached to private houses which, if they went on fire, they would have no insurance cover them.  Public buildings are available which should be brought to the attention of the relevant local authority.  For example, a new fire station is being built in Tuam.  The old fire station building would be ideal for use as a storage area or workshop, but who will provide the small amount of funding needed to make it workable?  These are the small things that would create a lot more around the country, as well as the schools and creative programme in which Ms Copeland is involved.  However, there is confusion among those involved because one may have to deal with the Arts Council, the Department and the local authority.  Why do we not have a one stop shop from which people could obtain advice and funding forms in order that they would be talking to one voice rather than having a fragmented approach?  That is why I expressed concern about the Creative Ireland initiative, which involves the Department and Creative Ireland.  There is confusion about the initiative among those who want to start something, although perhaps not for me having listened to the delegates.</p><p>I commend them on all of the work being done, but like everything else, improvements could be made, as we need to improve matters.  I know that they are passionate about what they do, which has come through in the presentations.  I will not put questions to them.  I thank them for their presentations and wish them well in their future work.</p></speech>

The good work which forms the vast part of the picture has to be recognised, but there are critical difficulties in the sector, although I appreciate efforts are being made to change the culture, which is really important work.</p> <p>  I understand workers need a safe place in which to contribute in the arts sector.  From the perspective of the Department and the Arts Council, I would like them to have an ongoing conversation with the committee about the tools that are necessary to strengthen their ability to ensure the system of governance will create a healthier working environment.</p> <p>  I thank the delegates and wish them the best of luck</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.548" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Coyne" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018011700002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend here today.  It is a very important issue and I am grateful for the opportunity to address it.</p> <p>  As Ireland&rsquo;s largest public transport provider, with over 139 million customers a year, we play a key role in the provision of accessible public transport in the communities we serve.  The primary barrier for customers with disabilities to our services in the 1990s related to step-entry vehicles and the challenges they posed for customers with mobility difficulties.  In the late 1990s, Dublin Bus introduced its first low-floor vehicle and in the 2000s the company adopted a progressive policy that all new vehicles purchased would only be accessible low-floor vehicles.  In 2013 Dublin Bus achieved a long-held goal of having a fleet that is 100% low-floor accessible.  This required the replacement of over 1,000 vehicles from step-access to low-floor accessible access.  This was good news not only for wheelchair users but for customers with mobility impairments, older customers and customers with buggies.  The enhancement of the accessibility of our services requires a continuous programme of improvement.  Our buses are now equipped with a low-floor chassis, kneeling suspension to further reduce step-entry height, a retractable ramp at entrance and a priority space for wheelchair users as standard.  In addition to this, almost 50% of our fleet now has space for both a wheelchair user and a buggy.  All buses provide a range of on-board facilities to assist visually, hearing and mobility impaired customers.  These include multiple accessible seats in the lower saloon, colour contrasting handrails, and on-bus audio and visual location announcements on all buses.  Having a fleet that is 100% accessible has proven to be vitally important in giving people with disabilities the confidence to use Dublin Bus services on a daily basis.  This achievement was made possible by the acquisition of new state-of-the-art double-decker buses as part of our fleet replacement programme.  The purchase of these buses was initially funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and subsequently by the National Transport Authority.  I acknowledge their continued support in helping us achieve this goal for our 139 million customers.  There have also been enhancements to the streetscape including accessible kerbing introduced at bus stops in the city.  This stop infrastructure reduces the angle of boarding and provides near level boarding access for customers.  It also includes tactile and colour contrasting paving.  The roll-out of this infrastructure at bus stops continues today.</p> <p>  Dublin Bus has a dedicated accessibility officer whose role actively promotes the development of our accessibility policy.  The accessibility officer works collaboratively with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, Irish Wheelchair Association, Deaf Hear, St. Michael&rsquo;s House, Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament.  The group meets on a quarterly basis and considers a wide range of accessibility matters from the creation of our accessibility policy to the introduction of new features on buses.  We have developed a close relationship with these agencies over the past 20 years.  In 2008, Dublin Bus launched its travel assistance programme.  The scheme encourages inclusivity across public transport by providing a personalised travel service to customers aged 18 and over free of charge.  Provided by Dublin Bus, the scheme assists customers in the independent use of Dublin Bus, DART and Luas, in particular those with mobility and learning disabilities.  It is funded by the NTA.  Through this scheme, customers can avail of personal assistance and practical advice on how to travel independently on public transport.  Our travel assistant will meet a customer at his or her home before he or she makes the next step of using public transport.  With the help of our travel assistant, a tailor-made travel plan is drawn up to meet each individual customer&rsquo;s needs.  The personal relationship is hugely important, as is developing trust between the customer and the travel assistant.  Since its launch, the scheme has gone from strength to strength with over 1,200 travel assist programmes provided in 2017.</p> <p>  It is our policy to ensure all our buses, information points and services are accessible and user friendly for all our customers.  We review our training programmes on an ongoing basis, aiming to provide employees with the latest and most progressive training resources.  We seek to further enhance the accessibility of our service through many initiatives and work processes.  These include consulting with people with access problems to meet their requirements and expectations where possible, work with other external agencies such as local authorities to assist with infrastructure which improves access to our services, continuously review our service to see how best it can be improved, and upgrade our communication system and provide accessible information.  While it is not possible to anticipate every challenge a customer may have on his or her journey with us, we work diligently with customers and stakeholders to anticipate problems and solve them as they arise.  Dublin Bus has a strong working relationship with stakeholders in the accessibility area.  Engaging with stakeholders allows us to react quickly when issues arise.  One such issue was the availability of the wheelchair zone on board buses. </p> <p>  Dublin Bus joined the Irish Wheelchair Association and Transport for Ireland to develop and launch an awareness campaign highlighting the importance of the dedicated wheelchair zone on all our PSO buses.  The multi-agency campaign initiative demonstrates the negative consequences which can impact a wheelchair user if they are unable to access the wheelchair zone on a Dublin Bus service.  A series of awareness videos, featuring wheelchair users captures the effects and illustrates the challenges that arise if the wheelchair zone is occupied by another customer, including those travelling with a buggy.  The series of videos launched as part of the campaign illustrate the simple process which IWA, Dublin Bus and TFI are encouraging all customers travelling with buggies to support and follow.  Member can find these videos online in the buggy section of the IWA website.  We are currently in discussions to run this campaign again in the coming months.</p> <p>  Over the past number of months, we have been working closely with local organisations at events for older people.  It is our responsibility to ensure that our older customers feel safe while using our services so our presence at events such as the age friendly strategy road show and the over-55s showcase of talents is essential.  Events like these allow us to promote safety and accessibility on our services while also giving our customers the opportunity to share their concerns or ask questions.</p> <p>  We have been proactive in raising awareness among employees about the health and safety risks for older customers with a poster campaign active throughout all our depots.</p><p>We have been proactive in raising awareness among employees about the health and safety risks for older customers, with a poster campaign active throughout all our depots. </p><p> While we have made significant progress in the area of accessibility, challenges remain.  I read with interest the submissions from the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland and other stakeholders who appeared before this committee last December.  We are always looking for ways to improve the service we provide to our customers and I want to assure these groups and members of this committee that any issues raised in their submissions will be dealt with fully by Dublin Bus.  It is important to continue to build on the progress made on the accessibility of urban bus transport.  Dublin Bus has a progressive accessibility policy, a key element of which is providing employees with disability awareness training.  All our customer facing employees receive disability awareness and customer care training.  We have over 2,500 drivers, inspectors and customer service employees who deal with the public on a daily basis.  Dublin Bus is in the process of addressing the area of hidden disabilities in employee training.  Dublin Bus works closely with disability user groups in the design of our disability awareness training programme.  As part of this programme we now include a video which focuses on how to assist customers with Alzheimer's disease and other hidden disabilities.  This improvement is a direct result of the close co-operation between Dublin Bus and these groups.  We have engaged with Headway with regard to people with hidden disabilities.  Headway is a voluntary organisation that specialises in brain injury rehabilitation and assists people who have been ill or injured to rebuild their skills to achieve the best quality of life that they can.  A key element of this training is to create awareness on disabilities which are hidden and highlight that these customers may have difficulties that are not visible but they may require some extra assistance.  We are also examining the possibility of redesigning our public offices to make them more accessible to customers who have hidden disabilities. </p><p> As chief executive officer of Dublin Bus, I am very proud to lead an organisation that is an industry leader in accessibility.  Public transport enables all people in our society to fully participate in the work, social and leisure activities that Dublin offers.  We are not complacent and I acknowledge that more work is needed to address issues experienced by people with disabilities.  Dublin Bus will continue its commitment to playing a leading role in helping to create an accessible and inclusive public transport system in Ireland.  That concludes my opening statement and I would be happy to any questions that may arise.</p></speech>

My colleagues and I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today to discuss the topic of accessibility of public transport for people with disabilities as it relates to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  As director of railway undertaking, I am responsible for our train operations and the maintenance of our fleet and our stations, all of which directly relate to the accessibility of our services.  I want to give the committee an overview of where we have come from, our current service provision and planned improvements as well as future measures needed to give the best and most independently usable service possible in the future.</p> <p>  Virtually the entire Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann rail network was originally developed in the 19th century and when significant renewal investment returned to the railway in the 1990s, it is fair to say that the legacy of that Victorian era still remained with us.  Apart from the DART network, our trains had significant accessibility issues and stations had not been upgraded to modern accessibility standards.  However, in 1995 we appointed an accessibility liaison officer, adopted the latest accessibility standards for fleet and buildings and established a disability users group in 1997 which operates to this day and includes the major representative bodies for the mobility and sensory impaired.  This ensured that the benefits of Exchequer funded investment in trains, stations and customer systems throughout the intervening decades were enjoyed by all customers, with direct input to design via our disability users group.</p> <p>  This has ensured that all our Intercity trains have dedicated wheelchair spaces, and wheelchair accessible toilets, and all are accessible via a mobile ramp.  All DART and commuter trains are accessible via a mobile ramp and have an open area which can accommodate wheelchairs as well as designated areas.  All new stations and all major station refurbishment programmes ensured accessibility was incorporated into the design, including ramps and-or lifts for access to all platforms.  Design features for the visually impaired such as tactile markings on platforms and colour contrasts on board services have enhanced the safety and usability of the travelling environment.  An ambitious programme was well under way to complete necessary accessibility works at all stations.  However, it was regrettable that this proved to be one of the many casualties when the country&rsquo;s economic crisis caused major rail investment grind to a halt.  While significant progress was made, we are acutely aware that there is much more to be done.</p> <p>  While our train fleet is now accessible, there is in all instances a gap between train and platform to ensure the safe operation of services.  For this reason, a mobile ramp is used by staff to assist in boarding and alighting of wheelchair users.  As members of the committee will be aware, we are seeking to commence a major order of new trains to cater for growth in demand across our network and planned electrification of the greater Dublin area rail lines as part of the DART expansion programme, including DART underground.  In any tender process, we will request companies bidding to build fleet to include solutions such as automated ramps from the train to facilitate independent use of our services by the mobility impaired.  I would advise members of the committee that the Victorian legacy to which I referred at the outset results in platform heights and gaps which have the potential to impact on the effectiveness of some automated ramp solutions, particularly at curved platforms, including those at major stations such as Connolly Station in Dublin and Kent Station in Cork.</p> <p>  Today, 118 of our 144 stations have all platforms accessible, with the remaining 26 stations having at least one platform accessible.  We have two prioritised programmes to address the remaining stations and to improve accessibility standards within other stations, as funding becomes available.  A prioritised programme to remove impediments or restrictions on access both entering and within station areas is progressing, covering 54 stations.  The funding envelope from the National Transport Authority, NTA, has increased steadily in recent years for accessibility projects, from &euro;250,000 in 2015, to &euro;510,000 in 2016 and &euro;2.4 million in 2017, which included a new access to platforms Nos. 6 and 7 in Connolly Station, and which saw 26 of those 54 stations addressed.  The 2018 allocation will be confirmed shortly and we are ready to proceed with a range of projects.  </p> <p>  A separate programme which would provide lift and footbridge access at stations without all platforms accessible has commenced, with planning permission secured for Carlow and Mullingar and planning applications well under way for Castleknock and Ennis.  The timescales for these works will be dependent on funding availability.</p> <p>  On a daily basis we assist hundreds of customers, be they wheelchair users, of reduced mobility, or visually impaired, as they use our stations and our services.  The committee will be aware that we advise mobility impaired customers to give notice where possible to ensure we can provide any assistance needed.  I would stress, however, that this is advised and not essential, and we make every endeavour to provide assistance at all times, whether notice is less than the advised 24 hours or whether no notice is possible.  This is the case today in many instances, particularly where our staff have well established relationships with regular users who require assistance.  In addition, as I mentioned above, 26 of our stations remain partially accessible and notice ensures we can plan that trains are directed to serve accessible platforms at these stations when assistance is required.  However, we want to work towards a future where any notice is ultimately eliminated and have worked with the representative bodies on our disability users group to develop plans to achieve this.  Later this month we will commence a pilot programme on DART stations to improve assistance for customers.  This will move away from a situation where we have many stations partially staffed to a &ldquo;hub station&rdquo; concept where nominated hub stations are permanently staffed.  Staff will be mobile between the hub stations and no more than two other stations served by that hub, meaning assistance and response times will be much improved.  We will reduce the advised notice to four hours, but continue to respond to requests for assistance in all situations.  We will liaise with the disability users group and individual users to ensure improvements are being delivered and issues addressed and after six months will review the pilot programme, both for its expansion to commuter services and for further reductions in the advised notice period.</p> <p>  We are also in the process of introducing Intercity customer service officers on trains across the Intercity network.  Ultimately, as we complete this during 2018, this will ensure a turn up and go service for the vast majority as there will always be assistance available when boarding and alighting each train.  This will provide customer service improvements on board for all customers also, including connection information, seat reservations, delay assistance and addressing anti-social behaviour issues.</p> <p>  Building on and further to the initiatives I have just outlined, we are also working with regular mobility and sensory impaired users of our services to develop a dedicated assistance app which will provide another channel by which we can engage with users, provide assistance and improve service.  We hope to develop this in 2018, and begin a trial of this facility by the end of the year.</p><p>We are a national railway and have a responsibility to provide the best possible service to all our customers.  We are confident that initiatives being introduced this year will result in significant improvements for customers with disabilities in using our services to live their lives, and to be full participants in our society and our economy.  They will be the latest in what has been a continuous programme of development, which will also form the foundation for future improvements.</p><p> We welcome support for the investment needed as we build further on this, both for our fleet and our stations.  I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann, in partnership with our stakeholders, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority, NTA, is committed to providing fully accessible services under the Disability Act 2005.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has 100% accessible city services in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, and fully accessible town services in Sligo, Athlone, Navan, Dundalk, Balbriggan, and Drogheda.  Our intercity commuter and rural services are not fully accessible but their enhancement is a key priority for us in 2018.  Currently, Bus &Eacute;ireann operates five regional coach routes that are wheelchair accessible, which include Navan to Dublin City University, DCU, with three accessible stops, Waterford to Cork with four accessible stops, Galway to Athlone with end-to-end accessibility, Galway to Ballina with end-to-end accessibility, and Letterkenny and Lifford to Dublin with end-to-end accessibility.<br/><br/>It is Bus &Eacute;ireann policy to procure accessible vehicles as part of the continuing programme of fleet replacement and upgrading.  The company follows best practice when assessing and improving the accessibility of our services.  Since 2008, it has been a legal requirement to ensure all new fleet acquired is accessible.  The NTA is responsible for funding the public service obligations, PSO, fleet and we work closely with it in that regard.  In recent years, all our major bus stations have been made fully accessible.  In addition, audio onboard announcements for main stops are made on the majority of our services, which assists the visually impaired.  In 2018, it is our intention to roll out this key initiative for all 6,000 bus stops across the network.<br/><br/>In addition to the above, we are in the process of converting our online timetables into html format to allow for ease of use for those with visual impairments.  This process is at an advanced stage and will be completed by mid-February 2018.  Our website, <i>buseireann.ie</i>meets the web content accessibility guidelines, WCAG, standard and is 95% compliant in this regard.  Converting files to html will help to convert the remaining gap and facilitate those users who wish to access web timetables using a screen reader.<br/><br/>While there has been a significant amount of investment surrounding accessibility, we accept that there are still shortcomings.  We will continue to work with all stakeholders to improve further the service offering.  A multi-stakeholder approach is key to achieving this.  Over the past number of years, we have invested in our bus stations in order to ensure that they follow best practice and are fully accessible.  While this investment is ongoing, common features in our bus stations now include, but are not limited to, automatic doors, accessible toilets, ticket offices with audio hearing loop, accessible ticket vending machines, and wheelchair accessible bus bays in the majority of bus stations.<br/><br/>Bus &Eacute;ireann employs a full-time accessibility and information officer to ensure high quality accessible and safe services are, where possible, available to our customers.  This officer also co-ordinates our accessibility user group, which includes the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, DeafHear and the disability focus group, which is a part of the Dublin Community Forum.  In addition, the requirements of our special needs passengers are covered as part of the driver certificate in professional competence, CPC, training courses that are conducted each year.  All Bus &Eacute;ireann training inspector located in all main depots nationwide are qualified to provide training in all aspects of accessibility.  In addition, last year a cohort of drivers was also trained in recognising and dealing with customers who may have dementia.  This was facilitated by the representative group dementia understand together.  <br/><br/>In terms of our fleet, all new vehicles purchased in the last number of years for PSO services are accessible through low floor access.  This includes kneeling access, which involved the vehicle being lowered to bring the entrance stop area in line with or close to the curb, or a wheelchair lift.  In addition, all our vehicles also feature handrails that assist with ascending or descending the entrance steps and contrasting strips that define each step.  We continue to work with the NTA regarding bus stop infrastructure and to identify vehicle types best suited to the varying needs of all our customers, while also suitable for roads and associated infrastructure.  This recently resulted in route 32 becoming accessible between Letterkenny, Lifford and Dublin. <br/><br/>Currently, 86% of Bus &Eacute;ireann's road passenger fleet of 680 vehicles is wheelchair accessible.  With the investment plan for 2018 this figure will increase to 92% by the end of this year.  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates a mixture of vehicle types, from low floor city buses to high sided coaches.  All low floor buses operating on city services, along with a small number of commuter routes, are 100% accessible and advance booking is not required for these services.  The majority of intercity commuter and rural services are operated with high sided coached featuring a wheelchair lift.  This necessitates a minimum of 3.5 m of space in order to accommodate the wheelchair user and operate the lift in a safe manner.  Local authorities are responsible for pathways and kerbing.  We work with their staff on the requirements for wheelchair accessible stops.  It is my understanding that the NTA is providing funding toward the construction of more of these stops.<br/><br/>There is one wheelchair space on all our vehicles.  A reservation system is in place for passengers who wish to book a space on a Bus &Eacute;ireann coach.  In order to accommodate a wheelchair, all coach types used on an accessible service require the removal of up to four seats, prior to the journey, along with an operational check on the wheelchair lift and the accompanying restraint mechanisms to ensure the wheelchair can be securely clamped into place.<br/><br/>What I have outlined is a key aspect of why advanced booking is required.  The booking system necessitates any intending customer to book 24 hours in advance of his or her journey on weekdays by contacting the Bus &Eacute;ireann information line.  Due to operational constraints, bookings for weekends and Monday travel require 48 hours notice and must be made no later that 3 p.m. on the Friday beforehand.  In this way, customers can be guaranteed the wheelchair space and Bus &Eacute;ireann can make the necessary internal arrangements for it.  This type of reservation system is in line with the prevailing practices across other EU countries.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the only coach operators in the State offering wheelchair accessibility on its services.  While there are considerations, both in terms of logistics and financial constraints, Bus &Eacute;ireann remains fully committed to an ongoing roll-out with several more routes to be added in 2018.  In this current year these additional services will be available from accessible bus stations only, while some key bus stops <i>en route</i>are being redesigned to accommodate wheelchair accessible coaches.<br/><br/>Routes to be rolled out include the Waterford to Dublin airport, Galway to Dublin city, Limerick to Dublin airport and Belfast to Dublin city.  As I noted earlier, wheelchair accessibility was recently introduced on route 32 and our first wheelchair passenger used this service last week.  In conclusion, Bus &Eacute;ireann remains fully committed to the roll out of wheelchair accessibility and enhanced facilities for passengers with disabilities on all our services.  We will continue to work with all stakeholders, including local authorities and the NTA in order to address some of these particular challenges.  We have committed to improvements in 2018, which I have already outlined.  These include online timetables converted to html, accessibility rolled out on additional routes, more driver training to coincide with new accessible routes, with all city and greater Dublin area, GDA, bus stops to be audited within quarter one of 2018 to assess their ability to be used by wheelchair accessible passengers.  In addition, we are going to roll out audio announcements for all stops across the network in 2018.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  We are conscious of our special role as a State transport provider and the operator of the largest nationwide public transport network, to comply with the higher standards expected of us as a public body.  While much work remains to be done I am very much committed to ensuring we meet those standards as best we can as we continue to recover from the financial and operational challenges of the past year.</p></speech>

Luas is a state-of-the-art light rail transit system that provides an accessible, attractive and unique mode of public transport in Dublin.  Compliant with current accessibility and environmental standards for transport systems, it offers accessibility for all.  This philosophy has been a cornerstone of the design and development of the system from the initial phases of the project.  Luas operates two main lines serving the north, south and west of Dublin city, the red line and the green line.  The red line is 20 km in length, has 32 stops and runs from Tallaght-Saggart to the Point-Connolly.  The green line is 24.5 km in length, has 35 stops and runs from Bride's Glen to Broombridge through the city centre.  All Luas stops and trams are wheelchair accessible.</p> <p>  Transdev operates Luas under contract to the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  It is a privilege for Transdev to operate a safe, reliable form of public transport carrying some 103,000 passengers on average per day.  Transdev are experts worldwide in operating transport systems, including light rail, buses, shuttles and taxis.  It is our view that developing accessibility in public transport would include a number of key objectives including consultation with the relevant advocacy groups at design stage.  TII and Transdev, through the Luas disability users' group - members of which attended this committee on 13 December - engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure that Luas and future Luas extensions are designed to meet the needs of all the public.  Design for accessibility on Luas has focused on people with mobility and sensory impairments.  Well thought out surfacing, furniture, stop facilities, clear signage, audio announcements and destination displays all serve to make the system easier to navigate.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the review with the relevant advocacy groups during construction.  The Luas disability user group is consulted throughout construction and on-site visits take place to inspect and review solutions.  Amendments to design are agreed and implemented as required.  This approach greatly reduces the requirement for retrofitting solutions post construction.  There are agreed formal processes for developing accessibility further during operation Luas with disability user group meetings take place on a quarterly basis.  TII, Transdev and the relevant advocacy groups meet and review Luas operations and develop accessibility solutions.  TII and Transdev have been proactive in establishing procedures and implementing staff training and awareness initiatives, which further enhance the accessibility of the system.</p> <p>  With regard to working in collaboration, Transdev strongly believes that in order for Dublin and Ireland to be seen as a world class transport provider, it requires all stakeholders to work together and to share best practise and key learnings.  We are delighted to be members of the transport integration group set up and run by the National Transport Authority.  Already we are seeing the benefits of having key transport providers sitting at the same table exploring ideas and sharing potential solutions to common challenges.</p> <p>  We thank the committee for its invitation and we welcome the opportunity to discuss the issues raised on the 13 December 2017 by the transport users.  We understand that Luas is not perfect.  There are improvements to be made in areas such as audio announcements at key times and locations.  Through regular and formal consultation we aim to meet the needs of all transport users, to deliver a transport system that is as equally convenient for a person with a disability or a carer, as it is for the rest of society so that anyone can use public transport to get on with his or her life, without additional challenges or having to rely on the kindness of strangers.</p> <p>  I note the Chairman's comment on the chief executive attending, and I will take this back to the chief executive.  This concludes my statement and I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I appreciate that accessibility for all is obviously much better than in Victorian times, since the Luas has been set up more recently, but it clearly is a fundamental principle that the Luas fulfils.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Kevin Traynor from the Coach Tourism Transport Council of Ireland to make his statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.561" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Traynor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018011700002#E00500"><p>I thank the committee for affording us this opportunity to make a submission on the very important issue of the accessibility of public transport for people who have a disability.  The Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, CTTC, is the representative body for Ireland&rsquo;s coach touring companies and Ireland&rsquo;s private bus operators.  CTTC members are experts in coach hire and transport solutions, including: airport transfers, day tours, extended touring, incentive travel, golf tours, school transport and provision of scheduled services.  In addition to specialising in long distance scheduled services, many of our members also operate licensed bus services in towns and cities throughout Ireland.</p> <p>  All CTTC members are family owned companies, with a combined fleet of 1,500 coaches, employing more than 3,500 people directly.  The CTTC comments and makes representations regularly on matters of concern to its members such as public transport, school transport, the coach tourism sector and the tourism industry generally.</p> <p>  CTTC believes the availability of and access to public transport is essential for many people with disabilities to play a full and active part in society, engage with their communities and to access services and work.  Accessibility to public transport is of critical importance to those who have no other form of transport and is a key challenge going forward with a rapidly ageing population.  It ensures a quality of life which is taken as given norm for public transport passengers without a disability.  Private operators currently operate quality scheduled route services throughout the country under licence from the National Transport Authority and are uniquely placed to improve transport services in a cost effective manner.  There are, however, significant barriers currently, which are restricting the continued positive growth in the provision of fully accessible services that I will set out for the committee.</p> <p>  One of these challenges is the cost of fully accessible transport.  In private sector transport, accessibility is restricted due to limited financial resources and the substantial cost of providing accessibility features.  Private operators face additional costs in excess of &euro;30,000 to purchase a fully accessible vehicle.  There is a requirement for positive national and EU incentives to create a sound business case for owning and operating accessible vehicles.  In addition, funding should be provided from State resources to private operators for increased staff training, pre-journey information and access point of contact in order to put systems in place to deal with requests for accessible vehicles.</p> <p>  A further challenge faced by private transport operators is the shared use of existing infrastructure.  Section 62 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 was included to facilitate access by non-public funded transport operators to bus stations and railway stations but this has failed to materialise.  Investment in infrastructure is also a challenge.  There is no point in providing accessible vehicles if the infrastructure is not available to support these services.  All local authority transport plans must provide accessibility infrastructure and ensure sufficient funding is available to complete the necessary work.  Other infrastructural barriers include managing the accessibility of infrastructure in small towns and villages to curb illegal parking in bus stops and provide accessible toilets and associated facilities at private resting areas and stations.</p> <p>  There is clear evidence that in the past there has been a communication failure between statutory bodies.  There is, therefore, an urgent requirement to ensure there is a joined up thinking process put in place between planners, transport providers and statutory agencies to facilitate fully accessible transport infrastructure in any new development, and to maximise resources to ensure a planned cohesive approach to optimise delivery.</p> <p>  CTTC welcomes the opportunity to make this submission and looks forward to liaising with the committee and contributing to the provision of an enhanced public transport system that is value for money and provides a public transport system that is accessible to all users.</p></speech>

We will now go the committee members.  The tradition has been that it goes in the order of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independent parties.  In view of the very comprehensive statements we have had, I ask that members' contributions contain more questions than statements to get to the nub of the matter.  After this session with the current witnesses the regulators will appear before us and then the committee intends to produce a comprehensive report to bring about change.  This is what we really want.</p></speech>

At our previous meeting, disability groups outlined many major problems.  The witnesses today have told us that they obviously have a lot done but have more to do and funding also seems to be an issue.  I will address my first question on private coach hire to Mr. Traynor.  He referred to shared use of infrastructure.  Perhaps this can be answered later on.  Mr. Traynor said that section 62 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 was included to facilitate use of bus stations, but that has never happened.</p></speech>

That is why my submission proposes joined-up thinking from everybody, including local authorities and planners, not just to look at what we have but to look at future planning for provision and accessibility.  For instance, local authorities claim they do not have the funding to provide the necessary infrastructure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1426" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018011700002#F00900"><p>The legacy of Victorian infrastructure has presented Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann with particular problems.  Mr. Meade mentioned the links from platforms to the carriages.  With staff reductions, there are now many more unmanned stations, particularly the smaller ones.  That creates further difficulties for people with disability.  Mr. Meade referred to the 24-hour notice to be given.  Surely that contradicts an improved service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Meade" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018011700002#F01000"><p>The improved service will come from putting people on-board the service so that when a passenger arrives at an unmanned station, the person is there on the train to assist any user who requires it.  That is not currently the case on our intercity services.  The unmanning of stations is about bringing people from behind the booking office window because many of our interactions are now web-based or machine-based.  The number of transactions through the booking office is quite small - barely above 10%.  We now want to bring them to the front of house to interact directly with the customer and have more touch-time with the customer.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear Mr. Hernan say that Bus &Eacute;ireann will have audio announcements and others stated it also.  In terms of implementing some of the changes needed to help people with disability, it is not all about funding; it is about the logistics of doing it.  That is the impression I have.  I am glad that is a target for 2018.</p></speech>

My first question is general.  Do they comply with some directive on the percentage of their funding to be set aside to provide an upgrade in disability services?  Of every &euro;10 they spend, how much is geared towards improving disability access and safe travel?</p> <p>  My next question may be parochial and relates to joined-up thinking between Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann with regard to Kent Station in Cork.  The entrance to the Kent Station has been changed.  What protocols were put in place for passenger access to the station in the event of one of the lifts going out of service?  Why did Irish Rail not put a ramp in place in the new station?  At the moment if the lift breaks, there is no ramp access for wheelchair users from the new entrance.  Was there a breakdown in communication there?</p> <p>  Twenty-four hours seems like a long time for people to have to give notification.  Could that be reduced to four hours?  Mr. Hernan spoke about Bus &Eacute;ireann, but for rail users, could the 24-hour notice be reduced to four hours?</p> <p>  What efforts has Irish Rail made to incorporate or retrofit automated wheelchair ramps into their carriages?  In its recent purchases Irish Rail has failed to the required standard by not having the wheelchair space and wheelchair-accessible toilets in each carriage.</p></speech>

Why does Bus &Eacute;ireann not have audio announcements on its service as Dublin Bus has?  What percentage of the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet has a screen display for its passengers?  Dublin Bus seems to be more advanced.  I accept that Bus &Eacute;ireann is playing catch-up in funding, but is it making progress on the screen display for passengers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.578" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Meade" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018011700002#F01500"><p>I will respond first as several of the questions were for me.  I referred to the NTA in my presentation.  There is ring-fenced accessibility funding, which we agree with the NTA.  We have an accessibility pot that is agreed every year.  We are awaiting finalisation of the current year's pot.  The presentation stated that &euro;2.7 million ring-fenced for accessibility last year.  We do not need any extra money for any future developments; they are automatically accessibility compliant.</p> <p>  We intend extending the four-hour notice across the network.  We expect the pilot to run well because we are already running it informally.  I would say that in excess of 100 times daily people just turn up and go and we assist them.  Reducing from 24 hours to four hours is a guideline and we regularly do far better than that.  As we move on to our on-board service where we help put people on board, people will again turn up and go because a member of staff will be on board to assist people.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the entrance to Cork station.  In the unlikely event of a failure - we have specified the lifts realising the amount of work they will get - we have the option of using the Glanmire Road.  The Deputy is very familiar with the station and will know that the old lifts or ramps can be used from the Glanmire Road.  There are alternative means to access the station in the unlikely event of lift failure because we have learned from our experience and the quality and design of lift gone in there now - I might regret saying this - should give us a very high level of reliability.</p> <p>  On level of capacity, we are required to work to an EU standard on new train design.  All our trains have capacity in excess of the guidelines, which is 10% of capacity to have either priority seating or wheelchair access.</p><p>Regarding wheelchair access, the passenger capacity guidelines refer to the length of a train.  Train carriages vary in length from 12 m to 25 m.  We are ahead of the guidelines and technical specifications and the EU directive.  We have priority seating in every carriage so that people in wheelchairs can, after being accompanied to a train, transition into seats.  We are well in excess of the guidelines in that regard.  For example, the Mark 4 Cork train has 400 seats, nearly 50 of which are priority seating and - I am doing the maths in my head - with ten wheelchair spaces.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Hernan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018011700002#G00200"><p>The Deputy raised a number of points about Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Key funding relates to fleet replacement.  Since 2015, all of our buses have audio systems, the most recent visual technology and access via low flooring.  The issues that we face this year do not concern funding as much as they do the logistics and practicalities of trying to set up audio and visual responses for 6,000 bus stops.  Approximately 550 of the main stops have been recorded so far.  A degree of co-ordination is required between us and, for example, the NTA in order to ensure consistency in the naming of bus stops.  We may not be the only people stopping at a certain bus stop, particularly on intercity routes, so we need to ensure that whatever name we are using is also being used by other parties.  We were sidetracked from our commitment to certain aspects last year, given the other issues that we were dealing with, but they are back on the agenda this year in terms of dealing with the audio and visual aspects to which I referred.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the issue of notice.  I would be hesitant to commit to less than 24 hours notice, given the practicalities of having to take seats off a bus.  A bus must be brought to a garage so that they can be removed, as seats are not taken off just in advance of a journey.  It takes time.  We also need to ensure that the lift is working.  I would prefer to be 100% sure that, when we commit to something, we can deliver on it.  Unfortunately, that has not occurred in some instances for various reasons, including a breakdown in the chain of responsibility.  We need to get that right before we can reduce the timelines.</p></speech>

Can the space not be kept?  Is that not viable?</p></speech>

When a 63-seat bus already does not have excess capacity, removing four seats for a requirement that may not arise is not practical.  However, there are two dedicated buses that provide wheelchair access everyday on a number of routes into Dublin.  We try to meet the requirement in that way as opposed to by meeting random or rare applications on other routes.  The number of people who use our service is minimal.  We need to be cognisant of that.  We like to believe that we can encourage more use, but it would not be practical to take four seats off each bus all day everyday.</p></speech>

We need to get that right in terms of the 24-hour notice.  None of our city services requires notification, and they comprise the vast majority of our services.  We are trying to improve the fleet and ensure that, even if the seats have already been removed, buses are accessible.  That has been a problem.  We will be at 92% accessibility by the end of this year.  Where it is realistic and we believe there is a necessity to provide a permanent reduction in capacity to facilitate a wheelchair user, we will consider that.</p></speech>

While I accept that his comments are genuine, the fact is that the loser will be the disabled person who cannot give Bus &Eacute;ireann notice but who must travel and needs that space.  Demand for it is likely.  Could Mr. Hernan give us the statistics on this matter?  It is a critical issue for the disabled people and their spokespersons who are present, notwithstanding the good news in many respects that Mr. Hernan has provided.</p></speech>

Mr. Hernan mentioned commerciality.  I do not want to pick him up negatively, but this is a public service and it should be available to people with disabilities in particular.

At our December meeting, disability groups raised the issue of the requirement, as per Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's protocol, of booking in advance.  Along with that booking comes a charge of &euro;5 for a single journey or &euro;10 for a return journey.  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that this charge is against EU regulations.  If so, why is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann charging people?  Aside from those who need assistance gaining access, does that charge also apply to pensioners in receipt of a free travel pass who, for whatever reason, decide to book in advance?  If they had someone with them to assist them on and off a train, would that charge still apply?</p> <p>  Mr. Hernan stated that Bus &Eacute;ireann had an accessibility and information officer.  That is the first I heard of it, and I have been in contact with Bus &Eacute;ireann numerous times about a lack of accessibility for wheelchair users locally and across the State.  Is the contact number advertised at stations and so on to members of the public - travelling customers - who have a grievance?  Is it visibly displayed at every bus station or bus stop so that members of the public can contact the officer with concerns?</p><p> Another important question I want to ask is how many times were wheelchair users who followed the company's protocol let down in 2017.  I am sure the company keeps a record of the number.  One keeps a record to ensure services can be improved and maintained.  Based on the records for 2017 alone, how many customers who required wheelchair access were let down?  I could refer to numerous incidents.  A constituent of mine who travelled to Dundalk Institute of Technology was let down no fewer than 20 times in 2017.  I could also refer to the case of a gentleman from Laytown who is regularly left sitting at the side of the road.  If a low-floor bus does not come for him, the driver tells him that he is not qualified to operate the lift.  That is scandalous.  The affected gentleman, with many others across the State, has been left at the side of the road on numerous occasions.</p><p> I have a question on booking 24 hours in advance.  Is it not the case that many stations across the State seek 48 hours notice?  It was said this type of reservation system was in line with the prevailing practice in other EU countries.  For weekend reservations, one has to make a reservation by 3 p.m. on Friday.  Therefore, if someone decides to visit a family on a Sunday, he or she will get the two fingers.  If a passenger wants to use public transport, he or she does not have a chance because Bus &Eacute;ireann must be let know by 3 p.m. on the Friday what his or her plans are for the Sunday.  One could not make it up.</p><p> The delegation referred to the fact that seats needed to be removed, as well as the more commercial aspect.  Does that not speak volumes?  I acknowledge that there is an issue with the free travel pass subsidy, a matter I raised with the Minister last year.  The subsidy is way below what it should be and operators outside the public transport system receive a higher subsidy for passengers with the free travel pass.  When the delegates refer to commercial considerations, are they saying the amount of money received for passengers with the free travel pass makes a person who needs wheelchair access to a bus less important than a paying customer who does not need wheelchair access?  The delegates need to explain the position, considering that people with a disability and access issues are equally as entitled to access daily public transport services as the next person and should not be left standing at the side of the road.</p></speech>

I will ask a couple of questions about the position in Cork city and county which may be somewhat typical of the position elsewhere.  </p> <p>  Let us consider the matter of access at the central bus station in Cork city, at Parnell Place, and how disability-friendly it is.  Mr. Hernan will be familiar with the circumstances there and the layout of the bays.  How many of them are good to go and allow wheelchair access?  Mr. Hernan will be aware that some of them are exposed to the elements, while some are under cover.  What is the position on the bays that are used to provide wheelchair access in terms of their exposure to the elements?</p> <p>  I was interested in the points raised on audio announcements.  I was not quite clear what was said on the current position.  What is the position on the Cork routes, for example?  Is Mr. Hernan saying there are audio announcements on all of the city routes?  Is he saying there are audio announcements on all of the routes that are not city based?  Will he clarify the position on the matter?</p> <p>  My last question is for Mr. Egan and on the position on Transdev Ireland and Luas services.  He mentioned that all services were wheelchair accessible.  Although that is technically the case, how does it work out in practice?  </p> <p>  With reference to the new Luas services from Bride's Glen to Broombridge, what is the position on the number of carriages used?  It it now very common for the tram from Bride's Glen, for example, to fill up very quickly.  The passengers waiting at stops down the line closer to the city have a right to gain access to the Luas, but effectively they cannot do so because the tram is full.  Does Mr. Egan accept that this is a particular inconvenience for wheelchair users?  What is the company's plan to address the issue and what is the timescale involved?  I do not see how it can be addressed unless extra carriages are provided.  When will that happen?  What is the plan in that regard?</p></speech>

Since Luas cross city opened, one of the unforeseen consequences has been the uptake in patronage on the Bride's Glen to Sandyford spur.  Nineteen northbound services leave from Sandyford during peak times, which are between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.  Many of those services started service at Sandyford so they start empty from Sandyford to take passengers between Sandyford and the city centre.  We have seen an uptake in patronage of services leaving from Bride's Glen.  The Deputy is right.  On many occasions, passengers have been left behind, which we did not see prior to the opening of the Luas cross city.  Commencing Monday, 15 January, we have put in an additional service departing from Bride's Glen during the peak period so it is departs from Bride's Glen just before 8 a.m.  This will pick up passengers.  In two to three weeks, we are looking to put in a second additional service to pick up northbound passengers from Bride's Glen.</p></speech>

With regard to a public information line or access, the number for the accessibility officer is not online.  However, we have a dedicated public information line that consolidates all queries or inquiries relating to Bus &Eacute;ireann so once they go into that dedicated line, any specific ones relating to accessibility or issues around that are then passed on to our accessibility officer.

I do not have the statistics to hand but I will certainly find out.  I cannot deny that there have been breakdowns and I was upfront in saying that in my opening statement.  It is something on which we are focused.  When there is a fall down, we try to learn from that and we have certainly learned from a number of experiences with passengers pre-Christmas or early in the autumn.

I think what we want as a committee is for the service to be provided within the shortest possible time.  I appreciate Mr. Hernan is quoting the regulations.

We will try to do everything within our power to improve the service on board our buses and modernise our fleet, but that is only part of the provision of accessibility.

Any person who holds a free travel pass for any reason is entitled to free travel.  They can attend any of our services.  There are no restrictions on travel.

The reason, in the first instance, people are awarded free travel passes are specific to those individuals and, more often than not, it is because they either are pensioners or have disabilities.  Therefore, if those people are awarded free travel passes, surely there should be an exemption for them.  They are not paying customers.  They need access, and the reason they have to book places and are charged a fee in the first instance is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's service is not wheelchair-accessible.  The only reason, in 100% of cases, wheelchair users book is that they must do so to ensure they get places.  The reason they have to book is the same reason Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is putting that charge on them.  It is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's responsibility if its service is not wheelchair-accessible, so why should those people who have been awarded free travel passes have to pay for the fact that its service is not accessible to them whenever they decide to travel?  Why should they have to give Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann a day's notice plus be penalised by a fee?  Will Mr. Meade examine that and will he-----</p></speech>

That is all fine and commendable, but when the CTTC calls for State funding for private operators, how does it propose that be funded?</p></speech>

Many of the other public transport providers get State funding to upgrade their fleet.  There is no State funding or incentive available to the private sector at all in this area.</p></speech>

There is a massive difference between the two.  For example, public service providers serve the least profitable routes because they provide a public service.  Mr. Traynor said the private operators need to be funded by the State.  How does he propose that be done?  Does he propose tax increases to pay for it?  Does he propose to borrow or to cut existing public services?  How could this be done?</p></speech>

I would suggest there are a number of options.  One would be to consider a preferential rate in terms of borrowings, perhaps.  Another would be some form of tax incentivisation to encourage and to defray the actual costs of purchasing these vehicles.</p></speech>

However, Mr. Traynor wants to make the State responsible and is asking that some of the CTTC's costs be offloaded on the State.  The CTTC applies for contracts.  One way of looking at the matter is that if it is a problem for the CTTC to provide wheelchair-accessible services, perhaps we should look at the qualifying criteria when applying for a tender through the NTA.

One of its hallmarks is the co-operation between Bus &Eacute;ireann and private operators where Bus &Eacute;ireann's services are contracted to private operators.  That is hugely important.  Private enterprise is healthy for our society.  If it increases competition and services and reduces costs, that is fine.  In fairness to Mr. Traynor, I accept that the key for all operators, public or private, is that they should be able to use the same facilities that are owned by TII.  Every operator should have access to full services.  That does not happen in some places not too far from where I live and that does not make sense.</p></speech>

The information they provided us with is useful.  There is no doubt that there has been a substantial improvement over the decades in public transport services. I recall being a member of the consultative panel of the Dublin Transport Initiative that discussed some of the proposals that we now see in operation.  The committee is examining the measures that still need to be implemented.  The hardware is in place in many ways and the issue is how it is used.  Reference was made to old trains and the old Craven carriages which could not have been adapted in a million years.  Even the Dublin Bus fleet was much different prior to the 1990s when significant investment was made.  However, there is much more to be done.</p> <p>  There was an expectation, for example, that when accessible services were available, people would be able to access them.  A significant bone of contention on Dublin Bus vehicles is the issue of dedicated disabled spaces being occupied by somebody who has folded up a buggy, for example, and the bus driver being unable to pick up a wheelchair user as a result.  The driver does not have the authority to instruct a passenger to make room for somebody in a wheelchair.  How do we overcome that other than through public information campaigns?  Should the drivers be given authority?  Disability groups have asked for this.</p> <p>  There is a pilot project in respect of giving 24-hour notice.  Will Mr. Meade elaborate on the intended roll-out?  How will that work in practice?  What areas will the pilot be run in?  He stressed that 24-notice is advised but it is not essential and every endeavour is made to assist people at all times.  That is grand if somebody is able bodied but if people in wheelchairs turn up for a service having given 24 hours' notice, they are more likely to be stranded and that is why they will not take the risk.  That curtails their ability to travel.  The company can say it is only advised to give notice but, in most cases, wheelchair users see the notice as essential.  They will continue to raise this issue along with disability groups.  The notice period is a major bone of contention.</p> <p>  Do local authorities have to be proactive in seeking the available money from the NTA to ensure the surfaces are correct?  This primarily affects Bus &Eacute;ireann as the Dublin Bus routes have largely been upgraded in recent years.  Is it the case that some local authorities are better than others?  We want to be prescriptive in the report that we will produce regarding what we think needs to be done.  It would be useful for us to hear from the witnesses on what their engagement is like on this and whether it is uniform throughout the country.</p> <p>  Reference was made to customer surveys.  These have always driven me nuts.  Such surveys are great for people who use buses and trains but people who cannot access services or who have limited access but who want services cannot be surveyed and, therefore, transport companies are not capturing everybody.  How can everybody be captured in a survey?</p> <p>  I understand the capacity issue faced by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I have engaged with the company frequently in recent months about this.  Are there design issues?  It is suggested that four seats must be taken out.  It must be possible to overcome design issues in the new fleet to provide flexibility in using the disabled space on a bus.  What is the experience in other countries?  This information would enable us to make recommendations on these design issues to make buses more flexible.  We do not want a scenario where spaces are empty and people are not using them.  However, we cannot have a discriminatory service either.</p> <p>  I refer to the contracts and commercial tendering through the NTA for some routes.</p><p>In terms of disability, is there a like-with-like approach in terms of the fleet when tenders are being examined or is a different standard required depending on who is seeking it?  I would welcome clarification on that because issues have taken us by surprise in terms of remuneration and historical pension requirements and I would like to hear about the experience in terms of disability access on commercial routes.</p><p> Deputy Munster made the point about staff not being trained on the use of electronic lifts.  Is additional training required?  One does not want a scenario where one has the facility but it cannot be used because training has not been provided.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-17a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Coyne" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018011700002#M00200"><p>The first question was for me.  I thank Deputy Murphy for her question about buggies and wheelchair space.  The facility has been there since 1999 when we bought our first low-floor vehicle.  Our most recently purchased 450 vehicles since 2013 now have both a buggy space and a wheelchair space.  There have been considerations at Government level and we fed into that in terms of what we could do to address the problem.  It is very complex.  We also feed into the EU, into DG MOVE, in terms of what the considerations are in Ireland from an operator's point of view.  The key issues include legislation, which is a matter for the Government in terms of what it chooses to do.  We offer our view of the current scenarios and if something was not legislated for we would outline the complications that arise.  If that was legislated for today what one would find is that all of our buses are full in the morning peak and generally in the evening peak so one would have to move six people off a full vehicle to allow for wheelchair access.  All the buses have the space but six people would have to be moved off the bus which is difficult to do.  Those who would have to move would have to leave the bus and that would involve complexities around refunds and which six people would come off the bus.  I do not say the issues are insurmountable but we would have to face very difficult challenges if legislation were to specify that a disabled person is fully entitled to the access space.</p> <p>  We also have a number of users whose parents carry a special card that we give them for children with a disability who are in a buggy.  It is not a case of the buggy being full of shopping, as the child requires it for transport.  Moving such a child from an access space would give rise to concern.  A number of people who have mobility permits also use the space.  Not every seat on a vehicle is accessible on the lower saloon as step entry is required for seats at the back.  Asking such a person to move would require them to go to a space that is not accessible to them, for example, upstairs.  Those are some of the complicating issues.  An alternative is to make sure the space is constantly available, because that removes those factors.  One would have to block that space off from general users.  One will still be faced with the situation of there only being one space.  What that would do is create a 6.5% capacity requirement and in order to counterbalance that one would need to invest 6.5% in the fleet.  Our current fleet is 1,000 so it would mean 65 vehicles to replace that capacity with capital expenditure of between &euro;20 million and &euro;30 million but there would also be current expenditure which would be around &euro;20 million a year.</p></speech>

We have been on this road for 20 years.  I was an accessibility officer and I went to Peamount Hospital, the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, and the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA.  Our view is that, all things considered, the system we operate today is based on the goodwill of passengers and, by and large, that works.  It does not work on some occasions and when that happens it is a 100% bad experience for the person.  Our drivers are very well aware of the situation and generally customers make a situation known to us.  Incidents occur but it is very rare.  I do not think the answer is for the Government to legislate in favour of having a total dedicated space at all times.</p></speech>

We did a partnership with the IWA and TII earlier this year and we knew what would come out of that in that we have all our customers to accommodate and it is something we are not shying away from.  I accept issues arise from time to time but, thankfully, they are minimal and, by and large, everybody gets accommodated.  It is a system we have worked towards for the past 15 years and it is working well now.  All things considered, it is probably the best solution we have at this point in time for the system we operate today.</p> <p>  On infrastructure, from a Dublin Bus point of view, we primarily deal with the local authorities in the greater Dublin area.  They are all very good in terms of providing assistance such as infrastructure requirements at bus stops.  What one will find in terms of quality bus corridors, QBCs, and many of the infrastructural projects is that accessibility is built into them at this point.  That is the remit of the NTA now and we have influence in that regard but it takes a strong line on infrastructural planning.  We had a tender with the NTA this year to operate services.  The specification is the same for whoever is tendering.  It has to be the same vehicle.</p></speech>

We have been very involved with the user groups in designing how it will work so we have a good database of all our users and as further users come on board, they are added to this.  Each location will have mobile numbers, so that it will not be a central number, users will know their home station and have a contact number for it.  That number will be manned throughout the hours of service.  As the customer requires assistance, it will come from that station.  We will run this for about six months with a view to extending it further, having learned any lessons from the pilot.</p> <p>  We also use surveys and focus groups for non-users, particularly when looking at new timetabling.  When we agree a new timetable with the NTA, we then go to a public consultation process and get comments from both users and non-users.  If we are examining a new service, there is a company that we use that specifically targets markets that are not using it to see how and why they are non-users and what we could offer them to entice them onto public transport.</p></speech>

Naturally, every licensed operator, that is anyone who holds a coach licence, has to have the certificate of professional competence, for which they must undertake the five modules and the training is part of that process.  It is not in the remit of this committee, but we advocate that the direction of the modules be changed in order to be more proactive practically.</p></speech>

I have questions, mainly in relation to unmanned Dart stations and so on.  I appreciate the point about the new dedicated hub, where one can telephone a number when one is within two stops of a station and seek assistance.  The Irish Rail submission says the number of partially accessible stations is 26; I do not know if that means manned or otherwise.  How many unmanned stations are there and does Irish Rail plan to increase that number?</p></speech>

I do not know the exact number off-hand.  The 26 stations referred to are where the platforms are partially accessible, irrespective of whether the station is manned.</p></speech>

There are 26 of those that we have to deal with.  It might be the case that some of the platforms in the location are accessible but others are not because of step access.  We are working through that with the programme.  We have planning permissions for some stations and are close to having it for others.  Our aim is that all stations will be accessible by lift or by ramp.</p></speech>

The Dart network does have unmanned stations, these are some of the more lightly used stations, but we want to have the facility that if a person requires use of that station and they need any assistance that we have a very quick response.  We are working to a four hour period now and we intend to work to much less than that, so that it will be considerably less than an hour in due course.  That is what is happening in more than 100 cases daily on the Dart network alone, and we are building it up.  The manning to which I referred earlier relates to taking staff from behind the glass to front of house with the customer and onto trains with customers.</p></speech>

There is obviously a limit to what we can do.  We had an experience on the DART a year and a half ago where a user group organised an outing and did not inform anyone and we had some 12 or 14 wheelchairs arrive at once.  That will cause a problem, but even the wheelchair-user group said that was somewhat unfair.  They were making a point and it is a valid point that we cannot have that many users turn up, but we have a cascade effect where we can bring more people to a station if required.</p></speech>

Getting the service providers' buy-in and their ideas and issues in that is very important.  The groups have expressed their views today.  The matter of audits was raised earlier by Deputy Murphy but what about an audit of services?  Do the providers have an annual report on service and change or do they intend to do so?  What are the service providers doing to make themselves more accountable?  What is their audit process to evaluate what needs to change?  The witnesses have told us what is changing, I would not describe it as what is being imposed on them from TII or otherwise, but if they had the funds, what is their best case scenario or plan?  How could they shorten the waiting time for people with disabilities?  I know that significant investment will be brought in, but what if that was front-loaded?  What is the best that the service providers could offer people?      </p></speech>

In 2014 we conducted a survey across the network to identify all of the accessibility issues, including CCTV systems, communications, lifts and access, etc.  The figure ranges from a low tide of about &euro;48 million if we only do some of the work to about &euro;80 million if we were to do everything.</p></speech>

We have recommendations which came to us through the users' groups.  The delegates probably have a copy of them.  I hope that before we finalise our report, they will have sight of them.  They can then make an input in order that when the document is published, it will make sense, have been costed and be irrefutable in meeting the needs of the organisations represented, people with disabilities and the general public.  What is best practice in other countries?  How do we benchmark against them?  I do not expect the delegates to answer that question now, but perhaps they might come back to us on it.</p></speech>

In that respect, one of the problems is in the area of health and safety .  As things stand, this is probably one of the dearest nations when it comes to insurance costs.  Premia have increased by about 40% in the last year.  We need to look at the risk assessment in that regard.  I know from where the Chairman is coming; it is a viable option to maximise the use of the spatial capacity within a vehicle.  Deputy Catherine Murphy spoke about the manufacturers.  It might be within the remit of the committee to liaise with the designated manufacturers to see if they would be prepared to have a representative appear before it to discuss the issue of accessibility.</p></speech>
