I received correspondence relating to today's meeting from the HSE and there is correspondence that was received on 3 October 2012 from Mr. Ray Mitchell in the parliamentary and regulatory affairs division of the Health Service Executive reforwarding the HSE July 2012 performance report.  Members have also been circulated with the replies received from the HSE following our meeting on 28 June 2012.  When the proceedings commence I want to put a short statement on the record on the background to today's meeting and deal with an issue raised yesterday about the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts to review present day expenditure that has not yet been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>  We are now dealing with agenda item No. 3, Vote management in the HSE.  Before we begin I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors' Gallery to turn off their mobile telephones.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. John O'Connell, assistant secretary, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. David Smith, principal officer, and Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa, Department of Health; and Mr. Tony O'Brien, deputy chief executive officer, Ms Laverne McGuinness, Mr. Liam Woods and Dr. Philip Crowley, Health Service Executive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100900003#B00300"><p>As this is the first appearance of Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin and Mr. Tony O'Brien before the committee, I welcome them and look forward to working with them in the context of our work.  As this is a resumed session, the Comptroller and Auditor General will not make an opening statement.  However, I wish to put today's meeting in context.  In that regard, I shall read the following statement.</p><p>  We are resuming our examination today of the management of the HSE Vote which was a subject matter of our meeting on 28 June 2012.  The issue of Vote management and cost containment was dealt with by the Comptroller and Auditor General in chapter 47 of his 2010 report.  In examining this, the committee sought details of how the cost containment and Vote management issues were working in the current year, given that the information coming into the public domain in respect of the HSE budget was that it faced a significant over-run and corrective measures were needed.  The evidence given to the committee in June by the former Accounting Officer showed that, if unchecked, the over-run was likely to reach &euro;500 million.</p><p>  Arising from that meeting in June, the committee received further information in July from the HSE, by way of follow up letters, and this evidence formed the basis of a draft report which was first considered by the committee at our meeting on Thursday, 20 September 2012.  In reviewing that report, it was clear to the committee that information published by the HSE in September needed to be incorporated in that committee report as the figures would be out of date and, as the key issue is budget management, the committee agreed to call the HSE and the Department of Health to bring our deliberations on this issue up to date.  It is in this context that the meeting is being held today.</p><p>  I wish to deal with an issue raised yesterday with the clerk to the committee.  It relates to a concern that the committee, by reviewing the Vote management in the HSE in the current year, is somehow straying beyond its remit.  I said on my appointment that I would not confine our activities to accounts and events, some of which are two years old, when they are discussed here and that I would bring current issues to the table in order that members of the Committee of Public Accounts can be more effective and can play a meaningful role in the way public expenditure is managed.  One has only to look at the latest Comptroller and Auditor General report to see the waste that is endemic in our system of public administration.  It would be very easy for the committee to stay within a narrower remit and deal solely with budget overruns in, for example, 2010, but that defeats the purpose when what the taxpayer wants is an explanation of how the current budget is being managed.  The Committee of Public Accounts has to play a meaningful role in the control of public expenditure.  It cannot wait until 2014 to review what has happened in 2012.</p><p>  In the case of Vote management of the HSE, the Comptroller and Auditor General has raised concerns in the past, and devoted an entire chapter to it in his 2007 annual report when he voiced concern at allowing over-runs to develop in the expectation that budget holders would be bailed out in some way.  At the same time, he questioned what he saw was the wait-and-see culture that had developed among budget holders.  We are now in a situation where there is no surplus cash elsewhere in the system to bail out the HSE and, therefore, the meeting today provides an opportunity to the HSE and the Department to highlight how costs are being contained.</p><p>  I am aware that serious efforts are being made by the HSE and the Department since it became evident earlier this year that an overrun on the budget was emerging from the trends.  At today's meeting we want to test how effective those corrective measures have been.  In the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2010 report, issues such as staff reduction measures, reorganisation and cost containment were raised.  These are the issues we are going to follow up at today's session.  What is not in our remit is to question policy decisions that are introduced to curtail costs.  This position is referred to on a weekly basis in the context of what is read out by the Chairman.  Therefore, I ask members to have particular regard for the constraints on the committee in so far as cuts to home help, home hours and so on are concerned, relative to policy only.</p><p>  The Accounting Officer is responsible for ensuring that systems of control are in place to ensure that money is not wasted and that public bodies can remain within budget.  That is where our focus and the focus of this meeting will be.  I trust this clarifies the matter.  I call on Mr. Tony O'Brien to make his opening statement. </p></speech>

The Health Service Executive appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts in June and the Chapters under examination were disposed of and the account closed at that time.  The Health Service Executive is clearly still operating in 2012.  The year is not closed and there is no report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 2012 under examination. </p></speech>

In this regard, I am concerned as to the appropriateness of attending the Committee of Public Accounts to discuss 2012 when the year is not closed and there are no accounts under examination.  In addition, I am further concerned that as late as yesterday afternoon a substantial draft document prepared by the Committee of Public Accounts was received by the Health Service Executive, the existence of which I had not previously been aware.  This is not a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This document, which was provided to us by the clerk to the committee, contains new information that raises questions that appear to be substantially policy related.  As the committee is aware, the Health Service Executive cannot engage in dialogue on policy related matters pursuant to Part 4, section 21(9) of the Health Act 2004.</p></speech>

I believe that he was correct and proper, as a good public servant, to do that in the interests of the organisations that he serves, and as far as the taxpayer of Ireland was concerned, with reported overruns for the current year.  He made specific comments on drug payments issues, charging patients for public beds, and why budgets had not been achieved to date and I believe that was in order.  I address my next comment to Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin as he is the Secretary General.  Is he chairman of the HSE?</p></speech>

It is unacceptable for him, as chairman, to come here today and say that he will not resume the discussion on the matters that we discussed here, at length, with the HSE's chief executive on Thursday, 28 June.  Mr. O'Brien has done the HSE a gross disservice today by what he has told the national Parliament and the people of Ireland, through the committee, and adopting what I would consider to be an unacceptable approach to discussing matters of public interest.  The taxpayer that pays his and my wages expect the discussion to take place.  I ask the chairman of the HSE to ensure that we have a proper discussion and a continuation of the discussion that we had here on 28 June with Mr. O'Brien's predecessor.</p></speech>

I hope that they have not signalled that the committee will be faced with extensive stonewalling by both of them.  I have a number of questions that I wish to raise with them and I am sure that is the same for my colleagues.  In advance of making the statement, such as it is, I would like both of them to confirm that they will answer our questions.  That is the least that we can expect.  Both of them have listed the number of committees that their organisations have attended in the Oireachtas as though it was a chore.  It is part and parcel of the democratic accountability and transparency that surrounds the very substantial amounts of public moneys that both are responsible for.  </p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa, assistant secretary, who is responsible for finance and Mr. David Smith, principal officer, Department of Health.</p><p>  At the outset I would like to refer to correspondence received from the clerk of the Committee of Public Accounts, dated 28 September 2012, and a further letter of clarification, dated 8 October 2012, regarding today's meeting of the committee.  Enclosed with the letter of 8 October was a draft copy of a report by the Committee of Public Accounts on the HSE, dated September 2012.</p><p>  Both I and my officials in the Department are fully aware of our responsibilities to assist the Committee of Public Accounts in carrying out its functions, as set out in Standing Order 163 of Dail &Eacute;ireann, and to provide all appropriate information and co-operation in this regard.  We are also aware of our responsibilities under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997 which expressly prohibits officials from commenting on Government policy.  We are committed to complying with requirements to the best of our ability.</p><p>  I am very conscious of the role of the Oireachtas in the oversight and governance of Departments and State agencies.  Both the current and former Ministers for Health and myself and former Secretaries General have been fully committed to meeting our responsibilities in this regard.  This is clearly evident from the record of attendances at Oireachtas committees by the Ministers for Health and-or Secretary Generals in recent years and I have outlined the details in my circulated statement.  </p><p>  I note that the subject matter for today's meeting is the budgetary situation in 2012 arising from meetings which the committee had with the HSE on 26 January and 28 June 2012 to discuss the 2010 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Members will be aware that the Department of Health was not required to attend either meeting and that the committee adopted the Comptroller and Auditor General's report at the meeting on 28 June.</p><p>  The position is that the chief executive, and in this case Mr. O'Brien as the deputy chief executive, is the Accounting Officer and not the chairman of the HSE.  I understand that the committee's draft report on the HSE September 2012 - which I only received yesterday evening - will also form the basis for today's meeting.  The subject matter of the report is very much policy related and is outside the remit of the committee's Standing Order 163(1)(<i>a</i>).  The fact that the committee is precluded from raising policy issues is acknowledged in its letter dated 8 October and I quote: &quot;In order to be fully clear on the purpose of the meeting and to allay concerns about the PAC raising policy issues, which under its terms of reference it cannot, I am attaching a copy of a draft report.&quot;  That means that the committee accepts that there is an issue.  To address these issues, which are not yet the subject of the report, would not be appropriate and I regret that I am precluded from engaging with the committee on these matters.</p><p>  The normal basis for engagement by the Secretary General of a Department with the Committee of Public Accounts is in respect of his or her role as Accounting Officer.  The Accounting Officer is held to account regarding the appropriation accounts which have been examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General and any reports made by him in respect of those accounts.  The Secretary General of the Department of Health would be accountable in respect of the accounts of the Office of the Minister for Health - Vote 38.  The chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive is the Accounting Officer for the appropriation accounts of the HSE and is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the HSE's appropriation accounts which have been examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  On occasion, if it is deemed appropriate, the Department may be represented at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts which are discussing the HSE's accounts, though this is not always the case.</p><p>  I am happy to engage with the Comptroller and Auditor General and with the committee in a constructive, disciplined and structured manner in due course, and in accordance with the process as described above and in response to a draft report prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I have attended today's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts to explain my position in person to the Members.  I look forward to engaging with both the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General as set out in the relevant legislation and Standing Orders.</p></speech>

We are just here to examine the accounts.  I do not need a lecture on the role of the Committee of Public Accounts or on the legislation surrounding it.  The draft report sent to him that arose from the committee's work to date is just that, a draft report.  We intend to discuss the facts, figures and overruns and to get answers.  I hope that he will co-operate with us on that task because that is what we do every Thursday.  We arranged today's meeting at this time to suit him and the HSE.  If some of the behind-the-scenes carry-on had been left to one side then we might have had a reasonable opening to the meeting.  The Government Chief Whip and others were involved and it was not a good way to start today's process.  If it makes people more comfortable I will say that we are legally entitled to re-open the accounts that are under review and the chapter.  Perhaps we will formally do that.

On the issue of agency staff, there is effectively a market price for agency staff, which includes the effect of recent directives which changed that pricing.  Our objective at all times is to minimise the reliance on agency staff.  As is known, in the course of the year there was a significant departure of staff from the HSE in light of the grace period scheme, which increased the reliance on agency staff at that time.  There is not a set formula as such.  We are working towards a minimisation.  A number of measures, which have been in the public domain recently, are directed at this.</p></speech>

The fact that there was a predetermined date by which a large number of staff had to leave would have created a particular challenge.  However, the number of staff leaving the health service in the course of any given year would not necessarily differ from the number which left during that period.  It was the coming together of that number of staff leaving that created the difficulty.</p></speech>

In one case, the HSE had not received &euro;500,000 because a consultant in Galway had not signed the form for the insurers.

However, it is a significant issue.  I spoke of this at the most recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children I attended.  This issue also formed part of the discussions at the Labour Relations Commission that involved the two bodies representing consultants.  It is part of the consultations and processes under way in regard to that agreement.  We are looking in greater detail at the information.  As I said at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, we are moving towards, subject to data protection issues, publication of granular information which would not identify patients but would clearly identify those persons who are not discharging their responsibilities in terms of the signing of forms.  There is a significant amount of money at stake at any given time.  It is primarily a cash flow issue.  If the forms were signed quickly more cash would be brought forward and the position would, it is hoped, be kept up to date.</p></speech>

We do not usually circulate the report beforehand.  It was out of courtesy and to inform the HSE and the Department where they stood on the draft report that it was sent.  That is the only reason.

I congratulate, if that is the right term, Mr. O'Brien and Dr. McLoughlin on their appointments and wish them well in their roles.  Of all the Committee of Public Accounts meetings, the meetings we have had with representatives of the HSE have been most engaging.  We have previously engaged with Mr. Crowley, Mr. Woods and Ms McGuinness.  While the meeting got off to a rocky start on both sides, I believe we need to - I do not think there is a parliamentary word for it - "chillax".  Everyone needs to take a step back here.  If the witnesses want to come in here and stonewall, that will not work.  If people here want to grandstand, that is not serving the interests of the taxpayer either.  A number of issues, which predate Mr. O'Brien's and Dr. McLoughlin's appointments, have come up in our many meetings with Mr. O'Brien's predecessor, Mr. Cathal Magee.  We have either not received satisfactory answers or we need an update.</p><p>  While I do not tend to go near the area of policy, any member of the public, sitting at home watching these proceedings tonight after a day's work and worrying how to pay the next bill, simply wants to know why the HSE budget cannot be managed.  I ask for some insight into the financial systems that are in place.  At what stage is the HSE in tackling the legacy issues?  It would be very helpful to begin with that.  What is the most recent figure available for the HSE budget overrun?</p></speech>

We have commissioned a number of studies.  The Minister invited Mr. Ogden to examine the financial affairs of the HSE and to examine in particular its strengths and weaknesses in respect of financial management.  We have a report from Mr. Ogden which is currently being worked through by the HSE.  We also have an implementation report which is a work in progress.  I assure the committee that I cannot be more helpful than that because the Minister is proposing to deal with these matters at an early date.  I can assure the committee of the very best efforts of the Department of Health and the HSE to put in place a proper management system from a financial perspective.  I do want to make it clear as well that there are constraints on me as Secretary General that are very serious.  There are policy matters that are being dealt with at the minute.  It is a matter for the Minister to make these announcements in due course on some of the issues to which the Deputy referred.  I can assure him that progress is being made on all of the headings.</p><p>  I would like to reassure the committee as well that the Minister, I as Secretary General and my predecessor always wanted and had the full co-operation of the HSE in respect of any of the matters outlined.  There was no failure on the part of the Department of Health in respect of these matters - they are works in progress.  Dealing with issues around drug pricing is a very complex and difficult business when one is negotiating with an industry that is responsible for a very significant &euro;40 billion a year industry in Ireland with 25,000 jobs and another 100,000 support jobs.  We had to deal with these issues in a very sensitive way.</p><p>  In relation to the income collection and all the other issues, in the fullness of time this committee and other committees will hear of very significant progress that has been made in these areas and I can assure the committee of our very best efforts to deal with it.  The issues in relation to the funding of health care across the world are very complex and difficult.</p></speech>

At the moment, we have eight primary legacy systems, which are what he would understand to be the health board systems that existed some time back.  We import all that information into one central database and we also import more than 50 sets of data from voluntary bodies, which we amalgamate to produce a single set of financial reports on a monthly basis.  As has been referenced by the chief executive officer and the Secretary General, our desire is to have a single system that does that automatically and in a much more efficient way, which would support effective financial management, but that is what we are working with at the moment.</p></speech>

I could be wrong but I cannot find a hospital in budget.  Is that correct?  I have looked through them all.  Louth County Hospital had used its entire budget by the end of July.  That was the highest with 67% spent by the end of June.  No hospital is in budget.  These are the questions I want to get a feel for: why is no hospital operating within its budget?  Are they being given false budgets to start with?  Are the figures built on sand at the beginning of the year or are hospitals not being managed correctly?  Can anyone give me a sense of that because I have yet to find a hospital within budget at the end of July?  I am open to correction.</p></speech>

This is a budget management as opposed to a policy question.  Is the problem that budgets are mismanaged and the HSE does not have the calibre of people to manage budgets within hospitals?  Why is no hospital within budget?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100900007#F01300"><p>There are undoubtedly a variety of answers to that question rather than a single one.  To answer at a general level, hospitals are required to reduce their spend very considerably this year in line with the overall reduction in funding to the HSE and a number of hospitals carried forward reasonably significant deficit positions arising from their end of year position in 2011.  Many hospitals are performing reasonably well in their in year position or what is known as their run rate while still carrying the deficit.  I cite an example of a hospital which came into the year carrying a &euro;23 million deficit and had to sustain a &euro;12 million reduction in its in year funding.  It has successfully done that by making significant improvements in its accident and emergency department, treatment waiting times and so on but, nonetheless, it is not yet in a position to manage down its carried forward deficit.</p><p>  Each hospital will have a different story but it may be helpful to address an earlier question of the Deputy's, which related to the issue of the current position this year versus previous years.  Over successive years, in what we believed were the good times and now know were not and the less good times, there were successive periods during which the HSE ran into financial difficulties at or about this time of year - sometimes a little sooner or a little later - so this is not a current year issue.  I believe that the absence of contemporary accounting systems - unified accounting systems of the type one would expect to see in an organisation of this size and complexity - is a significant contributory factor to that challenge.  In addition, in this particular year, the HSE faces what might be broadly referred to as significant demand-led challenges.  The number of patients presenting in accident and emergency departments is significantly up.  We have referenced the detail of the number of additional persons over and above the number expected who have become eligible for medical cards and, therefore, have received medical cards.  It may be instructive to note that if everything else had gone absolutely perfectly, the HSE would probably be on track without corrective measures.  There is something approaching a &euro;200 million deficit on that account alone so aspects of the HSE's operations are difficult to control, financially speaking, because of the nature of eligibility and the nature of demand.  That is an important factor to be taken into account but I do not in any way wish to diminish the significance of the absence of some of the basic enterprise-type systems which would go a long way to helping an organisation of the scale and complexity of the HSE to manage its affairs more effectively.  That is not, however, the total story; it is much more complex.</p></speech>

With regard to the committee's relationship with the HSE, Mr. O'Brien's predecessor told us, as Deputy McCarthy said, that the planned 50% reduction in the use of agency staff was "unrealistic".  It does not inspire confidence in a system when the Accounting Officer describes budgetary aims he is charged with implementing as unrealistic.  I do not ask Mr. O'Brien to comment on that but can he outline his perspective on the reduction in agency staff?  Was 50% a realistic target?  Is there a new target now?  Where does that stand?</p></speech>

As I mentioned to the committee member who left us earlier, the current position is to manage down reliance on agency and overtime, which includes a focus on absenteeism, to the minimum level possible consistent with maintaining safe services.  Agency and overtime in some of our hospitals is an underlying fact of their operation because of their geographic location and mix of services.  Some hospitals depend disproportionately on agency staff in the medical and nursing areas, whereas other hospitals that do not have the same issues tend to rely on them in the context of surge capacity and covering gaps left by excessive levels of absenteeism.  It is not a uniform picture.  In the context of seeking to manage this, the critical issue is to spend the minimum amount but to do so in a way that does not disrupt the safe provision of care to patients who need it.</p></speech>

At the time, Mr. Magee did not have the information available, which was understandable, and I was told the information would be sent on to the committee.  The committee then received a note from the HSE saying the information was not available because it was not collated.  One of my colleagues, who left earlier, obtained information through a parliamentary question on the number of people who earn over &euro;100,000 and the cost of their increments.  Increments, and the question of whether they are paid, is a policy matter and not an issue for the HSE.  However, in terms of accounting for its budget and its spending, I am confused as to why the information was not available to the committee when it sought the information in correspondence.  When a parliamentary question was tabled, the information was available.  I was baffled that the data were not available.  I wonder if the data are available in parliamentary questions but not to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It does not seem to tally.</p></speech>

The response in the documentation sent to the committee after the last session concerned identifying the number of people earning over &euro;70,000 who were paid increments.  The system issue arose in trying to identify how many people earning over &euro;70,000 were paid increments.  It is not difficult to identify how many people are paid over &euro;70,000.  We can do so in a relatively straightforward manner.  I hear the point made by Deputy Harris about those earning over &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

I do not mean this as a policy question.  When we are told about these legacy systems and the overrunning budgets, is the embargo on recruitment having a negative impact on the ability of the HSE to manage its budgets?  There is a responsibility on this House to provide the resources needed to manage budgets but clearly budgets are not being managed.  Is the embargo having an impact on the ability of the HSE to manage budgets?</p></speech>

In general, given that it must live within a particular ceiling, the HSE is not without the ability to seek specific skills where necessary.  For example, there is a requirement for a chief financial officer for the mid-western regional hospitals group in order to strengthen financial management as part of the development of that group.  Recruitment is taking place through the Public Appointments Service.  It is certainly not the case that the effect of the blanket moratorium limits our ability to address those deficits because we are seeking to do so at present.</p></speech>

It would be a backward step to do so.  When Mr. O'Brien's predecessor, Mr. Magee, appeared before the committee, he was always fully frank in whatever he had to tell us.  There was never any conflict or controversy when matters strayed into policy.  There was no sense of concealment of information and I would like to think both of the witnesses will approach the interaction with the committee in that spirit.</p><p>  An overrun in August of &euro;320 million has increased to &euro;374 million and it is reasonable to say that, all things being equal and projecting on the basis of the <i>status quo</i>, towards the end of the year the budgetary overrun, in real terms, will be &euro;509 million.

If I am not mistaken, he is saying that a figure in the range of only &euro;130 million to &euro;172 million will be the cut to the front line.  I am not looking for the detail, but I ask Dr. McLoughlin to set out the blocks.</p></speech>

The position is that &euro;130 million will be saved between 1 October and 31 December, as Mr. O'Brien has indicated.  That level of saving will be made.  There are a variety of other policy measures which will help the situation.  I am not in a position to be specific about them as this point.  I believe they will be substantial.</p><p>  I must make this point.  The HSE is obliged legally to balance its Vote.  That was the position in respect of Mr. Magee and it is the position in respect of Mr. O'Brien.  We will do everything in the Department to assist the balancing of that Vote.  I am very happy to answer in detail any questions at a later point, but I am precluded because of policy issues from going any further than I have indicated.</p></speech>

Without getting into the fine detail of policy choices, they must at a minimum be able to reassure us that a balanced budget can be struck, and furthermore in the public interest, to assure people, I am not sure how they do this, that it will not be at the expense of annihilating further front line services.  It strikes me that Dr. McLoughlin is making a claim - this has been repeated here several times - that a balanced budget will be struck.  He has not queried the figures that I have given to him.  He asserts that it will not affect front-line services.  I find it extraordinary, if all of that is true.  I do not see where the Department will get its &euro;438 million.  I do not see where he conjures this resource from, unless he goes to the front line.</p></speech>

Of the &euro;130 million, &euro;72 million are not directed at the front line, they are in areas I mentioned earlier, namely, cash management, stock management, changing the procurement practice, travel, printing and so on.  That leaves &euro;58 million.  We did announce at the end of August, that figure would come from front-line services.  We also made clear that we would be managing them carefully against risk assessment processes and looking for all other measures that could be taken in the meantime to avoid any of those cuts.  We are continuing to do that.</p></speech>

The balance of the measures are essentially on the income side.  I became deputy or acting chief executive officer of the HSE towards the end of August.  At that point I indicated clearly and in the public domain that the HSE was on track for a deficit in the order of &euro;500 million unless various corrective measures were taken.  The measures we outlined on the expenditure side related to the &euro;130 million that we have just discussed.  Dr. McLoughlin has referred to a number of policy measures that are designed to improve the income side.</p></speech>

The problem with that scenario is that this year, reducing the cost of drugs was to bring in &euro;124 million, but that has not happened.  The recouping of the full cost of private beds in public hospitals was supposed to yield &euro;143 million, that did not materialise.  What worries me is that the witnesses are working on an assumption that by year end, that is 2012, they will secure these moneys.  I wish it could be so and I wish them well in their task, but I find it extraordinary that they are telling us they will fill a hole of &euro;0.5 billion in the budget, taking only an additional &euro;58 million from front-line services and on the basis of policy decisions and policy measures, which were announced last year but did not come to pass, which arguably have left the current hole in the budget.  On a basic analysis I do not see how the figures stack up.</p></speech>

With all due respect, I would prefer if the Accounting Officers for the HSE and the Department of Health and Children were a bit more proactive in arguing the case for the preservation of services and for a reasoned budget that can actually deliver.

I am not sure it bears directly on the financial position of the HSE this year, but I can say there has been extensive engagement and dialogue in respect of not only the totality of the centres but also the methodology by which each of them might most appropriately be delivered.  Dr. McLoughlin has referred to the stimulus package, which is essentially what is known as a PPP, public-private partnership.  These centres can be delivered by two other modalities: conventional capital build and by a process known as lease acquisition.  There is a provision in the capital plan and this provision as well.  Centres that might not be delivered by one mechanism could be delivered by another.  We can look upon the stimulus package and the other provisions as mutual insurance policies against the failure to deliver any of the centres by one means or another, given that there are a huge amount of variables at play in respect of the methods by which these centres are developed.  These variables include the willingness and participation of general practitioners, availability of lands in the right place and so on.  It is quite a complicated picture.</p></speech>

One will find that the list of 20, as mentioned by the Deputy, does not contain the top 20 according to the deprivation index.  One will find that they are the 20 sites identified as most likely to be most effectively delivered via the stimulus package through the PPP.  It is not because they were the top 20 according to the deprivation index.  There has been a lot of debate and there may be some confusion about this, but the centres are not ordered from one to 20 according to the deprivation index either by the one-times multiplier or the three-times multiplier.</p></speech>

I find that somewhat astonishing.  I would have believed that Mr. O'Brien would have asked.  I would have assumed that the pool of people who would have been deeply involved with the application of criteria and the drawing up of lists would have been fairly limited.  I did not believe an extensive trawl of staff would be required.  Mr. O'Brien has been quite categorical in stating he had a particular involvement in respect of the initial list.  On the drawing up of the list, a decision was taken by the Minister, which is his kick.  The HSE was not so involved or, according to Mr. O'Brien, not involved at all, in identifying the additional sites.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

We should make it clear, of course, that these matters are under active consideration by the Government and that the outcome at the end of the year will be determined in consultation with the Government.  The Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are working very closely with the HSE to achieve a balanced Vote.  It is important that I put that on the record because the issues are quite serious.  I assure the public that services will continue to be provided at a very high level of quality and safety.  Patients need not be upset or concerned about these issues; we will deal with them all in a sensitive and sympathetic way.  We will do so in a way that will protect the interest of patients.</p></speech>

What happened at the start of the meeting is unfortunate.  The witnesses need to realise the role of the Committee of Public Accounts is to consider public expenditure.  It is never personal and this should be borne in mind as we work.</p><p>  I wish to refer to one local issue and then a national one.  In Limerick city, which I represent, a story broke this morning - I was not aware of it as a public representative but should have been - that certain patients that have heart attacks are taken directly to Galway instead of Limerick regional hospital.  I had contact with the HSE on this.  I understand that, at this point, what is required is an inspection of Limerick regional hospital by the officials associated with the national clinical programme, the coronary syndromes programme, with a view to putting in place a CAT laboratory with a 24-hour service.  Can the witnesses assure me that this inspection will take place immediately?  On what date will the 24-hour cardiac service be made available in Limerick regional hospital?  The situation has created fear and anxiety among the Limerick public that should not have been allowed to have been created.  It is a matter of communication.  I would like a categorical statement tonight that the inspection of the service will take place to ensure there are adequate facilitates and services.  I would like to know the date on which the 24-hour CAT laboratory and cardiac unit will be open to the patients of Limerick.</p></speech>

Primary PCI, the service to which the Deputy is referring, is a new development under the acute coronary syndromes programme.  Four centres have already been developed.  The HSE, with the Mid-Western Regional Hospital group, has invested significantly in the development of cardiology services at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital.  It now has five cardiologists, which represents a significant improvement.</p><p>  The decision on whether to authorise this service at that centre is primarily one of quality and safety.  The clinical lead has indicated that he will carry out the inspection within the next three weeks.  The outcome will determine whether we proceed to commence the service.</p></speech>

The inspection should take place immediately.  I understand Limerick regional hospital is now ready for the inspection.  It should not take three weeks.  I have no doubt that, if that inspection takes place, the 24-hour cardiac service will be made available in Limerick.  It is not good enough that patients were not aware of the matter.  This problem has featured since 1 October.  I ask Mr. O'Brien to expedite the inspection and have it take place immediately to give assurance to the people of Limerick.</p></speech>

It is in this context that the issue of the amount of money outstanding in respect of the signing of claim forms arises.  Recently, we put new electronic systems into five hospitals - Limerick will go live on the system tomorrow - to assist in this regard.  We have a number of specific problems with some consultants in terms of the completion of forms.</p></speech>

I have the files in front of me and will supply the figures if the Deputy will bear with me.  I was outlining some of the background.  The Deputy might be patient with me.  The figure for outstanding claims awaiting consultants' signatures is &euro;74 million.</p></speech>

The HSE is making &euro;58 million in front line cuts while &euro;74 million is outstanding because consultants have not signed forms to claim money from insurance companies.  Given the fact that the HSE is making cuts of &euro;8 million to home help services, how can the HSE stand over this situation or allow it to continue?  It makes no sense.</p></speech>

We have improved on the rate of signing of forms by consultants.  We are experiencing difficulties in respect of pending claims, those being claims that have been signed by consultants and are with insurers awaiting payment.  We are receiving more queries on those claims, adding to the overall delay.</p></speech>

Given the information provided by the witnesses, the HSE would not be required to make front line cuts if the bills were paid.  They stated that front line services would be cut by &euro;58 million, non-front line services would be cut by &euro;72 million and the remainder would be made up by generic drugs, etc.  Our job is to examine the figures and question management.  How in the name of God is &euro;74 million sitting around in unsigned forms on hospital consultants' desks at a time when the HSE is announcing cuts of &euro;8 million to home help services and a further &euro;50 million in cuts before the end of the year?</p></speech>

The Secretary General and Mr. O'Brien stated that we were in discussions on the issue.  It is correct to say that we need to recover that income as part of reaching a balanced year-end position.</p></speech>

The 2010 report to the committee contained an income Chapter, in which context the Comptroller and Auditor General made known to the committee and we responded to some concerns about the process that gave rise to so many forms being outstanding.  That process is primarily driven by the requirement of insurers to have the demographic detail, which is contained in our patient administration system on the day someone leaves hospital, as well as the form signed by the consultant.</p></speech>

By and large, the &euro;74 million does not have a good explanation.  There will always be some claims for which there may be a good reason for non-signing but &euro;74 million is way too high.  That is one of the reasons, shortly after taking up my post, together with the Secretary General, we sat down with the representatives of the consultant bodies and invited them into a Labour Relations Commission, LRC, process, one of the outcomes of which is a provision that such forms must be signed within 14 days.  I also referred to our proposals, subject to final legal clearance, to publish the list of consultants who are not signing forms.</p></speech>

If I ran a business where staff were not sending out invoices in order to get in fees, that business would not function.  I am bringing this down to euro and cent.  There is &euro;74 million outstanding that has not even been billed and it is work in progress.  Consultants have not signed these forms, which is wholly unacceptable.  We are dealing with people on the ground who ask how this happens.  Apart from the procedures to be put in place where signing must take place within 14 days, which I welcome, what will be done to clean up the &euro;74 billion owed to the HSE?  It has not yet even been billed to the insurance company.  What procedures are in place to recover this and give me a timeframe on when this will be done?  That is not straying into policy as it is purely about management and making proper use of the people's money.  We are charged with overseeing that and asking these questions.  Rather than giving me an overview of the process, will Mr. O'Brien tell me what will be done, and when the &euro;74 million will reach the HSE bank account?</p></speech>

The figures I have available, and Ms McGuinness can correct me if I am wrong, suggest that, for example, in 2007 expenditure from the HSE on private care contractors was approximately &euro;2.5 million, and such expenditure has climbed to &euro;19.14 million in 2011, the year for which figures are most recently available.  In many ways this has been at the expense of the displacement of some people working in the public system.  I do not expect Ms McGuinness to comment on that.  It is just an observation.</p><p>  Has the HSE engaged in any critical analysis of the actual cost involved in engaging private care companies as opposed to retaining the services of people in the public system?  There is an implicit assumption, whether in respect of agency staff or other areas, that by outsourcing services, savings can be made.  There is research that attempts to prove otherwise and there is a good deal of evidence that suggests many organisations, and analogous organisations such as the NHS in the UK, are now deciding to insource services again because they have learned lessons from the past in terms of the expenditure of public moneys on outsourcing.  Has any examination been undertaken by the HSE on those sorts of costs and whether it is beneficial to the taxpayer to focus on public versus private provision or <i>vice versa</i>?  Can Ms Laverne elaborate on that?</p></speech>

One is that we are being asked to reduce the numbers working in the public sector and to reduce our actual numbers.  In terms of the home help service, a procurement process was undertaken of home help provision in the Dublin north-east region.  The prices are very comparable when compared with the public expenditure on such provision.</p></speech>

We do not directly employ people in the provision of the home help service when we are contracting a particular agency in that respect.  We are not, therefore, responsible for the provision of pensions, PRSI, and so forth.  The agency would have to take up all the costs associated with staff absenteeism, management of pensions, management of payrolls, and so on.  There have been gaps in particular areas where it was not possible to obtain direct provision if one so wished.  That also has been a  particular circumstance in our selection of outsourcing that arrangement.</p></speech>

The contract they would have would vary very much on an individual basis.  It would depend also on where they are situated.  We have home help provision in areas that are quite remote such as on the Aran Islands.  Those people's contracts might be different on an individualised basis from someone providing home help in the city.  Some people have to travel some distances and in that case we would not be able to put in place an outsourced arrangement.  I can provide the committee with the terms and conditions of the contract.</p></speech>

A range of organisations, including Comfort Keepers, received just over &euro;1 million from the HSE in 2007, and that expenditure has climbed to &euro;3.267 million, which is a significant rise.

There is a contract for the provision of services.  There is not a commission <i>per se</i>.

It would have been done through public procurement and one of the key tenets by which they are assessed is the value for money aspect of it.</p></speech>

A direct billing arrangement, once the forms are signed, enables the HSE or the hospital in question to claim the amount of money that is due in accordance with a predetermined tariff for the treatments provided to the privately insured person in the hospital.  Separate to that, there is a scale of fees payable to the consultant, depending on his or her discipline and the nature of the treatment he or she provides, against the tariff that he or she separately claims and is paid directly by the private health insurer.  In so far as the consultant has not signed the form enabling the HSE or hospital, as the case may be, to claim the fees due to the executive or hospital, he or she will not yet be in a position to claim the fees due to him or her.</p></speech>

Digging behind each of those figures, page 20 of the report includes information on primary care reimbursements, which we touched upon.  One of the points made in respect of the increased demand for services, and I believe Mr. O'Brien touched on this point as well, is that a big chunk of the increase in the issuing of medical cards was clearing the backlog that had built up across the second half of last year.  That was cleared during the first half of this year.  Given that those applications were in the system but had not been processed, should it have been assumed that this deficit was going to occur because the HSE had received all the applications and they simply had not been processed?</p></speech>

That is one reason but there could be an increase in the number of prescriptions.  The volume of prescribing can affect the deficit on schemes.  It is not linked solely to the number of medical cards.</p></speech>

When the HSE is getting its figures ready for the year, I suppose it knows that if it issues a certain number of new medical cards, that will generate a certain amount of expenditure.  Why has there been such an increase in the number of items on existing medical cards that has consequently driven the cost the HSE is managing at the moment?</p></speech>

Medical card costs are much more significant in terms of people who are older, so ageing is a significant factor.  This has the effect of growing the prescribing volume.</p></speech>

At the start of the year, the HSE knows that people will be getting older and looking for more, that some people will, unfortunately, pass away, and that new people will be coming in.  It is a stable enough universe.</p></speech>

The drivers are numbers of medical cards and the mix of medical cards by age category, gender and physical location, because there are variable rates for geographies to some extent.  There are a number of drivers behind what causes the cost of schemes to grow.  They are estimated at the start of the year and then the trend is observed and managed as the year progresses in terms of budgets and actuals.</p></speech>

While there is much debate about this year's service plan and this year's projected deficit position, it forms part of a picture that goes on for a longer period of time.  As the Accounting Officer and as we approach the issue of developing a proposed service plan for next year, which will be in the policy space and I will not talk in any detail about that, it is important that we look to see what specific lessons can be drawn from each of the previous years in which the service plan has not worked in the way we would have wished.  I emphasised at the time that I considered the absence of enterprise-wide contemporary financial planning and accounting systems, which the HSE does not have as it is largely operating on the basis of the legacy systems it inherited, is a significant issue.  The Secretary General has made reference to a couple of reviews which have been commissioned by the Department.  They are currently being considered by the Minister and he has said that he intends to publish them in the very near future.  They, too, will speak to this issue and one or two others.  It is clear that the service planning round will need to draw on these lessons and take a very hard look at what we might do differently in terms of service planning in the future, based on this experience.</p><p>  The point I was making about the PCRS impact, or the schemes which we broadly refer to as PCRS, is that even if everything else had been absolutely perfect regarding the assumptions, income collection and so forth, the HSE would still have had to find a way to deal with the fact that the level of requirement or eligibility for various schemes, in and of itself, would have knocked the overall financial position off by approximately &euro;210 million.</p></speech>

This is only one part of the picture.  I do not put it forward as the entire picture because I have already acknowledged the financial planning and contemporary financial systems issues.  Clearly, also, we have an issue to address in terms of hospitals and other areas.  However, the HSE is sometimes open to criticism which is couched simply in terms of it not managing its expenditure correctly.  That criticism can be made and it is part of the explanation for some of this, but the HSE does not have the capacity to manage eligibility issues relating to the schemes we refer to generically as the PCRS schemes.  They are based on eligibility.  The need arises, the cost is incurred and the HSE has no discretion for the vast majority of that.</p></speech>

The challenge, however, is that extracting cash as a productivity gain, particularly in the area of roster changes and so forth in which consultants will engage, is a delicate and tricky manoeuvre.

We have had a fair exchange and sharing of information.  I want to clear up a number of points.  Mr. Woods referred to the legacy issues, the health boards, the 50 agencies and so on.  The HSE was established in 2005 and in all of those years, the legacy issues were not dealt with; proper computerised systems were not installed to read the delivery of services and the costs and so on.  Why was that?</p></speech>

In effect we have had some system development to try to deal with aggregated data more effectively to produce information both for public transparency and for the board of the HSE.  The core system that would be required to run the HSE effectively is still not in place.</p></speech>

The HSE had significant budgets over those years.  At the last meeting, the then chief executive officer, Mr. Magee, admitted that the systems were not fit for purpose.  Acknowledging that in 2012, not having done anything about it from the establishment of the HSE in 2005, in spite of the report to which Mr. Woods referred, would seem to me to be a complete breakdown of management.  Management, and its reports, cannot function properly without gathering information by technology.  That is essentially the world we live in.  The HSE has failed miserably over these years to put in place a system that actually works.  From what we heard today, what was actually done about the &euro;74 million that was outstanding?  Were debt collectors sent out to bring in that &euro;74 million as the HSE did when dealing with citizens who attended accident and emergency departments and did not pay?  Was the same effort made to put that in place to collect the &euro;74 million?  Deputy O'Donnell suggested that we did not just arrive at this point, the practice has grown up over the years.  It would seem once again that within an agency of the State, nobody cried "Stop".</p></speech>

There is a system being installed which offers the prospect of improvement in the overall process.  That is under way.  There have been active processes and there is one other under way at present both to support and pursue the signing of claim forms within each of the hospitals.  The comments made by the chief executive officer about the Labour Relations Commission's recommendations are very important in the context of getting timely signing of those forms.</p></speech>

There were also 50 agencies involved.  It think it was at the last meeting with the HSE that we found there was no clear oversight of their spending under section 39 and that a process of audit and a system of oversight would be put in place for them.  The committee has had no clear indication that the Department or the HSE has a handle on that?</p></speech>

I am aware that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, was very concerned about these matters when he took office and efforts were made in the autumn of 2011 to deal with some of these issues.  When I was appointed Secretary General of the Department, I ordered a major review of financial management systems in the HSE.  Those reports are currently being finalised and action is currently being taken.</p><p>  I want to make it absolutely clear that I discussed these matters with the Minister and they have been discussed with our colleagues in other Departments.  It is true to say there have been systems failures and there are issues that need to be addressed, including improving financial performance and ensuring we have financial accountability arrangements that are adequate.  The Minister has already indicated that he is putting in place a financial improvement plan which will involve the enhancement of the capability of the HSE to deal with these issues both within each of the regions and with the PCRS.</p><p>  One of the challenges is that we are planning to take the Vote back into the Department in January 2014.  I assure the committee of the very best efforts of the Department working with the chief executive and the HSE to deal with some of these issues very quickly.  In general terms, I can assure members we are dealing with these issues right now and we are planning a different approach to the service planning agenda in 2013 to 2015, inclusive.</p><p>  We need to have regard to the fact that significant reforms are required in the HSE.  The governance Bill is before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister and the Department were very keen that the Bill would be advanced as quickly as possible so that we can have a much more structured, effective governance system within the health service and within the HSE for as long as it is there.</p><p>  We welcome the opportunity to discuss the strategic issues with the committee and we will be very happy in due course to revert to the committee and give it a full account of the processes in place when the necessary policy decisions have been taken.</p></speech>

We have published details in respect of absenteeism in the Department, which is currently 2.8%, on our website.  Mr. O'Brien, as chairman of the HSE, myself, as Secretary General of the Department, and the Minister have insisted on publication of full details of all absenteeism across the health system.  In truth, absenteeism in the health system is neither affordable nor sustainable.  The Minister is on public record in this regard.  We need all staff of the HSE to have regard to the fact that this is an extremely difficult time.  Without going into specifics, "Olympic absenteeism" - a phrase I coined - was 11% in the context of one hospital.  I am aware of other services in respect of which absenteeism has reached 9%.  These levels are totally unacceptable.  We are targeting a 3.5% figure across the system.  We want to work closely with the staff associations in tackling this issue, which will be a serious challenge.</p><p>  I note that our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have negotiated a significant arrangement under the Labour Court which will help in terms of sick leave entitlements, which have literally been halved.</p></speech>

On the absenteeism issue, from next year we will be only funding replacement of staff at the acceptable level of absenteeism, in respect of which our national target as provided for in this year's service plan is 3.5%.  We have yet to have a discussion on what it will be next year.  Some locations are achieving this and others are significantly at variance with it.  We published the first full month's data in respect of July, which the committee has before it.  We will be moving to publishing on a quarterly basis, which is the more commonly accepted way of publishing absenteeism data.  We are putting a sharp focus on this issue.</p><p>  On the earlier question about financial systems, at the end of the week of my appointment I received two sets of correspondence, the first of which was from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to my formal appointment as Accounting Officer, including the various enclosures one receives reminding one of one's obligations.  The second was a draft copy of the Ogden review from the Department.  The two do not make good companions as reading sets.  Following publication of the review we will be able to talk about what we have done already to bring about improvements.  As any Accounting Officer would wish, many of the legacy system systems have been resolved at this point.  I am committed to working as hard as I can to ensure the remaining issues are resolved.  I mentioned the issue of contemporary enterprise-wide solutions a number of times in my evidence today, which is an indication of the priority I attach to them as a means of bringing financial control to the health service.</p></speech>

We undertook at that time to revisit the issue on an individual GP basis, looking back over the years to see what was outstanding in respect of both areas.  This work has been completed.  There will be no netting off because obviously the same GP may not be involved in both cases.  It is intended that this matter will be rectified on 14 November 2012.  As such, the recoupment will be made at that time.  Discussions will also be held with the IMO.</p></speech>

I am conscious, having previously represented the departmental side, that there may be issues arising as parliamentary questions which could have been dealt with more expeditiously by way of direct contact.

I commend the joint committee on undertaking a series of hearings on the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Shane Dempsey, head of consumer foods within FDII, Mr. Michael Barry, director of the Irish Dairy Industries Association, Mr. Cormac Healy, director of Meat Industry Ireland, and Mr. Ciaran Fitzgerald, chairman of Meat Industry Ireland.  As the Chairman noted, we each have individual presentations.  My colleagues will be dealing with their areas of the food sector.</p><p>  I will start my presentation by giving an overarching view of the industry.  The agrifood sector is by far the most important industry in Ireland, an indigenous industry with wider linkages to the overall economy.  One in eight jobs in this economy are linked to agrifood.  There are 690 enterprises, of which 94% are small and medium-sized enterprises, which is slightly lower than the European average of 99%.  We have a slightly larger number of large companies, but the figure of 94% is indicative of the significant importance of SMEs.</p><p>  There are two main aspects to the industry.  We have a very strong domestic presence and would supply the majority of Ireland's &euro;14 billion grocery sector and associated food service sector.  We are very strong in the export market.  We exported &euro;9 billion in food and drink products in 2011.  This is substantial.  Some 75% of our produce goes to other countries in the European Union and the other 25% goes to third countries.  Some two thirds of all indigenous exports emanating from Ireland are in the food and drink sector.  That shows the importance and export potential of indigenous enterprise.  The slightly broader bio-economy, which includes forestry and aquaculture, accounts for 30% of net foreign earnings.  These were the findings of a study, Fostering the Smart Green Bio-economy, commissioned by the former Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in recent years.  In numerical terms, the bio-economy generated &euro;11.5 billion in purchases in the domestic economy, the significant elements of which would be raw materials from the agricultural production sector as well as services.  It has the largest payroll of any manufacturing sector at &euro;1.75 billion.  The sector hits above its weight.  It would be the largest intra-EU exporter and we would be the largest net exporter of beef, lamb and dairy ingredients in Europe.  Compared with many other countries in Europe, the agrifood sector in its broadest sense is much more important to the economy than it would be in other countries.  One in eight jobs in Ireland is associated with agrifood whereas one in eight jobs in Germany is in the car industry.  That show how important the industry is to Ireland.</p><p>  The subject of these hearings is Food Harvest 2020, which is a very ambitious growth strategy, especially in respect of exports where it is planned to grow them by 40% to &euro;12 billion by 2020.  It is worth going behind that headline number and trying to get a sense of what impact it will have in terms of the wider economy.  It will be much greater than export growth in any other sector simply because there are such deep linkages into the wider economy, into agriculture and both the rural and urban economies.  The reason is that the direct expenditure as a percentage of sales in the Irish economy is 60%.  That compares with 19% for other manufacturing sectors.  Every extra euro generated by exports of food has a much greater impact in terms of direct expenditure to the rest of the economy than any other manufacturing sector.  We have done some analysis on this and have circulated a report to members, entitled Sharing the Harvest, which estimates that if the export target hits &euro;12 billion, it will result in 30,000 extra jobs throughout the economy.  A percentage of them will be in food manufacturing but a much higher percentage will be in agriculture and ancillary services related to agriculture and a certain amount in the wider economy as the wealth flows into the rest of the economy.</p><p>  Linkages are important.  We often hear references to the food chain.  That is particularly important to Irish agrifood.  This is the only fully integrated industry supply chain of any industry sector in the country.  Everything is available in Ireland: raw materials, production, processing, sales, marketing innovation and the corporate headquarters.  It is either sold into the domestic market or sold on the export market.  That means policy and regulation and the way they are implemented impact on the sector much more than on any other sector.  What is happening at farm level has a significant impact on what is happening at processing level, and what is happening at the processing level has a major impact on what is happening at farm level, and so on right up the supply chain.  One does not have such deep linkages to the same extent in any other sector in the wider economy.</p><p>  We see a policy dichotomy in Ireland.  The central tenet or vision of Food Harvest 2020 is smart green growth.  The strategy was brought together by a combination of industry and the agrifood sector in its broadest sense, both private and public.  There was very strong industry participation in the development of Food Harvest 2020 and subsequently in its roll-out and implementation.  We are finding that in other parts of Government, we are facing a number of policies which are very much at odds with trying to achieve smart green growth, or else the policies are not being implemented quickly enough to ensure we will achieve certain targets of Food Harvest 2020.  I can give some examples.</p><p>  Let us look at the slides in the PowerPoint presentation.  Certain aspects will be developed by my colleagues in their presentation.  It is vital we have a sustainable and competitive raw material supply base.  What happens at farm level - the production sector of food - is vital.</p></speech>

I am contributing at this point because it is our intention to outline the position with regard to the primary element of the industry before commenting on the secondary aspects.  I would like to provide a very brief overview in respect of the dairy sector and the opportunities for growth within it.  I wish to relate what can be a very positive and exciting story and to outline where the challenges exists.  There is no doubt that the targets to be achieved and the bounties to be realised are well worth working towards.</p><p>  I wish to take a moment to reflect on that for which 2012 will be remembered.  The year started a bit too well in that Ireland was faced with a super levy bill.  Up to June, there was strong milk production across the EU but this began to fall away in July.  We reached the point where there was just too much butter fat available in the market.   At one point we wondered whether the EU would reopen the intervention scheme in respect of the butter market.  However, this did not happen.  What did occur was a very large usage of the annualised private storage scheme.  The latter is an EU-run scheme which seasonal producers such as Ireland have used and depended on for a long period.  In summary, a large volume of butter stocks were placed in storage.</p><p>  The year 2012 will, of course, be remembered for the poor weather.  There was too much water in the north of Europe and too little in the south.  In addition, there were droughts in America.  This story was repeated across the globe.  The impact of all of this has been a shortage of fodder and an increase, to record high levels, in the price of grain, concentrates and feedstuffs.  As a result of poor weather in northern Europe leading to the production of poor fodder, feed prices have risen and people's profits are being squeezed.  We have moved from having a problem with the super levy at the beginning of the year to a position where we are 1.4% behind where we should be in the context of milk quotas as the end of the year approaches.</p><p>  The dairy industry exports just short of &euro;3 billion worth of dairy products to countries throughout the world.</p></speech>

The food and drinks industries are significant players in the national economy.  Instead of just agriculture, we must examine the cost of all policies if we are to develop these industries.  Energy costs were mentioned as being significant.  A 10% saving on a 2% cost is 0.2%.  If a cost is 30% and a saving of 10% is made, the overall figure is 3%.  Is there an industry average for the cost of raw materials, labour, transport and energy?  In broad terms, what percentage does each of these represent as a percentage of the overall cost base?  I have long argued that, for resource-based industries such as forestry, agriculture and stone, the cost of transporting a product to the factory and so on tends to be a larger factor than it is for companies making microchips, where the cost of transport is insignificant.</p><p>  Energy costs were also cited as being significant.  What is their order of magnitude in terms of the total input costs?  Knowing the figure is always useful.</p><p>  How much of the final cost is accounted for by the cost of raw materials, that is, what the farmer gets?  The committee has been considering an issue that has not been raised at this meeting yet, namely, the purchasing power of multinational multiples, the squeeze they can put on manufacturers and primary suppliers and the effects of same on long-term sustainability.  If companies with a large clout in the market are not offering viable prices, does it pose a challenge?</p><p>  We all agree that price volatility presents a considerable challenge, particularly if we are moving away from a dependence on EU subsidies such as single payments, etc.  This is an important issue for the world.  I noted the comments on the retention of private storage, which is one bet Mr. Barry has against it.</p><p>  Mr. Barry stated that direct payments insulate against price volatility, in that one gets a certain amount of money before one starts to gain.  For an 80-cow or 90-cow farmer, what is the average direct payment per hectare and what is his or her total direct payment?  Various proposals have been made for reshaping CAP.  It must support productive farmers.  Cattle dealers probably did the best out of the last CAP.  Someone who sent a large number of cattle to a factory received a ten-year bonus.  My understanding is that dairy farmers did not do as well proportionally.  I would be interested in Mr. Barry's comments in this regard.</p><p>  I will also be interested in knowing the meat people's thoughts on Mr. Barry's comments about mandatory country of origin labelling.  There will be conflict.  Some industries want labelling because that is their selling point whereas some do not.  Does everyone agree on the question or is there an industry dichotomy?</p><p>  I do not understand where the Commissioner is coming from in terms of the greening component of the proposed CAP.  On one level, every farmer must comply with good farming practice.  One cannot throw fertiliser around willy-nilly.  There is already a greening element.  The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, was for super green farmers.  Will the new greening element supersede REPS?  I do not understand.  There will be three levels of greening.  For example, standard greening is the good farming practice with which everyone must comply.  I would rather see a high standard without a special greening package, but a basic payment for a high standard - good practices, non-pollutants, etc. - would suit Ireland in terms of marketing, sustainability and so on.  However, if much of CAP's resources are devoted to greening, what must a farmer do to get the REPS payment?  Where does it all fit?  This is a valid question, but I do not know the answer to it.  Does Mr. Barry have an answer?  The average farmer who conforms with good practice should be able to get the full whack of the single payment.  There is considerable agreement on this point.</p><p>  I take it that Mr. Barry's argument is not with combating climate change, but with the way we count the emissions from cows, etc.  Genetic work is being done in Australia to try to reduce methane outputs from cows at both ends.  Has the Irish Dairy Industries Association, IDIA, proposals on counting emissions in a different way without compromising the need to reduce them?  This issue deserves a great deal of scientific analysis.</p></speech>

We are in uncharted waters from an agricultural economic perspective, and one of the most serious negotiation processes lies ahead, which could have significant long-term effects for the industry.  The industry's importance to the Irish economy has become more evident in the past number of years, particularly when we have been in recession in a big way.  It is the one sector of our economy that has continued to do well.</p><p>  I am concerned about the proposed end to quotas and I do not know how that will end, particularly with regard to the milk quota.  I have a feeling this will lead to intensification and a reduction in producers, and many farmers will not survive this.  Effectively, we will move to a more corporate-oriented farming industry, and I am very concerned about that.  What are the views of the witnesses in this respect?  The end of the quota system will open the process and lead to an expanded free market, and the consequences may lead to smaller producers not being able to compete as the margins will be smaller.  That will lead to an expansion of the social problems in rural Ireland in particular.  Will the witnesses expand on the issue?</p><p>  This year has brought problems home for many of us who come from an agricultural or farming background.  I know several farmers who will have no fodder for the winter because of the terrible summer we have had, and they have used much of the winter feed already.  Added to this are the fuel costs rising on a weekly basis, as well as higher energy costs.  The price of milk peaked at the end of June and beginning of July and has been dropping since.  The margins are getting smaller for people who are trying to survive selling the product.  What is the view of the witnesses on this aspect?</p><p>  The delegation discussed a domestic market that is dynamic and competitive, and at the end of the contribution reference was made to a comprehensive grocery sector, inclusive of rent reviews, labour legislation and rates.  Does this refer to getting rid of upward-only rent reviews?</p></speech>

It will be an investment of over &euro;100 million, which demonstrates the absolute strength of the food industry in Ireland.  This is an indigenous company set up 40 years ago.  It ties in with much of what we are saying about the importance of the food sector, which is one of the good news stories in the economy.  We must do everything we can as a Government and country to support this sector and help it grow.</p><p>  There are a couple of points regarding Mr. Barry's presentation.  The scale in the context of Food Harvest 2020 is colossal; the starting point of the country and its production has dairy exports at 2.7 billion litres.  With the proposed increase of 50% in milk volumes, is there a risk that we are putting all our eggs into one basket or leaving ourselves a little vulnerable if we go down the dairy line like this?  There was a point that the input cost volatility could be to Ireland's competitive advantage but will the witness expand on that?</p><p>  What is Mr. Kelly's view on the sugar industry?  He is aware of attempts being made to try to get Ireland producing sugar again within a quota system or otherwise if the system is gone by 2015.  What impact will be felt by the food and drink industry if Ireland gets back into producing sugar?  I am sure it is a key stakeholder in the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012100900007#J01000"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in today.  They mentioned input price volatility, which is something being felt by all sectors currently.  Feed grains have gone from &euro;115 per tonne in early 2010 to &euro;250 per tonne today.  There is a significant quality issue in Ireland because of contracts, and the industry should be conscious of that as well, as nobody in the feed industry saw it coming.  The witnesses mentioned Asian markets.  Although we need them to expand and put growth targets together, we should be constantly moving in the value-added brand sector, as the day will come when the Asian markets will take care of themselves.  They will not watch us supply them forever without trying to replicate what we do, so it would be perhaps foolish to put all our eggs in that basket.</p><p>  My late father got out of milk production in 1991.  We received &pound;1 a gallon at that stage, which equates approximately to 28 cent per litre.  That is scarily close to what the farmer is getting today, some 21 years later.  It seems Irish agriculture has absorbed inflation figures for 21 years as nothing else has.  The price of milk from the shelf has increased by 25% and over 21 years one could not begrudge that increase.  Fertiliser in 1991 was approximately &euro;130 per tonne and today it is approximately &euro;330 for the same amount, a 60% increase.  I know dairy farmers do not use as much fuel as tillage farmers but it is still a significant cost, and that has gone from approximately 21.5 cent in 1991 to approximately 86 cent per litre today, a 409% increase.</p><p>  We have increased our competitiveness and the single farm payment has been a very important influence.  Nevertheless, we cannot continue to produce at the quality we do and not have a fair price for farmers.</p></speech>

On the issue of mandatory country of origin labelling, I had understood that all along we were hoping to have a premium for Irish produce and I wonder where that has fallen out of that argument.  Perhaps I was not listening or it was not made sufficiently clear but I do not understand how it does not help the Irish dairy sector.</p><p>  On the matter of pragmatism in regard to greening, on whose behalf is that pragmatism required?  Do we need to lower the standards of the greening or to lower margins, or do we need to do both?  What did Mr. Barry mean by that?</p></speech>

Their presentations were very good.  I have been a dairy producer for  the past 20 odd years and I know of all the difficulties involved in that.  How hopeful are the witnesses that we can achieve the Food Harvest 2020 target of a 50% increase in milk production, which is a significant increase?  This year farmers have had to face high super levy bills, which will set them back a good deal in terms of their expectations.  The soft landing issue must be a serious one for consideration.  If farmers have to face high super levies in the coming year, dairy farmers in particular will definitely not be able to achieve the potential that has been set out.  I agree with the assertion that this is an exciting time in terms of Food Harvest 2020.  There are many challenges but there is great potential to be achieved.  However, if farmers have more such set backs they will not achieve that potential.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012100900008#K00500"><p>I will deal with questions or points that were directed at me as best I can and Mr. Michael Barry might then respond.</p><p>  I will start with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v whose first point related to the cost base.  The best work in this area has been done by the National Competitiveness Council.  It produces competitiveness indicators and an annual cost of doing business report every year.  It produces very good data and this allows comparisons between different sectors and between sectors in Ireland and overseas.  Its methodology  generally examines costs excluding the costs of raw materials and it does that largely on the basis that most raw materials are priced on a continental or global basis.  If one considers specifically domestically originating input costs, it is as well to leave out the costs of raw materials, but from a food perspective they would be a very significant part of the cost base.  If one leaves those out and considers the National Competitiveness Council's numbers for most food categories, one will generally find that labour is the single biggest input, and that reflects the fact that many of the industry sectors are quite labour intensive. </p><p>  Leaving aside the labour input, the next big components are utilities and the largest of those is energy, which is around 20%.  Transport is next and it is around 16% to 18%. Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was correct to point out that relative to other manufacturing sectors, those components would be much greater.  Those are two of the difficult pinch points.  Given that we are export focused if our energy costs are out of line, that is an imbedded cost when we are trying to compete in markets overseas.  Similarly in regard to transport, there is a distance-to-market issue.  If we are trying to sell beef or butter into the Italian or German market, it has to be hauled a much longer distance than the produce of the local market producers against whom we are competing.  They tend to be the input cost components and that is the reason they tend to be a very strong focus for the industry.</p><p>  The Government has a significant part to play in the construction of those costs in terms of the way in which the energy market is regulated.  We were able to benefit from a large energy users rebate for the past number of years and while that is coming to an end now it would have been very helpful to companies in the very difficult circumstances in which they found themselves in recent years.  In rough terms, the food and drink sector would account for about 25% of industrial electricity usage and other companies would use gas and heavy fuel oil as well.  Similarly in regard to transport, we have one of the highest diesel and general fuel oil costs in Europe.  The energy intensity of the sector means that this causes great difficulties.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's next question was on the final cost of production.  It is a very detailed chain and it depends on the final product.  The more processing that takes place, the more complex it becomes.  What is noticeable, and this is something to which we both referred, is that it is a low margin business.  That can be seen from public companies in Ireland.  When they make their statements to the Stock Exchange, and those figures are publicly available, the margins of the consumer food companies would tend to run in low single digits in percentage terms.  Meat historically would tend to run at even lower levels than that.  Generally speaking, it is a very tight margin business.  Some companies have managed to get past that but generally they would have very significant investments in brands and innovation, although they would be the exception rather than the rule.  The profile of the Irish food sector is that it is a very low margin business.  </p><p>  That last point is a natural lead into Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's third point which related to the purchasing power of the multinational retailers, to which a number of Deputies have also referred.  We have seen a flow of margin from the producer and the processor in the direction of the retailer.  That in large part is down to the consolidation and buyer power they have built up.  It is not a uniquely Irish issue - it applies across the world.  We talked about the importance of getting our statutory code of practice for the grocery sector over the line.  There are legislative measures or codes in place or being actively considered in many other European countries and that is the correct political and public policy response to this very significant issue.  It has manifested itself in a number of different ways, two of which are particularly relevant in the context of our discussions.  The first is the issue of unfair practices where we see changes to contractual terms and so on.  That causes huge difficulties for companies in regard to cashflow and general business planning, and I am referring here to the food manufacturing companies.    </p></speech>

We are proud of "Irish".  We want the freedom and flexibility to brand and differentiate ourselves as Irish.  The Kerrygold brand is an example of this.  That will apply to finished foods we are bringing directly to the consumer.  The vast majority of our additional product will be dairy powders such as whole milk and skimmed milk powders and caseins for high value-added products such as infant nutrition and sports nutrition.  These products are mission critical.</p><p>  We do not want mandatory country of origin labelling because we want to make it easy for global customers to use our ingredients, irrespective of the country in which they operate.  They will not have those restrictions if they are using powders from New Zealand.  That is the thinking behind our argument.  We are trying to have jam on both sides of the bread.  We want the freedom to use country of origin labelling when we want to.  For the majority of our ingredients, we do not want a customer to be obliged to include country of origin.  We want to remove those barriers.</p><p>  Greening is our unique selling point.  We are strong on that issue and we are completely committed to addressing sustainability across the food chain.  We have systems such as REPS and AEOS and our farms have very good and green metrics.  Some of the greening measures proposed by the Commission in the CAP may not be sufficient and would move us back to environmentally unsustainable activities.  </p></speech>

I will cover the meat sector in the context of Food Harvest 2020, the targets and where we are now.  I will concentrate on the beef sector but I will refer to the other sectors which I work for as well, the sheepmeat industry and the pigmeat industry.</p><p>  First, I will give the committee a quick reminder of the targets.  In the beef sector, the target is a growth in output value of 40% by 2020.</p> <p>In the original Food Harvest 2020 report, we talked about 20% but following that, as was done on the dairy side, a beef activation group was set up to look at some of the more detailed needs and requirements in terms of delivering on the target.  The first thing that group did was to recognise that world commodity prices, including beef prices, had moved on.  Consequently, in terms of achieving a value growth target, a certain amount of it had been achieved through price alone.  That activation group equally looked at the possibility of volume growth, both from the dairy sector and the expansion that will take place there with some additional cows in the system and in respect of the important suckler herd and the potential for some recovery in numbers that had been lost in previous years.  In terms of the pigmeat sector, an ambitious growth target of 50% has been set and I will touch on that briefly in a subsequent slide.  For the sheepmeat sector, there is a growth target of 20% in output value terms but I make the point, to which I will revert, that the sector itself, both at producer and processing levels, believes there is greater potential therein and considers that up to 45% perhaps could be achieved.</p><p> Before I go into some of the specifics on the beef sector in particular, I wish to take a look back at the beef sector itself and what has happened over the past decade.  It is useful to reflect on that as we look forward to ascertain what is achievable in Food Harvest 2020.  If one looks at the sector over the past decade, back in the early 2000s it was a sector that was a frozen commodity beef export business with a heavy reliance on intervention and on exports to international markets outside Europe with the assistance of export refunds.  This has changed significantly and it is worth noting that only two weeks ago, we saw the final setting to zero in Europe of beef export refunds.  I think this was the first time in the history of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, that export refunds in the beef sector were at zero.  It is now a sector that is supplying high-quality fresh-chilled product across the United Kingdom and mainland Europe to top retailers and food service customers.  Members probably have seen and heard some of these statistics previously but I note one in five burgers sold in McDonald's throughout Europe is made from Irish beef.  Moreover, of every 4 kg of beef eaten in the United Kingdom, 1 kg is of Irish origin.  We now are supplying in excess of 70 of the top retailers across Europe and Irish beef is stocked by more retailers than is beef of any other origin in the world, which is a significant achievement.</p><p> I will move through the graphic displays in my presentation quickly and the slide on view shows the development in exports.  The red bars reflect exports to international markets outside Europe with the assistance of export refunds, while the blue bars reflect exports to Europe.  Over the past decade, one can see a continual increase in the relevance and importance of the United Kingdom and European markets.  Similarly, the graph now on display shows the penetration of retail markets across Europe and again, over the past decade up to 2011, one can see continual growth in the volume of sales going to retail.  If one considers that ten-year period, back in 2001 approximately 27 retailers throughout Europe were being supplied, whereas last year, 75 retailers were stocking and selling Irish beef.  During that period, significant work has been done in respect of branding and adding value to our beef.  This certainly is the case with regard to adding value in terms of product development and new products.  More recently, however, there has been work done on branding both our primary beef, in terms of Irish Hereford, Irish Angus etc. and on the processed meat side.  On foot of a significant degree of work, while we remain with the core statistic in the beef sector that 90% of the beef we produce is destined for export markets, last year those exports increased by 15% to reach a level in excess of &euro;1.8 billion.  To give members an idea of the breakdown of those sales, the pie chart on the bottom of the slide on display shows that almost 50% of our beef exports go to retail, a further 23% to 25% go to manufacturing and the remainder, or just over a quarter, go to the food service sector.  The map in the corner of the slide on display gives an indication of the spread of exports throughout the European Union.  Obviously, the United Kingdom still remains an important market and still takes approximately 50% of our exports.</p><p> When considering this development over the past decade, what has been its impact?  One impact has been on the price return from the market, that is, the price return to producers.  During the same period I have covered, that is, from 2001 to last year, the beef price has gone from a level of 240 cent per kilogram to an average year-to-date price this year of 410 cent per kilogram.  There has been a significant movement in price, a 70% increase, over the decade.  The market has delivered, as that period witnessed a move away from intervention and from a reliance on export refunds to third countries to a closer linkage with the marketplace in Europe and the 500 million consumers therein.  As I noted, finished cattle prices during that period have increased by 70% and, more recently, have increased by 30% within the last two years to the tune of an additional &euro;700 million being paid to beef producers over the two-year period since January 2011.  Certainly in 2005 and 2006, there was a step change in beef price and in the past two years, there again has been a significant move in beef prices to a new level.  The gap with the European Union average certainly has been closed to a considerable extent.</p><p> However, in a word of caution before I turn to considering some of the recommendations, one cannot ignore the marketplace either and there are always issues there.  Since 2008, we have been working against both the severe impact the sterling-euro exchange rate has had on Irish exports and the economic downturn, both here in Ireland obviously and across Europe, which has had an impact on consumption.  It has led to a trading-down by consumers, who are being more cautious and are opting for lower-value cuts, etc.  Consequently, this has created its own pressures and consumption and sales volumes at retail level are down in the past two years.  In addition, there has been a disconnect between what I mentioned earlier, namely, developments in farm gate price and developments in retail price.  I have considered this issue in two ways.  If one takes the Central Statistics Office's agricultural output price index and its consumer price index since 2006 when that base period was set, the beef consumer price has moved by 8% while the farm gate or cattle price has moved by 35%.  The graphic in the middle of the slide on display shows the most recent two years, in which the blue line reflects what has happened at beef consumer price level, while the red line, which has moved on more considerably, reflects what has happened at farm gate level.  Consequently, there are pressures within the marketplace at present.</p><p> I will turn to Food Harvest 2020 itself and what it means for the beef sector.  The beef activation group that was formed just after the original report was produced sat for a short time, three months, and came up with a series of further refined recommendations that were perceived to be important to achieving the targets for the beef sector.  Briefly, the group considered the importance of the suckler herd as a bedrock of the beef sector and a platform from which much Irish beef is marketed, as well as the critical nature of the suckler cow welfare scheme to the aforementioned suckler herd.  It considered policy issues in respect of the CAP, as well as technical efficiency on-farm and I will revert to some of these issues briefly.  The closing of the gap with European prices was perceived to be important in respect of giving the confidence to move on and deliver on the growth targets.  It also identified the quality payment system and the role it has played in rewarding quality and I have appeared before the joint committee to discuss that issue in the past.  It also identified areas of young bull production, on which I will touch and which may have been something of a newer development in the Irish beef sector, as well as setting important recommendations on breeding and the progress that can be made from the breeding side.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane Dempsey" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012100900013#P00300"><p>I wish to describe the consumer food sector, the ambitious goals set out in Food Harvest 2020 for the sector and the challenges, some of which have been mentioned, that consumer food companies face in achieving these targets.  Essentially, prepared consumer food companies produce the products that are to be found in the middle aisles of the supermarket.  They cover a series of categories including beverages, ambient, confectionary, cereals, ready-meals and other convenience foods.</p><p>  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy states that the continued development of value added foods on the home and international markets is key to delivering a sustainable agrifood economy.  The idea is that the stronger the cadre of consumer food companies we can create over the next decade, the more value we can retain from the projected output increases of the dairy and meat sectors envisaged in Food Harvest 2020.  In addition, because the sector processes a great deal of our domestic raw materials, it supports wealth and employment across communities and towns throughout the country.  Our goal must be to take the vibrant SMEs and consumer food companies and create some more international companies and many more exporting companies.  That behoves the Government to ensure that conditions are right in the domestic economy to facilitate this growth.</p><p>  The slide shown here will give members a sense of the diversity of the companies within the consumer food sector.  They will note some of the globe's leading food brands alongside Ireland's most well known brands and food companies.  In addition, Ireland has a thriving artisan and food micro-enterprise culture.  These are prepared consumer food companies and they provide huge growth potential for the future.  The commonality between all these companies is the domestic grocery sector and be they international or artisan companies, they require a healthy grocery sector.  Indigenous companies use the sector as a springboard for export growth, as my colleague, Paul Kelly, said.  Equally, the Irish offices of global companies such as Mars, Nestl&eacute; and Coca-Cola also require a healthy sector to generate the sales required to retain investment in jobs in Ireland similar to the investment we talked about in regard to the Kerry Group earlier.</p><p>  This sector, like many others, is suffering greatly.  In 2008 when the downturn started to really bite and sterling depreciated by upwards of 20%, the sector underwent structural changes.  The FDII estimates that in the 2008 to 2009 period more than 3,000 jobs were lost in consumer foods.  In addition to those job losses, we saw a further downsizing of the footprint of international food companies here and the pressure in the sector remains intense.  Consumer sentiment is down and when it is down prepared foods companies suffer greatly.</p><p>  The third slide outlines the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and how it envisages that prepared consumer food companies will contribute to the ambitious targets within a sector that is called the value-added food and beverage sector.  This category includes four main pillars, namely, the infant formula, functional foods, beverages and prepared consumer foods.  The strategy predicts that this cohort will achieve a growth of around 40% working off a 2008 baseline.  We in the Consumer Foods Council have worked to identify and put figures around the consumer food sector but it is a diverse and dispersed sector.  The figures we have come up with we believe understate the strength of the sector and members will note it boasts 265 companies, employs 12,500 people, has a gross output of almost &euro;9 billion and exports of &euro;1.4 billion.  It is quite a strong sector and has a good solid base to build a sustainable agri-economy, as envisaged in Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  In 2011, the Consumer Foods Council, at the request of the Department of Agriculture Food and Marine's high level implementation committee, sought to establish deliverables specifically for the prepared consumer foods sector and they are outlined on the slide.  Those are a 40% increase in output, employment growth of 3,000 net and a 2% increase in business expenditure on research and development.  We believe those targets are achievable on the condition that Government and State agencies work with industry to deliver a number of policy interventions in the short term.  For me, the success of Food Harvest 2020 should be measured by the number of food SMEs we can transform over the next decade into international companies of scale with diversified export markets and internationally recognised brands.  That should be measurement.</p><p>  The key Government action required if we are to achieve the vision set out in the Food Harvest 2020 is that the Government needs to support the sector by providing access to finance for food companies.  Simply put, there is a market failure in the provision of access to finance for prepared consumer food companies.  Due to the traditionally longer term returns from investment in food companies, sources of finance such as venture capital are not available to food companies.  That in addition to the general lack of available credit, which every sector is experiencing, means that finance is not available for companies willing and trying to expand.  </p><p>  The FDII believes that a sector specific development fund should be established by Government.  There are approximately 70 State-run development funds at present but the majority of them are sector specific and focused on technology and high technology sectors.  None is focused specifically on food.  If we are serious about food and building a sustainable agri-economy, the Government should establish this fund and insist that existing and upcoming development funds have food industry expertise and that they are incentivised to invest in food companies.  In addition to supplement these actions, a strong suite of personal taxation incentives should be put in place to increase investment in food companies, and I can outline those at a later date if the committee is interested. </p></speech>

He presented figures for the increase in beef prices to the consumer as opposed to cattle prices and said there was a deviation there.  Would he accept that the increase in cattle prices is from a very low base?  Mr. Healy says this disparity has been an issue since 2006.  Does he feel the farmgate price needs to drop further, considering it has been slipping back in recent times, or would he acknowledge the considerable gap between what the consumer pays and what the producer gets?</p><p>  I also thank Mr. Shane Dempsey for an interesting presentation.  He speaks about the importance of genuine collaboration with the industry on the obesity issue, and I accept his point about taxation.  Does he think there is not genuine collaboration at present?  What does he consider needs to be done in this area?</p></speech>

However, I heard most of the presentations.</p><p>  One of the targets of Food Harvest 2020 is to produce an extra 2.75 billion litres of milk, which is a 50% increase in production.  Mr. Healy said that because of the constraints of the quota regime our milk production is now below the EU average.  How many more dairy cows will be needed to produce the extra 2.75 billion litres of milk?  Could I have an answer to that question before I ask the next one?</p></speech>

If the price of feed continues at the current rate, our expansion model will be one of more cows and low inputs.

Let us take the figure of 200,000 extra cows.  Unless we go into genetics and all the calves are one sex, there will be 100,000 extra dairy male animals.  How will that fit into the production of beef and the 40% increase in production?  I have a fear about quotas disappearing in this country.  Mr. Barry expressed it with regard to the suckler herd, that we will see a major decrease in that herd.  Land is a finite resource.  If it is lucrative to go into milk production, although nobody can predict what the world market will be, will we see a drive to stock every piece of land that comes on the market with black and white breeds, to the detriment of the suckler herd?  I mean no disrespect to Holstein or black and white breeds.  There could be an extra 100,000 male dairy-type animals coming into the beef herd.  How will we achieve our targets for 2020 if that happens?</p></speech>

I am amazed that the figure for Germany is only 15,000 tonnes.  I thought Germany was one of our major competitors.  Does the 90% include live export of animals or is the value for beef carcass or finished product included?</p><p>  Deputy Heydon raised a point.  This is a public forum and what is said is on the public record.  Mr. Barry produced a slide showing that finished cattle prices are up by 70% from 2001 to 2012, with a more than 30% increase in two years.  Deputy Heydon raised the issue of the base from which they were increasing.  One has often heard the phrase, "Lies, damned lies and statistics".  We can all produce statistics to prove anything.  I can produce statistics.  With regard to the 70%, one could say there was only a 35% increase in the nine years prior to 2010.  That is a statistic.  I remember farmers, and I was one of them, demonstrating outside meat factories about the price they were being paid for beef.  That was in the last ten years.  It proves that the base price the statistic is coming from is very low.  Mr. Barry says we are closing the gap on the EU average.  We might be closing that gap but we still have one of the lowest prices per kilo of beef in the EU.</p><p>  The slide Mr. Barry produced relates to price increases.  I would like to see the slide relating to the cost base and how every industry's cost base has increased.  Over the last five or six years the input costs in farming have been enormous in the context of that increase.  Perhaps I should have left this meeting and gone to get the information on how much the inputs of farmers have increased.  It is unfair to put it on the public record that the price of beef has risen by 70% over 11 years, with a 35% increase over the last two years, without also referring to the fact that costs have also risen by nearly an equal amount.</p></speech>

However, beef production is at a crossroads at present.  Perhaps I am being pessimistic, but a bubble has been created.  The costs now are quite prohibitive.  If a farmer goes to the sales tomorrow morning to buy replacements, he or she will have to pay a substantial amount of money to replace what he or she might have sold.  There are also the input costs afterwards which, as has been mentioned, are prohibitive.  This is a disincentive towards achieving the hoped for 40% increase in production under Food Harvest 2020.  I might be pessimistic in that regard.  The price increase is welcome but it is coming from a low base.  It is a fact, however, that the cost of production is coming from a higher base now than previously discussed.  As mentioned earlier in respect of dairying, the cost of feeding this winter will be enormous compared with previous years.  Any kind of feed is more than &euro;300 per tonne, which is very serious.  I believe beef production will be reduced rather than increased because of this situation.  What are the witnesses' opinions on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012100900015#R01300"><p>I apologise to Mr. Healy for having to step out and miss his presentation.  When he talked about the beef sector he did not talk about inputs.  I do not know whether that is relevant.  I know how hard it is to try to decide which parts to discuss, but in the interests of setting the record straight about what is happening in the industry, it might be useful to shed some light on that.</p><p>  My colleague, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, asked me to convey her apologies for her absence but she asked me to ask a question about the fair trade legislation.  It is probably best directed to Mr. Dempsey.  She asked what that legislation might comprise.  Mr. Dempsey gave us quite a clear picture of that.  Could his notes or presentation be made available, in light of the fact that some members of the committee are not present?  The slides are available but the witness obviously elaborated, so would that be possible?  Some of what he said is challenging and interesting.  Senator O'Brien wanted to know if Mr. Dempsey's organisation would be conducting a detailed briefing in advance of the grocery competition authority legislation this term.  She also wanted to know why the Lily O'Brien's logo was missing from the slide.  As she said: "Never miss an opportunity for a plug."  Who could blame her?</p><p>  The issue I wish to raise with Mr. Dempsey is obesity.  Clearly, it is an issue that will tax all of us over the coming years.  He is right to say it is a complex issue.  In many ways, that word could also be taken to mean that the things being offered as solutions, such as a fat tax, sugar tax and so forth, are not attractive to the industry.  His default position is, therefore, that it is a complex issue: "We do not like that solution so we will call it complex and wait for a different solution that suits us better."  It is something on which every side, including the political one, will have to collaborate.  I accept that.  However, there has been a great deal of evidence to show that some taxes work.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Healy" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012100900016#S00400"><p>I will try to go through all the questions.  First, Deputy Heydon made some comments about the interaction between farm gate price movements and the retail price and asked me whether I felt, from an industry perspective, that farm gate prices had to fall further because of the aforementioned disconnect.  I showed the trend on both price lines in the context that we are in a difficult climate.  There are difficult economic situations, austerity measures, etc., within many of the marketplaces in Europe into which we are selling and consequently, there is pressure on price.  It is not that market prices can increase indefinitely, as one must bear in mind the external factors.  In response to the Deputy's question, I do not believe that farm gate price must come back but it is a factor that market price cannot continue to increase without taking account of marketplace realities.  Apart from the economic downturn, the other major pressure one meets going into the marketplace - this has been discussed at length previously - is retail power.  One of our strong points, in terms of future sustainability for our current market reach, is that we are servicing the retail sector, that is, to consumers and the top retailers.  Nevertheless, as this joint committee has heard, there are challenges in dealing with retailers and in trying to press through price increases that are needed.</p><p>  In touching on some of Senator O'Neill's points, I do not for one moment discount or ignore the fact that input costs have increased.  Equally, my brief at this meeting is to outline what has happened in the beef processing sector over the years.  It is very easy to throw mud at something but it is important to note - as I tried to encapsulate in some of the slides - there has been a significant transformation in the sector over the past decade.  It has moved from a lower-priced commodity frozen base to one of which we now should be proud, involving top-quality fresh Irish beef going to European consumers.  Moreover, this is a sustainable transformation because that market exists and in the context of so doing, although one does not often hear about it, there has been significant price movement.  While I accept that input costs have also unquestionably increased for producers, in response I note we also must focus on on-farm productivity and technical efficiency.  There are areas in this regard where progress can be made.  Several of the larger processors in the industry have been involved in a scheme with Teagasc and the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, namely, the Better Beef Farms programme.  These farms have shown the kind of improved gross margin that can be achieved by a focus on usage, on maximising the usage of grass, by increasing output and keeping a handle on cost.  It is also in our interest that farmers make such progress and improve the bottom line.</p><p>  A point was made about the target and whether the 40% was achievable.  One point I wish to clarify is the target is in respect of growth in value output and not purely in terms of volume growth.  It does not suggest a 40% growth in volume.  Mr. Michael Barry can come in on this but the dairy sector is contemplating a volume increase of 50%, while the beef sector targets pertains to a value of output increase.  Consequently, it is a combination of price increase, the value of our actual product, as well as the premiumisation of Irish beef sales, in addition to some increase in volume.  This leads me to Senator O'Neill's observations on the 100,000 dairy male calves.  There will be that number, if not more.  I believe Mr. Michael Barry referred to approximately 200,000 extra cows and there probably will be that increase in any event.  Processors are already working with Teagasc and farmer groups to study different production systems to identify what will best fit an increased volume of black-and-white animals in the country and what will best get those to market.  The aim is to identify at what age and what will work for us in terms of a sustainable production system in the future with a view to retaining those animals in Ireland, to processing them here and to providing the jobs required to process them.</p><p>  Mr. Michael Barry can intervene in this regard but not every farmer in Ireland will be milking cows after 2015 and not every acre of land in Ireland will be suitable for dairying.  The Senator made the point that every piece of land that comes up will go the dairy route.  However, there are logistical issues in this regard in respect of fragmentation of land and land parcels.  The dairy man will want the land next door, as opposed to several miles down the road.  In that context, we are confident there is and will continue to be a significant beef sector in Ireland.  Moreover, we believe there can be significant suckler cow numbers.  There will be a challenge and we must see how this all plays out.  There will be an increase in dairy cow numbers but equally, we believe this does not need to be at the expense of suckler beef output.</p><p>  I again refer to some of the progress regarding efficiency that can be made on farms.  If I may take up another point, the Irish finished cattle beef price is not the lowest or indeed one of the lowest in Europe, it is one of the highest.  For much of this year, the Irish finished cattle beef price was running in excess of 100% and up to 107% or 108% of the European average beef price.</p></speech>

I do not want to cut the witnesses short nor do I want to delay them for 15 minutes to respond to a few questions.  Mr. Barry wants to come in briefly.  I will then call Mr. Dempsey.  We will try to get through the questions if that is possible.  I do not want to rush the witnesses but if they are happy enough, we will continue.</p></speech>

Some 15 or 20 years ago, Ireland was dependent on imported genetics.  We have now become a world leader in genetics and the world of sexed semen is now a commercial reality.  There is a tremendous opportunity there.  We will see a decline in dairy farm numbers and a new activity which will open up in the coming years is contract rearing of dairy herd replacements.  That will be a critical opportunity and a very interesting enterprise for farmers.  There are good opportunities there and again it is a positive outlook.</p></speech>

A policy objective is created and the food industry is brought in to comment on it.  It is not part of an overall coherent whole of society approach to deal with the complexity to which I will address shortly.  We are trying to establish a collaborative platform with the Department of Health and with the Government.  Industry and FDII members have committed to putting significant resources into research and other initiatives, including reformulation to address the obesity issue wherever they can.</p><p>  We have seen the impact of the BAI's advertising regime.  Taxation will be another disaster if it is brought in.  We ask to be brought into the process earlier.  We have bona fides and have done a huge amount in terms of reformulation.  Some 80% of my members have reformulated.  They have spent millions of euro on that and on a producing healthier, or as it is termed "better for you" products and variants.  They have essentially removed transfat from all their products.  The salt reduction programme is considered a huge success by the FSAI.  Individually, they spend millions of euro supporting healthier initiatives.  We have bona fides there.</p><p>  We are asking to be brought into the process earlier.  We can help to create health policies that achieve health objectives without damaging the competitiveness.  We are asking for a responsibility-type deal which members might have seen in the UK, or a version of that.</p><p>  I would say to Senator O'Keeffe that we would be delighted to utilise the Lily O'Brien's logo.

If one takes the example of a 10% tax, due to the market, the conditions in the market and retailer buying power, the economists believe one may get a 7% increase in price to the consumer.  That may or may not be passed on to the consumer by the retailer; they will set the price.  The products in question may be offered in deals, so the consumer feels no different.  If it is passed through at a full 10%, one may get substitution effects where certain people pick different products or replace or downgrade on brands for lower quality products.  In terms of complexity, if the price is too high, one may drive black market and cross-Border shopping.  That leads to economic damage and job losses.  Job losses and long-term unemployment are also a predictor for obesity and other non-communicable diseases.  Overarching all of that, 60% of people do not drink soft drinks.</p><p>  There is huge complexity.  We need to bring everybody into the room at the outset to create a whole of society response.  That is not view asserted by the industry but by the WHO, the CMO himself and other individuals.</p><p>  In regard to fair trade legislation and a briefing, we would be happy to do that and to talk to any groups.</p></speech>

The meeting has been very informative and thought-provoking.  Next week, Bord Bia and the Irish Dairy Board will attend the committee.  The farm organisations have been in attendance.  I see a common sense of purpose between the producers and the processors in fighting the distortion in the market.  It has been a common theme in all four presentations.  It gives an extra sense of purpose to our advocacy as parliamentarians to have that code of practice brought in on a statutory basis.</p><p>  The committee has highlighted the obvious collision course between climate change objectives and Food Harvest 2020.  We must look at the statistics, the one in eight versus the one in eight in heavy steel production.   Our statistics nationally from agricultural output will be skewed heavily.  I refer to the 20% under production, or under EU average, which is probably 30% under production given that we can produce more within the existing herd, which does not mean any greater output of greenhouse gas emissions.  There is much information here which we intend to bring, by way of a report, including our findings on the whole process, to the Minister.  We would be happy to submit it the witnesses.

I thank the witnesses for their attendance.</p><p>  In commencing proceedings I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by this committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise that the opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>  Before I call Dr. Kelly to make her presentation I wish to say that the decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la play an important role in Irish life; they affect every townland and are of interest to everybody.  They are often controversial and result in much debate, as was very much the case in Cork city last evening.  Therefore, we are very interested in what the witnesses have to say.  I thank them for attending and invite Dr. Mary Kelly to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.563" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Kelly" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012100900004#H00300"><p>We have gone through the introductions already.  I am accompanied by Mr. Conall Boland, deputy chairman of An Plean&aacute;la, Mr. Des Johnston, director of planning, Mr. Gerry Egan, director of corporate affairs, and Mr. Chris Clarke, secretary to the board.  I have been the chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la since 29 August 2011.  While the annual report is under my guardianship, I was not in An Bord Plean&aacute;la for full period it covers.</p><p>  I have a PowerPoint presentation, as I find it easier to talk about figures and have a few graphs to show members, and I also have an opening statement.  I will begin by giving a brief introduction to the mandate; the development of the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la over the years; some new functions that have been given to us; the annual report and the results of it; and the decision-making processes, which will probably cover the entire presentation because that is what the committee asked me to discuss.  I will then be happy to answer any questions, along with my colleagues.</p><p>  On the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, we are responsible for the determination of planning appeals under the Planning and Development Acts, compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities, the determination of appeals under the water and air pollution Acts and the Building Control Act, and the determination of strategic infrastructure applications, including local authority projects.  In addition, we have been given a number of other functions recently with regard to quarries and substitute consents and have some expanded functions under the Planning and Development Acts.  </p><p>  In terms of resources and staffing, the board, like all public sector agencies, must carry on with fewer resources than we had previously.  Under the Act, it is envisaged there will be a chairman and up to nine ordinary members.  Currently there is a chairman - myself - and seven ordinary board members.  In terms of staff, in 2008 we had 182 staff, including board members.  The employment control framework number for 2012 will bring that down to 146 by the end of the year; that is the number we have to achieve by the end of the year and we are very well advanced in terms of achieving that.  That will represent a reduction of 20% in staffing over that time.  During the Celtic tiger years we used the services of many fee-per-case inspectors but that has now been discontinued completely.  We do not outsource any of our inspections any more.  We also had the retirement of a significant number of senior staff in February 2011.  The graph displayed shows the total income better than I can by describing it.   </p><p>  Members will note that there has been a big decrease from 2008 to 2011, with the fall being gradual from 2009 to 2011, in the income received by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The green segment of the bars on the chart represents strategic infrastructure.  There was a good deal of that being done in 2008 but little in 2009, and very little fee income was derived from it.  It has held up reasonably well in 2010 and 2011, when there were a number of big projects.  The blue segment in the bars on the chart shows the Exchequer grant, while the red segment represents ordinary appeal fees.  Members can note that our income is composed of the sum of those three elements.</p><p>  Turning to our expenditure, members will note from the next graph the trend in the fall of salaries from 2008 to 2011.  Legal costs are represented in the purple segment.  We are price takers in terms of legal costs.  We do not take cases.  People take judicial reviews against decisions of the board and we have to pay for our legal representation in that respect.  We outsource our legal representation.  The orange segment represents other operating costs - that is, the ordinary costs of running the organisation - which have reduced dramatically over the last number of years.  In terms of our expenditure from 2007 to 2011 - members will be able to follow this better on the trend charts - the total expenditure is down and non-pay expenditure is down, while pay expenditure went up a little at the end of 2011; that was related to retirements.  A number of very senior people left the organisation at that stage.</p><p>  Moving on to planning appeals, normal appeals against planning authority decisions constitute a significant proportion of the work of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, representing 84% of all cases in 2011.</p></speech>

In regard to the seven ordinary members of the board, is it necessary to achieve a balance across representative sectors?  I am concerned that the quorum is two members.  Is it possible to achieve a balance when only two members are present?  I take Dr. Kelly's point in regard to the inspectors' reports, the directions and the orders because I frequently end up reading them.  Sometimes, however, it is difficult to figure out why a decision was made where an inspector has, for example, strongly recommended a refusal on an application that the board decides to grant permission.  How does the board respond when an inspector strongly recommends a refusal?</p><p>  Does strategic infrastructure include any type of industrial development or does it only include public infrastructure?  I ask Dr. Kelly in the hope she can tell me off the top of her head because I would otherwise have to go back to the Act.</p><p>  Does the board shop around for legal representation?  In regard to the cost of running the board, I note its lease expired but the difference in the cost was not large.  Perhaps it is a year ahead but was a reduction sought on the rent?  There is clearly an abundance of office space and it is currently possible to negotiate savings from a position of strength.</p><p>  The 31% figure for reversals appears to vary according to different parts of the country.  I presume decisions are broken down by category but County Leitrim had a reversal rate of 75% compared to 21% in the area that I represent, Kildare.  Do these figures represent one-off houses?</p><p>  In regard to higher density developments along public transportation corridors, there is a clear need to link land use and transportation planning so that public transport can function in a financially sustainable way.  Where do market forces come into play?  Are decisions determined by the national spatial strategy?  I presume the National Transportation Authority has a role in developing strategies.</p><p>  Would an online planning application system help significantly in allowing the board to function more effectively?  I often find it quite difficult to decipher scales of maps and similar images.  Is there a limit on that and would Dr. Kelly recommend changes in an ideal world?</p></speech>

The way in which the board is appointed is set out in the Planning and Development Acts.  The chairperson is appointed through public competition and the remaining members are appointed by the Minister after being recommended by nominating bodies which are specifically organised to represent various sectors.  I am satisfied there is a good balance across sectors in our membership.  Most of the members of the board have worked in the private sector at some point in the past.  Members represent different geographic locations as well as different types of expertise.  We have a number of engineers and planners, an architect and people from Cork, Limerick and Dublin.</p><p>  In regard to the quorum of two, the planning and development legislation originally specified a quorum of three but this was amended in 2010 or 2011 to allow for two members due to a way of increasing throughput in decision making.  The Acts set out the types of cases that two people can adjudicate and are quite restrictive.</p></speech>

We are looking at what we are going to do there.  We do not have our own in-house solicitors; we use an external firm.  They are expert in planning law and are successful for us.  We have to look at whether we need to tender that work.</p><p>  With regard to variance by part of the country, I refer to the appendices.  One has to be careful about how one interprets the chart, as it can be misleading, because while 75% of decisions were overturned in County Leitrim, only six applications had been made and, therefore, in other counties where there are larger numbers of applications, the percentage evens out.  We do not draw big conclusions from that.</p><p>  Land use and transportation are big.  Decisions are made on the basis of zoning in terms of residential and higher density.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about online planning applications.  The board does not have the facility to do this, although most of the local authorities do at this stage.  We are in the process of completing a needs and feasibility study and we hope if we get funding for it to put in a new system that will allow us to do that.  It would be more effective and efficient.  One will probably always need a set of physical maps but, nevertheless, one can do a lot on a computer screen.  One can also employ geographical information systems and make one's processing more automated and efficient.</p><p>  On the strategic infrastructure development, we require everybody applying for that to set up their own website with the planning application and all the documentation on that which would mean anything that comes in a complex case can be viewed through that even though it is not the An Bord Plean&aacute;la website.</p></speech>

It moved there in 2002.  It is in a contractual situation with the landlord of the premises.  That contractual situation also includes upward only rent review on the lease.  We have been in discussions with the landlord over the past few years, in particular, given the market situation but the lease terms have not reduced from where they have been in recent years because the landlord has indicated to us that the contractual situation obliges us to maintain the lease at that rate.  The landlord does not appear to be amenable to reducing the lease below that at this point in time.</p></speech>

We have a periodic rent review, which is, I think, every three years.  Again, I can confirm those figures.</p></speech>

Effectively, the landlord is telling us he wants to maintain the terms.  It has not gone up, in fairness, but it has not gone down.  I will confirm the figures.</p></speech>

I refer to the time it takes the board to make decisions.  I acknowledge Dr. Kelly explained the background but, generally, the delays are unacceptable.  This hinges on two factors.  We have a liberal regime in the context of third party appeals.</p> <p>Someone in County Wexford can complain about something in County Mayo provided that he or she ticks the boxes, which is not insurmountable.  In the interests of justice for the applicant, the application should be handled as expeditiously as possible.</p><p> Much of Government policy is tailor-made to encourage development and investment, integral to which is planning.  Local authorities are being asked to deal with people in a businesslike manner, that is, taking account of the needs of business.</p></speech>

I will also refer to larger projects, given the fact that we are trying to develop transmission lines.  Support or reorganisation might be necessary.  When planning is thrown into the mix, the sector often becomes too precarious for private investors.  They do not know for how long they will be waiting.  Time is money.  The process frustrates applicants.</p><p>  In my town, a potential commercial development might see a fast food business receiving planning permission if An Bord Plean&aacute;la sees fit, but those involved have been waiting since January.  It is a strategic development.  More needs to be done, be it in terms of making additional resources available or reorganising the process.  The situation is having an adverse impact on commercial ventures that require planning permission.</p></speech>

The board moves the goalposts when a decision on an application is being appealed.  The board tries to redesign the scheme.  In my town, the board liaised directly with applicants concerning certain housing developments instead of judging what was before it.  This practice is not welcome, as it removes the public from the process and could result in the board granting planning permission for developments that differ from those outlined in the applications.  Interested third parties do not see and are not given a chance to comment on the redesigned developments.  I would question this seemingly inappropriate practice.</p><p>  As far as development is concerned, we are on ground zero compared with the Celtic tiger years and the push for zoning.  This is not necessarily the board's remit, but I would be interested in the witnesses' opinions.  A farmer down a road might have land that suddenly increases in value because it is rezoned.  The local authority bestows the land's value on the farmer.  Could this process be re-examined?  If a local authority intended to rezone land for commercial purposes, for example, and acquired the land before rezoning it, the authority could sell it later.  Rather than a private individual, the authority would get the value of the rezoning.</p></speech>

I have shown the committee the graph outlining the length of time taken to make decisions.  We are not making all decisions within the statutory objective timeframe.  Many of the delayed decisions either require oral hearings or are complex - for example, energy projects.  It is not possible to make determinations on many strategic infrastructure developments, SIDs, within the 18-week period. The pre-application consultation is done at the behest of the applicant and it is for the applicant to declare when to close it.  If the applicant does not close it within 18 weeks, time has run out.  This does not always happen, but it occurs in the case of large projects.  For commercial reasons, applicants choose to keep their applications live and the pre-application procedures open.</p><p>  I have explained that the bottleneck is and always will be at board level.  The board must make the decisions, as no one else in the organisation can.  The time taken is dependent on the number of board members appointed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Currently, we have seven board members and the chairperson.  We will return to the 90% level towards the middle of next year, but we will not achieve it this year, given the backlog.  We do our best to prioritise cases when they are received.  This results in some applications being deprioritised, which does not suit everyone.  We have a major infrastructure appeals case list and an application must meet certain criteria to be put onto it.  For example, if there is the potential to create employment, we will deal with the application as quickly as we can.  Included in this category are schools, hospitals and nursing homes.</p></speech>

Many of the sub-threshold SIDs to which the Deputy alluded would be included.  Our filtering system prioritises that type of case, namely, anything that could create employment.  There are a number of other criteria.  I cannot comment on any particular case.</p><p>  The Deputy claimed that the board moved goalposts and redesigned schemes.  There are two ways to view this.  Frequently, the board believes that a scheme is unacceptable as presented.  The easy solution would be to refuse it permission.  A more complicated solution is to write to the applicant and explain that we might look more favourably on the application if the development is redesigned along certain lines.  We will not say that permission will be granted.  Asking for a redesign is the better approach, which is the feedback we have received from the development community.  I am unsure as to what the Deputy is referring to.  If a scheme is changed, we generally require the developer to readvertise its terms and circulate the redesign to third parties.  We hear from third parties concerning their opinions of new schemes.  As far as I am aware, we do not usually redesign a scheme without giving someone a chance to have a say on it.</p><p>  I do not have much to say about zoning.  The Deputy's suggestion would be a different way of operating.  The board has no role to play in that regard.  As I have not given consideration to the suggestion, I will need to examine it.</p></speech>

Later, I will talk about judicial reviews.  The board is supposed to make decisions within a statutory objective period of 18 weeks.  In the 2004-05 period, just prior to the peak of the property bubble, the board's success rate in this regard was 85%.  While the bubble was collapsing, the success rate was collapsing to 23%.  According to the 2011 figures, the rate is 81%.  However, planning applications have decreased at local authority level, as has the number of appeals.  The inconsistency across councils remains the same, yet the amount of work coming across the board's desk is less.</p><p>  In 2010, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, attended this committee and made a great announcement about seconding local planning officers to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to help with the backlog.</p></speech>

In 2011, when we had a full complement of eight board members, including the chairman, we reached 81% at the end of the year.  We were heading towards the 90% objective at that point.  With a board with those numbers, we can do that again.  The fact that we were down to half the board for about six months of the year meant we could only have one meeting at a time.  At the moment, we are running two meetings every morning with three people each and three meetings some mornings with two people each, depending on how that two-person board works out.  Since all the cases must go through the board, that is where the bottleneck occurs.  Now that I have a full board again, we can get back up to-----</p></speech>

A slight backlog has built up.  We call it a backlog.  We were down to having 750 cases on hand, which was the lowest for many years.  The processing sections and the inspectorate are getting through the work on time.  A bottleneck is appearing because there were not enough people at board level to make determinations.

When we meet with Dr. Kelly next year, we hope to see the board moving well past the 90% figure if it is operating at an optimum level.

I have benchmarked this figure against the UK, including Scotland and Northern Ireland.  They have all set themselves a strategic objective for their organisations of 80%.

Based on the current variables with regard to appeals coming in and the number of staff, Dr. Kelly is telling us that the difficulty in freeing up that bottleneck lies in the staffing of the board, that there is a bottleneck as opposed to a backlog and that if the board has its optimum number of meetings over the next 12 months, it would be able to hit its optimum figure of around 90%.</p></speech>

I will take up where the Chairman left off.  It seems the trend is downwards.  There is a quite obvious downward trend with regard to the number of planning appeals received by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The target of 90% should have been achieved by now.  I am a bit baffled by that.</p><p>  What are Dr. Kelly's views regarding the efforts made by local authorities across the country to put in place guidelines assisting planning decisions in respect of wind energy and wind turbines?  In some counties, a full policy document has been adopted, while in others, there are guidelines in respect of distances.  In Donegal, there was a proposed distance guideline of 1 km, which was defeated.  I do not know whether it was through An Bord Plean&aacute;la or in court in recent times.  Local authorities spent much time putting guideline documents in place.  What cognisance, if any, does An Bord Plean&aacute;la take of these guidelines when making its decisions?  Where does it see this guideline issue going?  If we are to believe what we are being told, we are to double the number of wind turbines between now and 2020.  From the board's own reports and website, I see that it has approved 66% of what came to it by way of appeal on wind turbines.  Could Dr. Kelly outline why the board approved 66% and refused 33% of these appeals?  </p><p>  Dr. Kelly stated that the board had received 805 notices in respect of quarries.  I presume they are queries of some shape or form.  The board has dealt with 325 of these to date.  From talking to staff in local authorities, I know they are extremely frustrated that decisions on these are not coming out fast enough.  There have been no discussions between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the staff of local authorities on how staff should interpret section 261(A) of the legislation.  What proactive work does the board do when new legislation appears to consult with local authorities so there is no mix-up in the interpretation with regard to decisions pertaining to this legislation?  It seems amazing that we are dealing with planning legislation, primarily the Planning and Development Act (Amendment) 2010, yet the board overturns 30% of decisions made by local authorities.  It should be pretty clear that the legislation is there and the local authority adheres to this in making its decision.  Yet in one in every three cases adjudicated by the board, it overturns the decision of the local authority.  I am a bit concerned about that and would like some clarity.  </p><p>  My final point concerns communication by the board as an adjudicating board on decisions made by local authorities.  It does not appear to have any liaison with them or have any communications on new legislation.  As a layperson, I would have thought that when legislation appears, they are the first port of call for the applicant and the board would give them clear guidance as to how it interprets that legislation.  A local authority that is well known to the Chairman - I will not name it - voted 27 to nil against a material contravention and the board overturned the decision of the local authority members.</p></speech>

We find them very helpful in delineating the parts of the county where wind turbines are acceptable and where they are absolutely unacceptable.  Many counties have a large part designated as "may be acceptable", which involves considerable interpretation.  However, the board uses them all the time when considering wind energy.  Part of an inspector's report will always outline the local authority's strategy and how proposal fits within it.</p><p>  There have been ministerial guidelines on wind energy - I believe since 2007 - and we have to take them into account.  As I said in my presentation, the board needs to balance all these things out.  I am not aware of the board having decided anything about distances of 1 km in the Donegal case the Senator mentioned.  When appeals come to us, as a quasi-judicial body we need to consider both sides.  We need to look at the developer's proposal and the appeal made by any third party.  Each case is different.  Very often with wind energy projects, many residents who feel that noise, shadow flicker and various disamenities that come with being close to a wind turbine would be extremely onerous on them.  We need to balance that against the submission of somebody who wants to develop a wind farm.</p><p>  Regarding overturning planning authorities' decisions in this area, our decision making is the same as with any other appeal.  We need to give a very good reason for overturning them.  I cannot give a general answer because each case is specific - I am not trying to avoid answering the question.  The issue can relate to a visual amenity, a residential amenity or proximity to an SAC.  There is always a specific reason for rejecting any development and wind farms are no different from any other development in that regard.</p></speech>

I was trying to deal with the wind energy projects.  On quarries, the Department has a function as defined in legislation.  We have participated in many seminars and meetings on quarries under the aegis of the Department.  We are in the process of organising an open day seminar for quarry proposers later this month.  There is no mandate for us in the Acts to have a communications role and as a quasi-judicial body we must remain independent.  We cannot tell people they will get permission if they do X, Y and Z when we know that third parties can come in and very often raise very important points which we must take into account at that stage.  It is difficult to engage like that.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is really the body that is charged with developing the legislation and explaining that legislation to people including to us and we have participated in quite a number of those.</p><p>  I am not aware of the case which is the subject of the Senator's last question.

Many people have asked questions about wind farms and I will not go back over that.  I have a question on proposed ESB and EirGrid projects for the west coast.  Are the existing guidelines for keeping away from schools, housing estates and places where people gather still important to An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Those in County Clare would have much to say about how the lines were erected there and I am concerned about the same issue in County Galway.  I have no complaints about what is happening and what I think is happening, but in County Clare people still talk about serious illness regarding schools.</p><p>  While I very much welcome what is happening with retail development, there are some concerns about out-of-town developments.  Are there cases where developers and those with objections are very close together on parking and park and ride facilities?  In some cases individuals, communities and bodies such as an Taisce have been advised to withdraw their objections or else there will be no further progress.  I would hope it would be possible to get people together to discuss these issues and ascertain if retail development can blend in a town centre rather than always having it outside a town.</p></speech>

We are aware that there are pre-application consultations on energy projects on the west coast - we do not have that before us at the moment.  There are no mandatory distances from schools, hospitals, etc.  However, from the proper planning of that kind of infrastructure, we would do our best to ensure those projects are done according to proper planning and sustainable development.  That would entail having proper consultations with people and ensuring having the least disamenity if there must be a disamenity to people.  We are very conscious of that with energy projects.</p><p>  There are many energy projects at the moment because of the strengthening of the grid.  Everybody from a development and ordinary point of view wants to have the grid strengthened in order to bring industry in and to allow wind energy on to the grid.  On the other hand many people do not want wires or pylons near them and a balance needs to be struck.  We examine each case very carefully and try to move them as far away from houses as we can.  However, there is no mandatory requirement.  As the Deputy knows, the population is quite dispersed and it is very difficult to find anywhere with no houses.  I assure the Deputy that we try to do our best in that sense.</p><p>  From what I have seen since I joined the board just over a year ago, we are very careful to look at sequential development and to ensure where we can that retail development is in the town and that a logical sequence is followed.  I am not aware of too many out-of-town developments that have been approved recently.  In general, the board likes to see retail developments in towns where there is proper public transport and people can get to and fro.  Sometimes at oral hearings people are able to come to agreement when the proposer and the objectors talk.  That can be one of the advantages of having an oral hearing but sometimes there is no agreement between them.  I am not really aware of what the Deputy said about withdrawing objections.  We certainly have not seen many of them withdrawn - it is not a trend we have noticed.</p></speech>

I know the rates cannot be reduced man for man but will there be a further reduction because applications are going down?  A question was asked regarding quarries and I will not dwell on that.  However, there is the issue of disused quarries and change of use applications.  I presume this would come under the habitats directive and is similar to the quarries directive.</p><p>  The amending planning development Act made a change to the number of people who can make a decision and this system is being used to get rid of the backlog.  A local authority may have a planner, assistant planner, people involved with roads, housing and communities, and each department has an input.  How can two people on the board make a similar decision?  There must be criteria on how the decision is made.  Two people are making a decision where seven or eight people have made the decision before them.</p><p>  With regard to decisions confirmed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the best in the class was Kerry; I will not name the worst but it is in the report.  The reversed decisions are documented, including the best and worst offenders.  Does the board take note of the local authorities performing well and the criteria being used or those which are performing very badly?  There is a significant discrepancy.  Some 75% of the relevant decisions were reversed in one county and only 11% are reversed in another county.  A teacher in a classroom with pupil performance as diverse as that would pose the question of where the process is going wrong.</p><p>  The rate of reversal appears to be the same, more or less, every year.  There is the question of whether a certain mark has to be hit but I do not presume the board could operate in such a way.  The same question applies when we see the percentage of failures in a leaving or junior certificate or the number of pupils getting an A, B or C.  I would not expect the rate of reversal to come out the same every year, more or less, as there should be differences.</p><p>  The highest level of legal expenditure was in 2011 and it was even higher than it was in 2007.  As the number of developments has decreased, I would have expected this expenditure to have gone the other way.  I am only going on the information put on screen and I presume the figures are in the report.  I would like to see them and the reasons for the high expenditure.  The same applies to other expenditure figures.  We can consider pay expenditure compared to total expenditure and non-pay expenditure.  It has increased since 2007, although I would have expected it to go the other way.  Why is the number increasing?</p><p>  I will not dwell on pre-application consultations.</p></speech>

Pre-application consultations were mentioned by Deputy Mulherin and others and I agree with those comments.  Is the process universally applied across the country or are there differences between counties?  Everybody has the right to it but does the board notice in its study of applications that some counties do not have such meetings or only a few of them?  Perhaps the decisions are not as good as they should be if everybody had a pre-application consultation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.622" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012100900012#Q01000"><p>I welcome the delegation.  I compliment the inspectors for the courtesy they show, especially during oral hearings.  Over the past ten years I attended several of these and the professionalism shown by staff has been excellent.  The board should be very proud of the way they treat the public, especially people without expertise in planning.  They give time and consideration in hearing their viewpoint, which is very important.  In saying that, I may not have always agreed with the decisions made.</p><p>  Government policy is part of the decision and there are certain targets set by the Government.  Where is that balance in the process?  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is 15% self-financing but is there any reason this cannot be increased to 20% or 25%?  Is there any logical reason An Bord Plean&aacute;la cannot be more self-financing?  It has been mentioned that there has been a drop in the number of determinations by approximately 26%, with only a 6% drop in the budget.  It works out at about &euro;4,000 per case.  Are there other areas available between now and the end of next year where there can be further savings within the budget?  Salaries and allowances add up to approximately &euro;9.2 million.  I know there is a certain core cost in running An Bord Plean&aacute;la that cannot be dropped but could there be further savings on salaries, allowances and operational costs before the end of next year?</p></speech>

As Deputy Humphreys noted, this is a very professional staff which has given a very good service over the years, despite the impression given by timelines.  We hope to move the process along.</p><p>  The members asked about a further reduction in staff numbers.  Staff numbers have decreased by 20% since 2008, and at that time 50% of cases were being determined by fee per case inspectors.  We are not using that process at all now, so all the case work coming to us is being done by in-house inspectors.  It is not only that our staff numbers have decreased by 20% but we have also completely stopped using fee per case inspectors.  There were approximately 150 such inspectors on the books at various stages at the time, so a massive amount of work has been taken out.  That is why there has not been as significant a drop in our core staff.</p><p>  I do not foresee a further reduction in staff and I hope that will not be the case.  The employment control framework for 2012 required us to lose 16 staff between March and December and we have just about accomplished that.  It will probably be done by the end of the year.   We must consolidate at that point and I do not foresee any further losses.</p></speech>

Local authorities do not get the true cost of examining a large development planning permission application.  I am trying to differentiate between an extension to a house and a shopping centre or major housing estate development to get some type of reimbursement for the time and cost of examination.  The 15% on larger developments appears to be low.</p></speech>

However, there are still interested parties who would not be notified.  In my experience, adjoining landowners who had no objection to an initial application as it was presented to the planning authority and therefore did not object could find that where there was a substantial redesign they were not made aware of it.  There is not as much development taking place now but natural justice requires that adjoining landowners should be notified if there is a substantial redesign of a site as a result of negotiations between the board and applicants.  Otherwise they are not being given a chance to make a contribution or to note their concerns so that their interests can be fully taken into account.  They should be entitled to that.  Can the board do something about that?</p></speech>

We must decide if a change is material.  If it is, we require the developer to re-advertise the new development and we accept more submissions.  The Deputy clearly has a case in mind but from the point of view of the board we also feel that natural justice would not be served if there was a material change and somebody who did not object in the first place then discovers something completely different was being done.  To my knowledge, that does not happen in the board.  We decide if the change is material and then ask the developer to re-advertise what is effectively the new plan.  We give people a chance to come back with new submissions and we consider them.  That is our policy.</p></speech>

It is entitled to do that, but it puts the landowner out of the loop.  The board might decide it is not material but it could be argued that it is material and the landowner does not have the benefit of any notification.</p></speech>

I sit at board meetings every day where people discuss whether something should be re-advertised and generally the decision is to advertise.  Natural justice is taken into account every day at every meeting of the board.  I am surprised to hear Deputy's impression.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  One relates to the type of objection the board regularly receives.  Can she clarify whether there is a distinction between third party appeals and observers, or are they both the same?  Are there serial objectors?  It appears on occasion, particularly with regard to large infrastructure projects, that the same faces turn up to object, at least to my eye.  Is that something the board has encountered?</p><p>  In respect of strategic infrastructure development, can Dr. Kelly give a little more detail on how the pre-application consultation takes place and how the board reaches out to the community?   I sometimes feel the planning process is very academic for the ordinary person.  If a development is planned in an urban area, a planning application appears in a newspaper or in a newspaper in a different part of the country in a little advertisement that is discreetly placed where people are not meant to see it, but it is in a public place.  Does Dr. Kelly believe there is room for reaching out more to people?  In other countries, for example, I have seen lampposts carrying large signs asking people if they have any opinions on a development, even if the development is on the other side of the road.  People are actually invited to voice their opinion.  We have to get a balance but the system at present appears to be more weighted in an academic sense rather than reaching out to people.</p><p>  My other question relates to decisions that have been overturned.  How many of those relate to section 180, where perhaps the local authority would have made the decision against the recommendations of the planning office?</p><p>  My last question is about foreshore consents.  Does that just apply to coastal areas or is there any reference to inland waterways?  I live in the Shannon basin.  Is there a reference to that?</p></speech>

I and Senator Landy will ask a supplementary question afterwards.</p></speech>

Yes, we must take account of Government policy.  Obviously, the Government sets policy on various things.  How we do it is a very big question.  Let us take the wind energy example.  If the Government has a policy to be in favour of a particular thing, we will look more benevolently on it than if that is not the case.  We must have regard to the Government policy but that does not mean we must slavishly follow exactly what is in it.  We must consider it.  We must inform ourselves about what the policy is, what effect it would have on the development and whether the development fits into it.</p></speech>

I have been asked whether third parties have more rights than observers.  Yes they do and let me give an example of one key difference.  If a third party submits an appeal but then withdraws it, the observer has no more standing in the debate.  That is a stark example of the difference.  There are many other differences including what one is allowed to do at oral hearings.</p><p>  We cannot call anybody a serial objector.  We must take every objection as it comes.</p></speech>

In fairness An Bord Plean&aacute;la must treat every objection on its merits.  We do that.</p><p>  It is the case that Ireland has a very open planning system and it is much more open than most European countries.  Many European countries do not have any third party right of objection at all.  In the North, the UK and Scotland, there is no third party right.  The only people that can appeal to appeals board in those countries are the first party, the developer, the promoter of the project or whatever.  In many European countries the right of third parties does not exist either.  They may have other ways into the consultation process at an earlier stage.  In general we have an incredibly open planning system,</p><p>  In terms of outreach, I would need to have a look at what the Deputy is referring to.  It may very well be that the promoters are seeking submissions in terms of asking for people's views.  I would not know unless I had a look at the matter.  I can assure members that we have a very open system. </p><p>  On the question of foreshore, it does not extend to the River Shannon.  It is a foreshore high water mark and a low water mark.  Overturning section 180 is seldom done in cases where it is done at all.</p></speech>

Judicial reviews are prohibitively expensive, with the cost for an individual, an organisation, or a council running into hundreds of thousands of euro.  It is critical that An Bord Plean&aacute;la gets its decision right in the first instance.  When a council has refused planning permission on the grounds that the development would materially contravene the development plan, is there a significant difference between refusing planning permission on the grounds of materially contravening the development plan and contravening policies and objectives?</p></speech>

If the planning authority's letter of refusal states, "a material contravention", then the legislation requires An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as I set out earlier, to look at four specific criteria, the first of which is that the development must be strategically important.  I have the four criteria listed on the PowerPoint presentation.</p></speech>

Is there a possibility that an error could be made in terms of how the council worded its letter refusing the permission, in not adhering to the facts, that could facilitate a re-examination of the judgment by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, or does it have to go for a judicial review for that to be smoked out?</p></speech>

Cork City Council voted unanimously on a number of occasions with regard to a development in Cork city.  The application was refused by Cork City Council and the decision was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la gave a ruling that the development could go ahead.  I can see the reason that the development would go ahead because An Bord Plean&aacute;la operated on the basis that the development was possibly in contravention of policies and objectives but it looked at the greater good of the area.  However, in this case the planning application was an actual material contravention of the development plan.  It was not a contravention with regard to policies and objectives.</p></speech>

I do not want to talk about that particular case.  To speak in general terms, it may be that the board, under certain circumstances, would decide that it was not a material contravention, having examined the bigger picture.  That is open to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to do.  We may have decided that it was not a material contravention and therefore we could overcome it.  I cannot answer the Chairman on the specific case he raised.  I am not aware of that case.</p></speech>

A difficulty with that case is that the local authority would have to go for a judicial review, at a significant cost, to try to reverse the decision.  Should we consider providing another mechanism to appeal a decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in place of a judicial review?</p></speech>

I had not been in An Bord Plean&aacute;la for that long and, in my time, we have not examined another layer.  Adding another layer creates another layer of delay.  If people can appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, they do so.  If they can appeal to a higher court, not necessarily a judicial review, they will probably do so if it is affordable.  We can keep the process going and it will achieve further lengthening of the planning process and will create further uncertainty for planners and objectors in that one is never at the end of the process.</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection has an appeals process and a review process, with a significant difference between the two.  The appeals process is where one re-enters the entire process, like going from a local authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and the review process is where one considers whether someone has taken cognisance of all of the information.  One is not requesting new information, as in an appeals process.</p><p>  Without focusing too specifically on the case I mentioned earlier, that process has merit in such cases.  We are saving the taxpayer from a massive hit with the judicial review.  The taxpayer pays money on one side or the other, in that the taxpayer is either paying the council's bills or the bills of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It saves the taxpayer a significant amount of money and it allows us to examine matters that may be material contraventions or contraventions of the development plan and to sort the matter out.  We can see whether full cognisance was taken of particular matters.</p></speech>

Delegates are informed that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  They are further advised that the opening statements they have submitted will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  There is a great deal to discuss.  We are all looking forward to Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the European Union which will allow us to play our part in facilitating co-operation between member states in 2013.  It is especially important for this country, given the many problems we face, that there is an ongoing successful engagement within Europe.  We are particularly interested in the continuing development of the European Union and the future of the eurozone, of which we are and intend to remain an integral part.  Like Canada, the European Union is a major economic power and has an important role to play in the world economy.  Our relations with each other are very important and I am very interested to hear the delegates' views on the comprehensive economic and trade agreement and the strategic partnership agreement.  The particular focus of this meeting will be the European Commission's proposed measures for the implementation of the fuel quality directive.  Ireland is in favour of these proposals, but I realise they are a source of concern for Canada.  We are eager to hear the representatives' views in this regard.  I call on Mr. Tilson to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Members have had a long day and undoubtedly have other places they would prefer to be.  We will try to be brief as possible and, in the main, restrict our comments to the fuel quality directive which, as the Chairman observed, is a source of concern for our country.</p><p>  The Canadian oil sands are the centre of a major development in our economy, one which is creating a lot of jobs.  Members of the European Parliament have come to Canada to visit the oil sands and acknowledged that they are environmentally sound.  Our immediate concern relates to the vote taken in February this year on the proposed fuel quality directive implementing measures.  The oil sands consist of crude oil suspended in an ore that is a mixture of sand, clay and water.  The majority of Canada's oil sands reserve is a type of extra heavy crude oil known as bitumen and located primarily in the province of Alberta, with smaller deposits to be found in Saskatchewan.</p></speech>

We have plenty of time.  I am not a geophysicist or a petrochemical expert either.  Can the delegation explain in layman's language how Canada is being treated unfairly?  Is this an issue of the type of oil and the extraction process used in acquiring it, or is it the substance or composition of the crude oil that Canada is placing on the international market?  I am unsure what the difficulty is.</p></speech>

We are as concerned about these environmental issues as much as the next person or the next organisation or state.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.671" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Senator Joan Fraser" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012100900017#V00600"><p>I am not a geophysicist either but my clear understanding is that once it is refined, the oil sands oil ends up being exactly the same as all the other fuels we use.  My understanding is that Canada has concerns with the fuel quality directive because of the decision to put oil sands oil into a category of its own and that this is based on a double standard.  As a country we take into account the whole process from the first time something gets stuck in the ground to the end of the road, including by-products.  This is not done for all other sources of hydrocarbons for the EU.</p><p>  One example strikes me as being illustrative of our difficulties.  In Canada by law the natural gas associated with the production of crude oil bitumen must be captured and disposed of safely.  In fact, much of it is captured and sold commercially as natural gas.  In Russia or Nigeria they tend to flare it off, producing large quantities of greenhouse gases which are not counted by the European Union.  However, we count them in our production and as a result the EU counts them.  The EU takes our numbers which include the effects of the natural gas but they do not do the same for other suppliers.  My party believes that it would be appropriate to continue to develop the oil sands but to do so cautiously such that we can be absolutely certain that we are being environmentally sound.  Everyone in the country believes that we should be treated according to the same scientific basis as everyone else.</p></speech>

There has been a great deal less of it.  It is regulated largely by provincial governments and therefore there is variation throughout the country.  Thus far there has been little of it and it has taken place mostly in Alberta.  There is considerable political resistance in eastern Canada, where the oil and gas companies have been eager to get going with fracking.</p><p>  Mme Papillon may have something to add in this regard.  There is a new provincial government in my province which, as I understand it, has simply declared that there will be no fracking.  I am unsure whether there have been any unique Canadian studies.  There may have been some but I am unfamiliar with most of them.  We rely to a significant extent on work done elsewhere.</p></speech>

The methods of extraction that we are familiar with in this part of the world, particularly in this part of the Atlantic, are offshore oil extraction by oil rigs and gas extraction by the same method.  We are familiar with how oil processes in North Africa, the Middle East and Saudi Arabia have worked.  What is different about sand oil?  Is Canada the only country engaged in this?  Are there are other countries, such as the United States, which would be geographically similar, that are engaged in this process or is this a unique Canadian process?</p></speech>

Clearly, it is a natural resource that Canada has in a regional area.  I myself live in a region where there is a small population and high unemployment.  It is important to make the most of the resources that they have and I can see that is where Mr. Tilson is coming from.  It is a matter of trying to balance that against the bigger picture, which is the question of whether the oil being produced is more polluting than other fuels and how one manages that in terms of trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and halt global warming, which, as they will know, is becoming difficult.  From all of the delegation's meetings, can its members tell us whether it is the case that these countries are putting Canada into a category of producing something that is potentially more polluting and, in the long term, more damaging to the planet?</p></speech>

The delegation has come a long way.  We would hope it has something to say rather than just asking us questions.</p><p>  I attended a number of EU Presidency meetings in Copenhagen earlier this year.  One of the points the delegation made that interested me, of which I have taken note, is that Canada is taking the carbon footprint of the full production process and is getting a carbon rating on that basis - there is the extraction process, the cleansing process and all the rest of it.</p><p>  Ireland has no oil or gas loyalty.  We are not big players on the international stage.  We are not like Russia, north Africa or anywhere else.  This is not a sector, such as whiskey, software or IT technology, in which we are a world leader.  We are a small player in this sector.  If we have taken a position on this, it would not be on the basis of self-interest because we are not major stakeholders in it.</p><p>  We will have to push Mr. Tilson on the question.  His response has been that he has gone to a number of EU member states and they told him they were having a look at the issue.  I would imagine he has met not so much with their committees but with their environment Departments.  The issue would not have come across the desk of this committee if the delegation had not brought it before us today.</p><p>  If I were in Mr. Tilson's position, all I would be asking is that they examine all oil on a full-carbon-footprint basis.  Is Mr. Tilson making that argument?  Can he present a scientific argument that a pint of Saudi crude has a greater carbon footprint than a pint of sand oil from Quebec, Alberta or wherever?</p></speech>

That is why we were almost shocked at the decision that was taken.  However, we are hopeful that the issue will be studied and that those countries will reconsider their position.  The statistics were 89 in favour, 128 against and 128 abstentions.  It does not seem as though everybody was agreeing with the proposal.</p></speech>

Approximately 20% can be extracted by open-pit mining.  The rest is done<i> in situ</i> because it is too deep for open-pit mining.  The companies drill down and use steam to melt the oil in the sand and then extract it.</p></speech>

Data suggests that the Canadian sand oils' average life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are about 10% above the European average baseline but they are far from the worst in the world.  They are significantly lower than Middle East heavy oil, Californian heavy oil and Venezuelan partial upgrade oil, for example.  There are numerous sources of oil that have a greater life-cycle greenhouse gas emission rate than our sand oils do.  That is another reason we find it very strange that our sand oils were singled out and put in a category all by themselves under the European fuel quality directive.  It seems to us like a double standard.</p></speech>

On site, it takes more energy to produce sand oil but not over the full life-cycle.  If one takes the whole process into account, that is how one arrives at the figures I quoted earlier regarding greenhouse gas emissions.</p></speech>

They have made great strides in recycling the water they use.  Most sand oil extraction is done in the province of Alberta, which tends not to have a great deal of water.  It is not Saudi Arabia, but it does not have an abundance of water like eastern Canada.  In Alberta, they must be careful with their water and the oil companies are working very hard to minimise their net end consumption.</p></speech>

This afternoon the delegation will also go before the Oireachtas committees dealing with foreign affairs and environmental matters.

It is a pleasure to be here.  We have had some interesting meetings thus far.  The Chairman has pretty well summarised why we are here.  We met some of the members' colleagues in Strasbourg.  Our delegation is two members shy as they have returned to Canada.  As the members may or may not know, Canada is an official observer at the Council of Europe and we have had an opportunity to attend it and have had the privilege of participating in some of the debates and listening to some of the issues raised.  We are interested in how those issues affect Canada and Canadian policies, and many of our issues are similar.  We have gone to Strasbourg for all four sessions of the Council of the Europe and have been fairly active in participating in the Council and in the committees.</p><p>  Our delegation is called the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association.  It is an association made up of members of parliament and members of the Canadian Senate.  We are an all-party group; we are not only from one party.  All parties are represented here today and, naturally, as with groups here, we differ on some issues and agree on others.  The committee may find some of those differences but we are certainly impressed with what we have seen in Ireland so far and look forward to hearing some of the initiatives Ireland may take when it takes over the EU Presidency on 1 January next year.</p><p>  Our issues are several-fold.  One is the economic problems facing Europe.  Those problems exist everywhere.  Canada has had those problems, although not as severely as Europe or Ireland.  Unemployment is one of them.  Many young Irish people are coming to Canada because there are no jobs here, and we are pleased they are doing that.  In the case of many people in Canada, their ancestors date back to the Famine, as do mine, and, therefore, we all have a connection with Ireland.</p><p>  We are interested in the economy and it is a case of how Europe goes, so will Canada go.  We are interested in the economy in the United States.  Our trade is pretty high with Europe and the Americans.  We are interested in a trade agreement, called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, that is being negotiated, and we are hopeful the Irish, during their Presidency, will encourage its passing.  We are at the stage now where it will be on the edge of going to the different member states for votes and we hope it will be passed.  We believe the agreement will be good for Europe and for Canada.</p><p>  We have several concerns.  One of the reasons Canada's economy is not, I would say, so much booming but is doing better than other economies is our oil business.  We are concerned about the fuel directive that surfaced last spring.  It is being negotiated again and we hope that issue will be resolved.  We believe our oil is as good as any country's that is being used in Europe.  We attend the Arctic conferences.  A number of Arctic conferences are held in different countries.  I do not believe Ireland is part of that.  We are interested in global warming and in the issues of the Arctic, which number many.</p><p>  The members may have some questions for us and I expect we will have some questions for the members.  I thank the Vice Chairman very much for allowing us to come to this committee.</p></speech>

It is particularly important that they should come at this time from the point of view of Ireland's assumption of the Presidency of EU next January and that of the questions Mr. Tilson MP raised.  Those points are important and we have raised them.  It is interesting that issues that concern the delegation also concern us.</p><p>  The first point we must remember is that Ireland's Presidency of the European Union is very important from the point of view of Ireland and that of Europe.  We believe we have a calming influence in that we are prepared to carry and face up to our responsibilities of an economic nature, fully accept all that goes with that, and, as a result, we expect to be treated as equals within the European Union.  The question of smaller countries playing a lesser role does not arise.  We believe we have an equally important role to play and that we all have to cease thinking in a parochial sense.  We have to think as Europeans.  Each of us, as elected members of national parliaments, must begin to think as Europeans and to have regard for the welfare of all the people of Europe in all the regions without exception because that will represent an inclusiveness that has been sadly lacking in the performance of some European leaders during the past year or more.</p><p>  We believe that, as a small country, we have a particular role to play in the sense that we realise what needs to be done.  We know, for instance, that the major European powers have accepted and taken on responsibilities that are huge in terms of a financial input, but that does not mean we are not aware of the pain they are going through.  Everyone has to suffer in the current economic climate.</p><p>  Mr. Tilson mentioned the Canadian boom as compared with the performance of other economies.  That reminds me of the agricultural sector in this country because some people say that sector is booming but in actual fact it is not.  It is in comparison with the building sector because, following the boom, the building sector is non-existent, and the same applies to that sector in many of our neighbouring countries.  The reason for that is the huge emphasis that was placed on property, property prices and the high level of lending that took place.  In the United States, and this occurred to a lesser extent in Canada, there was sub-prime lending and the creation of unprecedented inflation in the house property sector.  Not since the 1930s has anything happened that has been as bad.  When the crash came, what effectively happened here is that the two thirds of all revenue that was generated by the building sector disappeared overnight and left a considerable chasm in its wake.  The strategy that has been adopted in Ireland is to try to ensure the productive sectors which target export markets - the food, pharmaceutical and chemical sectors - continue to do their best to carry the responsibility for regenerating the economy, and that is what is happening at present.  Above and beyond all other European countries, we have done more than our fair share in setting out what has to be done.  We have made huge sacrifices and there has been huge hurt in terms of hits to our population.  A great number of people who have had their standard of living slashed are suffering.  We appreciate that and there is no easy way around it.</p><p>  I last point I want to make is one Mr. Tilson also mentioned.  When this economic crisis first affected the smaller countries in Europe, and of course it affected the smaller countries first, there was a tendency among some economic analysts and experts of worldwide renown to suspect it would only affect smaller countries, but they were wrong.</p></speech>

It is a great pleasure to see them here.

I know the delegates have strong links with Ireland, through kinship and otherwise.</p><p>  The constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which is represented by Senator Kathryn Reilly and myself, has extraordinarily strong links with Canada.  The area of Bailieborough, where I live, and the town and county of Monaghan saw huge emigration to Canada.  I believe there is a little village called Bailieborough and an area called Monaghan in Canada.  Friendship links have been established between Monaghan County Council and Canada, with great effect.  The Canadian ambassador to Ireland has visited my area of Canningstown in Bailieborough a few times.  I believe a Prime Minister of Canada had direct family links with the area.  The kinship ties between the constituency I represent and Canada are enormous.  My remarks do not do justice to the strength of those ties.  There is considerable documentary evidence of emigration, family links and villages and towns established in Canada by people from the Cavan-Monaghan area.  The same family names and place names crop up frequently.  There has been considerable exchange between our two countries.  For that reason, it is a particular pleasure for me, as a representative of Cavan-Monaghan, to welcome the delegation here and to applaud their presence.</p><p>  When we have The Gathering in Ireland next year and we bring the Irish diaspora and people with connections to Ireland back to the country, we would be delighted to see a considerable Canadian contingent among their number as part of that great celebration.  As well as a kinship in blood, we have a kinship in ideas and commitment to democratic principles, the rule of law and human rights, and we have many shared values about the rights of people and the significance of every individual.  Our kinship in those areas is just as significant as our blood kinship.</p><p>  I acknowledge the family connection of Mr. David Tilson, MP, with my constituency.  He has a direct connection which I have discussed with him previously.  I can identify for him the Tilson families in Cavan to whom he is related.</p></speech>

I would be happy to arrange a visit for him and to have him come with me to visit them.  I would be happy to facilitate that, if he has time.</p><p>  I stress to the delegates from Canada, which is a member of the G8, that we have a huge interest in job creation, in turning economic progress into jobs and in using job creation to create further economic progress.  Of course, this is a universal concern.  We consider this a vital stimulus to the Irish and European economies.  We are very concerned about youth unemployment and a lost generation of young people.  I ask Canadians to use their good offices within the G8 to suggest that we need job creation, a jobs stimulus, activation policies to get jobs going and a credit flow to facilitate that.  I note that Canada has strong representation in the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  Job creation and stimulus must be a sub-text of the IMF.  Job creation and giving people the dignity of work is a huge issue for humanity at present.  We must look at imaginative ways of doing that and of sharing our ideas with individuals. </p><p>  I am impressed by what the association has been doing in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, with regard to child soldiers, women's rights and atrocities of war.  I commend that.  Those are interests shared by Irish people.  I hope the delegates will continue to pursue that agenda, with their considerable influence.</p><p>  I know Canada has taken a robust stand on Syria.  As the T&aacute;naiste recently said to the United Nations, what is happening in Syria is an affront to humanity.  It is an appalling story.  I believe the delegates were present when I spoke about this matter at the Council of Europe.  I am curious to know what Canada is doing about Syria and I would like to hear the delegates' comments on that.  We need to restore peace in Syria through an arms embargo and, having restored peace, to ensure that democratic values and mutual respect are established.  We, in Ireland, would like to see all groupings in Syria co-exist happily.  Given our history and traditions, we also have a specific interest in the Christian minorities that might be in danger in a post-settlement situation.  We would be interested in Canadian support in that regard. </p><p>  I welcome the delegation.  There is huge kinship between Canada and Ireland and we should be working to build on that.  We have kinship in blood and in our shared values.  Both give us reason to work together.   We also have a mutual interest in working together, from an economic perspective.</p></speech>

Canada had a major involvement in the Irish peace process, when a number of Canadians played a significant and important role.  General John de Chastelain dealt with the issue of putting weapons beyond use.  Mr. Al Hutchinson dealt with policing and served as Police Ombudsman in the North.  Mr. Justice William Hoyt was involved in the Saville inquiry which dealt with difficult issues from the past and tried to come to terms with those difficulties.  The International Fund for Ireland makes a positive contribution to present day issues and supports clubs, groups and individuals to bring about a more positive environment.  The peace process was, partly, about people moving on.  It was also about people seeing change in their own lives.</p><p>  Canadians have opened their country to young people from Ireland, particularly in the difficult circumstances we are experiencing at present.  I listened to the Canadian ambassador at a jobs fair at the weekend.  He spoke about the welcome Canada offers to people from Ireland.  What skills does Canada seek in young Irish people who are emigrating?  Many young Irish people are going as far away as Australia.  The ambassador made the point that Canada is a six or seven hour flight from Ireland and that it is much easier to keep in contact with family, or to get home in case of a family emergency, from Canada than from Australia.</p></speech>

The important issue is the type of work that is available.  Is there a welcome there for the Irish?  In some countries there was criticism that the number of our young people going there was dragging down the skills set because people were working for lower rates.  Is there any tension in that regard in Canada?  Where are the emigrants going and is work and accommodation available in those areas?  Have there been difficulties with any of the young people who have gone there among the recent group of emigrants from Ireland?</p><p>  I again thank Canada for the help and support it gave to the Irish peace process.  Its role in that process is really appreciated by the Irish people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.743" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012100900005#D00400"><p>Like my colleagues, I welcome you here again and thank you for your interest.  I will add some concluding comments.</p><p>  You raised some points about the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, between Canada and Europe and asked about what the themes of our Presidency would be.  Ireland's economy is deeply integrated with the economy of the outside world.  The main thing keeping our economy stabilised at present, with the possibility of growth in the future, is our ability to export goods and services.  Any type of agreement that facilitates the greater flow of goods and services across the world is something Ireland would very much support.  We believe that within that environment we are producing goods and services that people will want to buy.  As a result, the Irish view of the agreement would be that we would want the most ambitious settlement possible to facilitate the people you represent selling their goods and services elsewhere.  We want the same for our people.</p><p>  With regard to the forthcoming EU Presidency, two main themes will probably dominate the work we do.  The first will be reaction.  Europe has been grappling for the last three years with the sovereign debt crisis and I believe issues such as the creation of a banking union will arise within the term of our leadership of the European Union.  How we react to that and how we deal with work that is ongoing at present will take up a huge share of the energy and attention we have for the Presidency, as will the response of the European Union to the terrible trauma taking place in Greece and the continuing uncertainty regarding the ability of some countries to fund themselves into the future.  I believe that will be a major part of our work in the Presidency.</p><p>  The second part will be our priorities and the normal priorities of the European Union.  Our priority is very much focused on jobs and we consider the acceleration of measures relating to the Single Market as very important for that, particularly in respect of the digital sector.  Second, as you may have noticed from the demonstration outside the House, the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy will probably be concluding during our Presidency, while we will do our best to steer the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework for the European Union to a close if they are not already concluded by the time we take over.</p><p>  That is a whistle stop tour of some of the issues on which I believe we are likely to be focused.  I have a question for the witnesses.  The Canadian Minister of Finance, Mr. Jim Flaherty, has been very critical of the European Union's response to the debt and economic growth crisis in Europe.  What are your individual perspectives on how you anticipate Europe responding to the difficulty we have?  I should acknowledge that Canada is the leader of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, delegation, of which Ireland is a part.  I understand our Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Canadian Minister of Finance have a very good working relationship.  In fact, Mr. Flaherty visited Ireland a number of weeks ago to receive an honour at one of our universities and also to talk about Canada's view on what it wishes to see happen with regard to the debt crisis and about its strong support for Ireland, which I acknowledge.</p><p>  Again, thank you for attending and I hope the rest of your visit goes well.  If any of you wish to respond to the points I and my colleagues have made, we would be delighted to hear it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.744" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Tilson, MP" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012100900005#D00500"><p>I will start.  I will try not to talk for long because my colleagues might wish to speak.</p><p>  A number of issues were raised.  I always maintain that jobs is the main issue, regardless of whether it is Canada, Ireland, Europe or the United States.  Unemployment is high here, but it is high everywhere.  Deputy Crowe asked about jobs and whether Canada is family friendly.  Unquestionably, there are many people of Irish descent in Canada.  My colleague, Ms Papillon, who is a francophone, will confirm that there is a large Irish contingent in the francophone community.  They have spread throughout the world.  You mentioned our Minister of Finance, Mr. Flaherty.  He is quite proud of his Irish connections, as is the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration who was here this weekend to attend the same jobs fair that was mentioned.  He is proud of his connections and always wears a green tie, or at least he does quite often.</p><p>  We have jobs and most of the jobs being promoted at the jobs fair are in western Canada.  The reason is that the oil business there has expanded and houses are being built, but we do not have enough people to build them.  That is why we are recruiting the people who are unemployed in Ireland to help build those houses and other structures.  We need those people to help us with that problem in the west.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned our banks.  I will not delve into what Mr. Flaherty said.  He might have been too critical, but I do not know.  There is no question that our banks are more regulated than banks here.  We have not had the same problems.  The banks offered people all kinds of money to buy a home and the bubble burst.  That is the problem.  We did not have that, touch wood.  It could happen but Mr. Flaherty is doing things such as increasing the amount of the downpayments one must make and ensuring mortgages can no longer be as high.</p><p>  With respect to The Gathering, I have seen the signs promoting it.  It is a wonderful promotional idea to encourage people from all over the world to return to Ireland.  I wish the country well with it.  I am sure if we reach the stage of signing the CETA agreement in Ireland, there will be all kinds of Canadians travelling over to witness that.</p><p>  The Syria issue is serious.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-09a.747" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Senator Jane Fraser" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012100900006#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and member for receiving us.  I will comment on one or two of the points that were raised.  The Vice Chairman referred to the impatience of the Canadian Minister of Finance, Mr. Flaherty, MP.  I think in truth the whole world has been tense, not to say impatient, about Europe's trouble in responding as quickly as the rest of the world thinks it should have.</p><p>  Canada is a federation and we have some understanding of how difficult it is to get many partners together around the table.  We have ten very strong provinces and three territories in addition to a federal government.  We are familiar with the complexities of these negotiations.  I do not think it was just Mr. Flaherty, who can be blunt and tends to say out loud what many others are more diplomatic about.  We, in contrast to Europe, have been extremely impressed by what Ireland has achieved.  Ireland faced a terrible crisis and has responded to it with necessary but terrible austerity measures, yet has maintained social peace.  The country is getting there.  I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been for many thousands of people, but it is an amazing and in some ways a humbling thing to see what this country has managed to do in facing up to a terrible crisis.  I would not want members to think we are sitting here being nasty, rude and critical about Ireland.  That is very far from the case.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe mentioned the peace process, which is another movement the whole world has watched.  As Deputy O'Reilly will recall, one of the first things I do is ask Irish people what should I do when I am in Ireland, and the other day in response somebody said I should take the train to Belfast and see the Titanic museum.  Is that not wonderful?  The past is gone, I am sure it will never be entirely gone but to see what has been achieved is very moving.</p><p>  I will now respond to questions on whether Canada is family-friendly.  As Mr. Tilson said, many jobs are in the construction industry, they tend to be in the oil sands.  People from the poorer regions of Canada are flocking there too.  There is work in developing the oil sands themselves and the construction of the communities that are needed to support that.  I believe Canada is a family-friendly country.  Fundamentally, Canada is a friendly country that has been built on immigration over the centuries.  We welcome and integrate people from areas as diverse as Hong Kong and Somalia.  For Canadians, the Irish are just like their cousins and they are made welcome by the Canadians who are delighted to see them.  We believe that the Irish people who stay in Canada will be wonderful Canadians and we are lucky to have them.</p></speech>

I thank the Vice Chairman and members for receiving us.  It is a pleasure to be here.  As my colleagues said we have shared values and shared historical roots.  I am from Quebec city, which has a long association with Ireland.  I am aware that Quebec has sent missions to Europe to help deal with youth unemployment by offering them jobs in Quebec.  We have sent missions to France and Belgium.  The Irish are coming to Quebec, perhaps because they know we have a shared history and many there have Irish blood in them.  I represent the Opposition, and the leader of the New Democratic Party, NDP, has Irish roots.</p><p>  We are interested in discussing many topics, including jobs and economic growth.  I look forward to further conversations.</p></speech>

It is good to see Deputies Bernard J. Durkan and Joe O'Reilly again.  We are meeting Deputies Se&aacute;n Crowe and Paschal Donohoe for the first time.  We are delighted to be here and to learn from the Irish experience and to share with you.  I am a Member of Parliament on the Government benches and our framework is clearly a focus on job creation, economic growth and most important of all for those of us with children - I am a mother of a 21 year old and a 14 year old - long-term prosperity.  Long-term prosperity is not just prosperity for our generation but prosperity for the generations to come.  That is the reason we are trying very hard to get back to balance by 2014, that is the reason for our policies.  We recognise that we are in a very fortunate position and that the austerity measures we are taking are very moderate relative to the ones that the Irish people are taking.  We are taking these measures and not resting on our laurels.  We do not want to have a situation where our young people are faced with challenges or for that matter, after the Taoiseach's visit on the weekend, Irish young people do not have opportunities.  To that end, our Minister of Finance, Mr. Jim Flaherty, MP, has taken measures that were seen by some as draconian to reduce terms of mortgages by increasing mortgage down-payment requirements.  Again, that is not about the comfort zone today but the comfort zone over the next 30 years.</p><p>  I echo the comments of all of my colleagues on welcoming people to Canada.  We are a very welcoming country.  I come from western Canada, where there are many jobs but not just in the oil fields.  It is very critical that we send out the message that there are jobs in peripheral services.  We are building communities and we do not have enough people in western Canada to fill all the jobs we have on offer.  While the oil sands jobs is a very important driver, there are other opportunities.  <br /><font color="#222222">  We cannot be more friendly than creating a safe future for children and young adults to enter into economic prosperity.</font></p></speech>
