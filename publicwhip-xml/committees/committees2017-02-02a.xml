    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#A00300"><p>We have a quorum and are now in public session.  We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to this committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Mahin Fitzpatrick.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of last week's meeting on 26 January, 2017.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  I wish to raise one item arising out of the aforementioned minutes.  We had quite a long discussion last week with the Secretary General of the Department of Defence, Mr. Maurice Quinn, about the sale of the Government jet.  I propose that the committee writes to Mr. Quinn to clarify a few issues because a couple of people have contacted me since our meeting and raised a number of matters.  First, I understood clearly from Mr. Quinn that there were access issues in terms of other people inspecting the Government jet and the spare parts in the hangar in Georgia.  I want him to explain how he arrived at that conclusion because I have been informed that there were no access issues and all one would have had to do was ask.  Access was put up as a reason for not getting an outside opinion.  Second, in his statement Mr. Quinn said that a lot of the spare parts did not have certification and I want some documentary evidence on that.  I also want know what document he issued to the Air Corps seeking certification and any correspondence received back confirming that there was none.  Finally, I just want to raise a point relating to our remit.  We accept that a decision had to be made to either sell the Government jet as it was, in parts on the floor and get the best available price - which is what actually happened - or fix it and put it back in the air.</p><p>There is a third option that was not considered, which I ask to be considered.  If someone took a vehicle into a garage and parts of it were on the floor, it may have been economical to put it back in working order and then sell it.  I am told that if they just repaired it and put it back in working order it could have been sold without any ongoing commitment at substantially more than was actually achieved.  There is no evidence that that option was explored.  No evidence was given to us that it was explored.  I would like to know the Secretary General's views on whether that option was considered and to see the documentary evidence that it was considered.  There appears to have been a Government decision to sell it.  Normally, somebody with a knowledge of selling things would have been involved in that process.  Did they seek to appoint any third party - some kind of broker - with knowledge of the industry to sell it or was it just done by civil servants?  I will ask the Secretary General to clarify those matters.  I am not disputing anything he said but I want those matters clarified because people who were watching proceedings contacted me afterwards with those questions so I would like them clarified. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B00200"><p>I want further clarification.  There was some discussion about the informal contact the Department used to give a view on the different options for the sale of the jet.  We had previous reports from the Air Corps and then we had this informal contact.  It seemed that somebody in the Department made contact with somebody they knew and that this person was paid &euro;900.  A number of e-mails were submitted.  I asked if we could get that correspondence and further clarification on who that person was.  Has that been asked for?  If it has been asked of them, have we got it yet?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B00300"><p>That is one of the points already communicated to them in writing to supply.  The one thing the committee will do is make sure we have a tracker system in place so that when we ask questions we get replies within a reasonable period and not weeks afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B00400"><p>On the same point, we asked Tusla and the Department, when their representatives appeared before us last time, for information on the guardian <i>ad litem</i>scheme.  We sought an awful lot of further information.  I have not seen any of that come back.  It is the same point.  We ask for clarification but it is hard to track whether we get it within a reasonable timeframe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B00500"><p>I will add to that.  I forget how long ago it was that we had representatives from the Department of Social Protection in to discuss the insolvency fund.  We asked for information and we are still waiting for it.  I am not letting it go.  I submitted a parliamentary question on it to further prompt the information.  We have to be very clear; we have to have a tracking system so that we do not move on and leave questions hanging in the air.</p> <p>  Those are matters arising from the minutes.  The next item is correspondence received.  We have a briefing document from the Department of Justice and Equality - No. 276A.  We have that.  The opening statement from Mr. Noel Waters for today is No. 280A.  When did we receive that?  When I went looking for it yesterday I could not find it.  It has already been in the system for a number of days.  </p></speech>

He caught us on the hop.  We will all get a copy of that.</p> <p>  I will move on to correspondence, No. 266C, i to iv, and No. 267, i to ii.  This is correspondence from last week where we are awaiting another explanatory note.  It all relates to payment of public moneys by Dublin City Council to Ballymun regeneration programme.  We agreed to forward this correspondence to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and when the Secretary General is before the committee on 2 March, we will discuss this matter further.  We have put him on notice of that.  There is a new item of correspondence here today.  Do any members have anything further to add or can we just keep it on the file until 2 March?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We have sent it on.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 275C, i to iii, a letter from an anonymous source which attached a newspaper article regarding lease agreements entered into by the OPW.  We note that.  It is just a newspaper article.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 277C, an e-mail received from two individuals who are involved in the ongoing case with the University of Limerick.  The secretariat has written to the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser for advice on this matter.  I propose that at our next meeting, the committee gets a brief from the parliamentary legal adviser on this particular issue.  We are also scheduling the third level institutions to appear before the committee in April.  I suggest we inform the University of Limerick that this topic will be discussed at that meeting.  We will come to that meeting in our work programme in a few minutes.  We note that.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 297C, i and ii, from NAMA regarding the sale of a property in Dublin 8 and an issue raised by Sager Management Limited.  The correspondence explains that the situation has been dealt with, that the individual has been contacted and is engaging in the process.  I propose we note this correspondence from NAMA.  Is that greed?  Agreed.  For the record, it is interesting to note that although NAMA was the secured lender on the property, the property remained under the control of the debtor and it seems NAMA is at arm's length from the actual sales process.  NAMA has been in direct contact with the individual.  </p> <p>  No. 4 is statement and accounts received since the last meeting.  They will come up on the screen now.  They are in front of us.  No. 4.1 is Leopardstown Park Hospital board, clear audit opinion; Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, clear audit opinion; Health Service Executive, patient private property accounts, clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to the issue of internal control.  That is specifically on our work programme.  On 9 March, we will deal with the HSE specifically on the patient private property accounts and the fair deal scheme.  We will deal with other HSE issues separately.  Those two items are specifically on our agenda.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 4.4 is special account for the purposes of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, clear audit opinion.  The next item is the Repayment Scheme (Donations) Fund.  There were nil proceeds to that account in 2015.  It was very easy to get a clear audit report when there were no transactions.  That was an account whereby the Repayment Scheme (Donations) Fund was set up to receive voluntary donations from beneficiaries of the scheme to be used to fund improvements in health services for dependent old persons and persons with disabilities.  People will recall that some people were in institutions without the proper legal sanction and they sought refunds of charges and everything like that and &euro;1.67 million was paid out in 2015.  Many families felt they got very good service and they made a donation back of the amount received.  Other families chose, in recognition of the happy service they received, not to make a claim in the first place.  </p> <p>  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General tell us if there is much left to be paid in that fund?  Is it nearly over?</p></speech>

I have noted that the total expenditure to end-2015 was &euro;453 million.  That was the total amount of reimbursements that were made from 2006.  I expect at this stage that most of it has been worked out.</p></speech>

There will possibly be indications in them.  I take it the claims date has passed and no new claims can come in at this stage?</p></speech>

If the committee is interested, it would seem to fit quite closely with the patient private property accounts and the fair deal scheme.  They are all related issues.  Perhaps if the HSE would provide an update and assessment of where they are at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B02700"><p>It is under the HSE.  We will write to the HSE to get an update and summary on that whole issue because &euro;453 million is a big amount of money.  We were all conscious of it a couple of years ago but we have kind of forgotten about the issue since.  We will add that as an agenda item when representatives from the HSE are in next month.  We will discuss the patients fund account, fair deal and the special account for the purposes of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  We will put that on the work agenda for that meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is our work programme.</p><p>There is a draft going up on the screen.  Today we have officials from the Department of Justice and Equality specifically to discuss the Vote for the Prison Service and the Comptroller and Auditor General report.  We will not deal with the broader Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p> Next week there is a meeting scheduled to deal with Project Eagle.  Just on that and even without going into private session, the conclusions of the secretariat's work will be circulated to all members next week.  In December while we were working on it in addition to the normal secretariat that is available to us we had the support of another staff member as well as help from a second person.  They have been moved to the secretariat of the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  The clerk is finalising it on his own and we are still doing our routine business as well.  It is fully understandable why it has taken the extra week or so.  The clerk assures me we will all have the document from the secretariat next week.  We will then discuss it and amend it accordingly leading to a draft and then a final report.  How long that takes will be up to the committee.</p></speech>

My understanding is that we were doing an examination of the sales process of Project Eagle - an examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and we were not carrying out any investigation.  This is now quite sensitive in respect of whether a commission of investigation is established.  We can all have different opinions and interpretations.  We can all put our own spin on it irrespective of the side of the fence we might sit on.  Whatever opinions people might have here, it is important that it be factually set out making clear exactly what this committee was doing and what we were not doing.  We all stayed within the boundaries because it was made very clear to us that we were not examining actions that might have been criminal or illegal by any individual or organisation.  It is important for that to be on the record.  I am asking for that paper to be provided.</p></speech>

We did not seek powers of compellability.  We are examining the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and that is it.

I sought additional staff when we commenced our work and we had staff going through all the correspondence, summarising everything for the report, and they were available to us until the beginning of January.  We probably thought we would have had a draft report in January.  It has taken a little longer because we held our public hearings right up until Christmas week.  We were still in receipt of correspondence subsequent to those meetings.  It is unfortunate we do not have the full complement of staff to see it through.  The outcome of it is that we are no more than a week or two behind where would like to have been.  We would like to be finishing it up now, but we will have the final work from the secretariat in the coming week.

There is political messing happening on this issue.  We have been stalled in completing our work not least because of a staffing issue on the one hand, as it now emerges.  On the other hand the political system, in the form of the Government, is saying that it is stalling the ball on a commission it had already committed to on the basis that it wanted to see our report.  It is completely unacceptable to put this committee and us as parliamentarians into that position.  I would go so far as to say that if at this stage we have to postpone all other work to finish our work on Project Eagle, if the Taoiseach or anybody else is using this as a pretext to delay a commitment they entered into - I certainly speak for my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, and I imagine for others - I am not prepared to be used in that way.  I find it utterly unacceptable.  Let us remember the ambition had been to publish all of this at Christmas time.  That got held up; we all understood that.</p></speech>

We do work programme planning here every week.  There are resources there that are specialised because of the work of Project Eagle.  There are staff working on that.  Some of those staff were removed and we were not informed.  Our work programme planning has gone out of kilter because we are not aware of what staff were there to do the work in the first place.  We can only do X amount of work because we have X number of staff.  This is X minus Y which we were not informed about.  When did this happen and why were we not informed?</p></speech>

A week or two ago we scheduled not to have any other business next week so that we would be able to deal with the report from the secretariat.  I am satisfied that we will have that report from the secretariat, but at this stage we may not have it in sufficient time to have that meeting next Thursday.  Our original intention a couple of weeks ago was to get it out this weekend and we would have a detailed discussion in the coming weeks on that document and prepare a draft report.  We will have that report next week, but I do not envisage us having it in sufficient time to allow a detailed debate on it next Thursday.  However, members will have it next week.  We are a week behind schedule on that.  I will take up all the issues that have been mentioned.</p></speech>

This is not a criticism of the clerk to the committee but my office was in contact with him and there were seven or eight e-mails exchanged.  The response I got back about the delay implied that it had nothing to do with staffing.  Staffing was not even referenced.  I was told that the delay was to do with tying up loose ends.  That is the problem we have; there was no clarity given to us, right through the process, as to exactly what was happening and why.  If that can be-----</p></speech>

The clerk checked with me and I said that we cannot release the document until we are in a position to release it to everybody.  I held back until this morning's meeting because I wanted to clarify the position for all members.  Staffing issues are not normally within the remit of politicians in the House.  We did get some extra support but it is very disappointing that, at the final furlong, that was pulled back.  Had that not happened, we would have been at the finishing line now.  That said, we are nearly there.  I do not want to undermine the report just because it will be produced two weeks later than originally planned.</p></speech>

That is the document that we will sit down, as elected members of this committee, to discuss and then we will start making our amendments to it.  At that time it will become a draft report of the committee, ultimately leading to a final report fairly soon thereafter, I hope.  The document that will be circulated next week is not a draft report; it is only a document that is being prepared for the committee's benefit.  Are members happy with that?  I do not know if I am right or wrong in saying this but if any of that document is leaked, we will have to take measures when drafting the actual draft report to make sure that it will not be widely circulated in advance of publication.  I am putting members to the test in that regard.  If any of the secretariat's document appears in any part of the media, we will have to sit behind closed doors.  If somebody breaches the confidentiality of the committee next week, he or she will not be able to do so again when we are the drafting of the final report.  Can we get agreement on that?  It is not fair to the rest of the committee if one member goes off and leaks it in an effort to get a bit a kudos.</p></speech>

We will wait and see but that is a possibility.</p> <p>  In the meantime, our work schedule is as follows.  On Thursday, 16 February we will be meeting the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to discuss the appropriation accounts, Vote 30 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter on EU refunds and levies in the agriculture sector.  On Thursday, 23 February we will be dealing with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, while on Thursday, 2 March we will meet the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to discuss the appropriation accounts, the Vote for environment, community and local government and the Comptroller and Auditor's chapter on central government funding of local authorities.  We will also discuss Chapter 5, which deals with progress on land aggregation.  We will also discuss the Ballymun renewal project, which has been the subject of correspondence with this committee.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 9 March we will meet the Department of Health and the HSE to deal with patients' private property accounts, the fair deal nursing home scheme as referenced in the HSE's financial statement, as well as the special account for the purposes of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  The latter will be included that as an item on our agenda for the meeting on 9 March.  There will be separate meetings with the HSE about section 38 and section 39 hospitals and so forth.  </p> <p>  On Thursday, 23 March we will meet the Department of Education and Skills.  I propose that on Thursday, 30 March and Thursday, 6 April, we deal with the third level institutions.  In the first instance, we should start with some of the universities and we can go on to the institutes of technology later.  I believe we should open up the session with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, which deals with all third level institutions.  We will try to determine which universities we should call and in what order.  I have no particular view as to which universities to invite but would point out that we cannot invite them all.  The University of Limerick has been brought to this committee's attention through various correspondence.  DCU was highlighted in terms of big procurement issues during the course of the year-----</p></speech>

If any member wants the committee to invite a particular university to either of those two meetings, he or she should pass a request on to the secretariat but we will not be able to cover all of the universities.

On Thursday, 13 April we will meet the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss the Department's Vote and the procurement and management of contracts for the direct provision system.

We are meeting the Department of Justice and Equality today but that is strictly to deal with the prisons issue.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 4 May, we hope to have the Revenue Commissioners in before us.  In fact, that meeting has been confirmed.  After that, we will move on to the institutes of technology and finally, the Department of Finance.  The schedule is such that we have a number of weeks for which we can select particular topics outside of the chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Between Easter and the summer recess, I hope to have a number of meetings, the agendas for which this committee can be selective about and determine who to invite.  We will come back to that but if anyone has any suggestions in the meantime, please let the secretariat know so that we can put it into our work schedule.  </p> <p>  That is where we are with regard to our work programme.

There has been a ruling in the courts relating to an action taken by a previous witness to this committee.  This committee was vindicated.  There was a lot of talk at the time that the action was initiated against this committee and indeed, against the State, about the remit of the committee, the conduct of its members and so on.  It would be useful to get a report back from legal services personnel to clarify a number of the issues raised.  The court made a very clear decision in favour of the committee.  I ask that the legal representatives be invited to appear before us to explain the verdict, offer clarifications on the remit of this committee and how it conducts its business, as well as any learning from the case itself.</p></speech>

We will do that.  While I know the ruling has implications for the Oireachtas as a whole, the case originally stemmed from the Committee of Public Accounts.  I agree that we should hear directly from the parliamentary legal advisers as soon as they are in a position to do so.  I would be surprised if they are not already working on it, with a view to meeting us.</p> <p>  Finally, there is one item of correspondence that I skipped over by mistake, reference number 281C , from Deputy Marc MacSharry.</p><p>It concerns matters relating to a certain property acquisition by Galway City Council in 2007.  We have a detailed folder that has been supplied to the Deputy.  We decided not to circulate it to all members because of the volume involved but I will ask Deputy MacSharry to make some comments.</p></speech>

It came to my notice there was a transaction in 2007 with Galway City Council acquiring land, it would appear, without appropriate valuations and at a very substantial premium above market value at the time, as well as a number of other anomalies.  I propose to speak to the clerk privately and refine the specific points I would recommend the committee considers.  Perhaps at that point we would circulate them to the committee, which can decide whether to look into this.  I know we do not have competence over the accounts of councils but we have competence over the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, which under the appropriate Acts is bound to approve all borrowing by local authorities.  There was borrowing of &euro;10.5 million in this regard so it would be useful for us to examine what level of oversight the Department put into practice.  This is just one example I believe is worth looking at, as it may have been replicated in every local authority area in the country.</p></speech>

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving the evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.

Payment of salaries, wages and allowances totalled &euro;235 million, which represents almost 71% of the total expenditure in 2015.  The Prison Service spent just over &euro;47 million on buildings and &euro;26.5 million on prison services, including expenditure on food and cleaning materials etc.  The main capital development project being undertaken by the Irish Prison Service in 2015 was construction of a new prison in Cork at a total estimated cost of approximately &euro;45 million.  This new medium security prison for adult males has an operational capacity for 275 prisoners and is the committal prison for counties Cork, Kerry and Waterford.  The relocation of prisoners from the old Cork prison commenced in early 2016.  The Accounting Officer will be able to brief the committee on the proposed future use of the old Cork prison.</p> <p> A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.3 million was voted for the Prison Service in 2015.  At the end of the year, the unused surplus for surrender was &euro;1.26 million.  The account received a clear audit opinion.  However, in my certificate, I draw attention to the Accounting Officer's statement on internal financial control, in which he discloses the level of non-compliance by the Prison Service with national procurement rules in respect of goods and services procured in 2015.</p> <p>  The report for consideration by the committee this morning relates to an examination by my office of the annualised hours system which operates in the Prison Service.  This system replaced overtime in the Prison Service from late 2005.  Historically, overtime levels were very high in the Prison Service.  Overtime costs peaked at &euro;59 million per year in 2002 and 2003.  Under the new annualised hours system, prison officers contract to work a fixed number of additional hours annually to a maximum of 360 hours per year over standard rostered hours.  When the Prison Service was planning to introduce the system, it was projected that it would result in significant financial savings.  I wanted to examine what had been achieved in that regard.</p> <p>  Following the introduction of the annualised hours system, the average number of hours worked by prison officers over and above their basic work week was halved.</p><p>The new cap on the number of additional hours that a prison officer may work ended the practice of some individuals working extremely high numbers of hours.  There is now a more even distribution of earnings from additional hours.</p><p> Prison officers are paid for contracted additional hours at a rate of 1.8 times the basic hourly rate.  A related pensionable allowance of 8% of basic pay is paid to each prison officer regardless of the number of additional hours he or she contracts to work.  This includes approximately 7% of officers who do not contract to work any additional hours.  My examination found that the average overall earnings of prison officers have not changed significantly in cash terms since the introduction of the new system.  Prison officers are paid for all of their contracted additional hours but may not be called on to work the full number of hours.  Additional hours not worked are called write-off hours.  While the average level of write-off hours across the Prison Service in 2014 was 15%, there was significant variation across the 14 prison institutions.  Open centres had the highest number of such write-off hours.</p><p> The Irish Prison Service has a low ratio of prisoners to prison officers relative to prison services in other states.  This suggests that some efficiency gains may be possible.  The joint task reviews that were carried out under the 2010-14 and 2013-16 public service agreements resulted in changes to staffing configurations.  No in-depth review of the tasks carried out in prisons and the resources required for those tasks has been carried out since 2001.  In particular, there was no formal process for the identification of potential efficiencies which may have arisen from prison infrastructure expenditure, which came to a total of &euro;223 million between 2001 and 2014.</p><p> The Prison Service anticipated that the introduction of the annualised hours system would result in a reduction of approximately one third in the amount of sick leave taken by prison officers relative to 2001 levels.  Sick leave levels increased significantly between 2001 and 2005.  The incidence of sick leave fell significantly after the introduction of the annualised system, but the reduction achieved to date has not been to the level anticipated by the Prison Service.</p><p> The Prison Service estimated that the annualised hours system would produce savings of &euro;31 million a year.  This was not achieved.  The examination estimated that the average annual net salary saving as a result of the introduction of the annualised hours system is approximately &euro;5.5 million a year.  Furthermore, the savings achieved to the end of 2014 were offset by substantial lump sum payments, totalling &euro;41 million, to serving prison officers when the new system was introduced.  As a result, the estimated net Exchequer saving over the period 2006 to 2014 was approximately &euro;8 million.</p></speech>

I might ask my colleague, Mr. Michael Donnellan, who is the Director General of the Irish Prison Service, to say a few words at the end if that is okay.  I acknowledge the useful work that has been done by the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff to determine where we are going with annualised hours.</p> <p>  As I have set out in my statement, there was a long history behind the agreement to introduce annualised hours in the Prison Service in 2005.  To put it simply, the decision to introduce annualised hours was made against a background of very substantial overtime working in the Prison Service, which cost a considerable amount of money and led to inefficient and ineffective ways of operating the service.  At one point, the level of overtime in the Prison Service was very close to that in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is a much bigger force.  I can come back to that point later in our discussions.</p></speech>

I am not in any way questioning the validity of the points made by the Comptroller and Auditor General when I say I know from my discussions and my reviews with prison management personnel over recent years that they believe the system of annualised hours has brought about a sea change in how prisons can be managed and has contributed greatly to securing efficiencies against a background of making much-needed reforms in the prison system.  A review that is taking place at present is assessing whether further improvements can be made in the system.  We can talk about this during the course of the morning.</p> <p>  I accept that the savings involved have not been as great as those which were initially hoped for.  This is largely due to a decision by an independent body to provide compensation on a scale greater than that which the Prison Service had argued was warranted for the changes which had been made.  By its nature, this was outside the control of the Prison Service.  Nonetheless, I think the Comptroller and Auditor General's report recognises that real and significant savings have been achieved.  A former Minister of State in the Department said at the time that "despite reservations ... about the deal that emerged [it was] accepted that the overall package represented a workable way forward for the future".  It is certainly the view of Prison Service management that this has proven to be the case in the intervening period.</p> <p>  Of course the annualised hours system is not perfect.  No system could be perfect in the particular circumstances of closed and open prisons.  Twelve years on, if I were faced with a choice between a demonstrably unpredictable and inefficient overtime system and a system of annualised hours that delivers efficiencies, predictability and significant savings, I would recommend to the Minister and the Government that a similar decision to that taken in 2005 be taken again now.</p> <p>  As I have said, Mr. Donnellan will highlight a few of the headline significant changes that have been made in the prison system.  In that respect, a crucial change which has occurred over the past decade has been the elimination of unplanned temporary release, or the "revolving door" as it was known.  That practice, which was a major feature of the overcrowded system over many years, had an enormously corrosive impact on the entire criminal justice system.</p> <p>  I will conclude by mentioning three items of significant infrastructural development that are in planning.  The E block in Portlaoise Prison is in urgent need of replacement due to its dilapidated state.  It is expected that construction works on the refurbishment of the two remaining wings in Limerick Prison, along with a stand-alone female facility, will begin towards the end of this year, depending on a tendering competition.  Most significantly, a new blueprint for the staged development of the Mountjoy complex, which is designed to extend its viability as a prison complex for decades to come, is in contemplation and, subject to Government approval, is likely be part of a public consultative process later this year.  I would like to hand over to Mr. Donnellan now to say a few opening words.</p></speech>

As the Secretary General has mentioned, the committee will be aware of significant changes and reforms that have occurred in the Prison Service in recent years.  The prison system has experienced severe strain and has had to deal with the continuing challenge of overcrowding.  Thankfully, overcrowding has been eliminated due to a number of factors, including enhanced pre-release planning, structured temporary release, community return and community release.  The number of people in custody has fallen by 20% from its peak in 2011.  More important, the number of people on temporary release has decreased by 70% from its peak.  There is no doubt that this is making society much safer.  The implementation of the fines legislation is starting to have an effect on committals.  We have not yet seen the full benefit of that.  Last year, we saw a decrease of 15% in the number of people being committed to prison for non-payment of fines.  This is very welcome.</p> <p>  We are continuing to develop a comprehensive capital programme.  Having developed new modernised accommodation in Castlerea Prison, Portlaoise Prison, Wheatfield Prison and the Midlands Prison, our priority now is to develop existing accommodation with a special focus on rehabilitation and the elimination of slopping out.  Five years ago, there were 1,000 people, or 25% of the prison population, slopping out.  Fewer than 50 prisoners, or 1% of the prison population, are slopping out today.  We hope to eliminate that with the development of facilities in Limerick and Portlaoise in the coming years.  The opening of the new Cork Prison in 2016 was a major initiative as the previous prison in Cork was the worst prison in our prison estate.  The introduction of an incentivised prisoner regime system has helped with behaviour and has helped to drive down violence in the prison system.</p><p>The committee will be aware that for various reasons, some prisoners have to be accommodated separately from other prisoners.  We call this a restricted regime and we have been working very hard in the past number of years to reduce the number of people who are on 22-hour or 23-hour lock-up, as it is called, or solitary confinement down to a manageable number.  Significant progress has been made on that.</p><p> We have also been working with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in ensuring we can measure recidivism and measure the effectiveness of prison.  Our first reports were published in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and during that period we have seen a drop in recidivism, that is, of people re-offending within a three year period, from 55% to 45%.  I hope in the next five to ten years I will see that percentage dropping down to 35%, which is the norm of the Nordic countries.  I am confident that the successful implementation of our strategy has really helped the prison system.</p><p> I look forward to developing our new strategy, which we are now implementing, which is built around supporting prisoners, supporting our staff, supporting victims and developing organisational capacity.  This has to be against the backdrop of additional hours, AH, which has allowed stability and predictability in the system and the diversion of much-needed funds to a more rehabilitative focus.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members.    </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Waters" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#G00400"><p>I will give an overview and then I will call on my colleagues from the Prison Service.</p> <p>  The level of overtime running during that period in the 2000s was escalating at a rapid rate.  The bill for overtime had risen from &euro;54 million, up to &euro;55 million, culminating at &euro;59 million in the space of a couple of years, which gave rise to very serious difficulties in the entire justice sector in meeting a bill of that level every year.  The money allocated for other services and in other subheads had to be diverted to pay the overtime bill.  During that period, as I said in my opening remarks, the overtime for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was about &euro;65 million.  There were about 3,000 officers in the Prison Service, whereas the number of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was much larger.  Clearly the issue of overtime had to be resolved as it was not sustainable.</p> <p>  A review of the figures from 1997 up to the early 2000s was conducted to see if there could be a better way of organising the service.  They looked at four different options, namely, hiring more staff, time off in lieu, trying to curtail the overtime system and the annualised hours system.  They came down in favour of the annualised hours, and this was approved by a Minister and everybody else in the system.  They went into each prison and looked at the number of hours required to run the prison, came up with a global figure - and my colleagues can elaborate on that - of rostered hours and overtime hours that it would take to run the Prison Service right across all the individual institutions.  I believe 16 institutions may have been in operation at that time.  That global figure ultimately fed its way into the &euro;31 million saving which was identified at that time and was based on an expenditure of &euro;59 million in overtime.  In subsequent years that overtime bill fell back to &euro;46 million.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Donnellan to give Deputy MacSharry a flavour of how the numbers that arose came about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Donnellan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#G00500"><p>As the Secretary General has said, there was an envisaged saving of &euro;31 million and that was against an overtime budget at its height of &euro;59 million.  However, when the deal came up for signature in 2005, the overtime figures for the year 2003-04 had dropped from &euro;59 million to &euro;46 million.  This reduction was because the then Government closed two prisons, the Curragh and Spike Island in Cork, which freed up 150 officers to be redeployed back into the system, which offset that overtime difference.  The real figure for benchmarking in our view should have been &euro;46 million, which would have given a gross saving of &euro;19 million per year.  The deal was put to a vote of the prison officers and then went to the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  The Civil Service Arbitration Board awarded the prison officers an 8% operational allowance and a lump sum of just under &euro;14,000 per officer.  That further eroded those saving.  The next savings, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said are just over &euro;5 million a year in real savings or just over &euro;8 million, if one takes in the pension costs.  That explains the background to that ambitious figure in 2002-03 of saving &euro;31 million a year.</p></speech>

If one compares on a direct basis with what was paid out in overtime, one is looking at savings of the order of &euro;8.5 million.  The actual payment every year on annualised hours in more recent years has been of the order of &euro;32 million.</p><p>The equivalent overtime payment in a direct comparison basis in the most recent year it was used was &euro;46 million, but other elements to this have happened in the meantime.</p></speech>

I guess that the entire prison service opted for 360.  Did they?</p></speech>

There were further developments on this in respect of the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements, which brought this back down to 70%.  There were new arrangements about the various ratios between the different bands which were put in place.  Does the Director General want to speak on that?</p></speech>

There was band 0, then 112 hours, 240 hours and 360 hours.  At the time, there was a requirement for as many people to work as many hours as possible and about 85% of people worked 360 hours, the top band.  However, following the Haddington Road agreement, there was a requirement for us to address cost control issues and cost reduction issues.  We were required to meet a level of 70% of staff on 360 hours, 10% on 112, 10% on 240 and 10% on 0.  We are nearly at those.  That has provided a saving to our pay bill of about &euro;3.5 million.  That was a further refinement through a whole range of agreements that were made.  For instance, the Croke Park agreement required further staff savings and there was a headcount reduction of about 230 staff.  Since then there have been reductions and savings on our prison Vote.</p></speech>

There was compulsory overtime before this was introduced.  The system had to work.  Middle management in prisons had the authority to call people in on overtime because they simply had no choice.  Escorts had to be provided for people to go to court.  People had to make hospital visits.  People at this stage were in an ever-increasing culture of overtime within most prisons, particularly the big ones.  Many people just wanted out of that in its entirety as well.</p></speech>

For clarity for people watching and for the record, under the annualised hours system, if one signs up for 360 hours, one gets paid for 360 hours.  If one happens to be in Arbour Hill Prison, for argument's sake, and 360 hours were not available but 220 were available, one would work for the 220 but be paid for 360.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The average is 15% around the country, but are there prisons where it is substantially higher than that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Waters" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#H00900"><p>The average has fallen back since 2015.  It is now in the order of about 9% across the country which, when broken down and the number of staff in all institutions taken into account, is on average about 24 hours on a yearly basis.  It varies very significantly from institution to institution.  The big closed institutions tend to have few or no write-off hours because there is a huge amount of work going on there with prisoners moving in and out, hospital visits, court visits, and so on.  A big write-off arises in respect of the open centres, Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  Does Mr. Donnellan want to speak on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Donnellan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#H01000"><p>To put it in perspective, the write-off is now down to 8%.  Take a comparison between Shelton Abbey and Cloverhill Prison, which the Comptroller and Auditor General looked at.  Cloverhill Prison is a full operating remand prison and is very busy with people going in and out all the time, all around the country.  The write-off there is negligible.  However, in Shelton Abbey we must remember that the total staff comprises only 50 officers, of whom 40 are on additional hours.  There are only 29 on the 360 band.  A very small number of staff proportionally are getting the benefit of the write-off in comparison to the vast numbers which are in our closed prisons.  One of the principles of the system was that there would be a write-off.  The write-off was always seen as part of smarter working and more efficient working where annualised hours in the private sector and the semi-State sector are concerned.  The write-off was always a feature of additional hours.</p></speech>

What has been done to try to address that?  Have there been negotiations with the unions?  Has it been a topic for discussion?</p></speech>

As can be seen following the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General, we have undertaken a review of the annualised hours, in particular on the methodology and allocation of additional hours and also alternative methodologies for the current annualised hours, AH, system.  It is important to say that this is an agreed system.  It has been agreed by all sides, so if we change it we have to change it by agreement with everybody.  The Deputy is right that it could be utilised more efficiently and at the current time, the AH is attracted to the officer rather than the need.</p></speech>

I would not attempt to underplay the difficulties that there will in terms of changing that.  The prison officers are very well represented by their union representatives.  Getting to where we are now took a very long time.  They operate on the basis, as one would expect of any union, of "what we have we hold".  We will have to negotiate that with them.  That is going to be an issue for us, but we are up for that.  If we can have independent evidence that can show that the system can work even better, and we await what the outcome of the review will be, I think we can take that forward.  It will be a tough fight.</p></speech>

We are also the founding member of the European Organisation of Prison and Correctional Services, EuroPris.  All prisons in Europe join it.  Some 30 prison systems are now part of EuroPris.  We can benchmark ourselves against those prisons, ask those prisons a question and get 29 answers back on a topic.  We have a lot of contact there.  More important, we are part of what is called a benchmarking group, which is made up of Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.  Our statisticians meet every year, and we benchmark ourselves against each other and against the same criteria.  For instance, the Council of Europe figures benchmark people for a whole range of staff who are not in the prison.  In Norway and Sweden, they have what is called the import model.  Many of their services are imported from the community, including health services, education services and work training services.  In our system, we hire our own work training officers and our own health services at the moment.  The only thing we import is education.  When we are benchmarked like for like, of who is inside the prison wall, this is what we get.</p><p>We see that Denmark has 1.1 prisoners to every member staff, Finland has 1.3, we have 1.2, the Netherlands has 0.9, and Norway and Sweden each have one for one.  Taken in that context, we are not too far out from the norm.  We were much better five years ago when we had massive overcrowding, but that was not effective, efficient or beneficial.  Communities were not safer when we had 30% more prisoners being managed by approximately the same number of prison officers.  The prison officer is the key change agent within a prison.  It is not the psychologist or psychiatrist; it is the class officer who intervenes with prisoners every day on the landing.  That is what can bring about massive change.  We are in the zone when compared with the other members of our benchmarking group.  If we want quality prisons, we have to pay for quality staff in appropriate numbers.  That is not to say we cannot be more efficient.</p></speech>

One can build very large prisons with perhaps 2,000 prisoners, as we have seen with the privatised facilities in our neighbouring jurisdiction, with very few staff and mostly automated systems.  However, that is not the Irish way.  We operate on the basis of having prisons located in and served by the local community.  Families of prisoners have committed no crime and need to be able to visit their loved ones.  Culturally, our position is much more in keeping with the Nordic model of smaller numbers, which does bring a cost with it.  That is broadly our policy.</p></speech>

For example, we have a prison in Cork that takes 275, one in Limerick that takes 200 and another in Castlerea in Roscommon that takes 350.  As the Secretary General indicated, in other states like Britain, those facilities would be amalgamated with much greater efficiencies.  However, we consider it important to have a regional structure.  We have made efficiencies and must continue to do so, particularly around technology.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that while there was a reduction post-2005, there had been a very steep rise between 2001 and 2005.  Why did sick leave increase in 2015?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Donnellan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#J00600"><p>Sick leave levels in 2013 and 2014 reduced on the back of central measures that were introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which implemented a reduction in sick leave entitlement for civil servants from six months to three months and so on.  That change led to a reduction in sick leave for 2013 and 2014.  In 2015, we saw a return to the sick leave level we currently have.  Benchmarking us against the group of other European countries in terms of total sick leave lost within the system, Ireland stands at 5.2% of all losses, Sweden is at 6.1%, the Netherlands has a figure of 6.5%, Norway is at 7.9%, and Finland's figure is 5.5%.  In other words, we are not doing too badly.  On average, there are 15 days of sick leave per officer per year.  If one strips out injury on duty and maternity-related sick leave, that comes down to 11 days per officer per year, which is not bad given the type of work prison officers have to do.  There is no comparison between their work and the work being done by a civil servant in an office.  We have a range of measures to tackle sick leave.  The levels are unacceptable and we are always trying to drive them down.  When the AH system was introduced, we saw a significant reduction in sick leave, and the 2015 figures should be viewed in that context.</p></speech>

There are three types of such claims.  The first is where a prisoner challenges the validity of the order holding him or her in prison.  Second, prisoners can take a challenge against us for a decision we make about them on behalf of the Minister.  In the case of a decision on entitlement to one third remission, for example, a prisoner can take a challenge to the High Court, as some have done, which is very expensive.  The third claim prisoners can take is where they consider their regime to be incompatible with their human rights.  For instance, gangland prisoners who are kept separate from other people and prisoners who are allowed only screen visits might  challenge that in the High Court.  In such cases, we would have to appoint matching counsel and defend the case.  Those are the costs associated with non-compensation.  Much of the total is made up by legal costs, but a small part is for compensation awards to prisoners.  These are sometimes given for very pragmatic reasons where, say, we get advice that it is not worth defending a challenge at a cost of &euro;100,000 and it would be better to pay &euro;10,000.</p></speech>

These cases can relate to paternity leave, maternity leave or sick leave.  We run the payroll on Tuesday to be paid for the following Thursday week.  That will be corrected within the following pay cycle.  Approximately 18% of our overpayments are natural overpayments that are corrected in the next cycle.</p> <p>  The next group arise from our errors in respect of the effective communication between the prisons, our payroll section and the Paymaster General in respect of paying salaries.</p> <p>  The main point on overpayments is that we recoup all overpayments.</p></speech>

Our view is that we were not picking up the faults.  We have a robust system now.  We have dedicated staff watching overpayment.  Reconciliation takes place twice per year.  We get back 98% of overpayments.  Short of someone leaving the country or not being on a pension, we take it back.</p></speech>

It was difficult to find a measure throughout the system because each Department was running its own payroll.  Now, it has been centralised.  One of the key issues is to get the figure as close to zero as possible.  That will be difficult given the structural nature of our payroll systems.  Payroll systems are run, in some cases, two weeks in advance of the payment.  It is difficult to change that.  It requires major structural and information technology change.  All Accounting Officers are concerned about the level of payroll overpayments.</p></speech>

Under proprietary goods, there were 14 cases valued at &euro;2.4 million.  Proprietary goods in the prison system include our locking system and our time and attendance system.  These are bespoke systems and have historical context.  We have to replace all our locking with the same company.  They are the proprietary cases.</p> <p>  We had seven cases at a value of &euro;3.4 million.</p></speech>

We are also developing a bespoke time and attendance system.  This will get rid of the time and attendance legacy issue.</p> <p>  Under the Office of Government Procurement we had seven cases in 2015 at a value of &euro;3.4 million.  I am happy to report that in six of those cases, contracts are now in place and one is in the making.</p> <p>  The third issue relates to roll-over contracts and there were six cases under this heading.  Now, we have contracts in place for the majority.  In these cases the facilities in our procurement system were not available to go out to tender.  The contract was rolled-over to pull off the contract for a further few months.</p></speech>

We have no reason to get into dispute with the Comptroller and Auditor General on that point.  However, we need to put some context on the discussion.  When this was happening, it was a programme of fundamental or transformational change in the prison system.  At the same time, numbers were spiralling upwards and they had to be managed.  Allied to that, the Prison Service headquarters was moving from Dublin to Longford.  This meant there was practically a 100% changeover of staff.  Almost 100% of the staff who ended up in Longford had not been in the headquarters in Dublin, although I stand to be corrected on that.  All of that had to be managed as well.  At the same time, the prison system had to function.</p><p>We take the point entirely.  We do need to go right into the guts of this again now in the context of-----</p></speech>

There are various aspects, as restorative justice is quite a wide family.

We are constantly saying that in order to stop people falling out of society and into prison we need early intervention and at the earliest possible time.  People end up in the justice system but the justice system has to pick up all of the pieces.  It is the education system, the housing system and the social welfare system.  As highlighted by the penal policy review group, we need a joined-up-Government approach to drive down imprisonment rates.  We have started to do that in Ireland for the first time.  A whole-of-Government approach to penal policy is very innovative.</p></speech>

I would also like to deal with the issue of sick leave, which is important.  What impact does the physical environment of the job of prison officers, the conditions under which they work and stress have on sick leave?  Could the witnesses please elaborate on that?</p></speech>

To answer the Deputy's first question about prison officer sick leave, there is no doubt but that the huge pressure on prison officers during those early years - 2003 to 2005, inclusive - to do compelled overtime correlated hugely with the number of days of sick leave taken simply because of the pressure on people.  They just could not keep going.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's second question, prison is a stressful environment.  Suicides, self-harm, violence and all sorts of other pains go on within prisons each and every day, so the stress factor in prison is well known.</p></speech>

I refer Mr. Donnellan to chapter 2.33 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in which sick leave in individual prisons is detailed.

We are rolling out a critical incident stress management policy which is in place in the Defence Forces and the fire brigade to help them deal with specific critical incidents, such as being injured, finding somebody self-harming or finding somebody who has committed suicide.  We have introduced a free counselling service for our staff so they can now self-refer to that service and receive assistance in dealing with the stresses within the working environment.  We are also rolling out some training with our psychology service on building resilience within our staff.  This is certainly something we acknowledge and something we are specifically, under our new strategy, attempting to support our staff on.</p></speech>

Picking up from what Deputy Cullinane was saying, I was struck by what Mr. Donnellan said about prisons being the new lunatic asylums.  It is difficult to hear that in terms of the morale of the prison staff.  No more than a parent looking after a child - he or she must be in a good place in order to rear the child - prison staff are the keepers of the prisoners.  It is extremely important - and I am glad to hear from Ms McCaffrey - that counselling services are available and that the Irish Prison Service has a plan in this regard.  I have no doubt that the increase in the amount of sick leave taken in 2015 is directly as a result of the working environment of prison staff.  It is a really onerous job.  I do not practise criminal law but I have been in a few prisons to represent family law clients and have spoken to the staff there and know the pressures they are under.  It is absolutely vital that the Department provide resources for prison staff in order to keep them going because we are all human beings.  I know, even from dealing with the area of law with which I dealt - criminal law is a whole other ballgame - that the working environment in the latter is extremely stressful.  This must be the paramount consideration.  Are the services Ms McCaffrey outlined available now or is it a plan-----</p></speech>

They were introduced last year.  We have an employee assistance service and local officers in each of the prisons who work with our national service to provide dedicated support to the staff.  I would like to acknowledge the work they do on the ground.  These efforts are to supplement the efforts being made within the prisons already.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Donnellan or Mr. Waters mentioned recidivism - I can never pronounce that word - and the fact that it has seen a reduction to 45% and that the norm in the Nordic countries is 35%.  These matters are all interlinked.  If we are to go in the right direction, that is the way to do it.  I am talking about the rehabilitation not just of prisoners, but also of the staff.</p> <p>  The story of the cash going missing in Limerick - the &euro;10,000 - was like reading something out of a Flann O'Brien novel.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not reference what year this occurred.  I know there were cash shortfalls back in 2009 and 2010, but the &euro;10,000 in Limerick was a significant amount.  I know from the Criminal Courts of Justice, CCJ, that if there is a bail officer, money is paid over and a receipt is given through a glass screen.  Does Mr. Donnellan know if a receipt was given in this instance?  Was an investigation carried out?  It is a significant amount of money.  Was it given in cash as opposed to a cheque?</p></speech>

It was brought to our attention by the governor of Limerick Prison, who, doing the checks and balances, realised a sum of &euro;10,000 was missing.  An audit took place, a forensic audit was undertaken as well and the governor concluded that &euro;10,000 cash was missing.  It was impossible to say with certainty how the money disappeared or was misappropriated, but the governor felt it was bail money.  It is not unusual for the Prison Service to receive bail money and it is not unusual for it to receive &euro;10,000 in cash for bail money.  We would much prefer not to receive bail money this way.

In 2016, approximately 8,300 people were committed to prison for non-payment of fines.  The year before that the number was almost 10,000.  Most of those are brought to the prison, turned around and let go.  Mr. Donnellan can talk about that process.  That is a huge administrative burden, apart from the message it sends to the system.  Legislation was passed in 2015 which was operational in January 2016.  We already see a small impact as the number has fallen from almost 10,000 to 8,300.  The life cycle of a fine ordinarily is between one and three years.  We expect the number to decrease further in the next two to three years.  Under the old system people were fined &euro;300 for not having a television licence or not taxing their cars and were given three months in prison in default.  That has gone.  The first option now is to pay instalments.  Last year approximately 2,000 people opted to do that.</p></speech>

We exclude our fines cases, otherwise they would skew our figures completely.  In a typical year, last year we would have nearly 18,000 committals, almost half of them are fines cases.  The anticipated benefit when those cases come out of the system in the future will be the whole washing through of people who come into prison, who are brought from outlying places in Ireland to a prison to be processed in to and be taken out.  Some of the fines would be very small, television licences, other small fines.</p></speech>

By and large the people who default on fines never get into the prison system.  However in cases of people with revenue related fines or fines for selling cigarettes, which is a big business, they would be kept in prison.  As the Secretary General said, this will reduce dramatically because there are about five stages to go through to get into prison under the new system.  The major option is community service, so people can do community service in lieu of their fine.</p></speech>

I was provided with the figures and it separated out the number on maternity leave, which obviously has to be factored in if one is going to change the gender balance in any workplace.  One can factor in a ratio for maternity leave.  I wish to raise the number on long-term sick leave in a particular institution, Cloverhill Prison.  I know the numbers can be quite small, however the numbers on long-term sick leave are fairly constant in one prison, whereas one would expect that number to rise and fall.</p> <p>  Is there a procedure to pick out figures in certain categories to find out what is happening.  For example is the prison more dangerous, is there a management tool to target it or how does one deal with it?</p></speech>

We work on a constant ongoing basis with the management teams in our prisons.  We have a monthly meeting with the HR governors and, twice a year, our attendance management team will go into the prison.  We are looking at the profile of people who are absent on sick leave.  Obviously in respect of some of those long-term sick leave cases, there are people who have very genuine serious illnesses and are absent from work.  We are hoping we can support them.  In terms of absenteeism, and the people who are in and out of sick leave, we manage the cases at prison level in consultation with the local team to ensure that we are on top of the issue.</p></speech>

Are there any particular initiatives on the wish list that could achieve significant reductions in the prison population?</p></speech>

We know that the first 24 hours of a former prisoner's life in the community after leaving prison is the most dangerous.  It is the point when he or she falls back into reoffending.  We must ensure that we put resources into not just finishing with people at the gate but supporting their journey through the gate and into the community.  We would have a sizeable number of people in prison today who could be out of prison but we do not release them from prison because we would simply be releasing them to homelessness.  We have teams of people that we fund who are helping to manage the transition.  The top priority on our wish list is that people who come out of prison would have proper accommodation, would get their social welfare payment and their medical card quickly, so that they would be hooked back into society.  Therefore they can be sustained through support.  Female offenders have completely different needs from male offenders, and it is very much the case that we in the Prison Service with our probation colleagues need to provide step-down facilities for people coming out of prison rather than simply hoping that everything will work out when they leave prison.  This is where we are putting the major emphasis from now on.  That will reduce recidivism and will stop people spiralling back into prison.</p></speech>

The elimination of overcrowding and the annualised hours have greatly helped the Prison Service to have the resources available to do that type of work.  Ten or 15 years ago that would have been unthinkable because the entire focus of the prison system was on managing as best it could the secure containment of large numbers of people in prison and with very little regard to dealing with other issues.  The staff did what they had to do and primarily it was to ensure that people were kept in safe custody.  There were a great many incapacities around the system but these are being addressed.</p> <p>  The idea that somebody would be released from prison into homelessness is automatically saying to him or her to go off and commit more crime.  We simply have to break the cycle.  We are involving other Departments across Government to see what we can do better around that type of system.</p></speech>

Many delegations from European countries have come to visit us.  Where a prisoner has finished half his or her six year sentence, during which time he or she has been involved in education, work training, and he or she is drug free is really helping to reduce his or her recidivism.  They can then be risk assessed by the probation service to serve the remaining period of their prison sentence in the community.  We call it "community return".  That has been really successful.  More than 1,600 people have been released through community return with a compliance rate of about 89%.  This initiative is settling people from prison back into the community.  That is the major emphasis.  There is no doubt that the European countries that we look towards are the Nordic countries, Norway and Sweden.  We look particularly to Finland, a country very similar to ours, where they have made dramatic changes in their prison system in the past 15 years.  They have much more low security and open type prisons.  That is something we need to look at.  Do we need everybody in medium to high security prisons?  There are lots of lesson we can learn from our colleagues in Europe.  Equally they learn from us because we are all learning together.</p></speech>

The motivation for building in Thornton Hall was that at that time Mountjoy Prison, which was the State's premier prison, was simply not fit for purpose.</p><p>It was subject to the most searing criticism by international groups and the European committee for the prevention of torture.  Slopping out was endemic in the prison and it was vastly overcrowded.  It was an appalling situation.</p><p> The decision was taken by the prison's interim board and supported by the then Government that a new prison would be built at Thornton.  It would incorporate the entire Mountjoy complex, be on a greenfield site and Mountjoy would be sold off ultimately to pay for the development.  The prison would also include facilities for the Central Mental Hospital and, at one stage, the then Forensic Science Laboratory.  To pay for the site, the open prison at Shanganagh, surplus to requirements of the Prison Service, was sold.  The cost of the site was &euro;29 million and the sale of Shanganagh also made &euro;29 million.</p><p> It is a long story; I am giving the potted version of it.  Ultimately, due to the economic crash, the prison at Thornton did not proceed.  It had become completely unaffordable from what it was set out as.  In the meantime, we had to do something in respect of Mountjoy.  Significant capital works were carried out there at greatly reduced costs which have turned it into a fit-for-purpose prison, unlike what it was 12 years ago.</p></speech>

Obviously, the hospital is directly across the road from the prison, so it is our preferred option.  However, this is not a policy area that we can influence.  We can only give the facts in terms of how many prisoners go over to the hospital on a daily basis, how many ambulances are called to the Midlands Prison on a weekly basis, how many emergencies or cardiac cases we have and so forth.

They are both in Romania and there are warrants out for their arrest.  We know where they are and they will eventually come back to serve the rest of their sentences.  They have written to us to plead their case but the reality is that if someone absconds from an Irish prison, he or she must come back.  They will be caught at the borders.  They cannot go to England or anywhere else because their names and pictures will flash up.</p></speech>

We were supplied with a briefing note on the outturn for salaries, wages and allowances in 2014, which was &euro;236 million, including a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;5 million.  The outturn in 2015 was &euro;235 million.  I see that the estimated outturn for 2016 is &euro;230 million.  It is good to see a reduction of &euro;5 million and I ask the witnesses to explain that.

We were paying fewer staff in 2016 than in 2015.  The staffing figure at the end of 2016 was 3,215, compared with 3,308 at the end of 2015.

That point has not been made yet.  There is a recruitment campaign under way at the moment through which we expect to hire 80 new prison staff, which will be the first recruitment into the prison system since 2008.  That will obviously bring a welcome injection of new blood into the system.  It is my understanding that there was a very significant level of interest, with almost 7,000 people applying.  That will be whittled down to an initial 80, which will bring our staff numbers back up.  As I said, numbers have fallen fairly dramatically since the high point back in 2007.</p></speech>

Finally, Mr. Donnellan mentioned step-down facilities and probation.  I ask him to elaborate on that further.

We all know about people in homeless hostels and it is sad to think that some people are still in prison because they are homeless.  Are there many in that category?</p></speech>

We can talk about recidivism, community service and so forth but there is not much point in releasing people if they end up back to square one.</p></speech>

If people out in the streets are being accommodated properly, which is beginning to happen, that will have a positive impact in that they will not be committing petty crimes and be remanded or committed to prison for short periods.  That is the positive side of the issue.  Anything that can happen positively in the community will have an impact in the prisons.  Notwithstanding that, we always have a range of people in prison who have come from homelessness and who have no place to go.  A lot of the people who have come into prison and have come off drugs really do not want to go back out to what they would call an "ordinary" hostel.  They want to go back out to a place that is drug-free and where they are given support.  That is where we are putting our new emphasis and focus.  We are trying to ensure that we do not release people into homelessness any more.  At any given time in the D&oacute;chas Centre, the women's prison, there would be three or four women who could be in the community but for the fact that they do not have accommodation.  They do not have a safe place to go and all the evidence is that they would be back in prison within 24 hours.  In that context, we would prefer to keep them safe and plan their release rather than simply releasing them.</p></speech>

Mr. Donnellan spoke about the Probation Service.  How advanced is that?  I ask the witnesses to provide a detailed note on it.  Mr. Donnellan also mentioned step-down facilities.  Such facilities are essential.  Some communities might not want to hear this, but step-down services are fundamental-----</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has been very exercised about this and we, in conjunction with the Probation Service, have invited expressions of interest to provide such facilities on a not-for-profit basis.  We are looking for non-profit, voluntary organisations to provide high-quality, supervised accommodation for women.  We are very hopeful that we can create ten spaces this year in the community for women in Dublin.</p></speech>

That will go to contract later this year and the building will start early next year.  Again, it will be a regional response for women.

Measures are in place to address the issues people have.  They include the community return programme, community service system and the programmes of the Probation Service.  It is not a case whereby the door is open, out they go and we say we do not want to see them again.</p></speech>

I will address the point about housing.  The issue has been examined in the context of the housing situation, in particular, whether there would be a value or a use for the site in that context.  That is a matter for other people.  One concern we have, taking a whole-of-Government approach, is that it is a large site.  We have learned lessons in Ireland about planning major housing developments in one particular area.</p></speech>

A site of 160 acres is sitting empty.  It is no justification to say that major housing projects have not worked out.  That is not an answer to a question about a site of 160 acres bought at &euro;29 million.  I have a reaction when I hear that.  Major housing developments often got into trouble because of complete lack of input from local authorities, including those in Limerick, Dublin and Galway.</p></speech>

There are three avenues into it, the two main ones being the Prison Service and the Courts Service.  Prisoners who suffer with mental health issues would be referred by the prisons, admitted, treated and then returned to prison, while people who were found not guilty by reason of insanity or unfit to plead would be referred by the courts straight to the Central Mental Hospital.  There would be also be a small number of cases of people with a very severe mental illness being transferred from a normal or non-forensic facility into the Central Mental Hospital.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting me to attend today to discuss this important issue.</p> <p>  The topic of today's discussion is the subject of ongoing litigation before the European courts involving the State, Apple and the European Commission.  As a result, I am required to fully respect the constraints placed on me by both Irish and EU law as regards public discussion on open legal proceedings.  This means that I will not be able to engage in a substantive discussion on material that relates to either the investigation or the legal appeal.  This includes, although is not restricted to, the following: the State's annulment application; the opening decision; the final decision; any documents and exchanges with the Commission during the investigation; and any underlying facts with which the investigation was concerned.  The committee will be aware that these matters also refer to the private and commercially sensitive business operations of an identified taxpayer, namely Apple.  It is important to give due account to this today also.  That said, I am conscious of the importance of the work of the committee and trust that the members will take full account of the legal parameters that underpin my ability to speak today.</p> <p>  Over the past number of years, the Competition Directorate of the European Commission has been gathering information from all member states on tax rulings.  So far, it has examined more than 1,000 rulings across Europe.  Ireland has always complied with such requests &ndash; which are issued on an ongoing basis to all member states &ndash; and we will continue to do so as we believe we have nothing to hide.  Aside from Apple, no other state aid cases have been opened against Ireland and the Commission has not indicated that any further state aid investigations will be initiated in respect of Ireland.</p> <p>  The European Commission's final decision in the Apple case marked the end of a three-year process.  The Commission first wrote to Ireland in June of 2013 asking for information on the practice of tax rulings in Ireland.  In particular, the Commission requested the information on any rulings granted in favour of Apple.</p><p>The process was later formalised as a full investigation into the dealings between the State and Apple.  That happened in June 2014.  Ireland co-operated fully with the Commission&rsquo;s inquiries.  Over the course of those three years, detailed and comprehensive responses were provided to the Commission demonstrating Ireland&rsquo;s view that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged.  No selective advantage was given, and there was no state aid.  In August 2016, the Commission announced that the Apple investigation was concluded and that it had reached a negative decision.  At the same time, the Commission privately sent a detailed and technical legal document to the State setting out the analysis that underpinned its conclusion.  This was published in December 2016 and the committee will have seen that the Commission has three distinct and indeed contradictory bases for the negative conclusion.  Its primary line of reasoning is that Ireland should have taxed all the worldwide profits of the two non-resident companies.  This is the heart of the final decision and the basis for the enormous recovery amount estimated publicly by the Commission.  The second and subsidiary line of reasoning is that the Irish branches of the companies should have paid more Irish tax than they did on the basis of a different transfer pricing methodology.  This is only referred to in outline in the final decision and the Commission has not specified a basis for calculating the recovery amount on this basis, although it would likely be significantly smaller than under the primary line of reasoning.  The third alternative line of reasoning is that the Irish legislation allowed the Revenue Commissioners to exercise discretion which conferred a selective advantage on Apple.  This is also only referred to in the final decision and the Commission has not specified a basis for calculating the recovery amount on this basis.</p><p> In September, the Government decided to appeal the Commission decision to the European courts.  This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.  As I have already explained, I am mindful of the need to avoid cutting across Ireland&rsquo;s legal case in my contribution today.  In the interest of being as transparent as possible, in December my Department published a summary of the legal pleas we have lodged in this case, which also explain what each plea means.  I, therefore, do not propose to repeat those here today or to expand up these points.  I will leave them to be debated before the courts.  That said, it is important that I outline, in high-level terms, what I believe are the key persuasive arguments for taking an appeal.</p><p> It is untrue that Ireland provided favourable tax treatment to Apple.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has stated emphatically that there was no departure from the applicable Irish tax law by Revenue; there was no preference shown in applying that law; and the full tax due was paid in accordance with the law.  It is important to take this seriously, as it is very damaging for our reputation to be called into question in this way.  This affects how Ireland could be treated by other jurisdictions, damages Ireland&rsquo;s credibility in the international tax debate and inhibits Ireland in pressing arguments that serve its national interest.  A further concern is that the Commission is undermining the fundamental principle of international law that tax should be paid where the value is created.  The central aspect of this case is that the economic activity that created the value in Apple&rsquo;s business operations was not conducted in Ireland.  Everyone knows that the iPhone and other well-known Apple products were developed in the US, not Ireland.  Our tax legislation, which reflects international norms, only allows us to tax non-resident companies on the profits they make in Ireland.  As a result, the bulk of Apple&rsquo;s profits were not subject to Irish tax.  In the decision, the Commission is attempting to rewrite Irish corporation tax legislation.  Taxation is a core member state competence, which is enshrined in the EU treaties.  This decision encroaches on member state sovereignty in the area of tax by extending competition rules into the tax area to an unprecedented and unjustified extent.  In doing this the Commission creates uncertainty for business and investment in the European economy, both in its novel interpretation of longstanding rules and its unfair retroactive application.</p><p> It is important to emphasise that the bringing of appeal proceedings is not in any way an endorsement of aggressive tax planning arrangements nor is it a defence of the extremely low effective tax rates that can be achieved under the broken international tax system.  It is the mismatch between the applications of the law in at least two tax jurisdictions that allows certain multinational companies to pay such low levels of tax globally.  The reaction to the Apple decision has, at times, painted an outdated and unfair caricature of Ireland&rsquo;s position on tax that is at odds with the evidence and overlooks our proven track record in recent years.  The facts show our constructive engagement at the international table, with early implementation of reforms ahead of many of our partner countries.  This has been confirmed by the head of the OECD, Angel Gurr&iacute;a, and was conformed more recently to this committee by the tax Commissioner, Pierre Moscovici.  Despite the decision, Ireland remains committed to international efforts to reform international tax rules to ensure the correct tax is paid by multinationals in the correct place.  Our view remains that it is important that this is done in the appropriate way, moving forward in tandem with other countries on the basis of a global consensus.</p><p> On foot of the Commission's decision, and notwithstanding the appeal, Ireland is legally required to recover the alleged state aid from Apple.  In the press release for the announcement, the Commission said that it expects that the amount of aid totals &euro;13 billion, plus EU interest.  However, as members will have seen, there is no such figure in the final decision and instead Ireland is required to calculate the sums on the basis of the methodology set out in the decision.  This looks back over a ten-year period for two companies and involves over 20 separate computations, taking into account any relevant tax paid in other jurisdictions.  The EU interest provisions are then applied to the amounts applying a methodology that is set out in an EU Directive.  It is too early to speculate on what the final figure will be as it requires complex calculations, but this work has been ongoing since September 2016 in co-operation with the Commission and Apple.</p><p> Some of the public debate on the case has been to the effect that Ireland should take the money and spend it.  The Government disagrees with this position and is instead exploring how to place the sums in a ringfenced escrow fund pending the outcome of legal proceedings.  It would be irresponsible and extremely short-sighted to consider the decision as a windfall for the State.  An appeal has now been lodged that questions the validity of the Commission&rsquo;s decision under EU law.  As a result, there is a genuine question of who is entitled to these sums.  If the appeal is successful then we will have to repay Apple.  Based on the Commission&rsquo;s view that the recovery sums may be reduced if other countries were to require Apple to pay more taxes, the ultimate entitlement of Ireland to this money in the face of competing claims from other jurisdictions is highly uncertain.  We simply cannot spend money that we are not confident we are entitled to.  Irish officials are currently negotiating the terms of such an escrow fund which may be established by a commercial contract with Apple, subject to the views of the Commission.  The terms of such an escrow fund are subject to confidential and commercially sensitive considerations and as a result I am not in a position to discuss them at this time.  I will provide an update on the contract and the figures involved when the process has been concluded in the coming months.</p><p> The formal deadline set out in the decision for recovery is 3 January 2017, which has now passed.  It is not unusual and not at all uncommon for member states to require more time for recovery.  For example, the Starbucks case related to an estimated &euro;20 million to &euro;30 million and took much longer than four months specified to be recovered.  We therefore requested an extension, noting the complexities involved in the Apple decision and the fact that the four-month deadline imposed is the usual state aid deadline without any recognition to the magnitude of the recovery in our case.</p><p>While the Commission has not formally granted an extension, it did confirm that it is satisfied with Ireland's progress on this issue to date.  This committee heard Commissioner Vestager attest to that fact herself this week.  Work has long been ongoing to ensure that the State complies with the recovery obligations and this will continue in regular contact with the Commission to ensure that it remains satisfied with Ireland&rsquo;s progress.</p><p> In conclusion, the Government is of the view that there was no breach of state aid rules in this case and that the legislative provisions were correctly applied.  By appealing the decision, the Government is taking the necessary course of action to vigorously defend Ireland's position.  Ireland has done nothing wrong.  We have a proven track record in international tax reform and a strong commitment to meeting the best international standards.  As I said earlier, I am mindful not to damage the important appeal that is now before the European courts, but I will engage with the committee to the fullest extent possible.</p></speech>

I understand the constraints he is under in the context of discussing this matter.  I have a couple of broad points to make.  Among the reasons given for taking the appeal against the Apple tax ruling and for the refusal to collect the money was that it may not all belong to Ireland.  In light of Commissioner Vestager's comment that the vast majority of unpaid taxes would be due in Ireland and not to another EU country, does the Minister for Finance now accept that this can no longer be offered as a valid reason to go ahead with the appeal?  I cite France and Germany in particular, both of which have clearly stated that they have no claim whatsoever to this tax.  Can we take that reason off the table at this stage in the context of why we should appeal?</p></speech>

I do not know if the Senator has read the full decision by the Commission.  The latter referenced this as a possibility.  There was an accompanying press statement which also said that some of the &euro;13 billion - if that is the correct figure - might be due to other countries.  At ECOFIN, Spain and Austria have publicly said that they are considering making claims.  It had become a political issue in Austria around the time of that first ECOFIN meeting, when the opposition in that country was demanding that the Government there should seek claims.  The difficulty about this is that it suited the Commission that other countries would come in and start demanding extra tax from Apple.  It meant that Ireland would be left with few friends when other people around the table thought there was a windfall due to their countries.  From a public relations point of view, the Commission was very clever in its presentation and it seems to me that the Commission is now rowing back from that position.  What it wrote, however, is what it wrote and what it put in the report is what it put in the report.  There is another trap also, which I am sure the committee has seen, where if a country on continental Europe was to pursue a claim to the effect that it was entitled to part of the &euro;13 billion because tax that accrued to Ireland subsequently should have been paid in its jurisdiction, would it not then be opening itself up to a similar state-aid inquiry?  If such countries did not collect the appropriate amount of tax from Apple in their jurisdictions, does that not constitute the very essence of state aid?</p></speech>

I am simply saying that the assertion that there could be third-country claims to the &euro;13 billion - if that is the figure - was much stronger on the day the decision was made in late August and was more emphatic in the accompanying press statement.  It was also reflected in the full report that was published in December.  The Commissioner is now putting a lighter emphasis on that but she may have had further information on the issue.  As the Senator stated, France and Germany have already said they are not entering claims and this may have reinforced her opinion that it is not a big issue.  My point is that it had been made a big issue initially.</p></speech>

The Commissioner has said that there is a possibility that countries which believe that Apple did not pay sufficient tax in their jurisdictions could make claims against the escrow account of the &euro;13 billion when this is all resolved, if that is the way it goes.  We cannot take it off the table because we would probably be subject to legal proceedings if that is the way it goes.</p></speech>

The Commissioner also confirmed that there are no further open investigations into tax arrangements in Ireland or elsewhere.  Does this prove that the investigation into Apple's operation in Ireland was not an attempt to get at Ireland's corporation tax through the backdoor and that it just happened to involve one of the world's biggest companies?  Does the Minister accept her verdict in that?</p></speech>

The first opinion was in 1991, which is 26 years ago.  The Senator may recall, if she has done some research into corporation tax, that Apple came to Ireland in 1980.  Right through the 1980s - like other exporting companies - it had export sales relief.  Export sales relief meant that exporting manufacturing companies paid zero tax.  Under Irish law, no manufacturing company that was exporting paid tax.  This exemption was given by the European authorities under state-aid rules.  Apple manufactured right through the 1980s, principally in Cork, and it did not pay tax because that was the agreement around export sales relief.  It was only in and around 1991 that Apple began to come into the tax net.  It was at that point Apple looked for an opinion on what its tax liability would be under the new rules.</p><p>If one traces it through the 1990s, first there was a 10% rate, which applied to manufacturing industries that were exporting.  There was a case that ran all the way to the Supreme Court involving McCanns, the banana people.  They asked to define the machine turning bananas to ripen them on the other side as a manufacturing activity.  They won their case.  I am speaking from memory now so members should not take this as a legal opinion but this is the story.  As a result of that it was extended to all manufacturing companies.  Manufacturing was defined very widely and included packaging, for example.  Putting teas in tea bags would have been within the exemption or mechanically turning bananas over to ripen them.  When one is trying to get a fix on what actually happened in 1991, there is a totally different context under Irish tax law.  Revenue is absolutely categoric that the methodology it used was fully in accordance with Irish law.</p></speech>

The opinion of Revenue was that the profits made by non-resident companies were not amenable to Irish tax.  They were amenable to tax back where the parent companies were in the United States.  The assumption was that while Apple did not pay tax on the profits which were accrued to the United States, they had a tax liability at 35% but that tax liability would only be crystallised into tax paid if the profits were repatriated to the United States.  There was no attempt by the Irish authorities to open gaps or doors or anything else for Apple.  We were very surprised that several years later there is a retrospective reach by the Commission in a way it had never done before.  That is what we are appealing.</p></speech>

The Deputy has dealt with Commissioners.  It is a political forum where the political impact of what it does is assessed as well.  It is part of the way Europe is run.  I do not think it was focusing on Ireland in particular.  It shares a view that I shared, and which I still share, that multinational companies, because of the mismatch of tax law in different jurisdictions, are not paying the amount of tax they should be paying.  That is not the issue.  I do not think Apple was paying sufficient tax worldwide.  The argument is that the tax liability was not in Ireland; it was where the economic activity occurred.  One can see the big debate that is starting again in the United States about reforming US corporation tax.  To answer the Deputy's question on whether the Commission was having a go at Ireland, I would say not particularly.  The issue was to give an edge to the reforms being conducted principally by the OECD but also by the Commission so that these mismatches, which give rise to a reduction in the payment of taxes, could be taken out of the system.  It was not particularly directed against Ireland.</p></speech>

The judges are not as familiar with common law and we are a common law jurisdiction.  Sometimes when these things are discussed there is a mismatch between the opinions because they are coming at it from a different legal perspective.  Someone asked one of our officials lately why there are not court cases about tax in Ireland.  As the Deputy knows, under common law, once one gets the first court case, it creates precedent.  They do not have that in European jurisdictions frequently where one goes to court again.  The concept of precedent seems to be beyond the remit of some of the people who are dealing with these things.</p></speech>

The &euro;13 billion was the estimate it gave when it were describing what had happened.  It included a method of calculation on the primary case.  In the work that has been conducted to date by the Revenue Commissioners and in sharing the information with the Department, I understand there is no strong reason to disagree that it will not land at &euro;13 billion or thereabouts.  It is a ballpark figure.  I will read the Deputy the note.</p><blockquote>The recovery sums represent what, in the European Commission's view, is the amount of additional tax that would have been paid over the past ten years had Ireland applied the European's Commission's referred methodology.  The recovery sum also applies interest to those amounts. </blockquote> <p>The Commission decision sets out its supporting rationale and the basis for making this calculation.  However, there is no such figure in the final decision and instead Ireland is required to calculate the sums on the basis of the methodology set out in the decision.  The work has been ongoing since September 2016 in co-operation with the Commission and Apple but so far my officials have not indicated to me that it will seriously over-run the &euro;13 billion or come seriously short of it.  There are other years to be assessed. </p></speech>

Can the Minister comment on that?  Does he know how long NAMA has been using the section 110 tax structure?  Given that this is a very large liability for a period of some four months, does it raise question marks about the estimates of Revenue and the Department of Finance which were that the closing of the loophole would only bring in a total of &euro;50 million for 2017?</p></speech>

We did not investigate how Apple organised its operations.  We did not investigate the cost-sharing agreements.  We did not investigate the fact that Apple records its profits in Cork, Ireland.<br /><br />We were looking at whether the allocation of profits was recorded in the branch and whether, therefore, it had to be taxed in Ireland, or recorded in the stateless headquarters and, therefore, not to be taxed in Ireland.  We found that the recordings by Apple, which we did not question, could not be supported by economic activity.  That is why they ought to be recorded in the branch of the company that is taxable in Ireland.</blockquote> <p>I am trying to reconcile, in my own mind, the statement made by the Department of Finance on the Irish branches of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe.  Can the Minister give us an opinion on the Commissioner's statement, particularly on the stateless headquarters and the activity levels she says were not supported by economic activity?</p></speech>

These companies are not Irish tax resident.  Our tax legislation, which reflects international norms, only allows us to tax non-resident companies on the profits they make in Ireland.  The central aspect of this case is that the economic activity that created the value in Apple's business operation was not conducted in Ireland.  Everybody knows that the iPhone and other well-known Apple products were developed in the US, not in Ireland.  The bulk of the profits, therefore, were not Ireland's to tax.</p> <p>  The central point of Ireland's response is that the 12.5% tax rate was applied to the Irish branch and that was all that could be subject to Irish tax under the legislation.  That is what Revenue did.  Ireland is not seeking to defend the outcome achieved by the company but I can be clear that Ireland received all the tax that was due under Irish law.  Importantly, the amount of tax correctly reflects the economic reality of the activity taking place in Cork.  The underpinning issue from Ireland's point of view is that the OECD has laid down the rule of what should be taxed.  The profits that accrue from economic activity in a particular location are liable to tax in that location.  The members probably have Apple phones themselves and if their eyesight is good enough they can read the little italic mark in the back which states that it is designed in California and manufactured in China.  This shows where the economic activity is.  Non-resident companies under Irish law are not liable to tax on profits accrued elsewhere.</p> <p>  The Commissioner is not giving a tax opinion but a state aid opinion.  That will be the subject of the case.  Apple paid its tax on all its profits in Ireland and last year it was one of the biggest corporate taxpayers in the country.</p></speech>

If I interpret it correctly, in dealing with activity levels in Ireland, they are actually putting a value on the intellectual property, or they are at least stating it to be economic activity.

I am not competent to answer that.  In the public presentation of the case, the Commission and its spokespersons have always said that, effectively, one cannot stand over a case where the biggest company in the world is paying 0.01% or an amount of that nature - a figure which the Commission has put into the public domain.  Of course, that is true and I would not stand over it either.  The point is that Apple had a liability of 35% for the profits that accrued in the United States but under the law in that jurisdiction, the tax liability only crystalises if the company repatriates the property.  Okay, the company did not pay tax.  My view is as follows.  We have been doing it for three years now and those who have taken part in the debates on finance legislation know that we are progressively changing the law, and we have done so reasonably successfully without scaring anybody.  The point is that tax avoidance occurs when there is a mismatch.  It takes two to tango and unless it is done internationally, the issue is not resolved.  This is to put all the burden on Ireland for tax liabilities accruing in other jurisdictions.  I do not see why I or the Revenue Commissioners should be responsible for collecting tax on Apple's profits in the United States, Austria or Spain.  It does not make sense that a small country such as Ireland should have that burden put on it.  That is part of the case we are going to fight.</p></speech>

We are talking about economic rights and not intellectual property.  I would appreciate if the Minister answered the questions.  My contention is that economic rights for all sales of Apple products outside of the Americas rested with an Irish-registered company.  That would not alter the Commission's argument one iota.  The Commission's argument is that because of where the economic rights lay, it was impossible for them to be assigned to that company because it had no staff and physical presence.</p><p>There was no way to deal with risk or any other management issues and therefore it had to be the branch.  Does the Minister dispute the sworn evidence by Tim Cook and others before the US hearing that as far back as the 1980s, the economic rights of Apple products rested in an Irish-registered company as a result of a profit-sharing agreement with Apple that was entered into again in 2008 and signed by Tim Cook as CEO of Apple, along with his vice president and one other financial director? </p></speech>

The point I am making to the Minister is that it is standard practice that if the intellectual property for products sold worldwide rests in Ireland, that is where it is taxable.</p> <p>  In the Commission's judgment there are minutes recounted stating there was no evidence to underpin the offer by the Apple tax adviser to calculate its taxable profits at $30 million to $40 million.  Would it be standard practice that the Revenue Commissioners enter into agreements where no methodology has been written down, no profit and loss, no transfer pricing documentation and, as the Apple tax adviser says, no evidence to back up the numbers suggested?</p></speech>

The Minister should know the answers to these questions because he has decided to appeal a Commission ruling which states that we are owed &euro;13 billion plus interest, money this State could do with.  I want to know, and I suspect many in the wider public want to know, why the Minister decided to pay millions of euro to lawyers to ensure we do not get &euro;13 billion when an EU Commissioner came here this week and explained in very simple and convincing terms why that &euro;13 billion is owed to this State.  It is entirely reasonable to ask on what basis the Minister has made that decision because she made a very simple argument to the effect it is not credible to allocate profits to a company that has no real existence, no economic activity, no employees and no office.  That is the basis of her case.  We are owed an explanation for why the Minister thinks there is some problem with that because it is self-evident that these companies did not have an economic existence, yet Revenue thought it acceptable to allocate and record profits in a company that has no real existence and the Minister is willing to go to court to defend that decision and say no to &euro;13 billion.  Can he please explain that to us?</p></speech>

In November or December we published the main legal grounds on which we were appealing and they are available publicly.  I did not put them into my speech today because the committee already has them.  They are the grounds for the appeal.  We think we are on very solid grounds and we have the best of legal advice.  It is a given that multinational companies organise their affairs to minimise their tax and maximise their profits but that is not the point here.  The point is that the liability was not on Ireland to collect additional tax from Apple because it had collected everything due to Ireland from economic activity to create a profit in Ireland.  That is the issue.  How it was structured after that and whether it paid sufficient tax in other jurisdictions - it paid very little tax overall - is the problem of the mismatches in tax law between different jurisdictions.  Clever tax lawyers can play one jurisdiction off against another.  To say the responsibility for fixing all that rests on the shoulders of a small country is facile and we do not agree. </p></speech>

The Minister has not given an argument that is in any way convincing or could be understood by lay members of the public, who have a big stake in this given that the sum in question is &euro;13 billion, as to why he believes the Commissioner was incorrect in her basic assertion.  Ironically, the representatives of the various parties on this committee tried to impugn her motives and suggest she was being political when, in fact, she was very convincing in saying she was just looking at the matter on the basis of the state aid rules.  Instead, individuals were suggesting this was really about an assault on Ireland's corporate tax rate and implying the Commission and other states in the European Union were jealous.  This is blurring the issue and being political.  Even in the Minister's response just now to me, he said we are doing what we are doing because it is in the best interest of Ireland.  Surely when dealing with a matter as serious as this, the decision should be based on what the Minister believes to be the truth about it.  It should not be a case of acting in a partisan way, regardless of the truth, to do what the Minister believes is in the best interest of the State.  Amazingly, he believes refusing &euro;13 billion is in the best interest of the State.</p><p> How can the Minister seriously suggest it is reasonable for Apple's profits to be allocated to a company that has no existence?  That was the essence of the matter.  The Minister still has not answered the question.</p><p> On the question of the other states in Europe being owed moneys, it could not be a question of the American sales because they are dealt with elsewhere, as Deputy Doherty said.  What the Commissioner said is that any other state is free to make a claim on the &euro;13 billion but it would have to provide the evidence.  The fact is that no other state in Europe has made a claim on it.  No figures were provided.  The Commissioner said that, as a consequence, the only place to which the profits could reasonably be allocated was a company with a real economic existence, that is, the company that was tax resident here in Ireland.  It was stated the profits should have been booked and taxed here and that it was not reasonable to allocate them to a company that had no existence and was tax resident nowhere.</p></speech>

Although the profits concerned were generated in the United States, that country did not tax them as the companies were not incorporated there.  In line with the tax treatment of non-resident branches internationally, the Irish law focuses exclusively on the profits arising from the activities of the branch in Ireland, and this regards any profits arising elsewhere.  This is how Irish tax law operates and has operated always.  Nobody challenged it.</p> <p>  Ireland is not seeking to defend the outcome achieved by the company but it received all the tax due under Irish law.  Importantly, the amount of tax correctly reflects the economic reality of the activity taking place in Cork.  I am not making a case to defend Apple's corporate structures in respect of non-resident companies in Cork.  That is not my business.  I am saying that because of the way in which they were non-resident, there was not a tax liability in Ireland for the profits put through them.  That is the argument.</p> <p>  The Commission, in my view, is misusing state aid powers to lay the blame for a mismatch in international tax rules at Ireland's door.  Its approach conflicts with the core international tax principle of ensuring taxing rights are aligned with economic activity.  That is another strong plank in the case we will be pursuing.  The profits charged to Irish tax fully reflect the operations carried out in Ireland.  That is a fact.  The tax on profits generated in Ireland was fully paid.  The driving force behind the profitability of the two companies is Apple's highly valuable intellectual property, which is wholly created and developed in the United and thus is not taxable on the basis of the activities in Ireland.</p></speech>

After that it would be a matter of argument between a different Commission and the Irish authorities as to whether a portion could be attributed to capital projects.  That is unclear.  The fiscal rules we have signed up to under the Stability and Growth Pact would deem this to be once-off revenue and cannot be used to finance permanent increases in expenditure.  In any event, the possibility of spending the money does not arise.  It will not be available to the Exchequer, unless and until the legal proceedings are fully completed.  It is expected that it will be several years before this is resolved.  It certainly could not be used for any recurring expenditure of a current expenditure nature.

Everyone's tax affairs is confidential, whether personal or corporate tax affairs, and the Revenue is obliged to keep the tax affairs and the tax details of all companies confidential.  I would not have access to confidential data.  When the Revenue gives me information it does it globally, referring to the sectors rather than individual companies.  The reason we know about NAMA is that it published this in the quarterly report.  Have we any idea of what was lost?  The Revenue has put in a figure of &euro;50 million.  That was the advice it gave me to include in the estimates for 2017.  It expects to collect another &euro;50 million.  On the face of it, one would expect more than that to be collected but it says the change in the law will lead to a change in practice, so that companies will structure themselves differently.  If things were allowed to continue, the amount of tax that would be collected would be bigger but we have to wait and see.  It is very hard to forecast these things.</p></speech>

Section 110 of the 1997 Act was designed to make Dublin, in particular, but Ireland in general, attractive as a location for financial services.  That was the intent of the section.  The section was then misapplied on the advice of tax lawyers to property portfolios but as I said to Deputy McGrath it was not clear that was being done until approximately the autumn of 2015, and then there was a discussion about how widespread it was.  The nature of tax avoidance measures that are brought up through the big tax advice companies and by tax advisers is that they are very secretive, and until the Revenue gets tax returns in and sees the data it is very hard to form an opinion.  The loophole is blocked now and we think it will work.  However, there will be an ongoing analysis of the effectiveness of the legislation we brought in last autumn.</p></speech>

Maybe the Minister could elaborate on that and on the process - how much feedback the Minister got, the timeliness of the feedback and other issues involving the interaction between the Commission and the Department and the Minister in advance of the ruling.  Was it a surprise on 30 August when it came out and how much prior notice of the announcement were the Department and Revenue given?</p></speech>

I am speaking from memory but I think I put this on the record previously.  When we got the call some time in late August that it would probably come out in the first days of September we were just surprised at the timing, but not particularly surprised.  I expected it would come out anyway in late September at that stage and then it was announced in August.  I had met the Commissioner - I forget on what date - and discussed it, and she had indicated that she would let us know in advance when the ruling would come out.  Therefore, I was not surprised at the timing but I was surprised at the amount of money.  Quite frankly, it was the widest possible interpretation that one could take.</p></speech>

It would be a matter for Revenue.  A lot of this is not shared because it is confidential.</p> <p>  The key point, from my point of view, is the fact that Apple had a particular structure for their company - it was not illegal - is not the concern of the Irish Revenue authorities.  The concern of the Irish Revenue authorities was to collect all the tax that was due in Ireland.  One might not like the arrangement that was made by a multinational but if it was in accordance with law, and if the G7, the G20 and the OECD had not succeeded in eliminating the mismatches which allowed large global multinational companies to avoid tax, my belief is the onus should not be put on Ireland.</p></speech>

As members of the committee are aware, and well used to, I am constrained, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, in discussing the tax affairs of any taxpayer.  Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 specifically provides for such confidentiality.  Further constraints arise in this case due to the fact that it is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings in the European courts and I am very conscious of legal limitations on what I can discuss in public as a result of those legal proceedings.<br/><br/>The committee's letter of invitation indicated that the committee wishes to engage specifically on the Commission&rsquo;s decision in this case and wishes to explore the factors underpinning it in the context of state aid rules.  Having received legal advice on the matter, it is my understanding that there are significant limitations on discussion of pending legal proceedings in any public forum.  Specifically, I am advised that I should not discuss the substance of the legal case, the state aid analysis in the Commission decision or the legal grounds relied upon by the State in support of its annulment application.  Having said that, I want to be as helpful to the committee as possible and I understand that the EU state aid investigation raises broader international tax issues, including in relation to tax administration.<br/><br/>When the Apple decision was announced last August, and prior to the Government's decision to appeal the decision, I issued a statement responding to the decision and it is important that I recap on the content of the statement:</p><blockquote>Revenue co-operated fully with the Commission&rsquo;s investigation.<br /><br />We provided all relevant information and explanations to the Commission to demonstrate that Revenue collected the full amount of tax due from Apple in accordance with Irish tax law.  Apple has confirmed on the public record that the relevant companies were not tax-resident in Ireland and under Irish tax law, non-resident companies are chargeable to Irish corporation tax only on the profits attributable to their Irish branches.  The profits of non-resident companies that are not generated by their Irish branches &ndash; such as profits from technology, design and marketing that are generated outside Ireland &ndash; cannot be charged with Irish tax under Irish tax law.<br /><br />The issue of international tax planning, involving mismatches between different countries&rsquo; tax rules, is well known and is the subject of the OECD BEPS project.  Those mismatches go to the heart of what the case is about.<br /><br />And while I cannot otherwise comment on the specific facts of this case, I can confirm that -<br /><br />- there was no departure from the applicable Irish tax law by Revenue;<br /><br />- there was no preference shown in applying that law; and<br /><br />- the full tax due was paid in accordance with the law.</blockquote> <p>As the members know, the Government decided to appeal the European Commission&rsquo;s decision and an annulment submission has since been lodged with the General Court of the European Union.  While I am not free to discuss the detail of Ireland&rsquo;s appeal of the decision, the main lines of argument in Ireland&rsquo;s annulment application have been published by the Department of Finance and I would like to read the key elements of those arguments:</p><blockquote>The Commission decision of 30 August 2016 (the Decision) wrongly asserts that two opinions given in 1991 and 2007 by the Irish Revenue Commissioners &ldquo;renounced&rdquo; tax revenue that Ireland would have otherwise been entitled to collect from the Irish branches of Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE).  The opinions involved no departure from Irish law.  The ordinary tax rules applicable to branches in Ireland of non-resident companies are in Section 25 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The opinions simply applied section 25, which in accordance with the territoriality principle, taxes only the profits attributable to the branch, not the non-Irish profits of the company.<br /><br />The Decision also mischaracterises the activities and responsibilities of the Irish branches of ASI and AOE.  These branches carried out routine functions, but all important decisions within ASI and AOE were made in the USA, and the profits deriving from these decisions were not properly attributable to the Irish branches of ASI and AOE.<br /><br />The Commission&rsquo;s attribution of Apple&rsquo;s intellectual property licences to the Irish branches of AOE and ASI is not consistent with Irish law and, moreover, is inconsistent with the principles it claims to apply, as is its stated refusal to take into account the activities of Apple Inc.</blockquote> <p>As members know, Ireland submitted its annulment application to the General Court of the European Union in November 2016.  In terms of the next steps in the legal process, my understanding is that the European Commission has until mid-March to make a submission to the General Court in response to Ireland&rsquo;s annulment application.</p><p>Ireland will then have a further opportunity to respond to the Commission&rsquo;s submission and following Ireland&rsquo;s response, the Commission will make a final submission.  Other interested parties also have the opportunity to apply to the court to make submissions.  The case will then be considered and adjudicated by the General Court, with a further right of appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union available to both parties.  The process is therefore likely to take a number of years.<br/><br/>On the broader issues raised by the Commission's decision, the European Commission&rsquo;s state aid investigations into the taxation of multinational companies reflect a broader international policy focus on the ability of companies operating cross-border to exploit gaps between the tax laws of different jurisdictions to reduce the amount of tax that they pay.<br/><br/>Part of the international tax policy focus in recent years has been on tax rulings or tax opinions, as they are called in Ireland, and their use by multinational companies to gain certainty in respect of their cross-border tax structures.  In particular, the Commission launched its investigations into ruling practices in all EU member states in 2013; EU member states agreed amendments to the directive on administrative cooperation in 2015 to provide for rulings with a cross-border impact to be exchanged between all member states from 1 January 2017 onward.  OECD BEPS Action 5 contained a similar initiative which came into effect on 1 April last year; OECD BEPS Action 5 also introduced best-practice guidelines for the issuing of rulings, and the EU recently finalised its best practice guidelines on 6 December last.<br/><br/>I  would like to set out the position regarding the Revenue practice on issuing opinions.  In providing opinions, Revenue's role is to set out our view of the correct interpretation and application of the law so that taxpayers can understand and comply with their obligations.  Unlike the situation in some other countries, Revenue does not issue legally binding tax rulings.  Revenue opinions cannot and do not depart from the tax law that applies in any case.<br/><br/>Revenue has published detailed guidelines on the provision of opinions or confirmations in respect of tax matters.  Guidelines on opinions-confirmations relating to cases dealt with by Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division, LCD, were previously contained in a tax briefing published in 2002.  These guidelines were subsequently updated in 2014 and again more recently in 2016.  There are separate guidelines which cover requests for opinions submitted for non-LCD cases through the Revenue technical services.<br/><br/>These guidelines set out in detail the procedures to be followed by taxpayers in requesting an opinion from Revenue.  Opinions are only issued where the matter is complex or where there is genuine uncertainty regarding the applicable tax rules.  Liability to tax should not be left uncertain, so Revenue will provide an opinion on how the law should be applied to complex situations.  Almost all tax administrations around the world do this and any taxpayer can request an opinion from Revenue.  Opinions from Revenue are specific to the particular case and the law provides for confidentiality of taxpayer information.  For that reason, Revenue opinions are not individually published.<br/><br/>As I have already mentioned, the use of tax opinions by multinational companies is an issue that has been discussed at international level, both OECD and the European Union, in recent years.  The outcome is that last year both the OECD and the EU designed exchange of information mechanisms so that all rulings that have a cross-border dimension will be automatically exchanged with other countries from now on.  Revenue is participating fully in these initiatives and has recently implemented both the OECD initiative and the EU directive, and has published a detailed manual setting out the new procedures.  The sharing of such information between tax administrations should help reduce the opportunities for multinational companies to exploit gaps between different countries&rsquo; rules in the future.<br/><br/>In light of these international developments, we have been reviewing our practice for the issuing of opinions and we have recently updated our practices in a number of respects.  At the time of the Government decision to appeal the Apple decision, we committed to reducing the maximum period for which opinions can apply from seven years to five years in line with the OECD best practice guidelines and, going forward, we will publish the number of opinions provided each year in our annual report.<br/><br/>More generally, in regard to international tax developments, I know that members of the committee are familiar with the OECD&rsquo;s base erosion and profit-shifting initiative which has specifically targeted aggressive tax planning by multinational companies, recognising that it is a global problem that requires countries to work together to address it.<br/><br/>Ireland has responded quickly to a number of the BEPS recommendations which were made in October 2015, notably as an early mover in introducing country by country reporting.  The EU anti-tax avoidance directive, which was agreed in 2016, was a significant milestone in terms of implementation of a number of other BEPS recommendations and Ireland will be implementing the directive in legislation in accordance with the agreed timelines set out in the directive.<br/><br/>Ireland is also fully engaged in the work to create what is referred to as the multilateral instrument or MLI.  This will be used to implement the tax treaty-related changes resulting from BEPS to tax treaties globally.  Countries, including Ireland, are now finalising their analyses of the various provisions in their existing treaties to prepare for the MLI.Revenue is playing an active part in this work given our role in the negotiation of double taxation agreements.  The MLI is a key part of the OECD&rsquo;s effort towards the quick and consistent implementation of anti-BEPS measures into existing tax treaties.<br/><br/>Revenue has invested significant resources in international tax in recent years.  We play a full role in both OECD and EU taxation discussions and a number of the policy developments relate specifically to exchange of tax information between tax administrations.  Tax administrations are working more closely than ever before and we are learning from each other in order to combat both tax evasion and tax avoidance more effectively.<br/><br/>In regard to the state aid investigation, I reiterate that Revenue can only operate within the law.  Revenue opinions do no more than provide clarity on the application of the law and there was no departure from the applicable Irish tax law by Revenue in this case.  In accordance with the law, Revenue attributes profits to branches of non-resident companies by reference to the individual facts and circumstances of the branch.  We consider the economic reality and activity of the branch to determine the profits generated by the branch<i>.  </i>What is it that the branch does?  Revenue can only tax on the basis of the economic reality of what is being done in Ireland.<br/><br/>As I mentioned at the outset, I am very conscious of the legal limitations on what I can discuss due to the ongoing court proceedings but I will make every effort to respond to questions members of the committee may have, within that constraint.</p></speech>

I appreciate the constraints he is working within but I want to focus initially on what is the nub of the case, as I read it and having read the Commission's overall decision.  It goes back to the tax rulings, as it calls them, or the advance opinions, whereby the basis of deciding how much of the profits of Apple Sales International, ASI, and Apple Operations Europe, AOE, reside in the Irish branch and how much reside in head office.  It set out in its decision the basis that was used so in the case of ASI, for example, the 1991 tax opinion was that the net profit allocated to ASI's Irish branch would be calculated as 12.5% of all branch operating costs, excluding material for resale.  Similarly, in the case of AOE, the net profit attributable to the Irish branch would be calculated as 65% of that branch's operating expenses up to an annual amount and 20% of its operating expenses etc.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Cody clarify for us, and I do not expect him to go into the detail, if the Revenue used a defined methodology in calculating the attribution of profits between the Irish branch and the head office of those two companies, which were incorporated in Ireland but were not tax resident in Ireland?  That is the key issue.  Was there a defined methodology which Revenue used and which, by the way, would have been used consistently in respect of tax opinions with other multinational companies?  Will Mr. Cody try to address that point within the constraints he mentioned?</p></speech>

Clearly, the decision sets out examples of 11 different entities where there was branch attribution.</p><p>If the committee bears with me, what I will talk about is what we try to do in terms of branches.  The Commission took a strong line on the fact that it could not see a consistent basis.  We see that as the opposite to a weakness.  We look at the facts and circumstances of the cases.  The 11 companies and Apple covered various sectors such as pharma, tehcnology and other entities.  What happens is that the company comes to us, sets out a basis and we engage with it or its advisers to ascertain the facts and circumstances of the case.  Calculating branch profits based on a percentage mark-up on the branch costs is a well established basis in international tax which various countries use.</p></speech>

We operate a self-assessment system.  If the company does not come to us, it has to calculate the profits that are attributable to the branch and declare those in its returns.  It can do that.  Some companies do not come and look for an opinion.  Some of the multinational companies have not got an opinion and they calculate their profits.  That is what they are obliged to do.  What they can do with the opinion is come to us.  They can be proactive.  They come to us and present a set of circumstances to us and ask if we are happy that it is a reasonable basis for the facts and circumstances of the branch and what takes place in the branch in Ireland.  We then engage with the company.  We usually ask for more information or we will say we are not happy with one or other part of it and it will go back and revise its position.</p></speech>

In the case of the two companies concerned, it has been said, and there are references in the Commission&rsquo;s decision about the test of management and control in terms of where the companies conducted their activity.

It is useful to talk a little about the process we are in at present.  As I set out, Ireland has put a detailed legal case in response to the decision of the European Commission.  That is lodged with the court.  It is not a public document.  It has not been made public yet.  The court effectively is in possession of that.  It will publish summary legal pleadings in the official journal.  What I read into the record earlier that the Department of Finance published is a summary of what will be published.  That is all that will be published.  We are in a situation here where a case is being made by the Commission in which there is a considerable amount of public detail available on the record, but obviously redacted.  There is an answering legal documentation, which is not on the record and on which my legal advice is that I cannot put it on the record, apart from in the court.  We have a process in train that will ultimately be determined by the court.  I have no difficulty coming before the committee to try to answer as much as I can but I have strong legal advice and I do not  wish to do damage to the legal proceedings that are in train.  Going into the basis of Ireland's answer and rebuttal to the particular points made by the Commission brings us straight into that area.  What I would like to do is, as much as possible, talk about what we do when we are trying to tax the branches of multinationals in Ireland.</p></speech>

Obviously, we discussed the case.  The investigation started in mid-2013.  It has gone on and there have been truckloads of documentation toing and froing.  There has been a significant level of correspondence between Revenue and the Commission.  One thing we did is that we decided at the very start to co-operate fully because as a regulatory body ourselves that is what we expect others to do with us.  We gave considerable information and we took part in meetings and discussions.  At our own board and management advisory committee level we briefed people on where we are.</p> <p>  On Tuesday I was taken by what the Commissioner said when she talked about her responsibility under the treaty.  Equally, we have a responsibility under the tax Acts and the authority given to us by the Oireachtas to implement the legislation.  That is what we did.  We implemented Irish tax law.  That is what the people who were involved in the individual opinions and who deal with opinions of multinationals seek to do at all times.  There is no question among people in Revenue that we implemented Irish law.  That is not to say that everybody, including me, is happy with multinational tax avoidance.  We have invested significant resources, which I told the committee previously about, in the context of changes we made two years ago setting up our international branch and the work we do in terms of playing a part in relation to tackling multinational tax avoidance that is significantly above our punching power.</p></speech>

Revenue's position is that under Irish law, it is not due this money and Mr. Cody is responsible for applying the statutory taxation provisions.  Does the EU state aid law supersede that in the event that the European courts uphold the Commission's finding that Ireland is owed this money?  What is the legal basis for accepting it?</p></speech>

If, ultimately, the European Court of Justice finds that there has been illegal state aid, Ireland will be obliged to recover the money, that is, the equivalent amount of the state aid - the tax.  At that stage, it would have been forgone if the European Court of Justice finds that it is forgone, so we will be legally obliged to collect it.  In respect of the methodology of collecting it in five years' time, tax assessment and collection of the money, the money will presumably be lodged in an escrow account and will then be available to be set against the tax liability.  I know the Belgian authorities in the context of their case looked at putting in specific tax assessment rules regarding an unsuccessful state aid case, or a successful one depending on what one is looking at.  That will come to fruition in whatever length of time it takes, be it four or five years or a shorter period of time.</p></speech>

I am trying to distil this.  In respect of the theme around the methodologies, the Commission has stated that the decision of 30 August asserts that the two opinions given in 1991 and 2007 by Revenue renounced tax revenue that Ireland would otherwise have been entitled to collect from the Irish branches of Apple Sales International, ASI, and Apple Operations Europe, AOE.  Mr. Cody speaks of a mis-characterisation.  I think those were the words he used in the documents we have.  Will he explain what he means?  What is meant by "renounced" in this instance?</p></speech>

They are not our words.  We do not agree with or accept them.  Ultimately, the Commission is saying that all the profits attributable to the two Irish-registered non-resident companies were properly taxable in Ireland.  It is like two parallel lines.  The Commission says that the profits of the companies are fully attributable and fully taxable in Ireland.  We are saying, and Irish law says, that the profits of the branch are taxable in Ireland at 12.5%.  The debate could go on forever and, ultimately, it will be a matter for the courts to determine.  Revenue can only apply the Irish tax code.  We cannot apply the Irish tax code as people might want it to be.  Our role and responsibility involves applying the Irish tax code.  The Commission is clearly of the view that the profits are fully attributable and that is where the figure of &euro;13 billion comes from.  Ultimately, it is a figure by 12.5% - there or thereabouts.  If, from the Commission's perspective, that figure is the amount of tax paid plus &euro;13 billion and is what should have been paid, it then uses the word.</p></speech>

That is basically the case at its simplest.  The Commission is saying it is fully taxable in Ireland.  Irish tax law says the branch profits are taxable in Ireland - not what takes place outside Ireland.  I am not anticipating the questions I will be asked but I know I will be asked about the headquarters.  What is really important in the context of Irish tax law and what we must do is look at what takes place in the branch - not what takes place or what is outside the branch.</p></speech>

She said:</p><blockquote>We were looking at whether the allocation of profits was recorded in the branch and whether, therefore, it had to be taxed in Ireland, or recorded in the stateless headquarters and, therefore, not to be taxed in Ireland.  We found that the recordings by Apple, which we did not question, could not be supported by economic activity.  That is why they ought to be recorded in the branch of the company that is taxable in Ireland.  </blockquote> <p>She went on to state: </p><blockquote>We do not investigate or value the intellectual property.  We have not done that here.  We have seen that Apple has organised itself with what it refers to as a cost-sharing agreement.  This means that most of the research and development takes place at the Apple Inc. facility in Cupertino.  </blockquote> <p>I am trying to get my head around this.  In Mr. Cody's lines of argument, he states that the Commission's attribution of Apple's intellectual property licences to the Irish branches of AOE and ASI is not consistent with Irish law and, moreover, is inconsistent with the principles it claims to apply, as is its stated refusal to take into account the activities of Apple Inc.  There is no reconciliation between those two statements.  I am trying to distil the contradiction in layperson's terms.  In respect of the intellectual property piece, the Minister asked us to refer to the phones and so on being made in China and the intellectual property in Cupertino.  Can somebody distill that for me in bare simple terms?  Where does the intellectual property piece fit into all this if the Commissioner is saying that the Commission did not investigate or value the intellectual property?  Mr. Cody is saying that the intellectual property is not generated in Ireland.  If I am interpreting the Commissioner correctly, she is saying that the Commission is not investigating the intellectual property so, therefore, it is not investigating an Irish operation in that sense.  How do we reconcile that?  How do we get a better understanding of that dynamic?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.875" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017020200002#R01000"><p>I think it has been acknowledged probably by everybody, including the Commission, that the creation and management of the intellectual property and the intellectual property rights developed in the US.  I think that is a given.  That is where the work was done - where the research and development is done.  We had to look at what was in the Irish branch in Cork.  The intellectual property is not created in Cork or in the branch in Cork.  It is outside the branch and outside Ireland.  The fundamental issue here is the interaction about residence rules.</p><p>In a way, this was not discussed hugely with the Commissioner and she did not make any real play about it.  The heart of this is the mismatch between tax residency rules, in this case with Irish registered companies.  This goes to the heart of the BEPS action plan.  If this could be sorted by state aid, the whole issue around BEPS, the whole issue around CCCTB, would be very different.  However, what we have is a mismatch.  The issue around what is in the head office would not have been a matter for our officials in 1991 or 2007.  From the point of view of the Commission, in a way, the 130 pages are the 130 pages for the prosecution.  The legal case, which I cannot share with the committee, rebuts those points.  Ultimately, it will be a matter for the court.  As the Commissioner said the other day, ultimately this will be a matter of law.</p></speech>

At various times, between 3,000 and 6,000 people were working in Cork.  As we all say, this is not a brass plate operation.  What we had to look at was what Apple did in Cork and what did that proportion of the total of Apple Inc. contribute.  That is all.  We had a tax case in 1998 where we were looking at the issue of multinational operation which had a branch in Ireland and had assets outside the jurisdiction.  The assets were not tangible in any way.  There is a High Court decision at which said what we could look.  That is the branch and what was in the branch, not having regard to what was in the head office.  We are being looked at for not looking at what we were not entitled or obliged to look at.  Most of the commentary on the case and the direction of the OECD relates to the idea that if there is tax foregone here, the reality is that it is US tax.</p></speech>

What it is trying to do is get a market rate for transactions between intergroup transfers.  It is trying to say that if one is buying on the market independently, that is the benchmark to mark against.  That is the arm's-length principle.  Again, the Commissioner said on Tuesday that is the secondary part of the Commission's case.  That is the alternative argument.  In some of the commentary and the talk about not applying arm's-length principles, the arm's-length principle and transfer pricing rules have evolved over the last number of years.  There were guidelines in 2010 implemented in our law.  Clearly, they were not in place in either of the years.  A number of commentators have highlighted that.  In fairness to the Commission, however, that is not the core of its case.  The Commissioner very much said that.  It is the secondary part of the Commission's case.</p></speech>

We appreciate the fact that there is a legal case and that some of this will be technical.  We will all have to wait the course.  The die is cast.  Unfortunately, this State is going to spend many millions of taxpayers' money that the Revenue Commissioners collect to fight a case so that we do not take in &euro;13 billion - possibly up to &euro;18 billion - that could help those same taxpayers.  Another case on which we spent taxpayers' money was that relating to Santander, which had nothing at all to do with this.  Ireland decided to join that case because it was obviously thought that it was going to assist in the Apple judgment.  The case was lost and it was money down the drain for the Irish taxpayer.  Did Revenue give any advice to the Department or any Government official or body in respect of whether Ireland should join the Santander case?</p></speech>

I have tremendous respect for the work Revenue has done.  It sometimes has to collect taxes with which it does not agree but, by and large, it has done a tremendous job over the years.  I have serious issues, however, over the Apple case.  On the question of the independence of Revenue, we are dealing with a tax ruling from 1991 after negotiations that began in 1990.  Did the Moriarty tribunal not find, in 1997, that the Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, intervened with the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners shortly after becoming Taoiseach?  The tribunal, which has been accepted by all parties in this House, found that Mr. Haughey conferred an undue advantage on Ben Dunne as a result of the intervention, which was in respect of Mr. Dunne's tax bill.  The tax bill was reduced by around &pound;23 million, or &euro;29 million.  Is it true to say that the independence of the Revenue Commissioners has not always been respected?  There have been interventions at the highest level and the example I have given coincides, in time terms, with the first Apple ruling.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance gave an answer to a parliamentary question in which it said it first became aware of it only after the Apple hearings in 2013.  I want to determine, before this committee today, whether that is the case with the Revenue Commissioners.  The Finance Act 1999 amended section 882 of the Finance Act 1997, and stated that any companies incorporated in the State had to provide certain particulars to Revenue within 30 days.  Those particulars included the name of the company, the address, the place of residence, the date of commencement of the business and, in the case of a company not resident in the State, the name of the territory in which it is tax resident.  If ASI or AOE were incorporated in Ireland post that date, they would have had to tell Revenue that they were stateless but there was no requirement on them to do that because they were incorporated prior to that date.  I want to know when the Revenue knew.  It surely knew that these companies were stateless.  When the Revenue Commissioners identify a loophole, it is their job to come to us as legislators, through the Department of Finance, and tell us.  They need to tell us there is a loophole whereby a multinational company, operating and incorporated in Ireland, records profits for that company but does not pay tax anywhere in the world on those profits.</p></speech>

When we became aware of it, as a result of the US Senate hearings, I challenged the Government to close down the loophole but it said it could not close it down, though it did so in a subsequent Finance Act.  We had the ability, during all this period, to close this loophole down and if we had done so we would not have the Commission breathing down our necks over the State aid rules.  We would have got the tax that was due to us in the first place.  I will put my question again.  When did the Revenue first know that ASI and AOE were operating on a stateless basis?</p></speech>

At the time that law changed it was very clear to us there was a problem around non-resident companies which were registered in no place or in a tax haven and that was part of the background.  I do not want to mislead the Deputy but the question of being stateless was not to the forefront of the issue.  I can write to the committee setting out some information.  We have not focused on statelessness as the problem.</p></speech>

We changed the law as soon as we knew about it, and rightly so.  My suspicion is that the Revenue Commissioners knew about it a long time before that but did nothing about it.  They did not tell us but turned a blind eye.  We do not have access to the information as to where are the economic rights of Apple's intellectual property.</p><p>We do not have access to their accounts.  Revenue had all of that.  In my view, Revenue may have known this as early as 1990 and yet as Mr. Cody rightly said, a paper was done by the Department of Finance in conjunction with Revenue, in 1997, to close down this tax loophole, which actually happened in 1999.  It again turned a blind eye to what Apple was doing in Cork.  Can Mr. Cody confirm to the committee that he was aware that Apple was operating stateless companies incorporated in this jurisdiction prior to the US Senate hearings?</p></speech>

The IRNR issue was on the agenda, it appeared in a tax strategy group, as the Deputy mentioned before, in 1998.

The transcripts which this debacle centres around speak for themselves.  On 30 November 1990, Apple's tax adviser met with Revenue Commissioners and stated that the company would be prepared to accept a profit of between &pound;30 million and &pound;40 million for taxation in Ireland as opposed to actual profits in their accounts.  The Revenue Commissioners asked the adviser to state if there was any basis for the figure of between &pound;30 million and &pound;40 million and he confessed that there was no scientific basis for that figure.  Lo and behold, on 3 January 1991, a deal was struck between the Revenue Commissioners and the Apple tax advisers that the profits chargeable to Irish tax would be between &pound;30 million and &pound;40 million.  This special deal involving an agreed charging structure is in contravention with tax legislation which remained in place until 2007.  I think that is the crux of the problem here as well in that we have a whole lot of indigenous businesses around this country, including small businesses in rural areas and other areas, which have been hounded by Revenue to the letter of the law.  This facility is not available to indigenous businesses and is anti-competitive.  There is an issue with how multinationals such as Apple are treated and how they dictate what tax they are going to pay as opposed to how small and indigenous businesses are treated by Revenue where the full hammer of the law is brought down on them.  Did the Revenue Commissioners sit down with Apple?  Did Apple say what it was going to pay?  Did Revenue agree that that was going to be paid?</p></speech>

There is a whole raft of stuff that could be read out in the case that is being put by the Commission, that the Senator did not read out the fully.  I cannot go into the detail of the opinion and how it was arrived at apart from going back to what I said before.  What we were dealing with was calculating and attributing the branch profits and coming up with the tax on that.  The Senator said, and I take it as a colloquial statement, that Revenue hounds indigenous companies.  We do not hound anybody.</p></speech>

I think that is really important.</p> <p>  Opinions are available to any taxpayer having regard to the circumstances but the rules are different.  If we are taxing an Irish resident taxpayer, their profits are calculated based on their accounts.  As a result, they are taxable on their accounts.

When Revenue discovered this arrangement - I cannot really understand how, given all of the people in Revenue, all of these things were not discovered earlier- and that it was being used and abused to relieve Irish citizens of up to &euro;350 million in taxes that should otherwise have been paid, is there no provision for Revenue to let the Government know this is happening and to advise that it needs to be immediately closed down?  The section 110 arrangement was discovered in 2015 but was not closed until many months later.  We need to quantify the figure that was lost as a result of that delay.  In the case of the double Irish tax strategy, it was closed for new companies but we see again that the liabilities for that will continue on into 2020 and beyond.  There does not seem to be any urgency in closing down these loopholes, which are available to a section of our society while other people are being treated differently.</p></speech>

That is what we are looking at.  The example of the section 110 process is where Revenue would have seen the use of the section 110 arrangement in relation to Irish property assets.  When section 110 was introduced, it was always seen as supporting the international funds industry.  With regard to the issue around the timeliness, corporation tax works on a time lag.  We will not see it as it is happening.</p></speech>

If one looks at where Revenue is coming from and how we look at things, we see tax abuse and tax avoidance and we bring it to the policy makers' attention.  Other people see those things as fully acceptable tax planning.  If Revenue could determine the policy, then the Finance Bill would probably be far busier with provisions to close off structures that we do not like.  There is, however, a whole policy dimension to be applied to all of this.  Revenue does not have the monopoly on the view of what is acceptable tax planning or aggressive tax avoidance.  There is a spectrum and one could invite plenty of practitioners into the committee and they would say that it is the purpose of the way the system is structured.</p></speech>

I said that Revenue brings the issues to the attention of the policy makers when we come across loopholes.  This is absolutely a core part of what we do.  Every year issues are put on the agenda.  Some get into a Finance Bill, some do not and some get into a Finance Bill after a period of time.  A core part of the job, and it is a part of the work I have dealt with for a long time, is when we see things, we bring it to the attention of the Department.  When we see an issue, we must establish what it is and go in and check on it.  We recently published our statement of strategy.  A core part of the work we do, and the resources we use in our revenue and legislation services, deals with flagging up of loopholes and coming up with solutions.</p></speech>

In my case, I put forward a motion to this committee in 2013 asking that Apple representatives be brought in to answer some of these questions.  The Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour parties all banded together to ensure that it did not happen.  They even turned off the cameras while we were discussing it.  This is the frustration that some of us must put up with in trying to get to the bottom of this.  I understand that the Revenue representatives have some constraints but I hope they will tell us as much as they can.  Is it Revenue's responsibility to identify loopholes, possible tax evasion and possible tax avoidance and to bring it to the attention of the Government?</p></speech>

The Deputy used the words "evasion" and "avoidance".  If we come across tax evasion, it is not a loophole.  We can raise assessments or do anything up to referral for prosecution.  The loopholes are around the tax planning and tax avoidance area.  When we come across loopholes that give rise-----</p></speech>

Would Mr. Cody accept that Cork, the Irish branch, was the hub for doing that selling?  Nobody else could have done it because there was no staff and so on.

It is part of the environment in which we are operating.  One of the things the Commission makes a play of is that the tax adviser mentioned employees and there is an inference that we were influenced by the idea that this is about jobs.  We want to make very clear that we are only interested in the issues that are relevant to the calculation of the tax.  The opinion updated that.  We changed it in 2016.  The 2016 changes relate to the Apple case in that we reduced the period to five years from seven and undertook to publish the numbers in our annual report.  The other thing that happened in the meantime is the move to country-by-country reporting and the exchange of information.  If we give an opinion to a multinational entity which has an impact on the tax arrangements in another country, we will exchange the information with the other country.  It touches on an element of what Deputy Boyd Barrett was saying.  There will now be greater knowledge of the full pieces of the jigsaw.  Every revenue authority should have a view of the issues relevant to the entire group because there is no doubt multinational corporations have oversight of all their own operations and, in many cases, they structure them in such a way to minimise the tax.  There is no overarching tax authority looking at this.  The individual administrations will have relevant pieces which from country A's point of view is very valid and protects its tax base but country B might say it has an impact on theirs and they want to revisit it.  That is part of the backdrop.</p></speech>

An opinion applies up to the time it is either withdrawn, the facts and circumstances change or the legislation that applies to it changes.  If the legislation changes, the rulings do not have any further value.  It is purely up to the company to come back to us and say that in the context of the changes in whatever section it is in the Finance Act, it is now looking at how this applies.  We do not go and say "Lads, the law has changed now and that is gone," because the law is changed, it is gone and it is a self-assessment tax system.  The company and any taxpayer are still obliged to return their tax having regard to the self-assessment system.  If the legislation changes, the previous ruling could not apply.</p></speech>

To follow on from Senator Burke's question on selectivity, the Commissioner referred to how Apple did not pay the corporation tax rate of 12.5% and that the Commission was basing its case on this and the idea that the tax ruling was selective.  The Commission's argument is that Apple got a special deal.  According to the Commissioner, the somewhat unfortunate references made by Apple in the US Senate were the catalyst for much of this investigation.  We will never know whether it would have been conducted otherwise.  Apple referred to having a special deal.  Maybe it was not as special as Apple thought it was and Revenue contends - I do not want to put words in Mr. Cody's mouth - that the deal was available to anyone who looked for it and Apple's treatment was the same that anyone else would have had had the same circumstances pertained.  What are Mr. Cody's thoughts on the issues of selectivity and Mr. Tim Cook's commentary in the US Senate?</p></speech>

Revenue does not do deals.  Instead, we examine the facts and circumstances and agree in the branch cases the profits that are attributable to the branch.  The Committee of Public Accounts asked me about Mr. Cook's statements at the Senate committee and the idea that Apple effectively got a rate of 2%.  I told that committee that it was a wrong explanation of what had happened.  From where Apple was sitting, however, I could see how it would look at the amount of tax it paid over its worldwide profits.  It is a sum-----</p></speech>

When Mr. Cook represented it as a particular percentage, the Irish tax rate over the non-Americas profits gave the sum.  The 12.5% tax rate was applied to the profits attributable to the Irish branch.  There was no deal or special arrangement.  All of the cases that we are dealing with - 19 were mentioned, but there are effectively 11 and Apple in the decision - involved the calculation of the profits attributable to the relevant Irish branch and the application to those of the statutory corporate tax rate of 12.5%.</p></speech>

I know that Mr. Cook subsequently said "Sorry" and that what happened was not exactly as he had said.  Apple has clarified the situation, and obviously it is appealing the case.  If Apple felt that there was another story behind this, involving deals and political influence, I am sure that it would be reluctant to appeal the case.</p></speech>

There is a raft of documentation which seeks to rebut that which is not yet on the public record.  I cannot put it on the public record now or discuss the detail of that documentation.

I am here with my colleague, Dr. Liam Glynn, who is the NAGP chair of communications.  We are both full-time practising GPs in urban and rural practices, respectively.  Our patients are directly affected on a daily basis by the issues we will discuss today.  We strongly support the work of this committee and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Healthcare committee in the development of a ten year plan for healthcare.  The NAGP has also advocated for such a ten year plan.</p> <p>  We have an upside down health care system which is hospital-centric.  Our hospitals are overwhelmed.  To address this, we need a paradigm shift in health care, away from hospitals and towards GP-led primary care.  GPs know their patients.  They are the senior decision makers in the community and can lead team based health care which is person centred and population focused.  GP-led teams are ideally placed to keep more patients well, cared for close to home and out of costly hospital care.</p> <p>  To achieve this, we need to support general practice.  This means two things: First, we must provide proper funding for general practice similar to other OECD countries; and, second, we must provide enough GPs to lead and deliver the required primary care service for the population.  Unfortunately, we have a manpower crisis of monumental proportions in general practice.  Every year some 50% of our newly trained GPs emigrate.  That figure is growing.  We need 4,500 GPs by 2025 in order to provide safe, effective and efficient general practice.  The challenge is stark.</p> <p>  Recruitment of GPs is a global issue but we are exporting our GPs.  We are competing also with Canada and Australia where general practice is supported by adequate resources, access to diagnostics, with a better work life balance and career structure.  We need a new GP contract which is fit for purpose and which will attract our young, highly trained GPs back to Ireland.  This is critical if we are to facilitate the shift to a GP-led primary care service that is central to the future of healthcare.  I am glad to say that the NAGP is actively engaged in this process. </p> <p>  We need special supports to attract GPs to work in urban deprived and rural settings.  Here, the use of technology with virtual clinics and the networking of singlehanded rural practices is especially important.  We need to support the pivotal role that practice nurses can play in addressing this issue.  We need increased numbers of practice nurses with roles in chronic disease management.  We would also welcome the addition of health care assistants, physician assistants and clinical pharmacists to work in general practice as part of the new clinical team.  This team can provide services such as chronic disease management, residential care, minor surgery, end-of-life care and enhanced acute care in the community, especially for the frail and elderly.  To build primary care we need to develop a new business relationship between primary and secondary care, the hospitals, as equal partners in a health care system based on shared and integrated care.  Direct GP access to acute hospital services such as acute medical and surgical assessment units and pathways need to be developed.  Over-reliance on the emergency department route needs to be fixed.  Hospitals are there to support primary care, not the other way around.  This culture change will take time but must happen through local discussion.</p> <p>  Such local engagement can be assisted through the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, supported local integrated care committees, based on the Carlow-Kilkenny model where GPs, consultants and management work together locally to improve patient care.  This should be funded and developed nationally.  We need a formal agreed transfer of chronic disease management into the community.  We also need to align information and communications technology between GPs and hospitals, a shared electronic health care record is vital for proper flow of patient data between community and hospitals.  We need to ensure that primary care resource centres are developed to act as service and diagnostic hubs and that these are accessible to all patients and GPs in each catchment area.  That is not the case for the primary care centres at the moment.  </p> <p>  The Deloitte report to the Royal College of General Practitioners, RCGP, in 2014 showed that every &euro;1 spent by GPs in primary care on people aged more than 65 saved &euro;5 in the hospitals.  This also gave better patient satisfaction and health outcomes.  It is now recognised that we must make a decisive shift to GP-led primary care.  All GP colleagues in the room today agree; and, the HSE, the Minister for Health and our health and social care colleagues agree. </p> <p>  This journey needs a ten year time frame and a new GP contract that supports this plan.  It needs ring-fenced funding to make the transition.  It needs political certainty to succeed.  GPs are ready and willing for the challenge.  That is why we are here today.  We hope we have provided some clarity on the challenges but, more important, on many of the solutions to achieving a health care system we can all be proud of.  We look forward to your questions on any of these matters.</p></speech>

I am a GP in Longford and am also chairman of the IMO GP committee.  My colleague, Austin Byrne is on the GP committee and is a GP in Tramore, County Waterford.</p> <p>  The argument that general practice is the optimum vehicle to deliver health care in the community setting has been made and proved without doubt and has been cited in a multiplicity of documents and research reports.  That there is a capacity crisis in general practice in Ireland is therefore without doubt and this is manifest in the reality that practices and general medical service, GMS, lists, which heretofore would have attracted multiple applicants, can no longer attract a single applicant.  In Thurles recently a practice of 1,200 patients which would have attracted a line of people a few years ago, cannot get a single applicant.  That highlights the real problem.  </p> <p>  The age profile of current GPs point to over 17% of current stock ready to retire in the next few years with little chance of replacement by newly trained GPs; 24% of GPs are over 60 years of age.  Newly trained GPs indicate that they intend to emigrate to other jurisdictions where they feel their talents are better appreciated and their aspirations from a professional and financial perspective are more achievable.  Newly trained GPs are also reluctant to commit to a health system which is failing as a result of the draconian reduction in funding foisted on general practice in the past few years.  They would like to stay but circumstances are driving them out.  </p> <p>  The resource cuts of 38% foisted on general practice have resulted in an inability to employ the staff required to deliver service to patients in a safe manner.  GPs are being stretched beyond breaking point with workload and general practice is being shunned as a career by those coming out of college.  They see what has happened.  With an aging population, an additional 20,000 patients aged 65 years annually coming on stream, a cohort which brings with it additional workload, this situation can only deteriorate unless very clear decisions are made and implemented.  The IMO has submitted a document which outlines the causes and offers solutions as follows.</p><p>The IMO calls on the Department of Health and the HSE to agree a strategy with the IMO for the development of general practice in Ireland in future decades.  To ensure the maximum benefit for both patients and the health system the strategy must include a manpower action plan to address the growing shortage of GPs and to include an increase in the number of GP training places and an assessment of practice staff needs including assistant GPs, practice nurses, managers and other support staff.  In order to halt the exodus of newly qualified GPs, priority must be given to negotiating a new GP contract with the IMO that is properly resourced and fit for purpose for a 21st century health service.  Incentives must be provided for the development of infrastructure including premises, medical equipment, diagnostic equipment and IT, as per the recommendations of the Indecon report which was submitted last year.  Access to diagnostics and allied health and social care professionals in the community are a necessity.  There must be a commitment to preserving the positive traits of general practice, including the community-based same-day appointment service where possible, the GP independent contractor model and, the role of the GP as gatekeeper to the health system.  Access to GP care should be expanded on a phased basis taking into account income and medical need rather than being based on age cohorts.  All of the above must be resourced properly.  That is the nub of the issue.  I hope we can provide additional insight to the health committee and enable it to provide support for the suggested measures.  We are happy to address the questions of members.</p></speech>

We have a more detailed submission which we hope is mercifully short.  It includes an analysis of the situation, but we are interested in solutions this morning.</p> <p>  We know the problems facing the health care service and we refer members to the briefing document.  We also believe we know the solutions.  In the accompanying briefing document we have outlined solutions for primary care based on the following headings.  The first is the cost efficacy of general practice.  A well developed general practice is a key feature of higher performing health systems than our own.  Another part of the solution, as my colleagues have outlined, includes building capacity in general practice.  We have 3,900 general practitioners and approximately 1,700 practice nurses who work largely on a part-time basis.  We believe that if want to deliver chronic disease management in this country and if we want to unburden the hospitals of primary care work and bring it into the communities we probably need closer to 5,000 general practitioners and, arguably, 5,000 full-time practice nurse equivalents.  The ratio between general practitioners and nurses in general practice in the United Kingdom is closer to 0.8 while in Ireland it is closer to 0.2 or 0.3.  We are seriously understaffed in both grades, in particular practice nurses.</p> <p>  Another part of the solution is to extend the use of information technology out of general practice where it is well established and into all other parts of the health system.  A further part of the solution to the problems that are being faced by the health system is delivering care where people want it.  People want their care to be delivered in communities and closer to home not in hospitals.  We believe building on current experience and expertise is part of the solution.  We need to move on.  The key issues facing general practice and primary care are recruitment and retention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.1119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karena Hanley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017020200002#E00600"><p>We know there will be a shortage of approximately 1,000 GPs in the next ten years.  That figure comes from a national manpower planning study.  Dr. Kerin spoke about the loss of trained doctors as soon as they finish GP training.  It is most important that we look at ways of retaining them as well as producing more doctors.  Let us look at solutions for retention.  General practice is an attractive career.  Drop-out rates during GP training are low but GP trainees fear that Irish general practice is not a viable career choice.  General practice in Canada, Australia and New Zealand is better resourced and those countries actively recruit here.  Their agencies are making it easier for our trainees to go.  As well as the economic loss it is a cause of sadness and ill feeling.  Emerging GPs want to do good chronic disease care for their patients in the community if appropriately resourced.</p> <p>  In terms of gender, under half of the general practice workforce is female.   Two thirds of women doctors work full time but they tend to work part time in their 30s, which is a time of intense child rearing.  A proportion of male doctors also work part time but there is a lack of flexible working options in the current GMS contract.  Some doctors who are employed by a practice do not hold a contract with the State.  Those doctors often do not receive any maternity pay or sick pay, as struggling practices now cannot afford to pay them.  Much better terms of employment are available to young doctors in neighbouring health systems in the UK, Canada and Australia.  As we have heard, access to diagnostics will help.  Some improvement in access to ultrasound was achieved in some areas of the country in 2016.  That is good but we need to build on it.  Some older GPs intend to continue to practise beyond their contracted retirement age.  That needs to be welcomed, planned and supported, with flexibility in the contract.</p> <p>  I will now turn to recruitment.  The national doctors training and planning, NDTP, unit tells us we need 100 more GPs to be trained every year.  The programme for Government agrees with that.  The ICGP supports that goal, and can deliver it, if resourced.  The ICGP will continue to work with the NDTP and primary care to increase GP training places.  We are currently training 172 GPs per year.  In the past six austere years, the ICGP delivered a 43% increase in training places with barely any increase in resources.  The dilution of GP training must be avoided as dilution will result in less resilient GPs with fewer skill sets, and will not help retention.</p></speech>

We wish to reflect on building capacity in the general practice team.  The primary care team was referred to from 2001.  A lot of time and effort has gone into it.  Arguably, the outcome from that has been somewhat disappointing.  Our interest is in building capacity in general practice teams.  Capacity in general practice is not just about GPs.  We want to build capacity so that we have GP-led primary care management of chronic disease in the community.  That will require an increase in all general practice staff.  GPs have the capacity to delegate work within their practices but the people to whom they delegate their work must also be appropriately trained and funded.  The concept is in keeping with the principle of enabling GPs to work to the higher end of their skill sets and contracts, leading to even more productive teams under the independent contractor model.</p> <p>  In the briefing document, we elaborate more on the following topics, including how to recruit and train more practice nurses.  In the ICGP we collaborate with our practice nurse colleagues in that regard.  We are also examining how to increase the number and capacity of practice managers and administrative staff, how we can interact and how the primary care team can be more effective as well as the extension of information technology, which in the Irish health system is really only located in general practice and must be disseminated into all other parts of the health system.  In colleges and university departments of general practice we can deliver ongoing research and educational support to effect those changes.  We are coming to the committee this morning with solutions and the members must put energy into those solutions, if they can do that.</p></speech>

We must examine how that will affect communities, the elderly and patients in general.  We recommend the delivery of a GP contract in 2017.  We also seek supports for emerging graduates from GP training and flexible working options in general practice.  General practice is successful.  In terms of value for money, general practice has been one of the most successful public private partnerships in the health system but actions must be taken to address the infrastructure of general practice.</p><p>These actions must recognise that GPs carry all the obligations and liabilities of providing the complete service.  We are giving away our GPs.  They are not returning in any significant numbers.  In the words of one recent graduate, now in Canada: "It would have taken so little to help me stay, it will take so much more for life to bring me back."</p></speech>

Before I open up the discussion, many of the members here today are also members of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  There is an understanding among all of the experts who have appeared before us that general practice is the core of how we build our future health service.  In that regard, we would like to direct our questions to how general practice can support this new health service.  I will take questions in groups of three as follows, Senator Burke, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and Deputy Kelleher.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.1124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017020200002#F00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive presentations.  I agree with what was said in regard to support for GPs.  It is fundamental that we develop this area in respect of which the cutback in funding has been substantial over the last few years.</p> <p>  One of the concerns for me in regard to health care is the many different groups in the area in need of funding.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, is seeking the recruitment of more hospital staff.  Everyone is looking for more funding.  As a country, we are the second highest in the OECD in terms of the level of spend in this area per head of population.  The question that arises then is where we are going wrong in terms of funding.  I agree we need to resource GPs but I am concerned about how we are going to address issues such as the fact that we have only 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 of population while the average across the OECD is 4.3; and the huge demographic change that is approaching at a very fast rate in terms of the number of people aged over 65 years expected to increase from 600,000 to over 1 million by 2030.  Approximately 51% of our hospital beds are occupied by people aged over 65 years.  How can we cater for this and at the same time improve the support for GPs so that more people can be kept out of the hospital system?</p> <p>  In my own area in Cork the population has increased from 410,000 in 1986 to 542,000 in 2016, which is an increase of 130,000, yet not one additional hospital bed has been opened.  We are asking GPs to do all of the work they are required to do at local level but to do so they need the backup of hospital services.  Where are we getting it wrong in relation to funding and where can we make the savings while at the same time put additional funding into the development of GP practices and supports for such practices?</p></speech>

Some of the information they provided is very worrying, particularly the high percentage of trained GPs that are emigrating and the age profile of those remaining.  I presume if this continues we will reach a crisis point.  Now is the time to ensure that does not happen.</p> <p>  How many practices currently have vacancies that cannot be filled?  What percentage of graduates from the GP training schemes end up practising?  In terms of solutions, would the reintroduction of the distance codes enhance newly-trained young doctors opting for rural GP practices?  The co-operative system is a huge success in west Cork.  Are there plans to expand that system?  Similar to the subvention for practice nurses, would it be helpful if a retiring doctor could access a subvention to enable him or her to hire an assistant young doctor?  In regard to the perceived shortcomings in the hospital system with regard to early discharges and so on, how does that impact on a GPs every day practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.1126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017020200002#F00500"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  I have the privilege and honour of also being a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  It is an exciting time in terms of the discussions that are taking place.  Everybody around the table will, I am sure, have a similar view in regard to how we deal with the changing demographics, the increase in population and transferring chronic disease and chronic illness from the acute system into the community and primary care system.  We are all agreed, and all of the reports and evidence would suggest, that this is the right thing to do.  How we implement that plan and the transitional phase will require an awful lot of front-loaded funding in terms of enhancing primary care. There is not much point enhancing primary care if all of our GPs are in Canada or Australia and so we are faced with a huge challenge.</p> <p>  Along with that, we are not training enough GPs.  This is not about retaining what we have, we need to expand capacity substantially.  Reference was made earlier to the need for an additional 1,000 GPs.  If we are to be honest with ourselves, there will be challenges in terms of ensuring that every practice is viable.  That is always going to be a challenge.  In that context, perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on their views on the difficulties being experienced in terms of recruiting GPs in certain areas and on GP salaries.</p> <p>  The bulwark of primary care is delivered by GPs in their surgeries.  This is based on a 44 year old contract.  I am aware of the ongoing discussions and negotiations on a new GP contract.  Let us be under no illusions, that is the critically important component in the delivery of primary care.  If that contract is not remuneratively advantageous or at least attractive, GPs will continue to flow outwards.  In that context, who in the negotiations is examining this issue purely from the clinical aspect?  In other words, who is advocating for the policies?  With the best will in the world unions are unions and they will advocate for their membership first.  In terms of our attempts to ensure there is enhanced capacity and so on in primary care, who is the voice of reason in the context of the negotiations in terms of what will and will not work?  Does the Irish College of General Practitioners have a role in that regard?  I previously raised that question with the Minister and he said he would consider it?  Whether that is happening or not, I do not know.</p> <p>  The National Association of General Practitioners has 1,900 members.  The IMO has 1,600 members.  Leaving aside all of the bartering and toing and froing in advance of the negotiations about representation and so on, are both parties equally represented at the negotiations?  Is there a lead negotiator or is there parity of esteem?  The witnesses might elaborate on that point.</p> <p>  If would be extraordinary if after all of this, half our GPs are outside the door and looking in the window.  If we are to get this right, the negotiations will have to be as representative as possible.  If one organisation is involved and the other is not, the committee will have to raise the matter.  It would be wholly inappropriate for us to be discussing the most important issue facing the delivery of our vision for health care if all GPs are not represented in the negotiations on the new contract to ensure it is teased out to the point where everybody gains.  I include in this regard the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and the plenary debate of its report in Parliament following publication.  This means the negotiations need to be as broadly representative as possible.  If it is not the case that all GPs are represented, the committee will have to have a discussion on it with a view to raising it with the Minister. </p> <p>  Reference was made to the Kilkenny model.</p><p>Recently, we discussed with consultants appearing before the committee the issue of GPs coming to the hospital, working with the hospital and greater links between consultants in the acute system and GPs in the primary care system.  There is also the matter of access to diagnostics.  We have heard varying views on access to diagnostics for GPs.  Some people say it is critically important while other clinicians of equal eminence say it is not necessarily the best way to go.  When the witness speaks about access to diagnostics, what type of diagnostics is meant?</p><p> There is planned elective surgery, elective appointments and elective diagnostics.  Whether that moves smoothly depends on the flow through the emergency department.  If there is not a great flow through the emergency department the elective surgeries and diagnostics take place on time, but if there is a build up in the hospital they all fall behind.  There were cases as recently as this week where breast surgery was cancelled just before it was due to take place.  That is really traumatic for people.  Should diagnostics in certain areas be separate from hospitals?  In other words, there would be regional diagnostic units that would function away from the hospital setting and not be dependent on what happens in the acute system.  Otherwise, they would be swallowed up again by the acute hospital system.</p><p> In addition to the role of the nurse specialist, is there a role for GPs specialising in certain areas as well, if we are to expand the GP service and the number of GPs?  I realise that general practice is a speciality, but within that context there might be GPs who work in the respiratory area, for example.  Is there a possibility that one could build expertise in hub areas within primary care as well?  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on that point.</p><p> Finally, what is the view of the representative bodies on the role of community pharmacists?  I accept there is a substantial difference between diagnosing and dispensing, but they spend a great deal of time in college too and most of them are quite bright people.  In view of the fact that they have premises in almost every village and town in the country, could they play a greater role in the delivery of primary and community care, obviously under the guidance and lead of the GPs?</p></speech>

He has identified the two key issues we have a problem with in the Irish health care system.  One is in the hospital system, where there is undoubtedly a bed capacity problem, and the other is in the primary care system, where there has been huge under-investment for many years.  The answer to the Senator's question is twofold.  We must deal with bed capacity.  However, if we invest in primary care, the pressure will come off the hospital system.  The issue we must get real with is that we will have to front-load the funding for primary care.</p> <p>  One of my roles as an academic is to look at this in detail and the data and a huge amount of international evidence show that we will get a bang for our buck if we put the money into our primary care system.  We know that one extra GP per 10,000 patients has an effect in reducing emergency department attendances and outpatient visits.  If we reorientate in that direction we will get a return on the investment very quickly.  The famous Rhode Island experiment is often quoted.  The state of Rhode Island in the US reorientated its health care system towards primary care and it got a fifteenfold return on its investment, even greater than the &euro;1 for &euro;5 that was already mentioned.  That was achieved within a 12 month period.  The crucial issue is that we must believe that we will get a return on investment if we resource primary care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.1130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Austin Byrne" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017020200002#G00400"><p>I will respond to Senator Burke.  It is refreshing to hear insight in terms of sound economic assessment and evaluation of capacity issues, bed numbers and GP numbers.  The committee, thankfully, appears to have a very good grasp of that.  The Senator mentioned that we are the second highest in the OECD in spending and asked why we have such a problem.  The key issue is that over the past eight or nine years we have built up a huge deficit in capacity at both hospital and general practice levels.  We have also built up a deficit in funding.  Capital infrastructure spending has been almost non-existent.  Our bed ratio is 2.8 beds per 1,000 in population, which is really low.  The committee is not seeking to discuss accident and emergency departments but it is worthy of mention.</p> <p>  On addressing the immediate issue of bed capacity, and Deputy Kelleher mentioned beds being blocked through accident and emergency attendances in terms of elective surgery planning, unless we get down to an 85% bed capacity the hospital system simply cannot function efficiently.  There is a view that it costs &euro;1 million to open a bed, but it does not.  Certain types of bed cost a great deal and certain types do not cost quite as much.  That is the first matter.  We must add bed capacity and it need not all be high dependency bed capacity.  If we offer extra capacity to our hospitals, we will free up beds for movement of patients and patient flow.  As we add beds, the cost per bed will drop off.  The other key issue is that our bed structure is highly fragmented and our cost per bed is highly variable throughout the system.  That requires careful examination, and it is not a job for today.</p> <p>  With regard to the separate groups, the Irish Medical Organisation, NAGP and ICGP are here today and there is the Irish Nursing and Midwives Organisation.  Everyone is looking for funding.  Looking at the fundamentals, we can say categorically that we have the lowest number of general practitioners per head of population in the western world.  That is a fact.  We have the highest number of nurses per head of population in the OECD.  That is also a fact.  Rather than looking at absolute numbers, we must look at the structures and patterns of work flow.  It is fair to say that many of our nursing colleagues would prefer to be working differently and smarter and, to use Dr. O'Shea's phrase, to be working to the upper end of their contracts or their skills sets.  We must develop the mindset of passing units of activity down to the lowest level of skills sets.  We need to farm certain activities down through the chain of activity - work our nurses and our GPs up to their game.</p> <p>  There must be serious amounts of front-loaded investment.  Our CEO announced in the past two weeks that he estimates &euro;9 billion is required.  That is quite a conservative estimate, and it is difficult to state a number such as &euro;9 billion without swallowing hard and taking a breath.  However, &euro;9 billion in the broader scheme of things, in terms of investment and the accumulated deficit over the last eight to ten years, is not an awful lot of money.  Bear in mind that if we do not make that front-loaded investment, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform finds it very difficult to sign off on the like of that, the cumulative deficit will continue to roll over and expand and the cost of providing care into the future will enlarge.</p> <p>  We then look to general practice as a solution.  I do not like the term "primary care".  Primary care is not general practice.  There has been much investment in primary care over the past number of years.  Centres have been developed.  They cost quite an amount of money to put in place.  The general experience among general practitioners, myself included, is that they are good buildings in good locations and easy for patients to reach, but they are largely unstaffed.  Where they are staffed it is by staff who have been relocated from hospital sector locations into the community on a part-time basis.  There are no additional units of activity or workload carried out by the staff who are relocated and who are working at capacity.</p> <p>  The further issue for the GP next door is trying to access a physiotherapist, for example.  A GP referral will receive a low priority triage, priority four, unless it is an acute injury.  A hospital discharge will be priority one because it comes from the hospital silo.  The physiotherapist who is now relocated to the primary care unit, therefore, at additional cost of room occupancy and the additional cost of mileage allowances to and from the primary centre of work, is largely performing the same activity they always performed.  They are working at capacity but we have brought another layer of inefficiency and another layer of cost into the system.</p><p>This brings us back to the initial question: Why are we spending so much?  We are spending so much because we are carrying out the wrong activities in the wrong centres and we are carrying out activities at higher levels of cost than is necessary.  We are carrying out routine disease reviews and medication reviews in costly outpatient settings because we do not have the capacity, the funding or the ability.  We are simply not allowed to perform it under contract in the community.  If we do perform it, we are straying out of contract and incurring a cost to the practice which is currently on the edge of viability in enough cases.</p></speech>

Senator Burke's question on where the funding should go is particularly important and we would concur fully with the observations of our colleagues.  The big picture thinking is that, in this country, we spend approximately 2.5% of our budget in general practice in the primary care part of the system, while the NHS currently spends 8% and it is moving towards 11%.  If the committee can advise the Oireachtas so that the Oireachtas makes correct decisions to effect that type of distribution, then we have the solutions.</p> <p>  The most important, effective and efficient part of the health system is arguably general practice.  We are pleased and delighted that Deputy Murphy O'Mahony perceives the co-operatives as being highly efficient.  They are efficient because they are run by general practitioners and are under the business umbrella, if one likes, of the independent contractor model.</p> <p>  Where should the money be spent?  More of it should be spent in primary care, particularly in the general practice part of it.  Another important question relates to where the diagnostics should be located.  It takes six to nine months to get an MRI or an ultrasound.  If we have standalones in primary care centres or hospitals delivering these services, as long as the access is equal to all citizens and efficient the Irish College of General Practitioners does not have a strong position on where the diagnostics should be located.  How efficient should it be?  Several years ago our colleagues in the Royal College of General Practitioners were appalled that it was taking more than six weeks to get a routine ultrasound so they decided that general practitioners should deliver ultrasound themselves.  They engaged in training and now have a training programme and provide GP ultrasonography.  This is part of what they are doing with their money and how they are using some of their 8%, as opposed to our struggling on the 2.5%.  There are various solutions.</p> <p>  Dr. Hanley will take over now, but I wish to make one last observation.  We all, including our colleagues in the HSE, have failed particularly the public patient in our industrial relations, IR, process over the past years.  We sincerely hope that we are moving towards an ongoing consultative and evolving contract that is examined every 18 months and that never again will it it take 38 years to do it. </p></speech>

We have really good news for the Deputy.  General practice training works.  It has a very low dropout rate and very good retention.  Some 92% of graduates from GP training remain practising as GPs, although, alas, at the moment not all of them in Ireland.  The other important point is that retention of GPs trained in a rural area is very good.  For example, in the past 30 years, of the 100 doctors trained in County Donegal, 50 have stayed practising as GPs in County Donegal.  County Cork has an even higher retention figure.  Train the GPs in rural areas and they will stay there.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked about practice vacancies.  The number of vacant lists have been accelerating.  It was approximately 14 in 2014, 21 in 2015 and now is 24.  The number is increasing.  She also asked about subventions for young doctors such as having a subvention for an older GP to take on a younger partner.  That is one of the suggestions in the ICGP vision for rural practice.  Of the four recommendations for rural practice, which include education and training initiatives, financial incentives and locum supports, the other recommendation is to fund a rotating assistantship.  This was successfully done in my practice when we had better funding, but we do not have the possibility of doing it at present because the level of funding is so badly reduced.  I will pass onto my other colleagues to answer other questions.</p></speech>

I will start with the issue raised by Deputy Kelleher on parity in the contract negotiations.  I agree it is important to address the issue because it is very important that all voices are heard.  As it stands, we have in excess of 1,900 members.  We submitted audited numbers of 1,800 at the time.  I understand that the IMO currently has 1,600 members.  What is happening here today is historic.  We have the three organisations here and we can see the commonality, the overlap and the same thinking and process.  As stated by the Minister, the new GP contract which is to underpin this shift to GP-led primary care is core.  I like the term primary care.  It encompasses all our allied partners, from dieticians to podiatrists and physiotherapists.  We will have our second primary care partnership conference at the end of March this year with international experts informing us of what works.  For any GP who was involved in the primary care partnership, there was an amazing synergy and energy last year when listening to our primary care colleagues on how we can best work together.  We need to work on that further.</p> <p>  On the contract, we sought clarity on it because, as it stands at the moment, we are dealing with the semantics of negotiation and consultation.  There has to be clarity, which we have sought, and we are waiting for the Department of Health to give it to us.  We have parity on the input and the output.  We all need to work together.  If that is not the case, I cannot see how the process can work, but we are awaiting that clarification from the Department of Health.</p></speech>

We can talk forever but there need to be timelines for implementation.  Even if the Department gave the appropriate resources to fund a fully-functioning contract and brought it in tomorrow, it could not be implemented because, as a result of the cuts of the past number of years, we do not now have the necessary capacity in general practice.  It needs to be regenerated but the only way to do that is to produce a contract that is functioning, that attracts people and retains GPs who are currently choosing to go abroad for more attractive conditions.  This will happen even more in the next number of years because the NHS will be looking for thousands and thousands of GPs and offering much more attractive conditions, right on our doorstep.  It is urgent that we get this done.  The roadmap should be brought forward to address that.  We need timelines and matching resources.</p></speech>

If the majority of GPs are sitting outside this process looking in, the process will not be completed in one year, or two or three years.  God knows how long it will take.  If we agree on the importance of underpinning our new health care reform with a new GP contract we have to get serious about the process.  Our stated position is that we want to get into the same room as the IMO, which represents the other element of general practice in this country, to work towards the development of a new contract as quickly and effectively as possible, so that everybody wins out.  I wish the IMO had a similar position.</p></speech>

The currency of general practice is time - the time to give to patients who present with increasingly complex problems as they get older.  We are heavily dependent on manpower and because resources have been cut over the past number of years there is not the capacity within general practice to provide the necessary time.  The resources are not there to hire people and most general practitioners probably have the workload of one and a half GPs and an additional nurse, but without the resources to hire.  This will get worse because, as people get older, presentations are going to get much more complex and the time needed will grow exponentially.  We need to address that.</p></speech>

We all have very significant performance anxiety over getting this right.  There are several ways to go about it but we know, from examples in other systems which have carried out effective reform, that consultation is the way to go.  However, our health system does not have that habit.  We will probably not get it all right and we will get bits of it wrong.  It is very important that the last paragraph of the contact stipulates that the contract will be reviewed again, not in 38 months but in 18 months.  We need to think German, that is, we must have constant negotiation among all the partners including the most important, which is not the general practitioner, nor the pharmacist, nor the practice nurse, nor the administrator but the patient.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.1162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017020200002#J01700"><p>I have raised questions about the efficacy of primary care centres.  They look very impressive and were very expensive but I do not know what they are supposed to do.  The theory sounds good but I am not sure.  My understanding was that they were to intercept patients before they crowded up the accident and emergency departments but it is not working out like that.  They have state-of-the-art facilities but I do not know what is going to happen with them.</p> <p>  In the opinion of the witnesses, where did it all go wrong?  I was a member of a health board and we all sat around a table once a month for a discussion.  We made decisions and every issue was highlighted long before it became an emergency.  A few years ago all GPs were listed in local newspapers as the highest earners in the country.  Does the Chairman remember that?  Where did that go wrong?  Something happened in the meantime but nobody told me what it was, and I am a former Opposition health spokesman.  Something happened within the structure of the service and that worries me.</p> <p>  The health services seem to be dumbing themselves down, or somebody is dumbing them down, to a huge extent and they are becoming demoralised.  When a GP job was advertised recently nobody wanted it because the talk on the street was that the practice was about to close down and would not exist in five years' time.  Who wants a job that is not going to be there in five years' time?  Nobody.  They were lucky, and delighted, to get one applicant but that person was not from the local area.</p> <p>  What is the problem with the delays in MRIs?  What is the cause of that problem and what are the logistical problems with MRIs?</p><p>If one goes to a private practitioner in an alternative medicine practice one can have the result of an X-ray in ten minutes.  If the X-ray is done in a hospital, one could wait for a long time, up to six months for it.  All that delay leads to substantially higher costs.</p><p> I would have thought by this stage it would be possible for everybody to access diagnostics through the hospital IT system and the highest quality advice should be available.  Why is that not happening?  Where are we going wrong again?  Mr. Chairman, we are talking about the people who are delivering on the ground.  The first port of call will always determine what happens in the system.</p><p> My final point relates to an issue I was dealing with yesterday, which will arise tomorrow as well.  There was a time a number of years ago when I used to be expelled from the Chamber for kicking up a row when questions about health were not answered.  During the health board system, Members had got answers to all their questions and then following the shift Members got no answers at all.  Members raise issues because somebody has raised it with them.  A patient raises an issue with the GP because he or she has a reason for doing so.  When we table a parliamentary question on the matter, we usually get a letter stating if the patient has suffered in the meantime or is facing increased levels of pain, he or she should contact the GP.  They have already contacted the GP and the GP has made the representations in the usual way and nothing has happened.  Why is that happening?  Why is the system not responding?  Delay creates problems for GPs and creates a backlog in the system.  We need to invest in hospital beds, GP services, nurses and consultants and training.  I am not so sure that we can invest all the money this requires all at the one time but I know we need to address the issue of waiting lists at accident and emergency departments as a matter of urgency.  There is no sense in having a ten-year plan for that, it has to be done now and it does not require rocket science.  From their vantage point, how would the witnesses solve this problem?  The rest will follow.  I know the Chairman is anxious that I stop. </p></speech>

I have a number of questions on that.  We hear from GPs about how pressed they are for time.  I can see in my constituency that the patients lists for the GP surgeries are long and they cannot accept additional patients.  I would not dispute for a moment that GPs are under pressure.  I do not think that making such statements about nurses is helpful but that is a matter for the GPs.  Would it not make more sense therefore if some of the business element of that were to be removed in terms of the employment?  I imagine it is difficult to be an employer.  I am not and never wished to be an employer but one ends up in that position.  Many of the GPs I have spoken to would almost refer to themselves as accidental employers.  They want to be doctors.  They want to work with their patients and do not necessarily wish be employers.  Would it not make sense to get rid of the allowance, the fee per item and all the administration that goes with it and have practice nurses and staff that are directly employed by the HSE?  I was examining the figures from the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, which outline the number of procedures and the number of claims.  For every procedure I can imagine a rainforest worth of forms that have to be filled out to claim back the money.  I do not attend a GP regularly but I know much of the work in respect of the fee per item claims is done by practice nurses.  If that element of the work was taken from the work of the surgery, it might free up GPs to do what they do best, and what they trained for, that is, the hands on care.</p> <p>  I apologise for having been obliged to step out for a meeting, so if my question on diagnostics has been asked already, I will be able to read the response in the transcripts.  I know from the parliamentary questions I have tabled and from the experience in my constituency that the primary care centres will be housed in lovely buildings but no additional staff are being employed in them.  If the witnesses could design an ideal fully functioning primary care centre and could staff it appropriately, what would be the staffing model?  What therapies would be on offer?  What ancillary and allied health professional staff would be available and how would it function in terms of the machinery and equipment?  In terms of a fully functioning primary care centre, would equipment, such as scanners and near-patient testing and so on be required? </p> <p>  In regard to the community intervention teams, CITs, what is the GPs' relationship with them?  I understand that some CITs operate as a separate stand-alone resource and some are integrated.  Will the witnesses tell members how the system operates across the country?  Members will know how it works in their area but the witnesses might be able to give us an understanding of their relationships with the CITs.</p> <p>  I raised the question of blood tests with the Minister for Health yesterday.  I understand there are issues with blood tests and I would like to hear both sides of the argument.  My understanding is that medical card patients should not have to pay for routine blood tests that are part of the diagnostics.  Yet I have seen notices in doctors' surgeries advising patients that if they are not prepared to pay for their tests, they should be prepared to take themselves to the local hospital to have the test conducted.  Perhaps members could be enlightened as to what is the issue with blood tests.  Perhaps that is tied into the issue I raised earlier.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late.  Unfortunately I am on two committees that sit at the same time on Thursday mornings, so I have to jump between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Health.  Like Deputies O'Reilly and Kelleher, I too am a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, which is devising a plan for the next ten years.  Politics has failed health in the past 30 years.  There has been constant change, constant movement on strategy, geographical imbalances and not taking account of the demographics, as well as a range of issues.  We need a timely and comprehensive plan for health.  </p> <p>  I often find that the internal politics of health could actually give professional politics a run for its money.  In fact in many cases I think it is worse, which is part of the problem.  The internal politics of health are a significant issue.  Somebody needs to bite the bullet and say it out straight.  In the future of health care process, there is agreement - more or less - that there will be a period of transition and transitional funding will be required.  Decisions are being made on a range of issues which cross over to the direction of the recommendations.</p><p>Obviously, the whole area of the GP contract is intrinsic to it.  One of the best presentations given to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare was from a number of the hospital groups.  One group CEO, Colette Cowan, said that in order to alleviate the issue she had in her hospital in Limerick the best thing to do would be to take away a whole pile of her budget and actually put it out into the community and primary care.  That is the sort of thinking we need from everybody; someone who wants to give away a large amount of their own budget and someone who is willing to actually change the way they do things.  The way in which GP practices are currently orientated is not right or correct.  There is not a comprehensiveness with regard to service provision, geography or anything else.  This is partly the fault of politics and the fallout of health strategy.  It is also partly the fault of the GPs.  Nobody is immune.  Politicians are at fault, health professionals are at fault, health strategy is at fault and GPs are at fault.</p><p> The future of health is like a big jigsaw that is going to have to be put together.  It is going to take a comprehensive period of time and a lot of political leadership over the next number of years.  It is also going to take leadership from the individual bodies.  We all know that with regard to the next GP contract, there were issues with what was previously left in place for a ridiculous length of time around its inflexibility and the way in which it was structured.  I have had numerous conversations with many members of the representatives' organisations on this, especially over the past year.  We are facing into a crisis given the volume of GPs who are about to retire, the demographic changes and the fact that we are not creating enough training places.  That is all obvious and it needs to be dealt with quickly.  I reflected on what my colleague Deputy Billy Kelleher said earlier that it is absolutely bananas for negotiations for the GP contract to go on without all of the representative organisations in the room.  It is nuts.  It shows that we have not learned anything and that we are going down the same road again.  An action of this committee - that I hope the members will support-  is to write to the Minister for Health on foot of this and make a recommendation that the negotiations are to include everybody.  Otherwise the negotiations will then have to be continually reassessed.  It is going to go on for years, and we do not have years.  I hope the Chairman will take this on board, please, as one recommendation we should all make.  My colleagues on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare will hopefully support that also.</p><p> On the requirement to create new GP training places, we need to be smart in this to correlate the fact that we also need to create capacity and volume for the other professionals needed in the primary care area - whether it is assistant GPs, practice managers, practice nurses etc. - because frankly, we need all of them also.   That is an important issue.  With regard to the new GP contract we also need flexibility in the type of contract in place.  The contract does not have to be the same for everybody.  The contract has to be fair and equitable but the same type of contract that operates in one location may not be necessary in other locations.  There are many differences between urban and rural practices.  There are a whole range of different factors that can influence that.  We need flexibility, be it direct hire contracts or other types.  There is one question, however, that I would like all six of the delegates here to answer directly.  This involves a figure - I am a very straight talking person as everyone knows - and I do not want a narrative on this.  What does a GP practising out of Dublin 16 expect to earn in one year in 2017?  What would a GP working in County Tipperary, in example in my home town of Nenagh, or in Ballina or Killaloe in my constituency and the Chairman's, expect to earn in a year?  Taking into consideration the costs etc., what would a GP expect to earn? The public would like to know that and I would like to know that so we can measure information during the process we must go through on the GP contract.  What are the expectations of GPs?  It is a critical question.  Chairman, I am nowhere near finished.  I have a serious issue with the timeframe on this, which I believe needs to be set out and shortened.  I agree with the comments that were made on the requirements for community health, the integration of this with GPs, how they are operating and the diagnostics.  I will not go through all of the topics because they already been commented upon.  We also need to look at our capacity to bring in GPs from outside the State.  Somebody needs to talk about this.  It is unfortunate but there is going to be an interregnum where we are not going to have enough GPs, even if we were to solve this in the morning.  There will be a period of time required for the upskilling and training of these doctors.</p><p> I would like to find out some statistics on how many doctors are actually not practising.  How many GPs who are fully able-bodied and under retirement age - or around it - are not actually practising?  Why are they not practising?  What are the consequences of this in the areas where they are not practising, such as in Limerick?  In the opinion of each and every witness here today, is it acceptable for GPs to bring in locums and pay them to run their practices?  I would like the witnesses' opinions on this.  In principle I agree with my colleague, Deputy O'Mahony, on the issue of the co-ops but I am beginning to wonder a little bit about co-ops.  There are issues, which the Chairman knows about, in west and east Clare.  With my health hat on I have an interest in them all but I am especially interested in the issue in east Clare because I actually use the co-op in Killaloe.  I live on the Tipperary-Clare border, more or less.  We had a situation where 12 doctors were involved in a co-op and two left, one retired and one moved to Limerick to fill a position - probably the issue I spoke about previously.  The co-op's out-of-hours service reduced from 58 hours to eight hours.  In that scenario GPs lose local support and local authority.  The current GP contract, I accept, should no longer be in place and is completely out of date, but GPs have a responsibility for out-of-hours services because of this contract.  That sort of behaviour is not good PR for GPs.  Granted there are many issues there, but is it acceptable in the view of the witnesses?</p><p> I spoke earlier about the differences between rural and urban practices, the allowances available to doctors and that, for instance, there would have to be some form of allowances for certain costs.  I understand that.  Surely, however, they should be phased out over time?  Have the representatives here today any comment to make on the whole area of pathway management to acute care?  Pathway management to acute care is a critical issue.  I live in a town, Nenagh, which has a minor injuries unit and hospitals in Limerick are bursting at the seams with the volume of referrals.  I do not understand why the minor injuries units cannot take greater volumes than they currently do.  This would alleviate the situations such as in Limerick.</p><p> It is very important that any future contract is managed.  Any future GP contract would need to have a reporting system to the HSE and to the public, based around performance of GPs.  For instance, without naming any names obviously, the management information would measure the volume of referrals each GP makes to an emergency department every month, week and year.  When ambulance personnel come to me - and I will not say from what area or town - and talk about the volume of referrals in the same town from one GP versus another GP, it sets off alarm bells for me.</p><p>The demographics are the same as is the volume of people using each GP.  Why, then, is there a difference?  While there could be reasons, we have to find out.  At least, with that management information, others could investigate.  That sort of stuff needs to happen.</p><p> I am in complete agreement on the Carlow-Kilkenny model and the integration there.  Do our guests expect that to be possible everywhere else around the country given the unique geography of some areas, etc., and the provision of the services available in those areas?</p></speech>

I cannot overemphasise the efficiency and productivity of a well-functioning, good general practice team.  If this is also then embedded well in a primary care team, the potential to sort out a lot of these problems is enormous.  We had such a lovely vision back in 1992 in the "Future of Health" document which described a really good way forward.  Once again, there was talk about investing in primary care and general practice, but once again, it did not happen.  Deputy O'Reilly talked about practice nurses and practice staff perhaps being employed by the HSE, but that fragments care.  From talking to businesspeople, one knows that someone who is self-employed in his or her own business with a well functioning small business unit can increase productivity by 20% compared to State employment or a large, anonymous organisation.  If one has practice nurses and practice staff employed by the HSE, that will increase fragmentation of care.</p></speech>

One will not have unity of the practice message and one will not have unity of the practice objective and vision.  That practice objective and vision must be to care for the patients.  One of the unique things about general practice is that there is a mutual investment by both patient and doctor in a continuity of care over the years.  This is a rich therapeutic problem-solving relationship which begins to really spin efficiencies as the doctors and practice nurses know their patients.  There is a loyalty and a continuity of care.  If one fragments that and loses that dedication to the general practice vision and objective within that practice, one will have lower productivity and worse outcomes than one has in the tight ship that a good general practice is.</p></speech>

Changing the name on the payslip for the woman or the man who is a member of the practice staff would not, I imagine, in any way dilute their loyalty, commitment or ability to care for patients.  However, it would alleviate a lot of what the witnesses tell us are the burdens of running a small business and all of that.  I have spoken to GPs and one of the things they say to me is that they do not just care for their patients but are required to run a small business on top of everything else.  A change in the name and handing the hassle to a big employer like the HSE, which has a payroll department and a HR department and all that goes along with that, while maintaining the ethos of general practice is a bit of a no-brainer given what GPs have told me about the nature of the business and the fact that it is very time consuming to run a small business.  Taking some of that out, I do not accept would-----</p></speech>

The problem is that the infrastructure has been hollowed out of general practice, which has made it very difficult to manage the escalating employer responsibilities, health and safety and so on.  While all of these are coming to all businesses, there is no other business which has had its potential for income generation diminished in the same way as GMS general practice.  That is why that is such a heavy burden.  However, 66% of emerging GPs see themselves being independent contractors in five years.  It is a model that has been proven to work and my experience is that it fosters the loyalty to provide a good service.</p></speech>

I practice in Newbridge where we have physiotherapists.  We have some private physiotherapists in Newbridge and we have HSE employed primary care physiotherapists.  For whatever reason, it takes six, 12 or sometimes more weeks to get an appointment with the HSE-employed physiotherapist.  The HSE physiotherapist operates on a paper-based system.  It is not easy to get on the phone to the therapist directly.  The private physiotherapist can be contacted by text and e-mail and will see the patient the next day.  The perception of patients, regrettably, is that the care provided by the HSE-employed physiotherapist is significantly less good than the care provided by the private physiotherapist.</p></speech>

It is difficult for us to criticise our colleagues in the HSE because we know many of them are passionate about what they are doing.  We have a consensus among ourselves that the independent contractor model, properly resourced from 2.5% up to 8%, delivers efficiency.</p> <p>  I am moving on to another question, which relates to waiting lists and what can be done about them.  There are 600 patients occupying hospital beds who are delayed discharges.  If we had more capacity in social care and more community-based home-care packages and if general practitioners were enabled to do more in nursing homes so that they could build their function, one would suddenly have 600 expensive beds transferred to less expensive beds in the community.  These are the things we believe will actually deliver efficiencies.  We have 540,000 people on waiting lists.  Most of them are on waiting lists for investigations.  If we had access to those investigations, we could do them in general practice.  We could do ambulatory care and keep these people out.  In the same way that we have 600 delayed discharges occupying beds, it is a cause of huge demoralisation to us that we have to send people to these hospital beds while our colleagues in the NHS, in Perth and in Vancouver can do an awful lot more to keep people at home.</p> <p>  Going back to Deputy O'Reilly's question, I refer to Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's observation that co-operatives are in charge of 1 million consultations a year in the out-of-hours setting.  They are delivered efficiently, quickly and powered by the independent contractor model that is run by general practitioners.  That is efficiency.  It is with deep regret that I note that the HSE has inherited a situation where it is in charge of enormous waiting lists.  The co-operatives are the independent contractor model.  Our practices are the independent contractor model.  We did a very odd thing in the Irish College of General Practitioners, which was to carry out some research.  We asked patients what they would like.  We asked them what they would like in chronic disease management which is the big enchilada in all of this.  We asked them if they would like consultant-delivered management of their chronic diseases or specialist nurse-delivered chronic disease management delivered in a hospital.  We asked them if they would like nurse-delivered chronic disease management or GP-delivered chronic disease management.  We collaborated with our colleagues in pharmacy on this study.  We asked 600 patients, the majority of whom said they wanted GP-led primary care management of their chronic diseases.</p> <p>  There are some things we are not certain about.  We know with respect to our health system that we appear to have more administrators relative to other more efficient ones.  We know that they are paid a little bit more than in other systems.  We know that they have managerial tools that are based on paper.  None of these things is enormous, but they compound.</p><p>We guesstimate that over &euro;20 billion is spent on payroll.  We want more than 2.5% and we want that money to go into one of the most productive spaces, which is the interaction between clinicians and patients in the community.  We want more care at home.</p></speech>

When I established my practice in 2012, I was eager and keen in terms of my engagement with the primary care teams but I quickly found myself at 8 a.m. meetings that went on to 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m. because of a lack of leadership and decision-making and meanwhile my patients were waiting for me.  I was not resourced to be at those meetings.</p></speech>

I am not as a GP making myself distinct from other colleagues in primary care but somebody has to take the lead.  I see the GP, who knows the patient and the effect of decisions made at meetings on patients, as being that decision-maker.  Also, there is replication of tasks, lots of note taking by hand with no IT support and so on.  The point made by Dr. O'Shea regarding the private versus the public service in terms of physiotherapy is well made.</p> <p>  In terms of solutions, the National Association of General Practitioners has examined the issue of primary care resource centres, which is a move away from primary care centres.  A primary care resource centre would be a service similar to the primary care centre but it would comprise the type of services required in individual areas.  For example, services such as outpatient infusions for chemotherapy, removing blood for hemochromatosis, diagnostics, imaging and so on would be provided by the primary care resource centre but there would be no GPs in the centres.  Instead, GPs would be linked to and have full equitable access to their services. </p></speech>

The GPs that did not partake in the primary care centres strategy are effectively blocked from accessing them.  In theory, they should have the ability to refer.  If as a GP, I operate from an office down the corridor from a GP who has access to a HSE physiotherapist and I have a patient with acute back pain who needs help, the latter will probably help me.  The corridor chat is perhaps the Irish way of solving issues.  We need to move away from that to primary care resource centres to which we all have equitable access.</p></speech>

There are already in place structures to deliver services such as MRI scans and so on but they need to be scaled up to accommodate volume.  There is no need to develop another structure to accommodate that volume.  What is important is access to services rather than the geographical positioning of them.  The process of providing access to MRI scans and X-rays online is very complex because these services are integrated throughout the country.  Splintering that up into small hubs in various areas of the country will result in exponential cost.  We need to expand the current service to accommodate the need.  In terms of what is proposed, the result would be more groups seeking to gain income as opposed to an increase in patients' access.  As I said, what is important is access.  We need to scale up access.  Where it is already in existence it is working well.</p></speech>

It all went wrong in 1973, shortly after the new contract was signed.  We took the waterfall mentality of roll-out that is very common in public sector contract formation, namely, identify the problem and build current capacity around the need or demand while projecting forward.  We cannot do long-range forecasting in health very easily.  We certainly cannot do long-range demographic forecasting very accurately.  We had a 1970s solution to a 1970s problem and as it rolled on it picked up baggage and excess need such that we currently have clinical unmet need patients who cannot access the services they need.  Those patients, because they deteriorate in their clinical condition, tend to spill into services that are above their need.<br/><br/>We also have a huge layer of unmet need in terms of things we need to do that we currently do not do.  In addition to GPs to man access to services for patients who cannot access them, we need GPs to man the services that we currently do not even consider to be GP services.  As such, we have two layers of unmet need.<br/><br/>FEMPI came along in 2008.  Reference was made to the glorious days of the wonderful salaries publicised in respect of GPs.  My own practice was regularly listed in the top-ten earners, although towards the end of the list, unfortunately.  It all looked wonderful.  Included on the list were salaries of &euro;600,000 for a practice in Tramore but that was a meaningless number, a top-line figure.  In other words, the figure was the amount of funding provided to run the practice.  Much was dependent on the structure of the claim system and the allocation of patients.  In our case there were two doctors at the time and a third assistant.  If the allocation of patients was weighted towards a single doctor in practice the list would reflect that in a single list number whereas there could be another practice equally-sized further down the road with three doctors but in respect of which the patient allocation, because the three doctors had opted to co-locate, was an equal split such that the payment to the practice was one third of that announced, or &euro;200,000 per doctor, such that they would not make the list.  Each doctor could be paid &euro;205,000 such that there would be a higher total net top line income but they would not feature on the list.  As I said, the list was meaningless.  It should be borne in mind that that list represents top-line gross.  For most practices, it would be necessary to take 50% to 60% off in terms of overhead costs and opportunity costs, such that the list would not be reflective of the true picture.  <br/><br/>FEMPI destroyed us.  The 38% cut in GP salaries was a top-line cut.  Operating costs did not change.  Patient demand and activity did not change.  This leads me to the question posed earlier by Deputy Louise O'Reilly in regard to blood testing.  Blood testing in the 1970s most people would agree was a rarity.  Blood tests were generally done in an acute emergency.  In other words, if a patient was bleeding, blood testing would be carried out to see if he or she had a bleeding tumour.  That is very different to the role of blood testing these days and the role of blood testing into the future, which for Ireland, means enhanced near-patient testing.  To suggest that a practice currently performing thousands of blood tests per annum should be offering those <i>pro bono</i>under a capitation system that was never designed to fund them and does not fund them, is very difficult to square.  I understand that among patients of lower income that is a barrier to care but there is an obligation on the health service - this was confirmed by Dr. James Reilly when Minister - to provide those blood tests in the local hospital setting.  There is no similar obligation under contract.</p></speech>

Many of these people are patients who need blood tests and cannot face having to go to a hospital to have them done.  How does one square that circle?  My understanding is that the HSE is of the view that this is a service, regardless of the increase in demand, that is already being paid for.  The person in the middle of all of this is the patient.</p><p>Whatever way one tries to square the circle, that is not fair.  I do not believe any of the witnesses would be comfortable with the notion that people would call to their surgeries knowing they need a procedure but not having the cash to pay for it - the witnesses have reminded us that they are running a small business - and on seeing that notice on the wall deciding to take themselves home.  People in the United States are having to make a decision as to whether they heat their houses, eat or get treatment.  Patients in general are now making a decision as to whether they heat, eat of treat but that is not right. </p></speech>

That number grew over the intervening years to approximately 2.1 million.  The 2.1 million patients in 2014 were funded to a total amount that was less than the funding for the 1.4 million patients in the earlier period.  Therefore, demand grew but funding fell.  Funding allows for time and time allows us to see capacity and therefore, it is all interlinked.  It is a simple see-saw process.</p></speech>

Let us consider patient demand and those complex patients who are on eight medications or more.  These are people generally with diabetes, hypertension and complex multi-morbidities who attend hospital services if they are not properly managed with preventative care.  Between 2004 and 2014, this cohort of patients rose by 300%.  Therefore, the number of the most unwell in those ten years tripled and the demand for services among the most unwell tripled but the capitation remained fixed and, in fact, it fell off because of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  The problem is one of contract design.  We have an inflexible contract where all of the risk is on the provider and the purchaser gets off scot free.  If we flip it on its head and consider the contract that exists in pharmacy for dispensing, all the risk is on the purchaser and the provider takes no risk.  As we scale the amount of medicine dispensed, we scale the fee paid.  When a patient is on eight medications, the dispensing fees are about 4.5 times the fee that is paid for medical care in the community.  That is no fault of anyone but that is a fault of contract design and that is something that we need to look at very carefully.</p></speech>

To return to an earlier point, we are not in the habit of having these conversations and we will just have to get good at it.  It has to be an evolving contract.  This is also a feature of more efficient health systems than ours.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy O'Reilly's point, the blood test issue is very important.  We have had a thousand difficult conversations with the patients in my small practice on this and it is utterly hateful.  I was going to say the blood test is a symbol but it is about monitoring chronic disease.  It is a matter of doing the test, making sure the results come back, communicating the results and perhaps altering the medication.  Therefore, it is not just a blood test.  </p> <p>  Dr. Austin Byrne's observation about the contract is correct.  The contract we are operating is for the diagnosis of disease; not for the actual monitoring.  It is really simple stuff.  </p> <p>  An important issue that has popped up in two instances here is why general practitioners are not going into the primary care centres and there is also the matter of those doctors who are suddenly working much fewer sessions.  </p></speech>

Some of them are leaving.  These are established GPs, tough resilient people like us, who are saying goodbye to it.  That is beginning to happen.  That is part of our 2015 crisis, but largely it is a numbers game.  We need to move from having 3,900 GPs and 1,700 part-time practice nurses, arguably towards having 5,000 and 5,000 full-time, respectively.  Thereafter, if we get modest amounts of money, we will be able to do the blood tests.  Anything that one wants done will be done at a fraction of the price in general practice.  It simply cannot be done for nothing.</p> <p>  With respect to why GPs are not going into primary care centres, arguably, there are not enough of them.  A question was asked as to why we are not going to primary care team meetings, which are important.</p></speech>

We are having difficulty getting them into our practices.  Partly it is a financial issue and partly they do not want to have a thousand conversations with patients about not being able to do their blood tests.  They are not going to explain to poor patients why they have to wait for six or 12 months for an MRI.  That is what our younger colleagues are saying and the rest of us are pinned into the ground.</p> <p>  Another important point related to referrals and why some doctors refer more and some refer less.

A common reason we refer more is that when one becomes significantly distressed and stressed, one's perception of clinical threat becomes higher.  If one is working a 50 or a 60-hour week, doing paperwork out of hours and then going on to one's co-operative to do a four-hour shift and doing the same workload the next day and day after and worrying about the different issues with which one is dealing because there are not enough GPs in the practice, then one will tend to refer a little bit more.  That is one of the well understood reasons we refer more.</p></speech>

However, that does not stand up to scrutiny.  I know of an example - I will not give the details as it would identify the GPs in the area - in which the practices are similar, the GPs are of a similar age and the patients who attend them have a similar demographic profile but yet one refers substantially more into a place in Limerick, a video of which the witnesses would have seen when 12 ambulance were pulled up outside it at one stage.  Perhaps it was just a bad day but I am being told by ambulance personnel that this is a frequent occurrence.  Dr. O'Shea explained what potentially could be happening but that management information, which is what I consider it to be, on those statistics needs to be churned and that needs to be examined or, dare I say it, investigated.</p> <p>  I asked a number of questions which have not been answered.

That has been retracted.  It is very important to clarify that in Shannondoc, which is the out-of-hours service, there was a 7% referral rate to that hospital over the Christmas period.  That is a metric that is audited and that is a fact.  When we consider that sick people attend Shannondoc, a referral rate of 7% is tiny.  What we saw with those 12 ambulances was the back-up, what was going on inside the hospital and the people in the ambulances were sick patients.</p></speech>

I know all the individuals involved there.  I have no issue with that.  There is no issue with the majority of GPs but we need to know if there are substantial differences and, if there are, why there are, and they have to be explained.  If they are explained that is fine, but currently they are not explained.</p></speech>

I am a rural GP and will return to work a Shannondoc shift tonight.  I will cover west Clare, from the Shannon Estuary to Galway Bay.  Deputy Alan Kelly correctly identified the changes that had occurred in Shannondoc, which I completely agree have been extremely regrettable.  The only area about which I can speak is west Clare where five years ago there were 20 doctors working, but now there are 15.  We have lost 25% of our workforce.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide the cover we once provided.  It would be fantastic if we could.  To me, this is the perfect symptom of what is going wrong, which is that we cannot get GPs to work in rural areas and urban deprived areas.</p> <p>  Examples have been given of practices which have no applicants.  I know of a practice which advertised a vacancy in Naas, a commuter town which one would perceive to be well off, but no one applied.  This is happening across the board.  I am particularly aware of the problem in rural areas where there are real challenges.  There are increased poverty and deprivation levels.  There are also increased age levels which are associated with the multi-morbidity described.  We go to work every day to try to keep our patients away from hospitals.  I echo the statistics mentioned.  We simply cannot get people to fill posts.  It reflects what young GP trainees think about their future being in this country.  We need the contract badly because there is a complete lack of certainty about career progression.  If we could provide the contract, perhaps we might provide certainty and be able to bring back the cohort who are already abroad.</p> <p>  People spoke about locums running practices, but we cannot find locums and even if we could, we would not be able to afford them.  There is huge variability in the general practice model throughout the country such that we need to take the differences into account.</p></speech>

The contract is not fit for purpose because it does not recognise current demand and that the delegates are interested in the negotiation of a contract that could be reviewed and would be responsive to patient needs.  I am a trade unionist, as the delegates know, and I absolutely respect their right to be represented collectively, but sometimes I think GPs do not do their own cause any favour because they come across as small business people and that this will not help them.  What they are saying is they are interested in a contract that would be responsive to the needs of the patient.  I have views on what it might contain, as do the delegates, but that is where they are at in the negotiations.</p></speech>

Deputy Louise O'Reilly summed it up really well, for which I thank her.  </p> <p>  I will take up the issue of a variance in standards between doctors, to which Deputy Alan Kelly alluded.  The ICGP has a great interest in raising the standard of general practice.  The evidence shows that one of the most effective means of raising standards is by giving feedback on prescribing rates for benzodiazepine and antibiotics.  If there is a problem with performance, feedback on average performance is the best way to improve and change behaviour.  The ICGP is poised and ready to deliver this feedback with the Irish primary care research network, but we need a little more investment.  The project has stalled because of a lack of funding, but the ICGP is poised and ready to be very effective in this area and provide solutions.</p> <p>  The question was asked how many GPs were not practising.  The TCD study tells us that 76% of all GPs are full-time.  They work eight clinical sessions a week and have another three devoted to paperwork.  There is evidence that these GPs work 60 to 70 hours a week and then provide an out-of-hours service.</p></speech>

The question I have asked is very simple and the reason I am asking is not to stick anyone to it.  We need to know what GPs' expectations are with regard to staying in or leaving Ireland after completing all of their training.  There are costs associated with living in Dublin, County Tipperary or County Clare.  I am asking for a ballpark figure.  It would give an understanding or set a concept for us and the general public.</p></speech>

The first is to think of any service provider in the State who has expertise and invested a huge amount of time in training to get to a certain point and has the full gamut and range of responsibilities of a GP.  The second way to arrive at the figure is through international evidence on primary care services which suggests that to have a strong primary care system GPs should earn at least 80% of the salaries of their hospital consultant colleagues.</p></speech>

I want to include Senator John Dolan in the questioning.  We can come back to all of the issues raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.1244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017020200002#P01800"><p>I thank the representatives of the three organisations, whose input has been helpful.  It is quite clear after two hours of questions, observations and comments that this is a massive issue which we have to work our way through.  We are here to speak about issues related to general practice manpower and capacity and a properly functioning primary care service.  Clearly, the contract and from where the money comes must be part of the discussion, but it must go beyond them.</p> <p>  Representatives of two of the three organisations spoke in their initial presentations about chronic conditions, illnesses and diseases and the role of the GP.  I want to focus on this issue, in particular.  My particular interest throughout my working life has been people with disabilities and meeting mental health needs.  I have worked with the entire gamut of organisations.  People with chronic conditions do not account for the majority of the population but they certainly account for the majority of users of the system.  Huge improvements have occurred in the past two decades in the longevity of people's lives.  Morbidity is one of the legacies as regards what happens to people who do not die earlier, to put it as crudely as possible.  I have several questions, but I will triage them and keep them brief.</p><p>All of us - the joint committee and everyone else with an interest in the issue - must consider how the groups and organisations that support and represent people with a range of conditions can gain direct access to what we will try to fashion.  This relates to the first question I will ask.  Members will be aware that there are support organisations for people with particular conditions, for example, Alzheimer's disease, stroke or muscular dystrophy, and people may or may not know about these groups depending on whether they have an early diagnosis and so on.  These organisations have a role to play.  I wish to address the issue of self-management.  In the past decade or thereabouts, I have seen people with certain conditions going through programmes independently and this has given them a better sense of control, ownership and leadership over the condition with which they and their families are struggling.  Dr. Byrne spoke about passing down units of activity.  In a sense, what I am speaking about is passing units of activity and partnership down to the person who has a chronic condition and his or her close advocates, for example, a family member.  How can that become a richer part?  We have many groups, some stronger and more competent than others, associated with various chronic conditions.  These conditions are being diagnosed earlier and people are living longer.  I ask witnesses to give their initial observations on that.  </p><p> Will the witnesses name one or perhaps two actions, changes, developments or obstacles outside the health system that have an impact on health and welfare?  We spoke about inside the health service but there are other parts of people's lives and public services that have a bearing on how fit, competent and supported people can be in dealing with various eventualities.  </p></speech>

While the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and this committee are different forums, many members sit on both committees.  We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because the health service is at a critical point and we have an opportunity to promote change.  This will be done in the report to be published in the coming months.  We must move in the right direction because if we head off in the wrong direction, the health service will be dead in the water.  We also need to assist the Minister and Department to move the health service in the right direction.  One of the core findings of the committee will be to recommend a shift from hospital-centred care to primary care, community care and general practice, whichever way people may wish to describe it.  As the witnesses stated, general practice does not have the capacity to take on additional work because the system is on its knees.  What are the fundamental triggers that would bring about change and help us to move in the right direction to build a service based on community care?</p></speech>

One of the biggest issues facing us all is the ever growing obesity problem.  Education on diet, exercise and so forth should be provided from childhood onwards, starting in cr&egrave;ches and schools.  This would make a major difference if implemented properly.</p> <p>  I have a model on my desk for nicotine replacement therapy.  It is a cube which contains tar and when turned upside down, thick tar drips downwards.  It shows the amount of tar deposited in one's lungs after smoking 20 cigarettes per day for two months.  Every child who comes into my surgery is transfixed by it and they all find it disgusting.  This model should be in every classroom in the country because it has a visual impact on children.  We should create something similar for alcohol and diet to be shown to children at a very early age because they feed off teachers.  If a child's teacher says something is right, he or she will think it must be right.  Unfortunately, there is a major deficit in this area.  This is one simple thing that would have an impact across the board.  I know it would require an investment over years but it is one issue that would hit home.  It is an example that stuck in my mind and one which could be done.  </p></speech>

I have been examining this issue in detail in my academic career, focusing particularly on self-management.  This is a major element and almost an elephant in the room in the sense that we do not talk about it nearly enough.  My particular expertise is in high blood pressure and physical activity.  It is clear that if we enable patients to monitor their blood pressure, it has a benefit in reducing blood pressure by almost the same amount as one of the medications patients take.  This practice has a very powerful effect and I am delighted the Healthy Ireland strategy places emphasis on this type of approach.  It has been shown clearly that brief interventions by general practitioners are extremely effective in encouraging lifestyle changes.  However, such interventions require time and general practitioners are running to catch up with ourselves.  If this could be enabled, it would be a very powerful mechanism for dealing with much of the morbidity we are experiencing and would genuinely empower people to manage their conditions.  Not only does this benefit the individuals in question but it also benefits the health service.</p> <p>  In terms of actions outside the health service, I very much agree that obesity is only one of a number of the health tsunamis on the horizon.  In many ways, the obesity tsunami has already struck.  The National Association of General Practitioners very much supports the idea of a sugar tax.  This measure could be very effective.  We have also expressed public support for minimum pricing for alcohol.  The alcohol Bill before the Oireachtas is important because general practitioners see day in and day out the detrimental effect alcohol has on lives.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.1251" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017020200002#Q00700"><p>As the time is winding down, I will keep my responses brief.  On Senator Dolan's question on how we can get people more involved, the Irish College of General Practitioners has grappled with this issue for some years and we recently agreed an approach for 2017.  We intend to establish a process in which we will approach some of the larger voluntary patient organisations to ask for assistance in identifying representatives of the public interest for appointment to our committees.  We have some experience with this approach, which we regard as necessary and of vital importance, although it is also difficult, complex and challenging.</p> <p>  At practice level, I suspect that if Dr. Glynn were not here this morning and did not have to rush down to do an on-call shift and probably deal with some paperwork on his way, he might have more time in his practice to formally engage with the people who come to his practice.  This means doing practice-based research, including on patient satisfaction, and meeting more patients, not in the context of their illness but in terms of, "This is our practice and what will we do about it."  This brings us back to the issue of numbers and manpower.  We need more general practitioners and nurses.  If we get 5,000 general practitioners and 5,000 practice nurses, we will be able to operate earlier on in the life cycle.</p> <p>  To return to the question on what we could do that would make a difference, although we are spending enough money, we are spending it too late in the life cycle.  I strongly concur with Dr. McGarry's observation in this regard.  It is an educational and health care principle that the return on every euro spent on education in the first five years of life is &euro;20, whereas the return on euro spent in adolescence is &euro;4 and there is very little return for every euro spent on people aged in their 20s.</p><p>The same applies in health care.  Understandably, we are spending a large amount of money on hospital-based care, on the care of advanced disease and on the complex co-morbid patient.  We want to be able to deliver high-volume brief interventions in our practices.  There is a strong evidence base for this when it comes to smoking and people who are overweight, but it is simply not getting done.  We need to focus where we are putting our spending.  We are asking the committee to bring us in line, up from our 2.5% closer to the 8% figure.  In England, with Brexit and so on, they are going to a figure of 11%.  We will deliver better value for money with our independent-contractor model.</p></speech>

Let us extrapolate manpower assessments, requirements and needs in conjunction with demographic trends for the coming years and the associated health needs.  Reference has been made to obesity, but the key issue is the ageing population as well as chronic illness and disease.  Let us suppose we have an extra 1,000 general practitioners.  Is there not a role for some specialists within general practice?  I have in mind GPs specialising in certain areas within practices to deliver front-line care in the GP setting.  For example, my GP is a former surgeon.  He loves ingrown toenails and so on.  Other GPs will not perform those procedures to the same extent.  Is there a possibility for specialty work within practices, whether respiratory, chronic or whatever?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.1254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017020200002#R00300"><p>It is obvious from listening to the deputations this morning that the new contract is somewhat down the road.  I am concerned about the disconnect between GPs and hospitals.  Deputy Kelleher referred to the Kilkenny model.  Is anything being done to try to improve the connection in other locations?  Such moves do not seem to be under way.  As a result, GPs cannot get advice from the people further up the line.  This needs to be fast-tracked now.  As I have said, it seems we are somewhat down the road from a contract.  Therefore, the question arises of how we deal with it in the meantime.</p> <p>  I met some junior doctors with the National Association of General Practitioners.  One point that came across from the meeting was the lack of confidence on the part of GPs about the extent to which they could make a living by being a GP.  One suggestion thrown out was the question of four or five sessions in hospital.  That would cover at least some costs.  Recently, I spoke to a GP from Canada.  She goes to the hospital and does four three-hour sessions per week there.  She has a direct connection with the hospital and the GP practice.  We do not seem to have this type of cross-over.  The emergency consultants were before the committee last week.  They maintain it is happening in some hospitals.  However, it is on a small scale.  Is this something we should try to develop?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.1255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017020200002#R00400"><p>These are important questions.  I will address the question about GPs with a special interest: life is a bowl of toenails.  Some of them attract perverse incentives for removal.  Let us suppose I send one of my patients to a private hospital.  The cost of the procedure by billing through private health care will end up in the order of approximately &euro;500.  This includes a greater fee for the surgeon and there is an anaesthetist on stand-by in case anything goes wrong in a clinic room.  If I do it for a patient under VHI cover, it will cost approximately &euro;80 or &euro;90.  If I do it on the medical card system on the public side, the public patient gets the thin end of the wedge and the cost comes in at approximately &euro;38.  Therefore, I cannot do it for the public patient.  That was twisting me up inside, so I stopped doing them.  We have carried out surveys of the members of the college.  Approximately, one quarter of our GPs are keen and interested in developing special interests.  A doctor with an interest in diabetes in a four-doctor practice could really lend an edge.  It is a question of manpower: we are short of the doctors to do it.</p> <p>  I will move on from toenails.  The next question was about the disconnect between hospitals and GPs.  We are working on this.  We know what we need to do.</p> <p>  Those of us going back to busy surgeries need to be able to engage.  We are looking at local integrated care committees.  This can be done elsewhere.  Part of it is a question of manpower.  It is difficult to get out of our surgeries.  The minute anyone leaves the surgery, the practices immediately start running at a loss in a material way.  It is not only a financial thing.  Patients need to be seen.  We need more doctors and practice nurses who can do work we are doing at present.</p> <p>  We know what needs to be done.  We have had different people looking at our system.  I am keen to highlight one of the observations.  It comes back to the point about the chaos outside University Hospital Limerick and the ambulances.  One issue is the gap at regional level.  We work hard in our surgeries.  Our specialist colleagues in public hospitals work appallingly hard in the public hospital system.  We do not have the mechanisms to integrate on a system-wide basis.  There are isolated examples.  Everyone refers to the arrangement in Carlow and Kilkenny.  The consultants and GPs there put in the extra hours to put something in place and they got funding for it.</p> <p>  Much of our funding at the moment is delivered in a manner that is exquisitely sensitive to budgets.  It is control-centred.  An overview of our system suggests we need more autonomy in regions, towns and villages.  We need more direct involvement with clinicians.  However, for that to work, we need more clinicians.</p></speech>

The arrangement in Carlow-Kilkenny is the shining example and it is often referenced.  That was a long process.  I have been there and I have examined the model.  I have tried to get something similar established in Limerick.  One theme that came out related to trust and relationships.  The building of trust and relationships has to be organic.  This is difficult when people are under pressure and are facing cuts.  It is also difficult for GPs operating in marginalised areas that are no longer feasible.  There is a level of hurt and mistrust between the departments and the HSE.  We need to build that up.  It happens slowly over time.  I will summarise a theme that came out today on the contract side.  It relates to what Deputy Kelly has said about the joint committee writing to the Minister to make this happen.  The message for the Irish Medical Organisation is that there is a need to work at the same level and that building the contract together is better.</p></speech>

There is definitely a role for it.  That has been internationally proven.  Efficient high-volume turnover is the key.  A certain volume of procedures need to be done to a certain standard.  The difficult is the current manpower deficit.</p> <p>  I will make a brief comment on the salary question referenced earlier by Deputy O'Reilly.  I would collapse at the thought of my practice nurse becoming a HSE employee.  I realise that may sound abrupt, verging on rude.  However, we know from looking to the public sector that levels of efficiency are perhaps well under half of what they are in the independent contractor sector.  We know levels of sick leave are approximately four times higher.  We know that public health nurse visits probably cost the State approximately nine times the cost of funding a practice nurse visit after we factor in all the associated costs.  Moreover, we have a barrier to innovation.  If I want to change something, I have to refer up to national level.  Things can only be done on a national level.  There are barriers to local changes to meet the needs of the individual community and small pockets of people.  It is a fine idea to try to separate us from some of that workload, but I do not believe it will happen.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelly was mad for a number.  Am I going to give him a number?  No, I am not.</p></speech>

It is very difficult.  The model sounds attractive in rural and deprived areas.  It is going to be next to impossible to implement because the associated costs and overheads will more than double the cost of service provision.  I can provide numbers for that later.  It is really tricky for a public health service to provide that.</p></speech>

They would lap it up and we would be sold a pup.  Similarly, on the IT side, the notion that tele-medicine is going to revolutionise general practice is not going to happen.  It accommodates and facilitates the patient movement.  It relocates the interaction.  It does not shorten the interaction.  It does not provide better outcomes.  It does not provide safety.  It is largely rolled out on behalf of providers to add an additional value added layer of profit.</p></speech>

The evidence given this morning is extremely important and will be built on.  I think we will revisit it in the not too distant future.  What is the one trigger the witnesses could see that would trigger a change from a hospital-based, hospital-centred service to community-centred services?</p></speech>

A 2014 Oireachtas report described it as the linchpin of primary care.  We have heard talk about shifting resources again and again and we have experienced the reverse.</p></speech>

Properly resourced general practice contracts are probably the biggest game changer.  I think many other things will follow on from that.  We will be able to retain our trainees.  We will get the complement up.  The independent contractor model as it is will enable us to involve more practice nurses.  We will be able to do more in villages and communities.  We will be able to go into nursing homes.  We will be able to accept patients from the acute hospital system and if we get diagnostic firepower then we will not have to send anything like as many into hospital.  Then we will be on to a winner.</p></speech>

Our traditional contract model deploys resources in a capitation based method.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, has warned against this in the past year.  We need to ensure that resource flow follows activity, complexity, efficiency and with quality as the underpinning factor.  Move it down the value chain to the most competent area at the highest, most appropriate level of expertise.  We tried it in the past and we said closest to the patient and we spent an awful lot of money building white elephant centres to relocate staff with no additional activity.  We need to be careful not to replicate that.</p></speech>

It has been said that resource allocation to primary care and to general practice has been promised and the reverse has happened.  The consequence is the crisis that faces us now.  We have pointed out what the problems are.  They have to be addressed and solutions have to be created.  The solution is to resource general practice adequately, to bring back people who can deliver for patients.</p></speech>

I quote the director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, one cannot build a service on fresh air and goodwill.  I think he has clearly pointed out that there needs to be transitional funding put in.  That is the trigger and the mechanism to achieve this.  We need to underpin it with a fit-for-purpose GP contract.</p></speech>
