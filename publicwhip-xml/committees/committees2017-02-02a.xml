    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#A00300"><p>We have a quorum and are now in public session.  We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to this committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Mahin Fitzpatrick.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of last week's meeting on 26 January, 2017.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  I wish to raise one item arising out of the aforementioned minutes.  We had quite a long discussion last week with the Secretary General of the Department of Defence, Mr. Maurice Quinn, about the sale of the Government jet.  I propose that the committee writes to Mr. Quinn to clarify a few issues because a couple of people have contacted me since our meeting and raised a number of matters.  First, I understood clearly from Mr. Quinn that there were access issues in terms of other people inspecting the Government jet and the spare parts in the hangar in Georgia.  I want him to explain how he arrived at that conclusion because I have been informed that there were no access issues and all one would have had to do was ask.  Access was put up as a reason for not getting an outside opinion.  Second, in his statement Mr. Quinn said that a lot of the spare parts did not have certification and I want some documentary evidence on that.  I also want know what document he issued to the Air Corps seeking certification and any correspondence received back confirming that there was none.  Finally, I just want to raise a point relating to our remit.  We accept that a decision had to be made to either sell the Government jet as it was, in parts on the floor and get the best available price - which is what actually happened - or fix it and put it back in the air.</p><p>There is a third option that was not considered, which I ask to be considered.  If someone took a vehicle into a garage and parts of it were on the floor, it may have been economical to put it back in working order and then sell it.  I am told that if they just repaired it and put it back in working order it could have been sold without any ongoing commitment at substantially more than was actually achieved.  There is no evidence that that option was explored.  No evidence was given to us that it was explored.  I would like to know the Secretary General's views on whether that option was considered and to see the documentary evidence that it was considered.  There appears to have been a Government decision to sell it.  Normally, somebody with a knowledge of selling things would have been involved in that process.  Did they seek to appoint any third party - some kind of broker - with knowledge of the industry to sell it or was it just done by civil servants?  I will ask the Secretary General to clarify those matters.  I am not disputing anything he said but I want those matters clarified because people who were watching proceedings contacted me afterwards with those questions so I would like them clarified. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B00200"><p>I want further clarification.  There was some discussion about the informal contact the Department used to give a view on the different options for the sale of the jet.  We had previous reports from the Air Corps and then we had this informal contact.  It seemed that somebody in the Department made contact with somebody they knew and that this person was paid &euro;900.  A number of e-mails were submitted.  I asked if we could get that correspondence and further clarification on who that person was.  Has that been asked for?  If it has been asked of them, have we got it yet?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B00300"><p>That is one of the points already communicated to them in writing to supply.  The one thing the committee will do is make sure we have a tracker system in place so that when we ask questions we get replies within a reasonable period and not weeks afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B00400"><p>On the same point, we asked Tusla and the Department, when their representatives appeared before us last time, for information on the guardian <i>ad litem</i>scheme.  We sought an awful lot of further information.  I have not seen any of that come back.  It is the same point.  We ask for clarification but it is hard to track whether we get it within a reasonable timeframe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B00500"><p>I will add to that.  I forget how long ago it was that we had representatives from the Department of Social Protection in to discuss the insolvency fund.  We asked for information and we are still waiting for it.  I am not letting it go.  I submitted a parliamentary question on it to further prompt the information.  We have to be very clear; we have to have a tracking system so that we do not move on and leave questions hanging in the air.</p> <p>  Those are matters arising from the minutes.  The next item is correspondence received.  We have a briefing document from the Department of Justice and Equality - No. 276A.  We have that.  The opening statement from Mr. Noel Waters for today is No. 280A.  When did we receive that?  When I went looking for it yesterday I could not find it.  It has already been in the system for a number of days.  </p></speech>

He caught us on the hop.  We will all get a copy of that.</p> <p>  I will move on to correspondence, No. 266C, i to iv, and No. 267, i to ii.  This is correspondence from last week where we are awaiting another explanatory note.  It all relates to payment of public moneys by Dublin City Council to Ballymun regeneration programme.  We agreed to forward this correspondence to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and when the Secretary General is before the committee on 2 March, we will discuss this matter further.  We have put him on notice of that.  There is a new item of correspondence here today.  Do any members have anything further to add or can we just keep it on the file until 2 March?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We have sent it on.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 275C, i to iii, a letter from an anonymous source which attached a newspaper article regarding lease agreements entered into by the OPW.  We note that.  It is just a newspaper article.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 277C, an e-mail received from two individuals who are involved in the ongoing case with the University of Limerick.  The secretariat has written to the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser for advice on this matter.  I propose that at our next meeting, the committee gets a brief from the parliamentary legal adviser on this particular issue.  We are also scheduling the third level institutions to appear before the committee in April.  I suggest we inform the University of Limerick that this topic will be discussed at that meeting.  We will come to that meeting in our work programme in a few minutes.  We note that.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 297C, i and ii, from NAMA regarding the sale of a property in Dublin 8 and an issue raised by Sager Management Limited.  The correspondence explains that the situation has been dealt with, that the individual has been contacted and is engaging in the process.  I propose we note this correspondence from NAMA.  Is that greed?  Agreed.  For the record, it is interesting to note that although NAMA was the secured lender on the property, the property remained under the control of the debtor and it seems NAMA is at arm's length from the actual sales process.  NAMA has been in direct contact with the individual.  </p> <p>  No. 4 is statement and accounts received since the last meeting.  They will come up on the screen now.  They are in front of us.  No. 4.1 is Leopardstown Park Hospital board, clear audit opinion; Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, clear audit opinion; Health Service Executive, patient private property accounts, clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to the issue of internal control.  That is specifically on our work programme.  On 9 March, we will deal with the HSE specifically on the patient private property accounts and the fair deal scheme.  We will deal with other HSE issues separately.  Those two items are specifically on our agenda.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 4.4 is special account for the purposes of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, clear audit opinion.  The next item is the Repayment Scheme (Donations) Fund.  There were nil proceeds to that account in 2015.  It was very easy to get a clear audit report when there were no transactions.  That was an account whereby the Repayment Scheme (Donations) Fund was set up to receive voluntary donations from beneficiaries of the scheme to be used to fund improvements in health services for dependent old persons and persons with disabilities.  People will recall that some people were in institutions without the proper legal sanction and they sought refunds of charges and everything like that and &euro;1.67 million was paid out in 2015.  Many families felt they got very good service and they made a donation back of the amount received.  Other families chose, in recognition of the happy service they received, not to make a claim in the first place.  </p> <p>  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General tell us if there is much left to be paid in that fund?  Is it nearly over?</p></speech>

I have noted that the total expenditure to end-2015 was &euro;453 million.  That was the total amount of reimbursements that were made from 2006.  I expect at this stage that most of it has been worked out.</p></speech>

There will possibly be indications in them.  I take it the claims date has passed and no new claims can come in at this stage?</p></speech>

If the committee is interested, it would seem to fit quite closely with the patient private property accounts and the fair deal scheme.  They are all related issues.  Perhaps if the HSE would provide an update and assessment of where they are at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#B02700"><p>It is under the HSE.  We will write to the HSE to get an update and summary on that whole issue because &euro;453 million is a big amount of money.  We were all conscious of it a couple of years ago but we have kind of forgotten about the issue since.  We will add that as an agenda item when representatives from the HSE are in next month.  We will discuss the patients fund account, fair deal and the special account for the purposes of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  We will put that on the work agenda for that meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is our work programme.</p><p>There is a draft going up on the screen.  Today we have officials from the Department of Justice and Equality specifically to discuss the Vote for the Prison Service and the Comptroller and Auditor General report.  We will not deal with the broader Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p> Next week there is a meeting scheduled to deal with Project Eagle.  Just on that and even without going into private session, the conclusions of the secretariat's work will be circulated to all members next week.  In December while we were working on it in addition to the normal secretariat that is available to us we had the support of another staff member as well as help from a second person.  They have been moved to the secretariat of the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  The clerk is finalising it on his own and we are still doing our routine business as well.  It is fully understandable why it has taken the extra week or so.  The clerk assures me we will all have the document from the secretariat next week.  We will then discuss it and amend it accordingly leading to a draft and then a final report.  How long that takes will be up to the committee.</p></speech>

My understanding is that we were doing an examination of the sales process of Project Eagle - an examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and we were not carrying out any investigation.  This is now quite sensitive in respect of whether a commission of investigation is established.  We can all have different opinions and interpretations.  We can all put our own spin on it irrespective of the side of the fence we might sit on.  Whatever opinions people might have here, it is important that it be factually set out making clear exactly what this committee was doing and what we were not doing.  We all stayed within the boundaries because it was made very clear to us that we were not examining actions that might have been criminal or illegal by any individual or organisation.  It is important for that to be on the record.  I am asking for that paper to be provided.</p></speech>

We did not seek powers of compellability.  We are examining the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and that is it.

I sought additional staff when we commenced our work and we had staff going through all the correspondence, summarising everything for the report, and they were available to us until the beginning of January.  We probably thought we would have had a draft report in January.  It has taken a little longer because we held our public hearings right up until Christmas week.  We were still in receipt of correspondence subsequent to those meetings.  It is unfortunate we do not have the full complement of staff to see it through.  The outcome of it is that we are no more than a week or two behind where would like to have been.  We would like to be finishing it up now, but we will have the final work from the secretariat in the coming week.

There is political messing happening on this issue.  We have been stalled in completing our work not least because of a staffing issue on the one hand, as it now emerges.  On the other hand the political system, in the form of the Government, is saying that it is stalling the ball on a commission it had already committed to on the basis that it wanted to see our report.  It is completely unacceptable to put this committee and us as parliamentarians into that position.  I would go so far as to say that if at this stage we have to postpone all other work to finish our work on Project Eagle, if the Taoiseach or anybody else is using this as a pretext to delay a commitment they entered into - I certainly speak for my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, and I imagine for others - I am not prepared to be used in that way.  I find it utterly unacceptable.  Let us remember the ambition had been to publish all of this at Christmas time.  That got held up; we all understood that.</p></speech>

We do work programme planning here every week.  There are resources there that are specialised because of the work of Project Eagle.  There are staff working on that.  Some of those staff were removed and we were not informed.  Our work programme planning has gone out of kilter because we are not aware of what staff were there to do the work in the first place.  We can only do X amount of work because we have X number of staff.  This is X minus Y which we were not informed about.  When did this happen and why were we not informed?</p></speech>

A week or two ago we scheduled not to have any other business next week so that we would be able to deal with the report from the secretariat.  I am satisfied that we will have that report from the secretariat, but at this stage we may not have it in sufficient time to have that meeting next Thursday.  Our original intention a couple of weeks ago was to get it out this weekend and we would have a detailed discussion in the coming weeks on that document and prepare a draft report.  We will have that report next week, but I do not envisage us having it in sufficient time to allow a detailed debate on it next Thursday.  However, members will have it next week.  We are a week behind schedule on that.  I will take up all the issues that have been mentioned.</p></speech>

This is not a criticism of the clerk to the committee but my office was in contact with him and there were seven or eight e-mails exchanged.  The response I got back about the delay implied that it had nothing to do with staffing.  Staffing was not even referenced.  I was told that the delay was to do with tying up loose ends.  That is the problem we have; there was no clarity given to us, right through the process, as to exactly what was happening and why.  If that can be-----</p></speech>

The clerk checked with me and I said that we cannot release the document until we are in a position to release it to everybody.  I held back until this morning's meeting because I wanted to clarify the position for all members.  Staffing issues are not normally within the remit of politicians in the House.  We did get some extra support but it is very disappointing that, at the final furlong, that was pulled back.  Had that not happened, we would have been at the finishing line now.  That said, we are nearly there.  I do not want to undermine the report just because it will be produced two weeks later than originally planned.</p></speech>

That is the document that we will sit down, as elected members of this committee, to discuss and then we will start making our amendments to it.  At that time it will become a draft report of the committee, ultimately leading to a final report fairly soon thereafter, I hope.  The document that will be circulated next week is not a draft report; it is only a document that is being prepared for the committee's benefit.  Are members happy with that?  I do not know if I am right or wrong in saying this but if any of that document is leaked, we will have to take measures when drafting the actual draft report to make sure that it will not be widely circulated in advance of publication.  I am putting members to the test in that regard.  If any of the secretariat's document appears in any part of the media, we will have to sit behind closed doors.  If somebody breaches the confidentiality of the committee next week, he or she will not be able to do so again when we are the drafting of the final report.  Can we get agreement on that?  It is not fair to the rest of the committee if one member goes off and leaks it in an effort to get a bit a kudos.</p></speech>

We will wait and see but that is a possibility.</p> <p>  In the meantime, our work schedule is as follows.  On Thursday, 16 February we will be meeting the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to discuss the appropriation accounts, Vote 30 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter on EU refunds and levies in the agriculture sector.  On Thursday, 23 February we will be dealing with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, while on Thursday, 2 March we will meet the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to discuss the appropriation accounts, the Vote for environment, community and local government and the Comptroller and Auditor's chapter on central government funding of local authorities.  We will also discuss Chapter 5, which deals with progress on land aggregation.  We will also discuss the Ballymun renewal project, which has been the subject of correspondence with this committee.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 9 March we will meet the Department of Health and the HSE to deal with patients' private property accounts, the fair deal nursing home scheme as referenced in the HSE's financial statement, as well as the special account for the purposes of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  The latter will be included that as an item on our agenda for the meeting on 9 March.  There will be separate meetings with the HSE about section 38 and section 39 hospitals and so forth.  </p> <p>  On Thursday, 23 March we will meet the Department of Education and Skills.  I propose that on Thursday, 30 March and Thursday, 6 April, we deal with the third level institutions.  In the first instance, we should start with some of the universities and we can go on to the institutes of technology later.  I believe we should open up the session with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, which deals with all third level institutions.  We will try to determine which universities we should call and in what order.  I have no particular view as to which universities to invite but would point out that we cannot invite them all.  The University of Limerick has been brought to this committee's attention through various correspondence.  DCU was highlighted in terms of big procurement issues during the course of the year-----</p></speech>

If any member wants the committee to invite a particular university to either of those two meetings, he or she should pass a request on to the secretariat but we will not be able to cover all of the universities.

On Thursday, 13 April we will meet the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss the Department's Vote and the procurement and management of contracts for the direct provision system.

We are meeting the Department of Justice and Equality today but that is strictly to deal with the prisons issue.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 4 May, we hope to have the Revenue Commissioners in before us.  In fact, that meeting has been confirmed.  After that, we will move on to the institutes of technology and finally, the Department of Finance.  The schedule is such that we have a number of weeks for which we can select particular topics outside of the chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Between Easter and the summer recess, I hope to have a number of meetings, the agendas for which this committee can be selective about and determine who to invite.  We will come back to that but if anyone has any suggestions in the meantime, please let the secretariat know so that we can put it into our work schedule.  </p> <p>  That is where we are with regard to our work programme.

There has been a ruling in the courts relating to an action taken by a previous witness to this committee.  This committee was vindicated.  There was a lot of talk at the time that the action was initiated against this committee and indeed, against the State, about the remit of the committee, the conduct of its members and so on.  It would be useful to get a report back from legal services personnel to clarify a number of the issues raised.  The court made a very clear decision in favour of the committee.  I ask that the legal representatives be invited to appear before us to explain the verdict, offer clarifications on the remit of this committee and how it conducts its business, as well as any learning from the case itself.</p></speech>

We will do that.  While I know the ruling has implications for the Oireachtas as a whole, the case originally stemmed from the Committee of Public Accounts.  I agree that we should hear directly from the parliamentary legal advisers as soon as they are in a position to do so.  I would be surprised if they are not already working on it, with a view to meeting us.</p> <p>  Finally, there is one item of correspondence that I skipped over by mistake, reference number 281C , from Deputy Marc MacSharry.</p><p>It concerns matters relating to a certain property acquisition by Galway City Council in 2007.  We have a detailed folder that has been supplied to the Deputy.  We decided not to circulate it to all members because of the volume involved but I will ask Deputy MacSharry to make some comments.</p></speech>

It came to my notice there was a transaction in 2007 with Galway City Council acquiring land, it would appear, without appropriate valuations and at a very substantial premium above market value at the time, as well as a number of other anomalies.  I propose to speak to the clerk privately and refine the specific points I would recommend the committee considers.  Perhaps at that point we would circulate them to the committee, which can decide whether to look into this.  I know we do not have competence over the accounts of councils but we have competence over the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, which under the appropriate Acts is bound to approve all borrowing by local authorities.  There was borrowing of &euro;10.5 million in this regard so it would be useful for us to examine what level of oversight the Department put into practice.  This is just one example I believe is worth looking at, as it may have been replicated in every local authority area in the country.</p></speech>

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving the evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.

Payment of salaries, wages and allowances totalled &euro;235 million, which represents almost 71% of the total expenditure in 2015.  The Prison Service spent just over &euro;47 million on buildings and &euro;26.5 million on prison services, including expenditure on food and cleaning materials etc.  The main capital development project being undertaken by the Irish Prison Service in 2015 was construction of a new prison in Cork at a total estimated cost of approximately &euro;45 million.  This new medium security prison for adult males has an operational capacity for 275 prisoners and is the committal prison for counties Cork, Kerry and Waterford.  The relocation of prisoners from the old Cork prison commenced in early 2016.  The Accounting Officer will be able to brief the committee on the proposed future use of the old Cork prison.</p> <p> A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.3 million was voted for the Prison Service in 2015.  At the end of the year, the unused surplus for surrender was &euro;1.26 million.  The account received a clear audit opinion.  However, in my certificate, I draw attention to the Accounting Officer's statement on internal financial control, in which he discloses the level of non-compliance by the Prison Service with national procurement rules in respect of goods and services procured in 2015.</p> <p>  The report for consideration by the committee this morning relates to an examination by my office of the annualised hours system which operates in the Prison Service.  This system replaced overtime in the Prison Service from late 2005.  Historically, overtime levels were very high in the Prison Service.  Overtime costs peaked at &euro;59 million per year in 2002 and 2003.  Under the new annualised hours system, prison officers contract to work a fixed number of additional hours annually to a maximum of 360 hours per year over standard rostered hours.  When the Prison Service was planning to introduce the system, it was projected that it would result in significant financial savings.  I wanted to examine what had been achieved in that regard.</p> <p>  Following the introduction of the annualised hours system, the average number of hours worked by prison officers over and above their basic work week was halved.</p><p>The new cap on the number of additional hours that a prison officer may work ended the practice of some individuals working extremely high numbers of hours.  There is now a more even distribution of earnings from additional hours.</p><p> Prison officers are paid for contracted additional hours at a rate of 1.8 times the basic hourly rate.  A related pensionable allowance of 8% of basic pay is paid to each prison officer regardless of the number of additional hours he or she contracts to work.  This includes approximately 7% of officers who do not contract to work any additional hours.  My examination found that the average overall earnings of prison officers have not changed significantly in cash terms since the introduction of the new system.  Prison officers are paid for all of their contracted additional hours but may not be called on to work the full number of hours.  Additional hours not worked are called write-off hours.  While the average level of write-off hours across the Prison Service in 2014 was 15%, there was significant variation across the 14 prison institutions.  Open centres had the highest number of such write-off hours.</p><p> The Irish Prison Service has a low ratio of prisoners to prison officers relative to prison services in other states.  This suggests that some efficiency gains may be possible.  The joint task reviews that were carried out under the 2010-14 and 2013-16 public service agreements resulted in changes to staffing configurations.  No in-depth review of the tasks carried out in prisons and the resources required for those tasks has been carried out since 2001.  In particular, there was no formal process for the identification of potential efficiencies which may have arisen from prison infrastructure expenditure, which came to a total of &euro;223 million between 2001 and 2014.</p><p> The Prison Service anticipated that the introduction of the annualised hours system would result in a reduction of approximately one third in the amount of sick leave taken by prison officers relative to 2001 levels.  Sick leave levels increased significantly between 2001 and 2005.  The incidence of sick leave fell significantly after the introduction of the annualised system, but the reduction achieved to date has not been to the level anticipated by the Prison Service.</p><p> The Prison Service estimated that the annualised hours system would produce savings of &euro;31 million a year.  This was not achieved.  The examination estimated that the average annual net salary saving as a result of the introduction of the annualised hours system is approximately &euro;5.5 million a year.  Furthermore, the savings achieved to the end of 2014 were offset by substantial lump sum payments, totalling &euro;41 million, to serving prison officers when the new system was introduced.  As a result, the estimated net Exchequer saving over the period 2006 to 2014 was approximately &euro;8 million.</p></speech>

I might ask my colleague, Mr. Michael Donnellan, who is the Director General of the Irish Prison Service, to say a few words at the end if that is okay.  I acknowledge the useful work that has been done by the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff to determine where we are going with annualised hours.</p> <p>  As I have set out in my statement, there was a long history behind the agreement to introduce annualised hours in the Prison Service in 2005.  To put it simply, the decision to introduce annualised hours was made against a background of very substantial overtime working in the Prison Service, which cost a considerable amount of money and led to inefficient and ineffective ways of operating the service.  At one point, the level of overtime in the Prison Service was very close to that in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is a much bigger force.  I can come back to that point later in our discussions.</p></speech>

I am not in any way questioning the validity of the points made by the Comptroller and Auditor General when I say I know from my discussions and my reviews with prison management personnel over recent years that they believe the system of annualised hours has brought about a sea change in how prisons can be managed and has contributed greatly to securing efficiencies against a background of making much-needed reforms in the prison system.  A review that is taking place at present is assessing whether further improvements can be made in the system.  We can talk about this during the course of the morning.</p> <p>  I accept that the savings involved have not been as great as those which were initially hoped for.  This is largely due to a decision by an independent body to provide compensation on a scale greater than that which the Prison Service had argued was warranted for the changes which had been made.  By its nature, this was outside the control of the Prison Service.  Nonetheless, I think the Comptroller and Auditor General's report recognises that real and significant savings have been achieved.  A former Minister of State in the Department said at the time that "despite reservations ... about the deal that emerged [it was] accepted that the overall package represented a workable way forward for the future".  It is certainly the view of Prison Service management that this has proven to be the case in the intervening period.</p> <p>  Of course the annualised hours system is not perfect.  No system could be perfect in the particular circumstances of closed and open prisons.  Twelve years on, if I were faced with a choice between a demonstrably unpredictable and inefficient overtime system and a system of annualised hours that delivers efficiencies, predictability and significant savings, I would recommend to the Minister and the Government that a similar decision to that taken in 2005 be taken again now.</p> <p>  As I have said, Mr. Donnellan will highlight a few of the headline significant changes that have been made in the prison system.  In that respect, a crucial change which has occurred over the past decade has been the elimination of unplanned temporary release, or the "revolving door" as it was known.  That practice, which was a major feature of the overcrowded system over many years, had an enormously corrosive impact on the entire criminal justice system.</p> <p>  I will conclude by mentioning three items of significant infrastructural development that are in planning.  The E block in Portlaoise Prison is in urgent need of replacement due to its dilapidated state.  It is expected that construction works on the refurbishment of the two remaining wings in Limerick Prison, along with a stand-alone female facility, will begin towards the end of this year, depending on a tendering competition.  Most significantly, a new blueprint for the staged development of the Mountjoy complex, which is designed to extend its viability as a prison complex for decades to come, is in contemplation and, subject to Government approval, is likely be part of a public consultative process later this year.  I would like to hand over to Mr. Donnellan now to say a few opening words.</p></speech>

As the Secretary General has mentioned, the committee will be aware of significant changes and reforms that have occurred in the Prison Service in recent years.  The prison system has experienced severe strain and has had to deal with the continuing challenge of overcrowding.  Thankfully, overcrowding has been eliminated due to a number of factors, including enhanced pre-release planning, structured temporary release, community return and community release.  The number of people in custody has fallen by 20% from its peak in 2011.  More important, the number of people on temporary release has decreased by 70% from its peak.  There is no doubt that this is making society much safer.  The implementation of the fines legislation is starting to have an effect on committals.  We have not yet seen the full benefit of that.  Last year, we saw a decrease of 15% in the number of people being committed to prison for non-payment of fines.  This is very welcome.</p> <p>  We are continuing to develop a comprehensive capital programme.  Having developed new modernised accommodation in Castlerea Prison, Portlaoise Prison, Wheatfield Prison and the Midlands Prison, our priority now is to develop existing accommodation with a special focus on rehabilitation and the elimination of slopping out.  Five years ago, there were 1,000 people, or 25% of the prison population, slopping out.  Fewer than 50 prisoners, or 1% of the prison population, are slopping out today.  We hope to eliminate that with the development of facilities in Limerick and Portlaoise in the coming years.  The opening of the new Cork Prison in 2016 was a major initiative as the previous prison in Cork was the worst prison in our prison estate.  The introduction of an incentivised prisoner regime system has helped with behaviour and has helped to drive down violence in the prison system.</p><p>The committee will be aware that for various reasons, some prisoners have to be accommodated separately from other prisoners.  We call this a restricted regime and we have been working very hard in the past number of years to reduce the number of people who are on 22-hour or 23-hour lock-up, as it is called, or solitary confinement down to a manageable number.  Significant progress has been made on that.</p><p> We have also been working with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in ensuring we can measure recidivism and measure the effectiveness of prison.  Our first reports were published in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and during that period we have seen a drop in recidivism, that is, of people re-offending within a three year period, from 55% to 45%.  I hope in the next five to ten years I will see that percentage dropping down to 35%, which is the norm of the Nordic countries.  I am confident that the successful implementation of our strategy has really helped the prison system.</p><p> I look forward to developing our new strategy, which we are now implementing, which is built around supporting prisoners, supporting our staff, supporting victims and developing organisational capacity.  This has to be against the backdrop of additional hours, AH, which has allowed stability and predictability in the system and the diversion of much-needed funds to a more rehabilitative focus.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members.    </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Waters" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#G00400"><p>I will give an overview and then I will call on my colleagues from the Prison Service.</p> <p>  The level of overtime running during that period in the 2000s was escalating at a rapid rate.  The bill for overtime had risen from &euro;54 million, up to &euro;55 million, culminating at &euro;59 million in the space of a couple of years, which gave rise to very serious difficulties in the entire justice sector in meeting a bill of that level every year.  The money allocated for other services and in other subheads had to be diverted to pay the overtime bill.  During that period, as I said in my opening remarks, the overtime for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was about &euro;65 million.  There were about 3,000 officers in the Prison Service, whereas the number of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was much larger.  Clearly the issue of overtime had to be resolved as it was not sustainable.</p> <p>  A review of the figures from 1997 up to the early 2000s was conducted to see if there could be a better way of organising the service.  They looked at four different options, namely, hiring more staff, time off in lieu, trying to curtail the overtime system and the annualised hours system.  They came down in favour of the annualised hours, and this was approved by a Minister and everybody else in the system.  They went into each prison and looked at the number of hours required to run the prison, came up with a global figure - and my colleagues can elaborate on that - of rostered hours and overtime hours that it would take to run the Prison Service right across all the individual institutions.  I believe 16 institutions may have been in operation at that time.  That global figure ultimately fed its way into the &euro;31 million saving which was identified at that time and was based on an expenditure of &euro;59 million in overtime.  In subsequent years that overtime bill fell back to &euro;46 million.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Donnellan to give Deputy MacSharry a flavour of how the numbers that arose came about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Donnellan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#G00500"><p>As the Secretary General has said, there was an envisaged saving of &euro;31 million and that was against an overtime budget at its height of &euro;59 million.  However, when the deal came up for signature in 2005, the overtime figures for the year 2003-04 had dropped from &euro;59 million to &euro;46 million.  This reduction was because the then Government closed two prisons, the Curragh and Spike Island in Cork, which freed up 150 officers to be redeployed back into the system, which offset that overtime difference.  The real figure for benchmarking in our view should have been &euro;46 million, which would have given a gross saving of &euro;19 million per year.  The deal was put to a vote of the prison officers and then went to the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  The Civil Service Arbitration Board awarded the prison officers an 8% operational allowance and a lump sum of just under &euro;14,000 per officer.  That further eroded those saving.  The next savings, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said are just over &euro;5 million a year in real savings or just over &euro;8 million, if one takes in the pension costs.  That explains the background to that ambitious figure in 2002-03 of saving &euro;31 million a year.</p></speech>

If one compares on a direct basis with what was paid out in overtime, one is looking at savings of the order of &euro;8.5 million.  The actual payment every year on annualised hours in more recent years has been of the order of &euro;32 million.</p><p>The equivalent overtime payment in a direct comparison basis in the most recent year it was used was &euro;46 million, but other elements to this have happened in the meantime.</p></speech>

I guess that the entire prison service opted for 360.  Did they?</p></speech>

There were further developments on this in respect of the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements, which brought this back down to 70%.  There were new arrangements about the various ratios between the different bands which were put in place.  Does the Director General want to speak on that?</p></speech>

There was band 0, then 112 hours, 240 hours and 360 hours.  At the time, there was a requirement for as many people to work as many hours as possible and about 85% of people worked 360 hours, the top band.  However, following the Haddington Road agreement, there was a requirement for us to address cost control issues and cost reduction issues.  We were required to meet a level of 70% of staff on 360 hours, 10% on 112, 10% on 240 and 10% on 0.  We are nearly at those.  That has provided a saving to our pay bill of about &euro;3.5 million.  That was a further refinement through a whole range of agreements that were made.  For instance, the Croke Park agreement required further staff savings and there was a headcount reduction of about 230 staff.  Since then there have been reductions and savings on our prison Vote.</p></speech>

There was compulsory overtime before this was introduced.  The system had to work.  Middle management in prisons had the authority to call people in on overtime because they simply had no choice.  Escorts had to be provided for people to go to court.  People had to make hospital visits.  People at this stage were in an ever-increasing culture of overtime within most prisons, particularly the big ones.  Many people just wanted out of that in its entirety as well.</p></speech>

For clarity for people watching and for the record, under the annualised hours system, if one signs up for 360 hours, one gets paid for 360 hours.  If one happens to be in Arbour Hill Prison, for argument's sake, and 360 hours were not available but 220 were available, one would work for the 220 but be paid for 360.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The average is 15% around the country, but are there prisons where it is substantially higher than that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Waters" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#H00900"><p>The average has fallen back since 2015.  It is now in the order of about 9% across the country which, when broken down and the number of staff in all institutions taken into account, is on average about 24 hours on a yearly basis.  It varies very significantly from institution to institution.  The big closed institutions tend to have few or no write-off hours because there is a huge amount of work going on there with prisoners moving in and out, hospital visits, court visits, and so on.  A big write-off arises in respect of the open centres, Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  Does Mr. Donnellan want to speak on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Donnellan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#H01000"><p>To put it in perspective, the write-off is now down to 8%.  Take a comparison between Shelton Abbey and Cloverhill Prison, which the Comptroller and Auditor General looked at.  Cloverhill Prison is a full operating remand prison and is very busy with people going in and out all the time, all around the country.  The write-off there is negligible.  However, in Shelton Abbey we must remember that the total staff comprises only 50 officers, of whom 40 are on additional hours.  There are only 29 on the 360 band.  A very small number of staff proportionally are getting the benefit of the write-off in comparison to the vast numbers which are in our closed prisons.  One of the principles of the system was that there would be a write-off.  The write-off was always seen as part of smarter working and more efficient working where annualised hours in the private sector and the semi-State sector are concerned.  The write-off was always a feature of additional hours.</p></speech>

What has been done to try to address that?  Have there been negotiations with the unions?  Has it been a topic for discussion?</p></speech>

As can be seen following the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General, we have undertaken a review of the annualised hours, in particular on the methodology and allocation of additional hours and also alternative methodologies for the current annualised hours, AH, system.  It is important to say that this is an agreed system.  It has been agreed by all sides, so if we change it we have to change it by agreement with everybody.  The Deputy is right that it could be utilised more efficiently and at the current time, the AH is attracted to the officer rather than the need.</p></speech>

I would not attempt to underplay the difficulties that there will in terms of changing that.  The prison officers are very well represented by their union representatives.  Getting to where we are now took a very long time.  They operate on the basis, as one would expect of any union, of "what we have we hold".  We will have to negotiate that with them.  That is going to be an issue for us, but we are up for that.  If we can have independent evidence that can show that the system can work even better, and we await what the outcome of the review will be, I think we can take that forward.  It will be a tough fight.</p></speech>

We are also the founding member of the European Organisation of Prison and Correctional Services, EuroPris.  All prisons in Europe join it.  Some 30 prison systems are now part of EuroPris.  We can benchmark ourselves against those prisons, ask those prisons a question and get 29 answers back on a topic.  We have a lot of contact there.  More important, we are part of what is called a benchmarking group, which is made up of Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.  Our statisticians meet every year, and we benchmark ourselves against each other and against the same criteria.  For instance, the Council of Europe figures benchmark people for a whole range of staff who are not in the prison.  In Norway and Sweden, they have what is called the import model.  Many of their services are imported from the community, including health services, education services and work training services.  In our system, we hire our own work training officers and our own health services at the moment.  The only thing we import is education.  When we are benchmarked like for like, of who is inside the prison wall, this is what we get.</p><p>We see that Denmark has 1.1 prisoners to every member staff, Finland has 1.3, we have 1.2, the Netherlands has 0.9, and Norway and Sweden each have one for one.  Taken in that context, we are not too far out from the norm.  We were much better five years ago when we had massive overcrowding, but that was not effective, efficient or beneficial.  Communities were not safer when we had 30% more prisoners being managed by approximately the same number of prison officers.  The prison officer is the key change agent within a prison.  It is not the psychologist or psychiatrist; it is the class officer who intervenes with prisoners every day on the landing.  That is what can bring about massive change.  We are in the zone when compared with the other members of our benchmarking group.  If we want quality prisons, we have to pay for quality staff in appropriate numbers.  That is not to say we cannot be more efficient.</p></speech>

One can build very large prisons with perhaps 2,000 prisoners, as we have seen with the privatised facilities in our neighbouring jurisdiction, with very few staff and mostly automated systems.  However, that is not the Irish way.  We operate on the basis of having prisons located in and served by the local community.  Families of prisoners have committed no crime and need to be able to visit their loved ones.  Culturally, our position is much more in keeping with the Nordic model of smaller numbers, which does bring a cost with it.  That is broadly our policy.</p></speech>

For example, we have a prison in Cork that takes 275, one in Limerick that takes 200 and another in Castlerea in Roscommon that takes 350.  As the Secretary General indicated, in other states like Britain, those facilities would be amalgamated with much greater efficiencies.  However, we consider it important to have a regional structure.  We have made efficiencies and must continue to do so, particularly around technology.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that while there was a reduction post-2005, there had been a very steep rise between 2001 and 2005.  Why did sick leave increase in 2015?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-02a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Donnellan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017020200002#J00600"><p>Sick leave levels in 2013 and 2014 reduced on the back of central measures that were introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which implemented a reduction in sick leave entitlement for civil servants from six months to three months and so on.  That change led to a reduction in sick leave for 2013 and 2014.  In 2015, we saw a return to the sick leave level we currently have.  Benchmarking us against the group of other European countries in terms of total sick leave lost within the system, Ireland stands at 5.2% of all losses, Sweden is at 6.1%, the Netherlands has a figure of 6.5%, Norway is at 7.9%, and Finland's figure is 5.5%.  In other words, we are not doing too badly.  On average, there are 15 days of sick leave per officer per year.  If one strips out injury on duty and maternity-related sick leave, that comes down to 11 days per officer per year, which is not bad given the type of work prison officers have to do.  There is no comparison between their work and the work being done by a civil servant in an office.  We have a range of measures to tackle sick leave.  The levels are unacceptable and we are always trying to drive them down.  When the AH system was introduced, we saw a significant reduction in sick leave, and the 2015 figures should be viewed in that context.</p></speech>

There are three types of such claims.  The first is where a prisoner challenges the validity of the order holding him or her in prison.  Second, prisoners can take a challenge against us for a decision we make about them on behalf of the Minister.  In the case of a decision on entitlement to one third remission, for example, a prisoner can take a challenge to the High Court, as some have done, which is very expensive.  The third claim prisoners can take is where they consider their regime to be incompatible with their human rights.  For instance, gangland prisoners who are kept separate from other people and prisoners who are allowed only screen visits might  challenge that in the High Court.  In such cases, we would have to appoint matching counsel and defend the case.  Those are the costs associated with non-compensation.  Much of the total is made up by legal costs, but a small part is for compensation awards to prisoners.  These are sometimes given for very pragmatic reasons where, say, we get advice that it is not worth defending a challenge at a cost of &euro;100,000 and it would be better to pay &euro;10,000.</p></speech>

These cases can relate to paternity leave, maternity leave or sick leave.  We run the payroll on Tuesday to be paid for the following Thursday week.  That will be corrected within the following pay cycle.  Approximately 18% of our overpayments are natural overpayments that are corrected in the next cycle.</p> <p>  The next group arise from our errors in respect of the effective communication between the prisons, our payroll section and the Paymaster General in respect of paying salaries.</p> <p>  The main point on overpayments is that we recoup all overpayments.</p></speech>

Our view is that we were not picking up the faults.  We have a robust system now.  We have dedicated staff watching overpayment.  Reconciliation takes place twice per year.  We get back 98% of overpayments.  Short of someone leaving the country or not being on a pension, we take it back.</p></speech>

It was difficult to find a measure throughout the system because each Department was running its own payroll.  Now, it has been centralised.  One of the key issues is to get the figure as close to zero as possible.  That will be difficult given the structural nature of our payroll systems.  Payroll systems are run, in some cases, two weeks in advance of the payment.  It is difficult to change that.  It requires major structural and information technology change.  All Accounting Officers are concerned about the level of payroll overpayments.</p></speech>

Under proprietary goods, there were 14 cases valued at &euro;2.4 million.  Proprietary goods in the prison system include our locking system and our time and attendance system.  These are bespoke systems and have historical context.  We have to replace all our locking with the same company.  They are the proprietary cases.</p> <p>  We had seven cases at a value of &euro;3.4 million.</p></speech>

We are also developing a bespoke time and attendance system.  This will get rid of the time and attendance legacy issue.</p> <p>  Under the Office of Government Procurement we had seven cases in 2015 at a value of &euro;3.4 million.  I am happy to report that in six of those cases, contracts are now in place and one is in the making.</p> <p>  The third issue relates to roll-over contracts and there were six cases under this heading.  Now, we have contracts in place for the majority.  In these cases the facilities in our procurement system were not available to go out to tender.  The contract was rolled-over to pull off the contract for a further few months.</p></speech>

We have no reason to get into dispute with the Comptroller and Auditor General on that point.  However, we need to put some context on the discussion.  When this was happening, it was a programme of fundamental or transformational change in the prison system.  At the same time, numbers were spiralling upwards and they had to be managed.  Allied to that, the Prison Service headquarters was moving from Dublin to Longford.  This meant there was practically a 100% changeover of staff.  Almost 100% of the staff who ended up in Longford had not been in the headquarters in Dublin, although I stand to be corrected on that.  All of that had to be managed as well.  At the same time, the prison system had to function.</p><p>We take the point entirely.  We do need to go right into the guts of this again now in the context of-----</p></speech>

There are various aspects, as restorative justice is quite a wide family.

We are constantly saying that in order to stop people falling out of society and into prison we need early intervention and at the earliest possible time.  People end up in the justice system but the justice system has to pick up all of the pieces.  It is the education system, the housing system and the social welfare system.  As highlighted by the penal policy review group, we need a joined-up-Government approach to drive down imprisonment rates.  We have started to do that in Ireland for the first time.  A whole-of-Government approach to penal policy is very innovative.</p></speech>

I would also like to deal with the issue of sick leave, which is important.  What impact does the physical environment of the job of prison officers, the conditions under which they work and stress have on sick leave?  Could the witnesses please elaborate on that?</p></speech>

To answer the Deputy's first question about prison officer sick leave, there is no doubt but that the huge pressure on prison officers during those early years - 2003 to 2005, inclusive - to do compelled overtime correlated hugely with the number of days of sick leave taken simply because of the pressure on people.  They just could not keep going.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's second question, prison is a stressful environment.  Suicides, self-harm, violence and all sorts of other pains go on within prisons each and every day, so the stress factor in prison is well known.</p></speech>

I refer Mr. Donnellan to chapter 2.33 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in which sick leave in individual prisons is detailed.

We are rolling out a critical incident stress management policy which is in place in the Defence Forces and the fire brigade to help them deal with specific critical incidents, such as being injured, finding somebody self-harming or finding somebody who has committed suicide.  We have introduced a free counselling service for our staff so they can now self-refer to that service and receive assistance in dealing with the stresses within the working environment.  We are also rolling out some training with our psychology service on building resilience within our staff.  This is certainly something we acknowledge and something we are specifically, under our new strategy, attempting to support our staff on.</p></speech>

Picking up from what Deputy Cullinane was saying, I was struck by what Mr. Donnellan said about prisons being the new lunatic asylums.  It is difficult to hear that in terms of the morale of the prison staff.  No more than a parent looking after a child - he or she must be in a good place in order to rear the child - prison staff are the keepers of the prisoners.  It is extremely important - and I am glad to hear from Ms McCaffrey - that counselling services are available and that the Irish Prison Service has a plan in this regard.  I have no doubt that the increase in the amount of sick leave taken in 2015 is directly as a result of the working environment of prison staff.  It is a really onerous job.  I do not practise criminal law but I have been in a few prisons to represent family law clients and have spoken to the staff there and know the pressures they are under.  It is absolutely vital that the Department provide resources for prison staff in order to keep them going because we are all human beings.  I know, even from dealing with the area of law with which I dealt - criminal law is a whole other ballgame - that the working environment in the latter is extremely stressful.  This must be the paramount consideration.  Are the services Ms McCaffrey outlined available now or is it a plan-----</p></speech>

They were introduced last year.  We have an employee assistance service and local officers in each of the prisons who work with our national service to provide dedicated support to the staff.  I would like to acknowledge the work they do on the ground.  These efforts are to supplement the efforts being made within the prisons already.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Donnellan or Mr. Waters mentioned recidivism - I can never pronounce that word - and the fact that it has seen a reduction to 45% and that the norm in the Nordic countries is 35%.  These matters are all interlinked.  If we are to go in the right direction, that is the way to do it.  I am talking about the rehabilitation not just of prisoners, but also of the staff.</p> <p>  The story of the cash going missing in Limerick - the &euro;10,000 - was like reading something out of a Flann O'Brien novel.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not reference what year this occurred.  I know there were cash shortfalls back in 2009 and 2010, but the &euro;10,000 in Limerick was a significant amount.  I know from the Criminal Courts of Justice, CCJ, that if there is a bail officer, money is paid over and a receipt is given through a glass screen.  Does Mr. Donnellan know if a receipt was given in this instance?  Was an investigation carried out?  It is a significant amount of money.  Was it given in cash as opposed to a cheque?</p></speech>

It was brought to our attention by the governor of Limerick Prison, who, doing the checks and balances, realised a sum of &euro;10,000 was missing.  An audit took place, a forensic audit was undertaken as well and the governor concluded that &euro;10,000 cash was missing.  It was impossible to say with certainty how the money disappeared or was misappropriated, but the governor felt it was bail money.  It is not unusual for the Prison Service to receive bail money and it is not unusual for it to receive &euro;10,000 in cash for bail money.  We would much prefer not to receive bail money this way.

In 2016, approximately 8,300 people were committed to prison for non-payment of fines.  The year before that the number was almost 10,000.  Most of those are brought to the prison, turned around and let go.  Mr. Donnellan can talk about that process.  That is a huge administrative burden, apart from the message it sends to the system.  Legislation was passed in 2015 which was operational in January 2016.  We already see a small impact as the number has fallen from almost 10,000 to 8,300.  The life cycle of a fine ordinarily is between one and three years.  We expect the number to decrease further in the next two to three years.  Under the old system people were fined &euro;300 for not having a television licence or not taxing their cars and were given three months in prison in default.  That has gone.  The first option now is to pay instalments.  Last year approximately 2,000 people opted to do that.</p></speech>

We exclude our fines cases, otherwise they would skew our figures completely.  In a typical year, last year we would have nearly 18,000 committals, almost half of them are fines cases.  The anticipated benefit when those cases come out of the system in the future will be the whole washing through of people who come into prison, who are brought from outlying places in Ireland to a prison to be processed in to and be taken out.  Some of the fines would be very small, television licences, other small fines.</p></speech>

By and large the people who default on fines never get into the prison system.  However in cases of people with revenue related fines or fines for selling cigarettes, which is a big business, they would be kept in prison.  As the Secretary General said, this will reduce dramatically because there are about five stages to go through to get into prison under the new system.  The major option is community service, so people can do community service in lieu of their fine.</p></speech>

I was provided with the figures and it separated out the number on maternity leave, which obviously has to be factored in if one is going to change the gender balance in any workplace.  One can factor in a ratio for maternity leave.  I wish to raise the number on long-term sick leave in a particular institution, Cloverhill Prison.  I know the numbers can be quite small, however the numbers on long-term sick leave are fairly constant in one prison, whereas one would expect that number to rise and fall.</p> <p>  Is there a procedure to pick out figures in certain categories to find out what is happening.  For example is the prison more dangerous, is there a management tool to target it or how does one deal with it?</p></speech>

We work on a constant ongoing basis with the management teams in our prisons.  We have a monthly meeting with the HR governors and, twice a year, our attendance management team will go into the prison.  We are looking at the profile of people who are absent on sick leave.  Obviously in respect of some of those long-term sick leave cases, there are people who have very genuine serious illnesses and are absent from work.  We are hoping we can support them.  In terms of absenteeism, and the people who are in and out of sick leave, we manage the cases at prison level in consultation with the local team to ensure that we are on top of the issue.</p></speech>

Are there any particular initiatives on the wish list that could achieve significant reductions in the prison population?</p></speech>

We know that the first 24 hours of a former prisoner's life in the community after leaving prison is the most dangerous.  It is the point when he or she falls back into reoffending.  We must ensure that we put resources into not just finishing with people at the gate but supporting their journey through the gate and into the community.  We would have a sizeable number of people in prison today who could be out of prison but we do not release them from prison because we would simply be releasing them to homelessness.  We have teams of people that we fund who are helping to manage the transition.  The top priority on our wish list is that people who come out of prison would have proper accommodation, would get their social welfare payment and their medical card quickly, so that they would be hooked back into society.  Therefore they can be sustained through support.  Female offenders have completely different needs from male offenders, and it is very much the case that we in the Prison Service with our probation colleagues need to provide step-down facilities for people coming out of prison rather than simply hoping that everything will work out when they leave prison.  This is where we are putting the major emphasis from now on.  That will reduce recidivism and will stop people spiralling back into prison.</p></speech>

The elimination of overcrowding and the annualised hours have greatly helped the Prison Service to have the resources available to do that type of work.  Ten or 15 years ago that would have been unthinkable because the entire focus of the prison system was on managing as best it could the secure containment of large numbers of people in prison and with very little regard to dealing with other issues.  The staff did what they had to do and primarily it was to ensure that people were kept in safe custody.  There were a great many incapacities around the system but these are being addressed.</p> <p>  The idea that somebody would be released from prison into homelessness is automatically saying to him or her to go off and commit more crime.  We simply have to break the cycle.  We are involving other Departments across Government to see what we can do better around that type of system.</p></speech>

Many delegations from European countries have come to visit us.  Where a prisoner has finished half his or her six year sentence, during which time he or she has been involved in education, work training, and he or she is drug free is really helping to reduce his or her recidivism.  They can then be risk assessed by the probation service to serve the remaining period of their prison sentence in the community.  We call it "community return".  That has been really successful.  More than 1,600 people have been released through community return with a compliance rate of about 89%.  This initiative is settling people from prison back into the community.  That is the major emphasis.  There is no doubt that the European countries that we look towards are the Nordic countries, Norway and Sweden.  We look particularly to Finland, a country very similar to ours, where they have made dramatic changes in their prison system in the past 15 years.  They have much more low security and open type prisons.  That is something we need to look at.  Do we need everybody in medium to high security prisons?  There are lots of lesson we can learn from our colleagues in Europe.  Equally they learn from us because we are all learning together.</p></speech>

The motivation for building in Thornton Hall was that at that time Mountjoy Prison, which was the State's premier prison, was simply not fit for purpose.</p><p>It was subject to the most searing criticism by international groups and the European committee for the prevention of torture.  Slopping out was endemic in the prison and it was vastly overcrowded.  It was an appalling situation.</p><p> The decision was taken by the prison's interim board and supported by the then Government that a new prison would be built at Thornton.  It would incorporate the entire Mountjoy complex, be on a greenfield site and Mountjoy would be sold off ultimately to pay for the development.  The prison would also include facilities for the Central Mental Hospital and, at one stage, the then Forensic Science Laboratory.  To pay for the site, the open prison at Shanganagh, surplus to requirements of the Prison Service, was sold.  The cost of the site was &euro;29 million and the sale of Shanganagh also made &euro;29 million.</p><p> It is a long story; I am giving the potted version of it.  Ultimately, due to the economic crash, the prison at Thornton did not proceed.  It had become completely unaffordable from what it was set out as.  In the meantime, we had to do something in respect of Mountjoy.  Significant capital works were carried out there at greatly reduced costs which have turned it into a fit-for-purpose prison, unlike what it was 12 years ago.</p></speech>

Obviously, the hospital is directly across the road from the prison, so it is our preferred option.  However, this is not a policy area that we can influence.  We can only give the facts in terms of how many prisoners go over to the hospital on a daily basis, how many ambulances are called to the Midlands Prison on a weekly basis, how many emergencies or cardiac cases we have and so forth.

They are both in Romania and there are warrants out for their arrest.  We know where they are and they will eventually come back to serve the rest of their sentences.  They have written to us to plead their case but the reality is that if someone absconds from an Irish prison, he or she must come back.  They will be caught at the borders.  They cannot go to England or anywhere else because their names and pictures will flash up.</p></speech>

We were supplied with a briefing note on the outturn for salaries, wages and allowances in 2014, which was &euro;236 million, including a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;5 million.  The outturn in 2015 was &euro;235 million.  I see that the estimated outturn for 2016 is &euro;230 million.  It is good to see a reduction of &euro;5 million and I ask the witnesses to explain that.

We were paying fewer staff in 2016 than in 2015.  The staffing figure at the end of 2016 was 3,215, compared with 3,308 at the end of 2015.

That point has not been made yet.  There is a recruitment campaign under way at the moment through which we expect to hire 80 new prison staff, which will be the first recruitment into the prison system since 2008.  That will obviously bring a welcome injection of new blood into the system.  It is my understanding that there was a very significant level of interest, with almost 7,000 people applying.  That will be whittled down to an initial 80, which will bring our staff numbers back up.  As I said, numbers have fallen fairly dramatically since the high point back in 2007.</p></speech>

Finally, Mr. Donnellan mentioned step-down facilities and probation.  I ask him to elaborate on that further.

We all know about people in homeless hostels and it is sad to think that some people are still in prison because they are homeless.  Are there many in that category?</p></speech>

We can talk about recidivism, community service and so forth but there is not much point in releasing people if they end up back to square one.</p></speech>

If people out in the streets are being accommodated properly, which is beginning to happen, that will have a positive impact in that they will not be committing petty crimes and be remanded or committed to prison for short periods.  That is the positive side of the issue.  Anything that can happen positively in the community will have an impact in the prisons.  Notwithstanding that, we always have a range of people in prison who have come from homelessness and who have no place to go.  A lot of the people who have come into prison and have come off drugs really do not want to go back out to what they would call an "ordinary" hostel.  They want to go back out to a place that is drug-free and where they are given support.  That is where we are putting our new emphasis and focus.  We are trying to ensure that we do not release people into homelessness any more.  At any given time in the D&oacute;chas Centre, the women's prison, there would be three or four women who could be in the community but for the fact that they do not have accommodation.  They do not have a safe place to go and all the evidence is that they would be back in prison within 24 hours.  In that context, we would prefer to keep them safe and plan their release rather than simply releasing them.</p></speech>

Mr. Donnellan spoke about the Probation Service.  How advanced is that?  I ask the witnesses to provide a detailed note on it.  Mr. Donnellan also mentioned step-down facilities.  Such facilities are essential.  Some communities might not want to hear this, but step-down services are fundamental-----</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has been very exercised about this and we, in conjunction with the Probation Service, have invited expressions of interest to provide such facilities on a not-for-profit basis.  We are looking for non-profit, voluntary organisations to provide high-quality, supervised accommodation for women.  We are very hopeful that we can create ten spaces this year in the community for women in Dublin.</p></speech>

That will go to contract later this year and the building will start early next year.  Again, it will be a regional response for women.

Measures are in place to address the issues people have.  They include the community return programme, community service system and the programmes of the Probation Service.  It is not a case whereby the door is open, out they go and we say we do not want to see them again.</p></speech>

I will address the point about housing.  The issue has been examined in the context of the housing situation, in particular, whether there would be a value or a use for the site in that context.  That is a matter for other people.  One concern we have, taking a whole-of-Government approach, is that it is a large site.  We have learned lessons in Ireland about planning major housing developments in one particular area.</p></speech>

A site of 160 acres is sitting empty.  It is no justification to say that major housing projects have not worked out.  That is not an answer to a question about a site of 160 acres bought at &euro;29 million.  I have a reaction when I hear that.  Major housing developments often got into trouble because of complete lack of input from local authorities, including those in Limerick, Dublin and Galway.</p></speech>

There are three avenues into it, the two main ones being the Prison Service and the Courts Service.  Prisoners who suffer with mental health issues would be referred by the prisons, admitted, treated and then returned to prison, while people who were found not guilty by reason of insanity or unfit to plead would be referred by the courts straight to the Central Mental Hospital.  There would be also be a small number of cases of people with a very severe mental illness being transferred from a normal or non-forensic facility into the Central Mental Hospital.</p></speech>
