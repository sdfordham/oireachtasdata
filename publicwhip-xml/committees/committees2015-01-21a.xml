I welcome everyone present to the fourth public hearing of the joint committee.  There will be two distinct parts to today's proceedings.  Later, we will hear from Professor Philip Lane of Trinity College, Dublin, on the banking crisis and economic and monetary union but first we will hear from Mr. Klaus Regling on A Preliminary Report on the Sources of Ireland's Banking Crisis.</p><p>Mr. Regling is the first managing director of the European Stability Mechanism.  He is also chief executive officer, CEO, of the European Financial Stability Facility, a position he has held since the creation of the latter in June 2010.  Mr. Regling has worked for 38 years as an economist in senior positions in the public and private sectors in Europe, Asia and the US, including a decade with the IMF in Washington and Jakarta and a further decade with the German Ministry of Finance, where he prepared economic and monetary union in Europe.  From 2001 to 2008 he was director general for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission.  During the period 2008 to 2009, he spent a year at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore where he researched financial and monetary integration in Asia.  In February 2010, the then Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, requested Mr. Regling to conduct a preliminary investigation into the crisis in the banking system in Ireland.  The report relating to that investigation was published on 31 May 2010.  Said report was co-authored by Mr. Max Watson, who sadly passed away in December.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.  I remind members that while Mr. Regling is managing director of the European Stability Mechanism and CEO of the European Financial Stability Facility, he has come before us only to discuss his report.</p><p>I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of his evidence to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, he will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and - as he has been informed previously - witnesses are asked to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Regling and invite him to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

On the previous occasion on which I was here, namely, May 2010, Max Watson and I presented our report.  Unfortunately, as the Chairman mentioned, Mr. Watson passed away last month.  Had he not died, Mr. Watson would be here with me and I would be very pleased about that.  I thank the Chairman for confirming that the testimony I will give this morning relates to the report and is not linked to my current role as head of the EFSF and the ESM.</p> <p>  The report was prepared as a diagnostic, not a forensic, study and it did not look at the role of individuals.  It was written from a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; perspective to complement the report of Governor Patrick Honohan, who gave evidence to this committee last week.  The report - A Preliminary Report on the Sources of Ireland&rsquo;s Banking Crisis - Max Watson and I compiled analysed the factors which led to the crisis, sought to draw policy lessons and identify follow-up areas for investigation looking at the period up to the end of September 2008.  Reflecting the mandate given to us by the Minister for Finance at the time, the late Brian Lenihan, this deliberately excluded all policy decisions taken after the end of September 2008, including the granting of the bank guarantee at that time.</p> <p>  In our report, we found numerous factors - global, domestic, macroeconomic and structural - that contributed to the crisis.  Taken together, these factors acted in a mutually reinforcing way and followed a decade of strong and extended economic expansion when Ireland&rsquo;s living standards first caught up with and then surpassed the average EU standard of living.</p><p> As we all know, Ireland was one of the countries most badly affected by the financial crisis through a combination of homemade problems and global factors.  A succession of bubbles in equities, bonds, housing, commodity and credit markets were the key factors behind the global financial crisis that unfolded from 2007, originating in the United States.</p><p> The roots of the problem in Ireland began earlier.  Following the creation of the single currency, Ireland's domestic financial services enjoyed a strong and extended boom.  This was facilitated by an influx of foreign savings as access to cross-border funding for Irish banks increased strongly.  It came at a time of very high global liquidity and a low risk premia.  This fuelled the existing strong Irish preference for property investment and developed into a blindspot, which was ominous in a country that had never experienced a property crash.  It was very striking to us, when we  researched our report, how many people we met who told us their own personal anecdotes about property investment.  Unfortunately, it is hard not to overstate the impact of this cultural attitude.  Property acquisition, as a topic, was almost a national obsession though not something we could easily quantify in hard data.  This cultural issue is by no means the sole cause.  On the economic front, relative to the domestic growth and inflation rates, monetary conditions were very easy and, in retrospect, we can see that this reinforced economic vulnerabilities.  Statistical tools also failed to capture underlying fiscal deficits.  The IMF later calculated that in 2007, although the headline budget was balanced, the underlying or structural deficit was 8.75%.</p><p> Euro area financial integration was also under way during this period when, following the creation of the euro, interest rates were permanently lowered for the Irish economy.  Irish banks enjoyed unprecedented access to cross-border funds, while foreign banks entered the domestic market which intensified competition.  At the time, cross-border regulatory and supervisory structures had not kept up with this process.  Since then many of these points have been addressed through the banking union.</p><p> Back in 2007, when the crisis first really struck, the single currency initially protected Ireland and other euro area member states from the currency turmoil that they would have otherwise faced.  Unfortunately, it was not enough as pressures built over the following year.</p><p> Our report also found a clear lack of budgetary discipline, with pro-cyclical policies and a gradual shift in the tax base that left it fragile and increasingly dependent on the property sector.  It shifted from stable to cyclical sources like capital gains tax, corporation tax, stamp duty on property and consumer taxes.  It was also unusual that Ireland did not have a property tax and yet mortgage tax deductions were offered which created subsidies that distorted commercial real estate development.</p><p> We also noted that there was insufficient surveillance from external bodies such as the EU institutions or the IMF.  The IMF was not strong or consistent in its criticism of the underlying dynamics of fiscal policy.  European Council opinions were favourable even if the Commission, as early as 2001, was concerned at pro-cyclical policies.  However, Stability and Growth Pact commitments were not seen in doubt, during the period up to 2008, partly due to an insufficient methodology for calculating structural fiscal balances, as I have already mentioned.  </p><p> Across the banking sector there was weak governance and risk management - sometimes disastrously weak.  Within the banks, internal procedures were often over-ridden, sometimes systematically, and many banks were highly exposed to specific individual borrowers and property lending, especially commercial property.  Incentives were also badly structured, not just bonuses for top banking executives but also for middle-management and loan officers.</p><p> Throughout this period, in the run-up to 2008, counter-cyclical fiscal or macro-prudential policies could have moderated the boom and cushioned the recession.  With a different official policy mix, perhaps a soft landing would have been possible, but instead official policies and banking practices merely added fuel to the fire.  For example, the Government could have mitigated the bubble by initiating fiscal policies that could have dampened, not stimulated, the economy.  Supervisors could have imposed tighter loan-to-value ratios.  Supervisors were neither hands-on nor pre-emptive.  They were also not used to technically complex problems.  There was also an absence of forceful warnings from the Central Bank on macro financial risks.</p><p> In summary, weak financial supervision and bank governance combined with official policies to leave the economy vulnerable to a deep crisis.  In our view, the true burden of responsibility was quite broad.  We concluded with a number of follow-up areas for consideration which are as follows.  Why was there not a stronger reaction within the banks to this concentrated loan overexposure?  How were such governance failures initiated?  Why was the response of supervisors not more forceful?  Were there failures by auditors?</p><p> Investigating the very serious breaches of corporate governance that were identified was also needed.  Finally, our report stated that it was important to identify lessons for future policy, not only in Ireland but in particular in future cases of countries that may join the EU area.</p><p> The report concludes that these interlinked factors culminated to create what in many ways was a plain vanilla property bubble that ultimately burst with very painful social consequences.  Taken together, we found many interconnected factors that contributed to the crisis, including insufficient critical external surveillance institutions.   Ireland was a country where it seems no one was really in charge to prevent such a bubble from emerging over the previous four to fiver years that led to 2008.</p></speech>

I shall list the questioners in order.  Senator Susan O'Keeffe, as lead spokesperson, will have 15 minutes and she will be followed by Senator Marc MacSharry who will also have 15 minutes.  They will be followed by rounds lasting six minutes each for the following: Deputy Kieran O'Donnell; Senator Michael D'Arcy; Deputy Pearse Doherty; Deputy Michael McGrath; Deputy John Paul Phelan; Deputy Eoghan Murphy; Senator Sean Barrett; and lastly Deputy Joe Higgins.</p><p>I shall get matters under way.  Mr. Regling, on page 44 of his report, said:<blockquote>There was a socio-political context in which it would have taken some courage to seem to prick the Irish property bubble.  Even so, there are clear examples in other countries where supervisors acted to stem the tide, and this is what lacked so notably in the Irish case.  </blockquote>I ask him to expand on his comment for the benefit of the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Klaus Regling" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#B00300"><p>There are several instances in the report where we drew comparison with other countries and said that many of the factors that contributed to the problem in Ireland also existed in other countries.  What struck us was that in Ireland all these factors we mentioned, which I summarised in my initial statement, were present but they were present to a stronger degree.  This relates to supervision but it also relates to the governance problems within banks and the concentration risks which became bigger and bigger.</p><p>So it was all there but to a degree that one could not find in other countries, or not in all the areas in other countries.  If one looks at the report, for instance, there are charts that show the increase in property lending by individual banks and the concentration on that sector of the economy.  This is unprecedented.  There are no other cases, although maybe a little bit in Spain, but in Spain the supervisors acted quite differently.  It was really a multitude of factors that all interacted in the same negative direction and the degree to which these factors contributed to the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#C00200"><p>What actions were taken in other jurisdictions that were not taken in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Klaus Regling" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#C00300"><p>In Spain, for instance, supervisors early on introduced counter-cyclical capital buffers, which is now something quite common.  It is widely accepted that this is necessary.  Obviously, Spain got into problems.  There was also a property bubble, but the supervisors there acted earlier with instruments that were not applied in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#C00400"><p>That brings me to my next question before I call Senator O'Keeffe.  How would Mr. Regling characterise the relationship between the banks on the one hand and the regulator-supervisor's governance structure - that is, the Financial Regulator's office and the Central Bank - on the other hand, in the years leading up to the crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Klaus Regling" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#C00500"><p>With hindsight it is easy to say that this relationship was not a healthy one, but one has to look back at the culture in bank supervision globally.  We also make this point in the report.  This was not just an Irish problem as there was a debate at the time about light-touch supervision.  There was a widespread view - including in the United States, for instance - that markets would regulate themselves to a large extent.  Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve at the time, often talked about this.  He is a good example because a few years ago he publicly admitted that this was a mistake.  It is another example where something that went wrong in Ireland also went wrong in many other countries, but this element was then reinforced by all the other problems I have just talked about, and which are to be found in the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#C00600"><p>Was there something unique about the relationship between the banks, the regulator and Central Bank system in Ireland that one did not see in other jurisdictions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Klaus Regling" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#C00700"><p>The degree of the problem was perhaps bigger because it was very light-touch supervision.  It was something that the Federal Reserve in the US also thought was the right approach, but certainly not what one would want to see today.  An intrusive, assertive relationship between supervisors and banks did not seem to exist, so banks were free to go in the wrong direction for too long.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#C00800"><p>I wish to express my condolences on the death of Mr. Watson.</p> <p>  Over his many years of experience, Mr. Regling has obviously read many reports and he has probably written many reports also.  How would Mr. Regling describe this one in terms of it being critical?  Would he say it is fairly critical or very critical?  How would he describe it himself as a report presented by him?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Klaus Regling" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#C00900"><p>I think it is fairly critical.  When I re-read it, I also had that impression.  I hope it was fair, however, because there were many things to be criticised or to be critical about.  Seen against the global context, there were not only home-grown problems.  It was an unfortunate combination of home-grown problems against the global background of too much liquidity, too low interest rates for too long, and the search for yields from many parts of the world.  It was also the time when Ireland joined the euro area, which had positive impacts.  It prevented currency turmoil and led to the permanently lower interest rate.  In a way we were all learning what a permanently lower interest rate meant.  It is clear to economists that this is equivalent to a very strong, stimulatory monetary action, but it was the first time that something like this happened.  We were aware that monetary conditions would be very easy because of the fact that Ireland had joined the euro area and would therefore have permanently low interest rates.  It was clear that policy should react to that somehow.</p> <p>  We make the point in the report, for instance, that there was a final appreciation of the Irish currency in the exchange rate mechanism in March 1998, a few months before the beginning of monetary union.  This was only done to act against this strong monetary push that was coming from the decline in interest rates.  At the same time, we had a very loose global monetary environment.  We had more financial market integration in Europe, in the EU, which was also something we wanted to see.  It is one of the advantages of the Single Market, and of the euro, to have more financial market integration, but this also meant that there was more liquidity available than before.  All this happened simultaneously.</p> <p>  With hindsight it is easy to say that stronger policy action, in those areas where it was possible, would have helped a lot.  The two areas available were in fiscal policy and supervisory action.  Unfortunately, as we describe in the report, fiscal policy moved from being counter-cyclical early in that decade, to becoming pro-cyclical later in the decade.  It therefore added fuel to the fire.  </p> <p>  On the supervisory side there was a light-touch approach, which was not intrusive or hands-on.  Instruments that were available were just not used, or used very late and very little, like reducing the loan-to-value ratios.  That is something that could have happened more forcefully, but one has to see it against the culture at the time.  Today, everybody who deals with these issues talks a lot about macro-prudential supervision, but that was not very fashionable at the time globally, and not alone in Europe.  With hindsight, however, it was clearly one of the areas, together with fiscal policy, where one could have done something and should have done more, but it did not happen at the time.  </p> <p>  Going back to fiscal matters, there is a real issue here for me as an economist, that we were not able to calculate and are still not very good at calculating underlying fiscal balances.  It is an unresolved issue.  We learn as we go along but we always know more after a few years.  I mentioned the IMF data that said in 2007, as I quoted, that the nominal fiscal balance was in balance.  We thought the underlying structural deficit was very small at the time.  Today we know it was bigger than 8% of GDP.  </p> <p>  Our report is critical on all these points but the criticism is spread very widely.  It is also spread towards economists who have not come up with a good methodology to calculate this.  It is of course critical of bank governance, supervisors and fiscal policy makers, though not only in Ireland.  The global background was not helpful at all.  These different elements from all sides reinforced the problems.</p></speech>

In addition, however, the external bodies that are there to monitor countries, like the OECD, the IMF and the European Commission, all failed to some extent, hence the bottom line that nobody seemed to be in charge.  Of course, that was a surprise.  It was also, for me, some kind of self-criticism because at the time I was in charge of economic-financial affairs at the European Commission.  This is also a criticism that is directed at me, directly.</p></speech>

He said that with hindsight we know more things and macro-financial prudence has changed.</p><p>Mr. Regling states on page 35 of his report:<blockquote><br /><br />... property exposure gave rise to a very risky concentration of risks within certain institutions, and even more so across the banking system.  In an economy which is not large, and which has one main financial centre, it would be surprising if this state of affairs was unknown to banks, even if formal data systems did not surface it.</blockquote>I just wonder what Mr. Regling was trying to say here.  Was he trying to say that people actually knew what they did not say they knew, or was he saying that there was actually a crisis of solvency and that people ought to have known that, whereas we understand that people say it was a liquidity crisis, not a solvency crisis?  I am not clear what Mr. Regling is driving at there.</p></speech>

It is just striking how many loans went into the sector, with unprecedented growth rates.  To an observer from the outside - Max Watson and I were outsiders when we came to Dublin - it would indicate that alarm bells should have been ringing loudly and clearly among the banks themselves, their supervisory bodies and the supervisors, the central banks.  Obviously, it did not happen.</p></speech>

Mr. Regling talks about the alarm bells in another part of the report.  One can have alarm bells ringing all one likes but, as we know, we sometimes just switch them off.  Were they ringing or not ringing?</p></speech>

I am sure alarm bells were ringing but there was not enough attention paid to this.  This we noted.  We do not know about the interaction of individuals; that was not our job to find out.  Again, however, one has to see it against the background of the global, EU and Irish economies.  People thought at the time that things were going very well.  One will remember that the time was called the Great Moderation.  There was good growth, a good rise in the standard of living and low inflation.  We know today there were a number of factors that contributed to this and, therefore, people whose job it was to monitor and ring alarm bells were fairly quiet globally and in Europe, because the situation seemed so much under control and so good.  This is not trying to make an excuse for all the things that went wrong and for senior bank managers, supervisors, central banks and so on but it tries to explain why what happened did happen.  Again, it happened in many other countries, but not always to the same degree.</p></speech>

He seems to be suggesting that common wisdom, the knowledge people had, would have suggested there was a serious problem.  I am not clear whether Mr. Regling said people ignored it or simply did not know.  There is a huge difference between not knowing and ignoring.  He is suggesting that they were ignoring it.</p></speech>

However, the experience in other countries at the time was also that the economy had been going very well for such a long time that those who had been critical were clearly in a minority.  Again, let me look at the global economy.  There were people who criticised the Federal Reserve policies for a number of years, since early in the decade.  They included, for instance, people at the BIS, Raghuram Rajan, who was the chief economist of the IMF at the time and who is now the Governor of the Central Bank of India, and John Taylor, a well-known US academic in Stanford.  There were people who criticised globally the monetary policy, excess liquidity and low interest rates - too low for too long, as Raghuram Rajan said - but they were clearly in a minority.  The majority of the academics of the central banks of the banks globally had a different view.  They all made good money when they were investing money and the majority of academics just did not share the view.  Therefore, this is a combination of things that clearly went wrong in this country but one has to see it against the background internationally, where things also went wrong for quite a while.</p></speech>

In other parts of the report, he talks about errors of judgment in bank management, major lapses in the documentation of loans, weak risk management, and the failure of corporate checks and balances.  If something was systematic and internal procedures were overridden, that means people knew what they were doing.  Is that a fair observation?  In some cases, that is what was happening.  People absolutely knew what they were doing.</p></speech>

We now have the banking union.  The supervision of systemically important banks is now done through the single supervisory mechanism, which is associated with the ECB.  We have the European Systemic Risk Board, ESRB, a new institution also linked to the ECB and chaired by the President of the ECB.  It has the mandate of macro-prudential supervision, something that did not exist before the crisis.  It is a good example of what we learned from the crisis.  However, again this is a global phenomenon.  Macro-prudential issues were not on the agenda before 2008.  After the crisis, countries such as the US and the UK created bodies like that.  We have it in the EU area and it is chaired by the ECB President.  Many things have happened since 2008 that are obviously not reflected in the report.</p></speech>

Of course, there were rules and regulations in place.  We have EU directives that deal with banking supervision.  Also in the United States, there were rules in place but the general approach was one of light touch from the official side.  There was a lot of confidence that the banks would self-regulate in their own interest.  I already quoted Mr. Greenspan, who said a few years later that this was a mistake.</p></speech>

It does not mean there are no rules at all.  There were rules, but they were much lighter than what we see today after we learned lessons.  In particular, the approach of supervisors was too hands-off.  There were not many on-site inspections.  Today there is a widespread view that the manner in which supervisors deal with banks should be more intrusive and assertive.  There is also a cultural issue which goes beyond rules and regulations.  It is different from the time when the view was that banks and financial market participants would self-regulate themselves to a large extent.  The view was that they would do it because it was in their own interests.  They did not want to go bankrupt or get into serious trouble.  That was a widespread view and that is why there was light-touch regulation.  There was confidence in self-regulation.  That changed completely after the crisis.</p></speech>

That is fine.  In that context, without the benefit of hindsight, the methodology in terms of the structural deficit which Mr. Regling speaks of now, rather than in the report, which he mentioned in his opening statement, and the fact there is a lot more macro prudential focus, would it be fair to say that the structure of the eurozone for small open economies such as Ireland was incomplete and inadequate in providing them with the tools to deal with the crisis as it unfolded?</p></speech>

Of course we now say that all of those who were involved, including the European Commission and the Eurogroup, and the design of the monetary union when it started in 1998 were incomplete.  My institutions, the EFSF and ESM, did not exist.  The founding fathers of the euro did not believe that such an institution, which would provide emergency finances when a country loses access to markets, would be needed because they could not imagine that a member of the euro area could lose market access.  Also, we could not imagine a crisis of the magnitude we saw in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  It was the worst economic crisis in 80 years and was not anticipated.  It is one example.  There are many others.  </p> <p>  The surveillance was too narrow and focused on fiscal policy, which is important, but we did not pay enough attention to other imbalances which became very large, such as divergences in competitiveness.  Ireland is a prime example of that.  We also had a chart in the report showing that unit labour costs in Ireland increased by 45% more than was justified by productivity gains from 1998 to 2008.  This led to the very large current account deficit, not surprisingly.  We now have a totally new system of surveillance and monitoring of-----</p></speech>

That is why the home-grown issue also plays a role.  It was the same system for all the euro area countries.  When it started there were 11, and there are now 19.

Given that there were no bears in the market, with the exception of Professor Taylor in Stanford and Professor Morgan Kelly in UCD, what pro-cyclical policies could a Government have implemented in 2006 to prevent this crisis?  At that stage, if we had listened to the IMF or the Commission, what could we have done?</p></speech>

We also know - and this was known to people who worked a lot on this and to the European Commission when I was there, as we wrote about it - monetary policy is often pro-cyclical, unavoidably.  Countries that grow stronger than the average also typically have higher inflation rates than the average.  As a consequence, they have lower real interest rates.  The opposite is also true.  Countries that do not grow so fast have lower inflation rates and, therefore, higher real interest rates.  This means there is a pro-cyclical impact from being in a monetary union, coming from the monetary conditions.  This is no surprise.  We knew it when monetary union started.  It also happens in regions of large countries, such as in the United States.  The mid-west or Florida can have very different monetary conditions and also typically-----</p></speech>

I would not go too far because someone cannot excuse everything with that.  The fact that monetary conditions could be pro-cyclical was well known to policy makers.  The Senator asked what could be done at the national level, responding to national differences, and here he is back to fiscal policy and supervisory action.</p><p>I already talked about that briefly earlier.  Fiscal policy could have been counter-cyclical, but what we actually see - and we already knew it at the time - is that fiscal policy was moving, from the first half of that decade to the second half, from being counter-cyclical to becoming pro-cyclical, and that added fuel to the fire.  Fiscal policy could have addressed some of the problem, but it did the opposite - although, again, due to the lack of good methodology, the full extent was not known and supervisory action that could have been taken was not taken - for example, loan-to-value ratios were reduced very late and by very little.  Those are the two areas where the national authorities can do something even in an incomplete monetary union.</p></speech>

It is in those years that the data clearly shows that the property bubble became very big, so bank lending grew sometimes at 80% or 90% per year.  That was when these problems appeared, not only in Ireland but in many other countries of the world.  It was a global environment, with the EU integration of financial markets and the home-grown problems of not responding adequately to that.  I think it would be that five-year period.</p></speech>

In the context of the structure of the euro and how the 19 heads of central banks operate, each being a member of the governing council of the ECB, in Mr. Regling's understanding at the time - I suppose it is the same now - when the 19 central bankers are sitting around in Frankfurt, have they a fiduciary duty to the mission of the European Central Bank and, if so, does that override any duties and responsibilities they have to their national central banks when they are in that room?</p></speech>

One is the management of their national central banks at home, but when they attend the meetings in Frankfurt as the ECB they are there in their personal capacity.  The Maastricht treaty is very clear on this - they are not representing their country.</p></speech>

In his research and interviews with 100 people, and no doubt from reading other reports and media commentary of the day, he will have noticed that, apart from the John Taylor he mentioned from Stanford - we had Morgan Kelly here, and a number of other commentators - by far the majority of academics and other commentators were predicting soft landings and so on.  In his look at the Oireachtas, the Parliament, can Mr. Regling reflect for us on the discourse that was going on?  Clearly, we know what Government was doing, but in terms of the Opposition, was the Government being held to account to the extent it ought to have been?  Was the Opposition advocating counter-cyclical policies or promoting an even more pro-cyclical set of policies?  Can Mr. Regling give us an insight into that?</p></speech>

Greece got bilateral loans first, and then also received money from the EFSF.  A very simple legalistic answer would be that the EFSF and ESM treaty actually states that we can provide financing only when the euro area as a whole is threatened.  That would be the legalistic answer.  Otherwise, we would not become active.  I think the reasons behind that are clear.  When the crisis hit Ireland, it was the first EFSF case.  Greece was hit earlier and the problem was solved initially in a different way.  There was a serious threat for the euro area as a whole because we saw at the time a lot of contagion - by "contagion" I mean the problems jumping from one country to another and more and more countries losing market access.  Then there was the threat that if no emergency financing was provided, countries would have had to leave.  That was when we created the EFSF.  That was one clear conclusion.  That is why we are much better equipped today than we were in 2009 and early 2010.  The EFSF was created in May and June 2010 to provide emergency financing.  Also, from the investor side - the other side of the coin - it is very clear today that at the time, many of the big investors were not in a position to differentiate between the different European economies - they had not done their homework studying the differences - so when one country got into difficulties they did not know how to interpret that and they also withdrew from the other countries.</p></speech>

He speaks about the systemic risk throughout the banks which it seems was important beyond reasonable doubt.  He then argues that clearly the banks themselves should have known where they were trading cross-guarantees with different banks. </p><p> Does Mr. Regling believe that if the Irish Government had contacted the ECB on the night of the guarantee, there could have been a situation where Anglo Irish Bank would have been allowed to go into liquidation and to fail?  Could a different construct have been used in terms of a guarantee that would have cost Ireland and the taxpayers less money?</p></speech>

The supervisory board of the bank should have asked many questions, such as whether this does not create too many risks.  The supervisors should have asked more questions.  It was probably out of line with some of the rules on concentration risks.  The Central Bank should have asked questions.  The Government should have taken appropriate action to counterbalance that.  Again I am back to this view that it is a very widespread phenomenon where one should not single out one person or one group of actors.</p></speech>

Mr. Regling does single out the commercial aspect of that on page 6 of his report.  We now know 190 people who were transferred into NAMA had tens of billions of euro - over 50% of the entire loan book.  When I say 190 people I mean 190 individuals or corporate entities.

What happened here with NAMA also happened with most other countries - to create an entity that priced bank resolution and separated bad parts and good parts of the banks.  In that sense, it was the way that was also chosen in all the other countries.  On the details I cannot comment but let me stress again that crisis management is always difficult because decisions have to be taken in real time, before all the information that one would like to have is really available.  That is a very general statement but unfortunately it is true.</p> <p>  The other point, I already mentioned it briefly, is that certain instruments and frameworks that were developed afterwards were not available in 2008, particularly on the bank resolution side.</p></speech>

I wanted to start by looking at the area of commercial property.  Reading Mr. Regling's report, one of the things that strikes me is that he emphasises time and time again the role that commercial lending, commercial property played and the concentration.  There has been a narrative there and indeed I think some of the comments he has made play into that narrative, where he talks about the national obsession that people had with property.  We had our own Taoiseach in Davos saying that we went mad borrowing and so on.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Regling talk about the role commercial property played in that?  The information we now have from the Nyberg report suggests that 50% of the Irish loan book of Anglo belonged to 20 individuals, 51% of the loan book of Irish Nationwide was made up of 25 individuals and 190 borrowers made up &euro;62 billion of debt.  When we talk about the property bubble and the crisis here, was it essentially a commercial property bubble and was it essentially a small number of individuals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Klaus Regling" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#G03100"><p>Of course one had both.  One had the housing bubble as such - real estate - and when we talk sometimes about the obsession of the Irish public with real estate I think we refer to that.</p><p>People really thought prices would never fall because the collective memory did not exist, unlike in the UK for instance where people know that once in a generation there is a crisis in the housing market and prices drop by 10%, 20% or 30%.  This collective memory did not exist here, so people thought it would always go up and the investment could not go wrong.  That relates I think to real estate.  On the property side, our research suggests that economically it is a more serious issue.  Data were quoted from Peter Nyberg's report.  He did his report about a year later so we did not look into that in that detail.  I take it that these numbers are the right ones but we did not work on those ourselves.  Economically, this misdirection of capital hit the Irish economy even more than the housing bubble because it seems that a lot of investment took place that was never really viable and will never be viable in the future.  It is a real loss, and that is quite different from real estate where we see already that prices are recovering.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#H00200"><p>If we look at NAMA, which again appeared afterwards, we see from reports by NAMA that housing made up less than a fifth of NAMA&rsquo;s assets.  One of my questions relates to the concentration of commercial property, which was the majority of assets that went into NAMA.  Only 54% of it was within the Irish State.  Could Mr. Regling expand on the role in the crisis played by the credit and commercial lending and the activities that took place outside of the State?</p></speech>

Given the very ample liquidity and the search for yield, banks and investors in general look to other possibilities to make money.  They have leveraged huge liquidity.  If they do not find opportunities at home, another way out is to go abroad.  By the way, a third opportunity is to invest in strange assets such as sub-prime mortgages and other such assets.  They are the three possibilities &ndash; all of which are not very good.  We saw that happening also in other countries.  Indeed, it was striking that some of the Irish banks got into property deals quite far away from Ireland.</p></speech>

When one has a bank, for example, Anglo Irish Bank, that has 50% of its Irish loan book lent to 20 individuals, what type of alarm bells should have sounded and what should have been the reaction?  Is it acceptable to not sound those alarm bells given the knowledge that Mr. Regling believes that the banks knew about the concentration of lending and that his late colleague believed that the supervisors would have also known?</p></speech>

They are probably correct but they are not part of our report.  Without going into the data of individual banks, the phenomenon Deputy Doherty describes points very clearly to failures of senior bank managers, the supervisory board and the supervisors.  That should have been caught and addressed.  Again, it was in the context of the great moderation and the belief that banks would regulate themselves.  I do not wish to blame only the people at the time, it was also the culture at the time which was to be blamed, and we have learned from that.</p></speech>

Mr. Regling mentioned that the crisis had the potential to destabilise the euro.  I take it that the response to our crisis, in particular in 2008, could also have had the effect of saving the euro.  Could Mr. Regling elaborate on that?  The language used in the policy lessons to which Mr. Regling referred on page 43 is interesting.  He talked about the need for closure, including for the Irish people, and the need for justice to be done.  What role does he believe our European partners and institutions have to play in that regard?  Many believe the best way to achieve closure is to get back some of the money that was injected into the banks.</p></speech>

For me, what has happened goes a long way in terms of closure because the European partners and the euro area as a whole, have developed a completely new system.  Monetary union today is different from monetary union as it was designed during the 1990s and in the Maastricht treaty.  We now have emergency financing available through my institutions.  We have much broader surveillance.  We have a banking union.  Countries are under stricter economic policy co-ordination that goes far beyond the fiscal side, which was always co-ordinated through the Stability and Growth Pact.  Now we also address all the other areas that can lead to problems.  We have an excessive imbalance procedure that looks at current accounts, wage developments, and competitiveness among other matters.  It is a new system.  That is what the European partners could do.  In Ireland, Parliament has done a lot of work in that regard.  There are also proceedings going on against individuals.  All of that is important.</p></speech>

I will take him back to the fraught environment in September 2008.  Lehman&rsquo;s bank filed for bankruptcy on 15 September.  What would have been the implications for the eurozone if a bank had collapsed in the eurozone, not necessarily in Ireland, if there was a disorderly failure of a bank at a time when there was such a liquidity crisis following the collapse of Lehman's?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Klaus Regling" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#H01500"><p>The problem is that no one can be absolutely certain about that.  We learned that through Lehman's.  I remember very well that the weekend before Lehman's was allowed to fail, after the US authorities had rescued several other big banks, they reached the point where on that particular weekend in mid-September they decided to let one go.  I remember many editorials in global newspapers that said indeed the time has come to let one of these big banks fail.  That indicates to me that nobody can really pretend that he or she knew the consequences.  Lehman's has shown that the consequences can be unpredictable.  We just do not have experience.  In today&rsquo;s world where even banks that do not belong to the top ten can be so interconnected through new financial instruments that did not exist 20 years ago, the implications go far beyond what one could imagine.  That is the lesson from Lehman's.  Therefore, it is very hard to say what exactly would have happened if one of the big European banks would have gone under.  At the time it was decided that after Lehman's it was too risky to do that also in Europe.</p></speech>

That is why the finance Ministers meet every month in Brussels or more often if necessary.  The central bankers work together.  The supervisors work together.  That is the international responsibility, but decisions are taken normally after talking to many others.  As I said earlier, sometimes decisions also have to be taken very quickly without all the information one would like to have.  Crisis management is not easy.</p></speech>

The question that many people will want answered is why no one in authority, whether it be within the banks, the regulator, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the Government or the external bodies, shouted "Stop" when this problem was building up and it was clear that a crisis could potentially develop, that risks were being developed in the Irish economy?  That is the question many people would want to have answered.  Mr. Regling met with many of the key people involved.  Why did nobody see it coming?  Why did nobody shout "Stop" in the years leading up to 2008?</p></speech>

It was a failure of all those involved.  The only way to understand it is to think back to the time when there was great moderation, economic developments seemed fantastic, there was strong growth and a growth rise in the standard of living without an increase in headline inflation and as prices, including housing prices but not only those, went up, it was not seen as such a problem at the time.  Today, it is seen as more of a problem.  Macro-prudential tools were not well developed and were rarely used, although they existed.  All these things are different today.  We have learned from this but at the time it was not the case and that was not only here but also in other countries.</p></speech>

Could he elaborate on what he means by that and the role that played in the lending policy that was being pursued by the banks, the role that people played by virtue of how they were going to be rewarded for decisions that they made in their jobs?</p></speech>

We know these kinds of incentives can lead to certain behaviour.</p></speech>

In addition, looking at the increase in loans to real estate during that period, it was probably impossible for the loan officers to do a thorough credit analysis.  There were just too many applications, otherwise this jump every year would have been impossible.</p></speech>

Was the bonus culture in the banks at the time, which existed both at senior management and middle management level, particularly targeted at the property sector and lending into the property sector?</p></speech>

In his presentation today, he posed the question of whether there were failures by auditors.  In his view, in drawing up his report, were there failures by auditors in the Irish banking institutions?</p></speech>

We could not get to investigate that in the report so I do not have an answer but it seemed an obvious question to ask given what we see in the balance sheets of banks and how their loan portfolio developed and on the concentration and other things we have already discussed here.  The question for me then is quite obvious - why have auditors, among many others, not been ringing the bells?  It was a question that we put at the end because we did not get into that.  We did not interview the auditors.</p></speech>

My feeling would be that in other countries where we have seen big housing bubbles and that occurred in Spain in the euro area and in the Baltic countries outside the euro area, but in regard to the EU where they had a similar phenomenon of very strong lending to commercial and real estate properties, there were probably similar problems but I never researched that.</p></speech>

Can he outline briefly what he meant by the pattern of tax cuts?</p></speech>

There was a problem on both sides.  Expenditures went up but the Deputy's question is mainly on the revenue side.  It is also striking that expenditures after 2004 - there is a chart there - were growing faster than nominal GDP.  Until then it grew less than nominal GDP so that was one problem.  On the revenue side, we mentioned in our report that the share of cyclical taxes like property taxes and sales taxes increased significantly.  That makes the system more vulnerable because, with hindsight, we know that these sources of tax revenue disappeared with the crisis.  That was a very strong reason the overall fiscal deficit became so big.  Unfortunately, with hindsight, that is exactly what happened.  The deficit became big because the reliance on cyclical revenue had become so large.</p></speech>

Can he elaborate on how he came to that conclusion?</p></speech>

We could not find any clear policies on this.  That is why we wrote the sentence the way the Deputy read it, that it seemed to be <i>ad hoc</i>but that is it.  We could not find policies in place that would have governed this in a transparent way.</p></speech>

Instead it was pro-cyclical.  Supervisory actions could have been taken but were not taken.  Again, it is a little like the questions from the Deputy's colleagues.  One has to see it to some extent against the culture of the time.  People thought, and not only in this country, that we lived in the great moderation where everything was perfect, that high growth would continue forever, that there would be no inflation and no problems, and that markets would regulate themselves.  We learned it was an illusion but one has to keep this environment in mind if one tries to understand why the actors did not use instruments that seemed so logical with hindsight and should have been taken.</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is a contradiction in Mr. Regling's report but he talks about the structure or regulatory model at the time having been an experiment and about it coming from a compromise.  When his colleague, Mr. Watson, was in front of the finance committee, he said in relation to not having the prudential director on the board that everyone knew it was wrong, so much so that they wrote to the Department of Finance and said, "We cannot possibly do that".  It was said he was to be put on a board anyway.  Mr. Regling concludes that the design of our regulatory system was not the issue.  Can he expand on what was happening in terms of the design, in the first instance, and why the design was not an issue given what happened?</p></speech>

Many countries have experimented with trying to find the correct design for supervision.  Some countries from the beginning left the matter with central banks; others took it out, as in the UK, but it has now put it back with the Bank of England.  These things are going back and forth.  Max Watson's and my conclusion, not only for Ireland but globally, is that the structure plays less of a role than the culture.  We are not saying the structure, the institutional set-up, is unimportant but that it plays less of a role than the culture.  It is more important that the culture be the right one.  If the people play their role in an assertive hands-on way, that is more important than the institutional set-up because, even if the institutional set-up is perfect - if one can find a perfect set-up - but there is a hands-off, non-intrusive and too-polite approach in the belief that markets will find a way themselves, that set-up does not really help.  That is why we came to this conclusion, which is a global conclusion and not one only for Ireland.</p></speech>

However, I do not want to say the institution does not matter at all.  It is important to get it right and have the lines of communication correct.  The right people have to be at the right meetings.  All that is important.  We only want to say it is even more important that the people in charge really play their role well.</p></speech>

When the crisis hit, all this came unexpectedly.  That is why we did not have the institutions in place, such as my institution.  There were not policies in place that one would wish today with hindsight had been in place.  Therefore, there were approaches and decisions taken without having a general policy developed first.</p></speech>

Mr. Regling mentioned culture and talked about cultural attitudes in this country.  When Mr. Wright, who was in the Ministry responsible for finance in Canada, was before us, he referred in his report to Ireland failing the test of prudent fiscal management.  Does Mr. Regling see any cultural problems or aspects in this country that make it difficult for us to manage euro membership policy formation and everything that goes with it?</p></speech>

In other countries where we saw problems during the crisis, people have learned.  In the euro area as a whole we have learned.  The institutions, such as the Commission, also have learned.  I would not support at all the Deputy's implication that Ireland, even today, is not fit for the monetary union.</p></speech>

There are six large banks, almost equal in size.  They had a much more hands-on supervisory system.  What happened in the US, for instance, was that the originate-and-distribute model that contributed so much to sub-prime mortgages and the development of financial instruments that were rated triple A but worthless afterwards just did not feature in Canada.  In Canada, when somebody wanted a mortgage, one went to the bank and it would proceed in the good old way of doing a credit analysis and then deciding whether to give a mortgage.  In the US, this system did not exist any longer in the second half of the last decade.  Everything was done by the financial markets.  Nobody really did a thorough credit analysis, as a loan office and bank should do, and that is why it all got out of control.  That was the origin of the global financial crisis.  Canada just kept its old banking model whereby a mortgage was given by a bank.  It also stayed on the books of the bank, and that is why the bank felt more responsible for doing a good credit analysis.  It knew that if it did a bad one, it might end up with a loss.  It is very interesting in that there was very different development in the two countries.</p></speech>

The report says it.  However, I must always come back to the combination of global factors, including too much liquidity, interest rates that were too low, European problems, and not being fully aware of what it means if a country enters monetary union and interest rates come down permanently.  In the case of Ireland, long-term interest rates were basically cut in half permanently.  This created a monetary boom.  We knew that this would happen but the extent and consequences were not fully appreciated.  We did not have available to us the instruments, such as ESF and ESM, at the beginning of the crisis.  We did not have a banking union and we did not have the ESRB, the body that is now in charge of macro-prudential risks.</p><p>We did not have a banking union, we did not have the ESRB, the body that is now in charge of macroprudential risks.  We tried to co-ordinate fiscal policies through the Stability and Growth Pact but we did not systematically look at other imbalances like current account imbalances, competitiveness imbalances, all these things have been corrected but they were not there in the beginning and it contributed to the crisis.

This includes the European element and we wrote about that in the report.  At the beginning of monetary union this move to permanently low interest rates meant a monetary push.  We knew about it but we did not anticipate the full extent of the problems.  We were in favour in the EU as a whole of more financial market integration but we underestimated the consequences because it could mean - as we see in Ireland and some other countries - that it allowed banks to access funding from abroad and fuel the bubble.  There was nobody who told the national supervisors to do something against that.  All that has been changed, but these are indeed problems that came from the European level and they added to the problems that came from the global level and the home-made failures in governance in many areas.</p></speech>

We met with former bankers, central bankers, consumer representatives, Government officials, journalists, politicians, financial regulators, trade union representatives, and members of the academic community.  Outside Ireland we met officials at the Bank for International Settlements, the ECB, the European Commission and the IMF, so it was fairly widespread.

Would he agree that perhaps when he says property acquisition as a topic was almost a national obsession in Ireland, and that it was hard to overstate the impact of this cultural attitude, this was perhaps the case among those people to whom he spoke, but the big majority of ordinary people in this country were not involved in property speculation.  By way of background, this is a particularly sensitive issue here because some of those who have pushed subsequent austerity justify it on the basis that "we all partied".  In reality most people did not, they were the victims.</p></speech>

In a sense many of them were decision makers, but we also talked to academics, trade union people and journalists, but we did not talk to people in the streets, that is also correct to say, because we did not have the time to do that.  I would not call it speculation when people bought apartments and houses, because they did it given their belief that prices would only go up, it would be a good investment but would not be wrong, and they wanted to already buy apartments for their children early.  As we heard as an example, people bought apartments for their children who were still in school because they thought once they got out of school, university and start a job they would not be able to afford a house.  That is why we use the word "obsession" or almost obsession, which goes beyond what I see in some other countries.  I would not call it speculation.</p> <p>  That I have a different view of austerity policies Deputy Higgins probably knows, so I will not get into that now.</p></speech>

By way of background, I refer to the fact that in Europe, the component price of a home that is caused by the land or site value is about 15%, but in Ireland in the top of the bubble the price of the land reflected itself in about 50% of the price of an ordinary home.  An expert here, P.J. Drudy, writing in the <i>Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland</i>, 2007, said &quot;there is evidence to suggest that land suitable for housing in some parts of the country, and especially in the Dublin area, is controlled by a relatively small number of landowners and developers.&quot;  Does Mr. Regling think it would be appropriate that there should be, for example, control of profiteering in building land, or in the subsequent housing, etc., that is built on building land?  Should that not be a policy change as well as some of the others he suggests?</p></speech>

We did not get into that.  I think the share of the price of the land going up in a bubble is quite normal, a common phenomenon.  These numbers the Deputy quotes I cannot confirm and I do not know what is a normal bubble - to the extent one can talk about a normal bubble.  The phenomenon I think is quite usual and one will find it in other countries.</p> <p>  What to do - I am not an expert, we did not get into that and it is not my expertise.  I think transparency is always good.  The tax system can also play a role - property taxes can play a role, but I think the committee has other experts who will come here who know more about that.</p></speech>

That has been the situation in this country.</p> <p>  In page 45 Mr. Regling says, "it appears particularly surprising that there was not a stronger reaction within the banks themselves and among supervisors to lending trends that saw progressive build-up of concentrated loan exposures to and within the commercial property sector."  Indeed I think he would add the housing sector as well.  Was it the case in reality that the property speculation goose, so to speak, was delivering golden eggs by the bagful for the bankers, bondholders and investors, and those who were benefiting simply wanted the good times to continue?  Perhaps that then worked its way through to the regulators and even the establishment politicians?  They were all drinking in the same well of free-market capitalism so let them at it.  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

We did not get into that.  However, certainly some people benefited a lot from these developments and it was, let me repeat, against a background of everything going well, the standard of living going up for a large part of the population and GDP <i>per capita </i>growing strongly.  We know today it was growing too strongly and that it was not sustainable.  Everybody benefited, some more than others, but a large part of the population also, and people thought these good times would never end.  Again, this was not an Irish phenomenon.  This was the same in the United States and many other countries.</p></speech>

One of the items is what Deputy Higgins was just indicating to Mr. Regling.  On the issue of regulation, Mr. Regling used the term "light touch" earlier.  Was light touch regulation, in his opinion, a result of policy or a result of pressure coming from the financial institutions?  Which was the main driver of light touch regulation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Klaus Regling" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#M00300"><p>That financial institutions prefer light touch supervision is understandable.  That is not surprising at all to me and this was also what we saw in all the other countries, in particular in the United States.  The financial sector was happy with light touch regulation.  So, no surprise here.  What is surprising is that the policy world - the regulators, supervisors, central banks, policy-makers, and a large part of the academic world - believed for a very long time that this was the best possible approach.  We saw the consequences.  Let me quote Mr. Greenspan again.  I think, on this occasion, it is very instructive to quote him.  It was he who promoted this for a long time.  He said it was a mistake.</p></speech>

In and running up to the conclusion of Mr. Regling's report, he states that there were two groups of factors that caused the crisis in Ireland.  There were the global factors which were external factors and there were the home-made factors.  Which was more decisive in contributing to the Irish banking crisis and financial collapse: the international factors or the home-grown domestic factors?</p></speech>

What I would like to emphasise is that because these different factors came at the same time, that is the explanation for why it became so bad.  If only one of the factors had been at play and the other not, then the crisis would have been much shallower.</p></speech>

Mr. Regling also mentioned fiscal policy being that driven by Government, the governance of the Central Bank and other matters.  In his judgement, having completed a report and upon review, how would he rank those factors in order of significance?</p></speech>

They all contributed.  If one of them had not been there, the crisis would have been a little bit less serious but there would have been a problem in any case.  It is good the Chair asked the question again, because that was the main conclusion of our report.  There were so many factors coming from the different sources - globally, European, national - and they all happened at the same time.  That is why the crisis became so serious.</p></speech>

We have now - I mentioned it earlier - the so-called excessive imbalance procedures.  This looks at macroeconomic imbalances that can lead to a crisis like excessive divergence in competitiveness, current account imbalances and credit bubbles.  All this is now done in a systematic way.  It did not exist before the crisis.  We always had a Stability and Growth Pact but not these other elements.  The Stability and Growth Pact has been strengthened.  There is less room for political interference now.  The Commission proposals will normally become European law.  We have done things on banking union, including transferring the supervision of important systemic banks to the single supervisory mechanism, SSM.  That is important.  We have the European financial stability facility, EFSF, and as a permanent crisis mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which did not exist before the crisis.  There are many different elements where we have tried to draw the conclusion.</p> <p>  Let me mention also the European Systemic Risk Board, ESRB, which is not well known by the broader public.  It is a very important innovation because it has this mandate of looking at macro-prudential risks.  No one did that at the European level before 2008 and, let me say again, the same in the US and the UK.  So, not only a European phenomenon.  One clear lesson of the crisis is that these macro-prudential aspects can become very important.  Supervisors in the past only looked at the micro aspect.  They went into a bank - maybe not assertively enough - and looked at the loan book, loan by loan, and decided whether it was a good loan or a bad loan, whether the provisions were enough.  However, there was no one to add it all up, which is the macro-prudential side, to come to a judgement on whether, overall, from a macroeconomic perspective, what banks were doing in a country was excessive or not.  So, we have learned lessons in many different areas here in Ireland, but also in the euro area as a whole.</p></speech>

I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to the committee today and to take questions about the role of the euro in what went on.  Since the mid-1990s this has been one of my main research areas.  The idea of monetary union was in the air since the early 1990s and there was a lot of discussion about what might happen once the euro was formed.  Of course, now we have seen all that has gone on in the first 15 years.</p> <p>  I will make four points in this opening statement, so it will be an overview of the more detailed written statement I have provided.  The first point is to talk about the global context.  Europe, in the end, is a relatively small part of the world economy.  We have to remember that the euro area lives in a global economic and financial system. </p> <p>  Second, I will talk about the impact of the euro in its first decade until the crisis.  My third point is about the role of national macro and financial policies under the euro.  My fourth point will be about how the euro has affected crisis management since 2007-2008.</p> <p>  In terms of the global context, since the late 1990s the creation of the euro was not the only major event in the world economy.  In the background, for example, the rise of China had a big effect.  China was growing so quickly that it was important in the late 1990s, but by the mid-2000s it was very important.  That had trading effects, although maybe less so here.  For example, the economies of Portugal, Greece, Italy and so on were quite affected by the rise of cheap imports from China.  Financially, the surpluses coming out of China were essentially flowing into the US financial system.  Low interest rates in the US prompted, for example, the rise of securitisation in US financial markets and European banks were active in the US system.  Therefore, there was a deep connection between what was going on in the US in the mid-2000s and what was going on in Europe.  A lot of that was being intermediated through banks.  European banks were important in linking the US financial system to the European financial system.</p> <p>  That meant that by the mid-2000s we had this global liquidity situation where interest rates were quite low globally, while capital was flowing and trying to find extra yield.  There was a lot of interest in innovative products like asset-backed securities.  There was a lot of availability of non-deposit funding.  What we saw were lots of countries starting to run much larger imbalances.  That was true in the euro area but also outside it.  We saw the Baltic economies and Iceland running large deficits.  Within the euro area, Ireland was running a current account deficit, but it looked smaller than what was happening in Spain, Portugal and Greece for example.</p> <p>  Let me now turn to the direct effect of the euro itself, which was interacting with those global factors.  It is important to split the time period into sub-parts.  First of all, from 1997 to 2001, there is an entry phase.  The fact that EMU was going to happen already led to a decline in interest rates in the periphery of Europe.  It led to a lot of optimism that now interest rates and inflation would be lower.  It created a situation where there was more temptation to invest, consume more and save less.</p> <p>  I would emphasise, however, that period really came to an end with the recession in 2001.  The US recession and the European recession in 2001, even though relatively brief, did break that initial phase.  If one went back and asked people in 2002 and early 2003 what happened next, they would say essentially that the exciting phase was over.  Essentially, one might think at that time that the world would settle down to more normal behaviour.  At that point, however, from 2003 to 2007, the import from the US of low interest rates, innovative financial products - and global banking corporations looking to invest through the interbank market and bond market in national banking systems across Europe - all of these credit events were happening then.  </p> <p>  I would emphasise that at that time the fundamentals in Europe were looking less good.  The interaction of credit supply was becoming more available, but in fact the story in Europe was becoming less positive.  In a number of economies demographic factors were turning more negative.  Oil prices were going up, which was a negative for importing countries in Europe.  The dollar depreciated quite a bit.  From 1999 to 2001 the dollar appreciated a lot, which has boosted Ireland in particular.  From a low in late 2000, when &euro;1 bought only $0.82 cents, by 2008, &euro;1 bought $1.57.  That was a pretty massive dollar depreciation against the euro. </p> <p>  In countries like Ireland and Spain, one saw that the business model of building export markets was replaced by an emphasis on local activity, especially construction.  The quality of economic activity from a long-term sustainability point of view declined in that period.  Essentially, there was a credit supply shock with all of this global liquidity being available, but in fact there were fewer productive opportunities in Europe at that time. </p> <p>  I will come back to the crisis period after 2007.  Let me turn to my third point about what the role of national policies inside a monetary union is, especially in the context of this kind of credit shock.  I will come back to interest rate policy in a minute.  The other levers of policy include credit policies, thus using financial regulation to ensure that banks do not over lend.  Today, we are talking in Ireland about loan-to-value ratios and loan-to-income ratios.  The Central Bank of Ireland could have used those tools in the mid-2000s.  Other countries did use them to a much larger extent than here.  </p> <p>  This morning, Mr. Regling talked about the fact that these were out of fashion a little bit at that time.  I think one can find examples where they were used more extensively than here.  That is the first line of defence.  When the source of the instability is global credit, the more direct way to deal with that is through regulation of credit politics here in Ireland.  </p> <p>  The second line of defence is fiscal.  At a micro level concerning the role of taxes and subsidies that might have encouraged investment in housing, those policies could have been changed.  At a macro level, the narrative is that under monetary union the scale of fiscal surpluses one needs to run when one is in an all out boom situation, is much larger than was achieved.</p><p>It is the case that the fiscal balance was in surplus for a long time but fiscal surpluses of 1% or 2% of GDP were basically not enough.  There are counter examples.  I wrote in the report that in 2007 countries like Finland and Sweden had surpluses of more like 5% of GDP.  Again if we roll back the clock, would that have been something that was seen as politically viable in the Irish situation - running surpluses in the mid-single digits?  In the report I describe also the possible role of a rainy day fund.  Essentially, given how difficult it is to manage surplus situations, it might have been a way to communicate to the population that some of this tax revenue was a windfall, so the capital gains taxes, the stamp duties and so on might be seen as ring-fenced.  They were not going to be long-term revenues at the level that they were and those revenues could have been diverted into a secure fund, which then could have been released when the downturn came.  I wrote about this in the late 1990s before the EMU pointing to this perhaps being one of the innovations we need.  Regarding going into the euro, there was enough evidence that one needs to run fiscal policy on a more prudential basis than was achieved.  It is important to say that it is not the case that the Irish system failed to deliver surpluses.  There were surpluses and public debt came down to a relatively low level but this was of a different order - the scale of it that was needed to stabilise the system was much greater than was politically discussed at the time.</p><p> I will turn to interest rate policy, the one that we do not have under the euro but could have had outside the euro.  One thing we could have taken before joining the euro was to revalue the Irish pound, so in terms of the lock-in exchange rates, we could have done more.  There was a small revaluation in early 2008 - it was around 3%.  The Irish economy was rocketing in 1998 and 1999.  It could have been anticipated that a much bigger revaluation could have been a good way to start in the move to the euro because that would have relieved inflationary pressures that built up.  In terms of interest rate policy, in the period 1999 to 2002 it is clear that we would have chosen much higher interest rates if we had been outside the euro.  The economy was really strong, inflation was quite high and way above the European average.  We would have seen much higher interest rates here.  It is not super clear after that.  From 2003 to 2005 inflation here has come down and in 2004 and 2005 we were pretty close to the European average.  It is not clear to me that the Irish Central Bank at that time would necessarily have picked much higher interest rates.  In 2006 and 2007 we were back to a situation where the economy started to overheat again and we would have picked higher interest rates.  I think the interest rate sequence we would have seen would have been different but I also would emphasise that carries its own problems.  </p><p> When a country has a small economy with its own currency and it raises interest rates in the heated situation we were in, there will be offsets.  One is that it will look very attractive to global investors.  If one is offering a 5% interest rate when France is offering 3%, one will have a lot of capital flowing in.  It could have brought in foreign capital to look for gains here.  The currency would have appreciated.  The interest rates we would have needed to cool down the housing market might have been the interest rates that would have had severe consequences for the export sector.  Switzerland is seeing that now.  There is a trade-off between the currency position and the interest rate position we want for financial stability versus what is desirable for the real economy.  That is the conundrum, there is no way around it, which is why, essentially, there is the current debate.  Interest rates cannot do everything.  We need the credit policies - the macro-prudential policies - as well.  </p><p> Iceland had a floating currency.  If one mixes a floating currency with poor regulation, one can get perverse outcomes because the krona in the mid-2000s was quite strong.  What that meant was that an Icelandic risk-taker could say to an international bank that in euro terms he or she was worth &euro;1 billion because of this currency appreciation effect and therefore he or she could offer it better collateral and could borrow more.  Again, with a well-regulated banking system that effect goes away but one has to think about the interaction of interest rate policy, regulatory policy and fiscal policy together.</p><p> My final point is about the crisis.  In the first period of the crisis from August 2007 onwards, there was a fairly positive view of European Union membership because it must be remembered that with the euro we had access to European Central Bank, ECB, liquidity whereas if countries outside Europe like Iceland, Latvia and so on had foreign debts and if they did not have liquidity to help service those debts, the scale of the problem was going to get bigger.  One could say there is a little bit of inoculation but there is a down side to inoculation which means resolution is postponed.  It must be remembered that a big part of liquidity provision is allowing foreign investors to escape, that the foreign depositors could leave the Irish banking system and be replaced by ECB liquidity.  It is important to emphasise again that a major beneficiary of liquidity is not necessarily local but the fact that foreign bondholders can get out of their positions in a smooth and easy way.  ECB liquidity is a double edged sword.  It is a big benefit of being part of the euro system but there are some down sides in that some crisis resolution options are avoided through that mechanism.  I would say that the ECB delayed too long in coming up with an outright monetary transactions, OMT, type structure.  In 2011 and 2012 there was unnecessary prolongation and a deepening of the crisis through the debate about whether the ECB has a role in eliminating redemonination risk.</p><p> If we had not been in the euro we can imagine the scenario where we had borrowed a lot but were outside the euro.  That scenario would have been a much deeper crisis but maybe faster recovery.  The crisis would have been deeper because if we owed dollars or other foreign currencies, there would have been a lot of bankruptcies.  On the other hand, the foreign creditors might have come up with deals.  They might have shown forbearance.  They might have offered debt restructuring and so on.  On the alternative of being outside the euro, the initial crisis would have been deeper because we would have had to face up very quickly to many bankruptcy situations.  Living standards would have dropped a lot because one of the consequences of devaluation is that imports become very expensive and since so much of what we consume here are imports, we would have seen a very sharp decline in living standards.  That is what happened in Iceland.  When the krona devalued in Iceland it helped recovery because Icelandic firms have become more competitive over time but the impact effect is a lot of financial distress and a big decline in consumption.  I do not think there is one answer to the question of which is better - a very devastating shock crisis but quicker recovery or having a more stable, gradual approach, which is what we have had.</p></speech>

To summarise some of the points touched on in his opening statement, he seems to suggest that even in the context of the eurozone the authorities in Ireland could have done much to stem the rising boom via prudent fiscal policy, a credit policy through the Central Bank and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the suggestion of a rainy day fund.  Following on from our engagement with Mr. Regling this morning and Professor Lane's opening comments, what is Professor Lane's view of the relationship between the Central Bank and the regulatory authority and the banks during the lead up to the crisis period?</p></speech>

The issue here is that the role of the Central Bank is quite distinct from the individual banks in the sense that the Central Bank is there to be at arm's length so that it is not bound up with the banks and it has a good deal of knowledge.</p><p>It is not bound up with the banks.  It has a lot of knowledge.  The individual banks might be concerned with market share.  They only see an incomplete picture of what is going on, whereas the regulator's office, in principle, should see everything because it has the books of all the banks.  It can look at the aggregate data.  It can take a systemic view.  The regulator and the Central Bank really have the core responsibility here.  Individual banks might decide to take certain risks.  It is up to the regulator to say "Listen, you cannot all do this - if you all make the same lending decisions, if you all lend into property, if you all lend to the same guys, clearly there is going to be a collective problem".  The solution to that is a regulator who is prepared to prioritise stability and to say "Listen, you may want to lend at that rate, but it is collectively too risky - we need to intervene".</p></speech>

Professor Lane suggested in his paper that if Ireland had not joined the eurozone, the potential would still have existed for a credit boom to happen in Ireland.  Maybe he can expand on that.</p></speech>

Second, I tried to indicate when I spoke about interest rate policy that the global financial system can overwhelm individual economies, including those with their own currencies.  The interest rate tool is a double-edged sword, whereas macroprudential domestic credit policies are much more direct.  A simple refusal to allow the banks to lend too much can do a great deal to stabilise the local system.</p></speech>

I would like to refer to the significant credit flows that came in, not immediately after we joined the euro but a couple of years afterwards.  There was a slight slowdown or recession when the dotcom bubble burst.  What were the significant factors underlying the major increase in the banks' balance sheets in the era that was mentioned by Professor Lane - late 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005?</p></speech>

It is important to look at that from both sides.  I will look at why they were willing to lend to Ireland from a global point of view.  There was a fundamental lag in perceptions.  Ireland had grown so much for the previous decade.  The late 1990s were really spectacular here.  A trader or analyst in a global bank might have argued that Ireland had a pretty good story to tell.  It is understandable why it started.  It is understandable that this happened in 2003 and 2004, when the global conditions were so liquid.  I looked at this last week.  At that time, Irish banks had historically not been major issuers of bonds, for example.  An argument in favour of buying some of them could have been made by those who did not have much by way of bond exposure to the Irish banking system.  I think there was an appetite in 2003 and 2004.  It was felt that Ireland might be under-weighted in global investment portfolios.  In all of these things, there is a reason it starts.  I think the bigger issue is that over time, it grew too quickly and it went on for too long.  I do not necessarily have a big issue with the fact that this thing started.  The issue is that there was too much delay in recognising that it had gone too far and was going on for too long.</p></speech>

For example, one indicator is that throughout that period, Ireland ran current account surpluses pretty much most of the time.  In net terms, we were lending to the world - we were not borrowing from the world.  That changed around 2003 or 2004.  The really rapid expansion in the late 1990s was sustainable in the sense that it was not being driven by borrowing from the rest of the world.  That is an indicator.  In the mid-2000s, we were growing but the liabilities to the rest of the world were also growing at the same time.</p></speech>

I would like to ask about the ability of the Irish banks to raise additional funds.  I am not just thinking about bonds.  I am thinking specifically about bank properties that were sold to pension funds before being rented back.  How would Professor Lane term that practice, which occurred during this era?</p></speech>

I am pretty sure it was pretty small in terms of its overall balance sheet.  I can see how it would have made sense from an organisational point of view.  That sounds okay to me if a bank wants to concentrate on lending, rather than managing its own properties.  The sale of their buildings by the banks is probably a pretty small part of the overall story.  It might also indicate their private view of whether the property market was overvalued.  That might also come into it.  Maybe they were selling because they took the view that if they were going to be lending to the Irish property market, they did not want to be holding an Irish property as an asset as well.</p></speech>

Last week, Patrick Honohan mentioned the absence of a central credit register.  When the committee gets to talk to individual bankers, maybe they will be able to say more.  Maybe each individual bank was insufficiently clear about the total indebtedness of these individuals.  These individuals might say to one bank "here is my situation".  If they are simultaneously borrowing from many different banks, maybe the collective risk exposure is bigger than what was visible to each individual bank.</p></speech>

Part of his evidence related to his discussions with the former Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan.  He had hoped to get to the weekend following the bank guarantee if emergency liquidity assistance could have been made available.  Why does Professor Lane think such assistance was not available at that stage?  It would have allowed the authorities to buy a little time to get to the weekend.  Rather than having to deal with the matter in a number of hours, they would have had a few days when the markets were closed.</p></speech>

I suppose the way I would phrase it is that the euro was a very young monetary system.  It had only been around for the good times between 1999 and 2007.  The playbook was not there to show how a national banking system should respond when its banks get into trouble.  This goes back to the issue of whether they might have been overly cautious.  Perhaps they decided not to try emergency liquidity assistance because they thought it might not be appropriate.  The alternative could have been to raise the issue, explore it, discuss it with the ECB and say "Listen, here is what we are thinking and here is the situation".</p><p>Rather than assume it was not feasible, for whatever reason, it is something I would have hoped could be explored more.</p></speech>

The relatively small amount of ELA in that period would have been a fraction of what subsequently went in.  Can Professor Lane explain?  I am baffled as to why a small amount was not considered to get to the weekend, when there would have been more time, and subsequently tens-----</p></speech>

That was providing support.  ELA was coming into play because the amount of collateral that could be put in with the euro system had run out.  There was a need to do something of a more emergency or exceptional nature.  I think this is a question that the committee will definitely have to raise with the relevant authorities when it gets to speak with them.  From the outside, it is not clear why that was not pursued.  I do not really have any good explanation.</p></speech>

It is probably fair to say that the attitude of the euro system to Ireland had to be constrained by the issue of what this would mean for the behaviour of other countries in the system, whereas, if we had our own national central bank which only had our own national interests to think about, it would have been different.  However, there are pros and cons to that.  It must be remembered that because of the euro system, this was a massive net inflow to Ireland.  If we just had our own national central bank, all we could do would be, essentially, to move funding from the Central Bank to the bank balance sheets.  It would not be a way to draw net resources into Ireland.  Because we are members of the euro system, however, there was a big net inflow into Ireland.  As I tried to point out earlier, we were not the only beneficiaries of that, because the net inflow from the euro system allowed a net outflow of private investors, so that depositors and bondholders could escape.  Who benefits from having lots of liquidity?  Partly, there is a benefit here because we did not have to do the kinds of things that would have been necessary without that funding, but, partly, the benefit goes elsewhere.</p></speech>

In Professor Lane's paper dated February 2011 he made the point that the UK and Denmark made funds available to non-EU countries at much lower rates.  Why or how, in the period of solidarity, was this nation being charged an awful lot more than what other countries were establishing with bilateral rates?</p></speech>

It was fairly simple at the time.  The logic was that this was essentially an IMF-plus bailout, so we would use the IMF funding rules, which were set to charge us a pretty stiff premium.</p></speech>

They were in the same ballpark as those of the IMF, which included a big risk premium - or not so much a risk premium as a penalty clause, under which, in order to make sure countries do not look for bailouts until they really have to, the financing has to be at a penal rate.  That is a long-standing tradition.  But what that did not allow for was that we were in it together.  If we are all in the common euro area, that is not the right analogy.  The IMF analogy of a global membership helping an individual member country did not suit Europe, and eventually it moved to say it would essentially be at the cost of firms, more or less.</p></speech>

It states that in the absence of medium-term liquidity support, forced deleveraging over a short timescale can be self-defeating by driving down property values in a fire sale process.  I am taking that as a comment on NAMA.</p></speech>

One view of liquidity is that where a bank has a one-week problem, liquidity has to be provided for a week, but when a central banking system has made many long-term property loans, essentially a liquidity crisis could last for years.  If one tries to get the banks to sell off those loans quickly, there will be a big decline in asset prices and, therefore, it would be self-defeating, turning a big problem into a massive problem.  When there is a property-based banking crisis, liquidity needs to be extended for years, which is what has happened, and NAMA has been part of that.  NAMA has the NAMA bonds, has provided liquidity to the system and has been gradually selling its portfolio.  Ireland has been able to make a case that liquidity support is a years-long issue, not a months-long issue.  It must be remembered that in the bailout discussions in November 2010, some of the troika were essentially arguing for a pretty quick disposal of assets by the banks, and over the next few months the Irish authorities were able to convince them that this would be self-defeating.  My point there was that dealing with the liquidity problem, as it turned out, was going to be a process that took years.  Liquidity was needed for years and years.  It was not something that would take just a few months.</p></speech>

I would like to dwell a little on that.  He said in the written statement with which we were furnished that it was vital to understand that there were several structural changes in the international economy and the international financial system from the mid-1990s, so the creation of a single currency could not be viewed as the sole or even the primary factor behind the extraordinary growth in national financial flows during the pre-crisis period.  If I pushed Professor Lane to say what was the primary factor in the explosion of credit worldwide from the mid-1990s, could he outline one, or maybe two?</p></speech>

Essentially if one thinks about the world economy and where it is now compared to 1995, what fraction of world GDP is coming out of emerging Asia is a great deal higher.  Asia had its crisis in 1997-98 and one of the consequences of that was that Asia essentially decided to take a cautious approach that they would be a big net saver, they would grow quickly but they would spend less and the surpluses out of Asia were a major reason interest rates in the US went down quite a bit.  The low interest rate environment in the US was the source of a lot of funding for Europe.  The big narrative for me is the financial implications of the rise of emerging Asia.</p></speech>

No doubt Professor Lane is familiar with the work of Professor David Harvey, professor of anthropology at the City University of New York.  Professor Lane echoes in his opening remarks the words of Professor Harvey who spoke about strange new markets that arose which pioneered with what became know as the shadow banking system, permitting investment in credit swaps, currency derivatives, even future markets, pollution rights and betting on the weather.  He states that this massive global funding grew from virtually nothing in 1990 to $250 trillion in 2005, at a time when global output was only $45 trillion.  To the year 2008, it grew to an astonishing figure of $600 trillion.  Was it inevitable that with funds of that magnitude sloshing around the financial markets, extraordinary speculative developments would manifest themselves as these funds competed for profits?</p></speech>

Let us remember that the reason that the frenetic innovation was taking place was that interest rates were so low that many investors in order for them to be able to offer a reasonable return had to do something different.  The reason that interest rates were so low was that essentially one had a great deal of global saving being released out of Asia.  The money coming out of Asia was concentrated on low risk products.  They were not interested in taking global risk.  The low risk end of the market became not very attractive for everybody else because there was so much demand for low risk products from Asia.  All of these new types of products were being driven by a "search for yield".  How in this environment can investment make a bit extra?  The ideal is to find something that makes a bit extra but looks safe.  This is the reason for securitisations - trying to come up with AAA, which was not safe.</p> <p>  With regard to billionaires, the first point is that there are different types of billionaires in the world.  Some are probably contributing to the global savings glut.  Remember that a great many billionaires are essentially aggressive risk takers.  They also borrow a lot.  They may be quite rich but they would be part of the risk-taking side.</p></speech>

In the 1970s by common consent we had a massive increase in petrodollars by sheiks and oil tycoons and that led to huge lending in the developing world which in turn led to an incredible debt crisis in Africa and Latin America, causing significant suffering of course for millions of people.  Does Professor Lane see a similarity between that and what developed up to the crash in the mid-1990s?</p></speech>

When one has a big shock in the world, whether it is the big increase in oil prices in the mid-1970s or the entry of China into the global economic system, that can give rise to large asymmetry.  Some parts of the world want to be a net lender but where does that money end up?  What is the role of the international financial system in funnelling that money to end users and from the point of view of the end user, just because somebody wants to throw a lot of money at one, is one wise to take it?  One has to consider whether those contracts are fair.  There was hope in the 2000s because so much of the funding was not sitting on bank balance sheets.  In the 1980s various US banks were in trouble because they had lent so much money to Latin America, whereas by and large in the 2000s there was not so much bank lending as securitised bonds and so on.  The hope was that the risk would be spread across many investors.  Of course, in the end it did not turn out like that.</p></speech>

He states, "Alternative investment products that offered the promise of higher returns also grew rapidly (hedge funds, private equity), with these entities taking on high debt loads in view of the low interest rate environment and the high risk tolerance on the part of investors."  Was all of this developing into a situation where what might be seen as investment in staid entities, these funds were chasing higher yields by taking higher risks?</p></speech>

That is very much part of the same general dynamic when interest rates are so low that if one wants to make a bit extra what can one do?  One can take on more risk explicitly and I think those hedge funds and private equity funds would say that they are good at working in risky environment.  Even more damaging was where the risk was hidden, where mortgages got chopped up into safe and less safe components.  When what looked safe was not safe, there was mispricing of risk.</p></speech>

Oxfam stated that the 80 richest people owned about 48% of world wealth in 2007, when the crash happened.  Oxfam states that since 1990 income from labour has made up a declining share of gross domestic product across low, middle and high income countries.  It states, "Around the world, ordinary workers are taking home an ever-dwindling slice of the pie, while those at the top take more and more."  With that increasing share to profit, interest and rent and less for working people, does Professor Lane see that as a background to working people being forced to borrow more to buy the products that they could not afford from their ordinary wages and then on the other hand these funds that we have been talking about lending to them to try to boost their profits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#T00900"><p>I think that is a really important part of what went on.  That is one consequence of the decline in the labour share.  One of the puzzles since the late 1990s is that profits have been relatively high but firms have not invested so much.  Increasingly firms sit on a great deal of cash.  Like the Asian sovereigns, the corporations typically do not want to take on investment risk.  They put the cash on deposit or they buy short-term net products.</p><p>So it is another source of cash looking for safety and, in turn, driving down the risk-free rate and encouraging the search for yield.  On the other side of that is the fact that labour incomes in many countries were stagnating.  I am less familiar with studies that have been carried out in Europe.  In the US, however, the high increase in household debt was, at least in part, being driven by the stagnation of wages.  That definitely is a part of what went on.</p></speech>

Why were countless billions of euro and dollars cascading around the financial markets in this way and why were so many exotic products developed?  Why was the money in question not invested in manufacturing, for example, particularly in view of the fact that 25 million people in the European Union were unemployed?  Why were billions poured into property speculation in Ireland at a time when, by common consent, broadband infrastructure and water infrastructure were in desperate need of investment?</p></speech>

Investment rates, in terms of the real or productive economy, have been low in Asia and in the advanced economies.  Some of the stories people tell essentially revolve around competition.  With the rise of new competitors from the emerging world, it is not super-clear what is the right investment strategy for many corporations.  In addition, many activities need less by way of investment because of IT developments.  In the context of cloud computing, for example, the cost of establishing a new IT company is a lot less than used to be the case because it is possible to rent storage space in the cloud and so on.  There are many different stories with regard to why investment rates have come down.  I agree that the fact so much was invested in property reflects some kind of distortion in how the world economy works.</p></speech>

Against the background of the credit explosion, speculation and deregulation internationally, was it inevitable that the regulatory system was going to collapse?  In an article which appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>in 2005, it was claimed that Ireland had become known as the wild west of European finance.  Is Professor Lane of the view that there was truth to this claim?</p><p>I apologise to Professor Lane for cramming in my final question at this point but time is against me.  A debt equating to 100% of gross domestic product has been placed around the necks of the Irish people.  Ordinary citizens would like to know where the many billions of euro that were moving around during the property bubble ended up.  We know that some of this money was paid out in the form of wages, etc.  However, what happened to the massive amounts that were paid for land and the huge profits that were made?  The Irish people are in an extremely indebted position as a result of political and economic decisions which were made, but which we are not allowed to discuss just now, and austerity policies that were put in place.</p></speech>

There was a regulatory choice.  It is important to say that there are these kinds of global factors, but policies still make a great deal of difference.  You can see that some countries around the world have mechanisms which did protect their banking systems.  There is nothing inevitable about the regulator getting caught up in it.  In the Irish case, it is very important to distinguish between the regulation of the local banking system versus the regulation of the IFSC.  If you like, the regulation of the IFSC is also part of a global issue relating to international finance versus national systems.  Essentially, there is a lot of global effort along the lines of: "How can I structure my global portfolio to avoid regulatory intrusion?  I will set up a contract which runs through the Cayman Islands, which lands in Ireland for a bit, which goes on to Switzerland and so on".  We know the world needs to deal with offshore finance and Ireland is part of the debate with regard to what is the role of offshore centres of different types in the global system.</p> <p>  On the last question of who are the net losers and winners from this, it would be an important project to generate a full answer.  Part of it was waste.  We do have a great deal of wasted capital in the context of all of the effort to build houses where no one wanted them and so on.  Part of it is that the money just went down the drain in terms of waste.  We pay for things which are useless.  Let me go back to the issue of who was involved in 2007 and where are they now.  Of course, the way the system was, a lot of these debt contracts were paid off.  Essentially, we replaced the banking liabilities with sovereign liabilities through recapitalising Anglo and so on.  The question, of course, is whether we could have managed an alternative way to resolve that or whether we could have managed to place more of the losses on foreign investors.  This inquiry will address that matter with different layers of analysis in the coming months.  I think that, yes, more could have been put onto foreign investors in different ways but it is equally not so clear that there is any easy answer.  I hope this inquiry can reveal what were plausible alternative possibilities.</p></speech>

The first relates to the growing sophistication, complication and diversification of the range of products available within the financial services sector.  Did the availability of such products have an impact on the regulatory framework that was in place and increase the pressure on it?</p></speech>

The IFSC is involved with all sorts of sophisticated financial products but that is pretty much quite separate to the regulation of local banks.  All the narratives would state that what when on with the local banks was plain vanilla and involved regular property lending.  They were not getting into trouble because of-----</p></speech>

Will he explain what constitutes securitisation and indicate how banks develop and sell securitised products?  What was the rate in Ireland compared with the US in this regard?  Was it lower or higher and what was the level of concentration in the area of commercial property?  If there had been more or less of this, would it have had a positive or more negative impact on Ireland?  Will Professor Lane first outline what securitisation involves?</p></speech>

Those loans would be a source of income because they would receive the interest payments from the debtor.  That is how a bank would earn income.  However, an alternative strategy came to be developed as follows.  Let us say I have 10,000 mortgages.  I will write a contract which says that I will issue a bond where the pooled income from those mortgages will form the basis for making the interest payments on that bond.  If you issue that bond, you no longer worry about those 10,000 mortgages because-----</p></speech>

In most cases there is a residual element because you want the bank to remain interested in those loans.</p><p>However, if a lot of the risk is transferred to the bond investors, the bank can then release funding and look for new opportunities.</p><p> There was a certain amount of issuance of mortgage-backed securities by the Irish banks, but I do not think it was a massive part of what was going on.  It was more the case that the global banks - the massive international banks - were moving away from direct lending to buying bonds.  Sometimes the bonds were backed by US securities but, quite often, all they would need was a good rating.  Irish banks were pretty highly rated so they could buy A-rated bonds, and they might have bought a B-rated bond at more risk.  Essentially, the global banks were moving from making direct loans to being bond investors.</p></speech>

Given all the changes that occurred in the world, or global financial system, over the 1990s and into the 2000s, were bankers reckless, opportunistic or greedy, or was it just good business to take the chances that were taken?</p></speech>

From reading the three reports, the Nyberg, Honohan and Regling-Watson reports, one would see examples of where it seemed to make sense to the bankers.  They bought the narrative that the world was safer than it used to be.  There had not been too many recessions in the preceding decades.  Where there was a recession, it was pretty brief.  None lasted more than a few months.  Even with the currency crisis of 1990 to 1993, recovery from it was reasonably rapid.  An individual bankers might have misperceived the collective risk.  This is why I am going back to the role of the regulator.  Each individual bank might think what it is doing is acceptable but when they are all making the same decisions, one gets a systemic problem.  If they are all lending into property and to the same guys and if they are all lending to particular models, then the collective system becomes too risky.  The only entity that has the collective view is the regulator.  Ultimately, if banks are reckless and so on, so be it, but essentially they can be constrained by regulatory intervention.</p></speech>

In light of the existence of global banking corporations, and the fact that banks are bigger and do more than they used to do 100 years ago, is there now an imbalance of power between a central bank and the banking corporations, the centres of profit?  Is that a serious problem for any country, particularly Ireland?</p></speech>

That would imply regulators did the best they could and yet it was not enough.  The situation here is that regulation was not done to the degree necessary.  They could have adopted alternatives, as we are seeing this week with the debate about low loan-to-value ratios and other restrictions.  Of course, all of that would have been very difficult politically.  Can you imagine in 2004 or 2005 a central bank coming in big-time to say, "This has gone on too long and has gone too far and we are really going to stamp this out"?</p></speech>

It was true, and is still true, that the Central Bank operates within a wider system.  This is why it is independent.  One gives it the independence and one delegates saying: "You are free to do that; it is under your authority."  It did have that independence.  I would say it is reasonable for the political system to delegate decisions to the regulator.  In the end, it is with the regulator.</p></speech>

On a number of occasions, he has stated a question might be better answered by other witnesses coming before the committee.  There was a paper presented to this committee and I encourage members to address that in their questioning.</p></speech>

He says that on page 6.  Mr. Klaus Regling and Mr. Max Watson report that by 2005, according to the OECD, the cost of tax expenditure had become larger than the remaining income tax receipts.  It appears to be extraordinary that the cost of tax expenditure was larger than the remaining income tax receipts.  There is obviously a big imbalance.  What was going on that had us arrive at a point where those reforms were such that the property boom was not being countered in the way Professor Lane suggests it could have happened?</p></speech>

It is a fact that there were many tax breaks and allowances.  Again, it is not just at the level of the developer.  The fact is that mortgage interest relief and other tax breaks existed.  Perhaps a more generous interpretation is that some of the tax breaks might have made sense at a particular time, but the fact that they were prolonged and not eliminated must be borne in mind.  Around the world, that is an issue.  Historically, tax breaks, even when temporary, tend to get rolled over and are continued.  Perhaps having a system with a much tougher approach to the renewal of tax breaks could have been part of what could have happened.</p></speech>

Clearly, financial products have changed over the years.  I believe Professor Lane said they become more "innovative".  Equally, offshore banking and that whole system has become more innovative.  Is there any evidence that financial institutions themselves used those offshore centres to funnel their own profit away and, therefore, leave a worst-case scenario for the taxpayer to address?</p></speech>

In the Irish case, I would not say so.  Globally, there may be elements of that.  An interesting point is that when Ireland unified the tax rate for corporations, the tax rate on banks came down as part of the overall reduction in tax rates for corporations.  That element may also be part of the wider story here.</p></speech>

I wrote a paper in 2007 and a couple of co-ed pieces, which said the economy was slowing down and we needed to have an adjustment to our fiscal strategy.  I had another meeting with Brian Lenihan around that time and I also met him in mid-September 2008 to talk about the fiscal situation.  In January 2009, Professor Honohan and I met him again.  There was no agenda and the meetings involved very casual conversations.</p><p> In 2010 I wrote a report for an Oireachtas committee on the fiscal framework, how to set up a fiscal council and fiscal rules.  In that structured way I was involved in that element, but apart from that the answer is "No".</p></speech>

Senator O'Keeffe and Deputy Higgins posed the question earlier of why such investment was directed towards property when he was talking about the amount of money invested in the country.  In his answer to Senator O'Keeffe, Professor Lane touched on tax incentives in the property sector.  At what stage does he believe those incentives ceased to have a positive impact?  Were they ever required, in terms of boosting activity in property development?</p></speech>

I do not know whether they had a dominant role to play.  At a micro level, there is the question of why the property boom was more intense in some regions and districts than others.  In other words, in terms of the geography of where investment took place, the incentives, I am sure, had a bigger effect in terms of the overall picture.  From the reports written, we know property booms have happened time and again.  It is a classic boom-and-bust cycle that can take place.  There is no great mystery about the dynamics of property booms.  Professor Honohan used the phrase, "A plain vanilla boom-bust cycle", and that is what we had.  To return to tax incentives, my guess is that they probably had more effect in terms of what particular locations were affected rather than the overall scale.</p></speech>

The term "groupthink" is often used regarding politicians, the media, bankers, property developers, and what went on in Ireland in the lead-up to the banking crisis.  Was Professor Lane's profession part of the groupthink that went on?</p></speech>

Globally, there was insufficient weight put on the downside risks of financial innovation.  The benefits were overstated and the costs understated.  The Deputy mentioned fiscal policy, but there are more general issues such as the credit boom, the housing boom and so on.  I would have said there is probably a fairly generic consensus that fiscal policy was too loose.  Going back to the mid 1990s, people would have said that if a country was going into a monetary union, fiscal policy would need to be a lot more prudent.</p> <p>  I have a lot of sympathy for the political system.  Once one goes into surplus, going from a small surplus to 5% or 6% will be very difficult to do.  That is why having institutional reforms, such as a rainy day fund, might have helped.  Insufficient attention was paid to the rise of stamp duty and capital gains tax.</p> <p>  On the wider issue of the credit boom, the house price boom and so on, individuals such as Professor Morgan Kelly, David McWilliams, Alan Ahearne and various people in the media who contributed-----</p></speech>

It comes back to the regulator.  The data we see as academics come with a lag.  The unfortunate thing about the crisis was that the boom was relatively short.  My broad narrative is that in 2002 and 2003, the start of it could have been tolerated.  In 2004, things were maybe still okay.  The question is when in 2005, which is the key year, does one call stop?  There is a mix.  People started talking about this in 2006.  Even if the credit boom was towards its peak, there was a lot of time in 2006 and 2007 to say we were in trouble and to ask how we could get out of it at the least cost.</p></speech>

He mentioned it was not a major part of what went on.  I want him to elaborate on that, with particular attention to the Central Bank's bulletin in July 2011, when it indicated that at the end of 2007, 12% of mortgages were securitised and were off balance sheet, and this accounted for &euro;17 billion in loans which had moved off the balance sheets of the larger credit institutions.  Time and again in the documents presented to us by Professor Lane, the point is emphasised that it was obvious there was a slowdown in the property market and issues in terms of bank funding.  What was the reason behind the fact we had 12% of our mortgage book off balance sheet?  What role would that have played?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.341" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#W01300"><p>That sounds about right.  It is important, but not massive in terms of the overall balance sheet.  In terms of the bond market and the way the banks were issuing bonds in the mid 2000s, they were doing all sorts of things.  There were dollar, sterling, senior and subordinated bonds.  This may go beyond the scope of what members can do in this inquiry, given the amount of time they have.</p> <p>  The treasurers of the banks, in terms of the mechanics in a given period, may have chosen to do a mortgage-backed security issuance or a straightforward unsecured bond.  They, in turn, would have been interacting with the global banks who would have been the advisers and would have outlined the cheapest ways to raise funding in a month or year.  Others can answer questions better than I can on that level of mechanical detail on how banks design and raise funding.  Broadly speaking, one category in which people were interested was asset-backed securities.  There are many different elements to how banks raise funding.  Did the Deputy's information refer to the covered banks or did it also include what went on with Ulster Bank and so on?</p></speech>

It is not a case of mortgage securitisation because some of them remained on the balance sheet.</p></speech>

That is fine.  I am mindful that I am limited in terms of time.  In the opening statement Professor Lane presented to the inquiry he stated: "it is possible that the lack of precedents and the untested nature of the ELA framework ... may have deterred the Central Bank ... from deploying ELA to buy some time in managing the severe liquidity squeeze on Anglo Irish Bank".  Is that his assumption and opinion or is this based on any conversations he had with anybody who may be involved?</p></speech>

There may be a couple of lines in the Honohan report to this effect as well, that they were reluctant to pursue it.  As someone said earlier, the fact that emergency liquidity assistance was used big-time later on reveals that if one makes the case for it, it can happen.  I do not know the individuals involved.  In the euro system, the ECB is the central bank for all member countries.  We could ask if our national Central Bank had been able to step in at that time, what would we have done?  If there had been a funding problem at home, the national Central Bank would have stepped in and provided substantial liquidity to the local banks, but a national central bank cannot provide foreign currency liquidity.  To the extent that these were funding from overseas, there would have been a problem.</p></speech>

In this regard I reference Fortis Bank, which was rescued by three European member states, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.  On 26 September 2008, Fortis Bank was offered &euro;5.4 billion in a marginal lending facility which had to be approved by the ECB governing council.  On the morning of 29 September, the ELA was formally sanctioned for that bank and by 3 October, a number of days later, it rose to &euro;51 billion.  The reason I ask about this, and it was mentioned by Professor Lane and others, is that this was not unique.  In terms of the ELA, it was not only provided by Belgium, it was provided by-----</p></speech>

I am pretty sure they did, but there is the issue of under what circumstances ELA is appropriate. The traditional view of ELA was that it was something extremely temporary and also one had to be assured of solvency.  One had to be assured that the bank was solvent.</p></speech>

If we think about the evolution of sovereigns spread in 2009 and so on, it is only in 2010 that the sovereign bank loop got much more intense.

I would not agree with that statement because the fact is that the banks themselves are either solvent or insolvent.  That is not determined by the Irish Government standing behind them.  That is determined by the balance sheets of the banks.  Was there a duty of care on the part of the ECB to ensure that if it was extending ELA funding through the Irish Central Bank, Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society, in particular, were solvent at the time?</p></speech>

Relative to GDP, the scale of insolvency at that point was maybe within what the Irish Government felt it could handle in a worst-case scenario, but of course those estimates were way off once the property prices and GDP cratered in the rest of 2008 and throughout 2009.

Is it a fact that the ECB was sending funding directly to the banks?  It was not extending funding to the Irish Government, but to the banks.  Was there not a duty of care on the ECB?  As Professor Lane is probably well aware, ELA funding cannot be extended if the banks are insolvent.</p></speech>

The italicised part of his paper on page 8 reads: "The capacity of the euro area to respond to such a financial crisis is as yet untested."  He warned of that in 2006.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

As he knows, people like Professor Barry Eichengreen saw the euro as being designed for France, Germany and some northern European countries.  He actually said that he was quite surprised that "Ireland, Spain, and other countries at the periphery of the European Union were among the founding members of the euro area".  In the scenario that Professor Lane draws, his final remark at the end of page 12 reads: "A central bank that is not bound by a fixed exchange rate commitment can forestall such unnecessary crises by acting as a 'lender of last resort'."  Was it a problem in September 2008 that there were design faults in the euro, that we had not really thought out the consequences of membership and that, reverting to Deputy O'Donnell's question on ELA, we were totally unprepared because we had not worked out the implications, as Professor Lane warned in 2006 and other economists warned when we joined the euro?</p></speech>

One is, if we had our own national Central Bank, that could have made it easier to deal with local funding because the Irish Central Bank could have printed as many Irish pounds as it had wanted, but it could not print dollars, sterling or whatever.  If we had the same kind of credit boom that included a lot of foreign funding, that foreign funding would have been in foreign currency.  In the same way that Iceland could not stabilise its banks in terms of its foreign funding and in the same way as in emerging market crises, when one has foreign currency debt, the fact that one has a local central bank does not get one that far.  There is a mix.  The general issue is "Yes".</p> <p>  Also in my report, I pointed out that, in the 1990s, we had the Scandinavian banking crisis, we had the east Asian crisis, we had the Mexican crisis and we had the Russian crisis.  Going into the euro, there had been all sorts of financial crisis in recent history, in part reflecting the fear that, with more and more cross-border finance, maybe more accidents would happen.  There is a history of the euro by Professor Harold James, about the committee meetings in the 1980s and 1990s up to the point of the euro.  The fact that those committee meetings decided not to deal with having a common crisis mechanism was a euro system design flaw.  The fact that the euro system did not have a crisis mechanism meant that, from word go, the responsibility was at home.  If there was not a European crisis mechanism, we needed a national level crisis mechanism, a rainy day fund and so on.  There was also a question of under what conditions we could use ELA.  That is a question to engage on with the regulator.</p></speech>

It is the case that it had a tougher level of regulation.  The fact that one can find plenty of examples where there was no banking crisis says that it was not just down to global factors.  It was, in that sense, avoidable.  That is absolutely true.  Learning about good ways to regulate and what risks not to take is definitely a good idea.</p></speech>

One might say all these fancy regulations are secondary to, first, making sure the banks have enough capital and, second, making sure they do not borrow too much.  Simple rules can go a long way.</p></speech>

Your point is essentially that because we moved from a taxation base that was pro-cyclical &ndash; I think Mr. Regling&rsquo;s report refers to going from 12% to 30% - that money should have been ring-fenced for a rainy day fund, for future difficulties.</p></speech>

In one of your papers you stated that underneath it all there was a structural deficit.  Mr. Regling said this morning that we are still not good at working out that structural imbalance under the economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.427" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#Z00500"><p>There are different levels.  There is one which is abstract but core to the fiscal compact, that is a question of whether GDP is at potential.  For most of what is called a structural balance it is a question of where in the GDP cycle we are.  There is also the concept of the financial cycle, when credit is growing quickly and construction activity is very high.  That is so visible and obvious in the Irish data it is not a small issue of whether Ireland can grow at 3% or 4%.  When capital gains tax, stamp duty and so on grow at such a rapid rate under no circumstances could one say those revenues will be there every year forever.  If they will not be there every year forever one could say these are windfall revenues.  One saves a windfall for the rainy day, one does not ramp up current spending or make tax cuts to get rid of it.  In the scale of the revenue boom we had at that time it would have been possible to come up with fairly simple decision criteria that would have allocated a fair chunk of revenue to a rainy day fund.</p></speech>

There are ways to get around that.</p></speech>

It was to deal with the increase in pension commitments that we will face after 2025.  In line with that long-term goal, the portfolio was extremely equity focused.  It was not liquid and we had to sell so much of these equities at the bottom of the market.  The fact that our crisis happened at the same time as the global financial crisis meant we had to liquidate a lot of the assets in the fund to recapitalise the banks.  If we look back at what happened to those equity shares since then it was very badly timed.</p></speech>

A lot of countries such as Chile have several stabilisation funds to cope with the long term, the cycle and so on.  One can have a long-term fund to deal with these long-term aging issues and a cyclical fund to deal with the rainy day.</p></speech>

The fact of that funding being available was important to limit the amount we needed to borrow from the rest of the world.  In accounting for the crisis it is important to keep in mind that its impact is not just the increase in debt but the fact that we had to run down that fund.  That should be definitely included in the overall financial cost.  The rainy day fund would have existed on top of that.</p></speech>

There are lots of committees so the Irish Central Bank staff had many more duties at a euro area level because there would have been all sorts of committees where each member country would have been sending staff.  The level of activity probably went up.  It is true to say that it is more orientated towards euro area policies and not so much the local issue.</p></speech>

The issue was the reluctance to make big decisions.  Their analysis might have shown that risks were going up in the mid-2000s but they were too slow and too reluctant.  They made some decisions.  There was an increase in the capital charge on high loan to value mortgages and so on but it was not sufficient.  I do not think it was an analytical issue of not understanding what was going on, it was basically a question of whether they were prepared to pull the trigger to cool it down.</p></speech>

I am going to clarify it now.  Professor Lane, you are saying it was not on auto pilot but certainly the focus for the Central Bank, which was busier because of the all the new committees in which it had to participate, was on serving the ECB mission rather than on the national one.  Would it be fair to say that?</p></speech>

The issue is moving from diagnosis towards action so the big issue is why they did not decide to be more interventionist to manage those risks by restricting credit growth through various mechanisms.</p></speech>

They do not talk about how the interest rate will affect Ireland or they do not talk about how the interest rate will affect France because they are there to set the policy for the euro area.</p><p> When it comes to financial stability issues, when essentially one has national financial systems, then the Governor would have the role of explaining to the euro council - the governing council - "Here's what's going on."  The Governor is appointed by the Irish Government.  So I would be fairly sure they would, within the rules of the euro system, advocate as far as possible what is in the national interest of Ireland, subject to the rules of the euro system.</p><p> On the question of lobbying, should the rules of the euro system be different?  That is more indirect through the political systems of Europe about what the mandate of the ECB should be.</p></speech>

The previous witness used the word "incomplete".  Professor Lane referred to the youth of the EMU and that, in his words, it had known only  good times.  In many ways the Irish people were the guinea pigs as the bigger European players minimised their losses while trying to come up the curve in the context of the international financial crisis.</p></speech>

I think even on Monday at the conference here in Dublin Beno&igrave;t C&oelig;ur&eacute; spoke about it; essentially attitudes have evolved over time.  The diagnosis of the financial crisis has evolved over time.  In the report I stated that essentially financial stability is really a common responsibility.  To the extent of the common responsibility, it is deeply unfortunate that essentially so much happened at a national level.  The fact that the guarantee was issued at a national level without, it looks like, too much negotiation in advance with the rest of Europe-----</p></speech>

When it comes to the unguaranteed bonds in 2010, it seems clear that if the euro system decides they do not want bondholders to be burnt, then that should be paid for at a European level; it should not fall on an individual country to protect the financial stability of Europe.  However, essentially the mechanisms were not in place at that time to deliver on that.</p></speech>

Essentially too much capital flows through banks which therefore puts depositors at risk and therefore puts governments at risk in order to protect depositors, whereas if one has much more funding going through capital markets essentially it is much more transparent about who bears the risk.  It protects, basically, regular savers, who deal with regular banks, from risk.  I think it is a positive for Ireland.  If there is an alternative for banks, there is more by way of bond markets and more by way of equity funding - all of those things which have been traditionally limited are possible at a European scale with commitment to make that happen.  I think that is important for the future of Europe.</p> <p>  Part of the tragedy of what has happened is Europe was too dependent on banks and therefore there has been basically so much effort to save the banks and that has been so expensive.</p></speech>

I have a few questions on the role of the euro and monetary union which he addressed in some detail in his paper.  In the round considering the factors that led to the crisis and then the management of the crisis within the confines of monetary union, would Ireland have been better or worse to have been out of the euro?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.463" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015012100002#AA01000"><p>I do not think there is a single answer on that.  The way I phrased it in the report - I think in the opening statement - is outside the euro the crisis would have been different.  One would have had, I think, a deeper crisis initially because the currency would have collapsed in value.  There would have been very large increases in interest rates because to protect the currency interest rates would have gone up.  What would have been the consequences?  One would have had a lot of bankruptcies just as, say, in Iceland one saw the banks going bankrupt.  So in part there is a benefit to that because the foreign creditors would have taken a hit.  So some of the losses would have been transferred outward.</p> <p>  On the other hand there would have been a lot of financial distress here.  With devaluation there is a big distributional effect because with import prices going up, consumers would have taken a big hit initially.  On the other hand with the weaker currency maybe after two or three years, recovery would have kicked in more quickly.  So one has a very unstable short term, but maybe a faster recovery.  On the weighting of stability versus other factors, people will have different opinions.  It is an interesting-----</p></speech>

My view is that the risk factors could have been managed through a financial regulator that is more proactive and through a fiscal policy that basically put more aside for the rainy day.</p> <p>  On the euro for Europe, can the Deputy imagine the history of Europe for the past 15 years with 19 more currencies or 18 more currencies - whatever the number is today?  During the 1992-93 currency crisis we all had individual currencies.  There was a reason the euro was created in the sense that there were a lot of inefficiencies and problems with having a set of independent currencies.  So I suppose my view is the euro could have worked and can be made to work so long as the rest of the policy set-up is in line with that.</p></speech>

Have we matured as a country and dealt with the apparent conflict between fiscal prudence and winning elections?  What is his view on the journey through which we have come and how we now regard fiscal management?  Have we taken the right steps or is there still a risk on that front?</p></speech>

Let us imagine we are back in a boom situation and revenues are high, essentially the purpose of the fiscal rules and the fiscal council is to increase the political cost of excessive generosity.  So now, if one likes, it is a restraint.  I think those restraints are not fool proof.</p> <p>  If a government really wants to ignore the fiscal council and ignore the fiscal rules, it probably can get away with that for quite a bit.  It depends on the political system buying into that rules-based framework.  That is for the members, as politicians, to work out.  It is that kind of framework where they are constrained in what they can do.  It is important to say that across the world there is an understanding that essentially this does not end the political debate because one can have a high-spending government yet still running surpluses if it is prepared to raise taxation.</p><p>It is not about how much a country should spend or how much it should tax.  It is saying that if it spends a lot over a cycle, it needs to raise enough revenue to match that.</p></speech>

Professor Lane spoke earlier about the issue of a central credit register and the fact that one was lacking.  First, if we had had a central credit register what role could it have played in terms of improving the bank's ability to make proper lending decisions and also protecting borrowers in cases during the period when losses were being built up in the system?  Second, does it surprise Professor Lane that six years out from the epicentre of the crisis we still do not have a central credit register?</p></speech>

It does seem as if individual banks had incomplete information.  At least some of the decisions they were making were on the basis of not having the full picture of the debts of individual borrowers, and we have seen that in some cases.  It is important that the credit register is in place before the credit situation normalises.  When there was very little lending for the past six years perhaps it was not the first order of business but as the banking system normalises, having that in place will be important.</p></speech>

Could he rank for us in order some of those policy instruments that would have actually reduced the risk?</p></speech>

The second is fiscal policy.  It is important that there were surpluses, and it is important to state that public debt did come down but the fiscal mindset was not sufficiently altered by Economic and Monetary Union, EMU, membership.  If we had been running a fiscal surplus of 5% or 6% in the mid-2000s, that would have enabled us to absorb the hit of the crisis much easier.</p> <p>  The other element is in terms of crisis management.  A more narrow guarantee and an earlier shutting down of Anglo Irish Bank would have helped to narrow the losses.  On that I do not have anything different to say from what Professor Patrick Honohan said.</p></speech>

The topic for discussion is the impact of social protection payments on income distribution.<br />Before we commence, for the information of our guests, I must read a note on privilege, although many of them will probably be familiar with it.  I draw to their attention that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that I have just outlined.<br />At the request of the broadcasting services, everybody, including myself, must, for the duration of the meeting, turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight or safe mode, as otherwise they will interfere with the broadcasting equipment.  I am switching my mobile phone to flight mode and I ask that everybody does the same.<br />The topic of today's meeting relates to the issue of social protection payments and their impact on income distribution.  The purpose of social transfers, which is an issue our committee would examine as part of our brief, is to alleviate poverty, support well-being and reduce inequalities in society by redistributing income.  We know from many studies that the level of personal household income has a major bearing on issues related to people's health, welfare and opportunities that are available to individuals and, in particular, to children.  Another very current issue is that income equality in itself is an objective for society because there is considerable evidence that societies with more income equality do better in many respects, including life expectancy.  Considerable analysis on that has been done during the course of the recession.  Many studies have been done on the issue of income distribution and the impact of budgetary measures on that, including social protection. We are having this meeting to examine that issue further.<br />Our committee has been examining the issue of equality budgeting.  Since this committee was established a few years ago, we started to examine the issue of equality budgeting in the context of when we had our pre-budget hearing.  We have had the Think-tank for Action and Social Change, TASC and Social Justice Ireland in previously on that matter.  I, a few other members, including Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, and the Clerk to the Committee went to Scotland to examine how they do equality budgeting there.  They do it in the sense of taking account of the grounds for discrimination, which includes gender, disabilities and so on, but we have also examined it in terms of income inequality and equality.  This is an ongoing topic that the committee has been examining.<br />To assist the committee on this we have with us delegates from the Economic and Social Research Institution, ESRI, which is represented by Professor Tim Callan and Professor Dorothy Watson, and from TASC, which is represented by Mr. Cormac Staunton.  We also have Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir and Mr. Cormac O'Sullivan from PublicPolicy.ie, while Professor John FitzGerald is here in his own personal capacity.  To commence the discussion, I invite Professor Callan to make his presentation.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for the introduction.  I will talk briefly about a piece of research we did at the ESRI where we looked at the impact of social transfers on poverty.  In contrast to what my colleague, Professor Tim Callan, will talk about, the focus of this research was on the very bottom of the income distribution and the significance of social transfers in alleviating income poverty.  Therefore, the focus was very specific.  The research focused on the period from 2004 to 2011.  Therefore, it covered a period of economic well-being, economic growth and also the period at the beginning of the recession.  I will summarise the findings under four headings: looking at changes in the significance of social transfer income for households, changes in the effectiveness of social transfers in reducing income poverty, variations in this respect across life cycle groups, and how Ireland in the period compared with other European countries.  To give an indication of what is covered by the term "social transfers", it includes the State means-tested and non-means-tested social welfare payments, and it also includes child benefit and pensions, whether those pensions are from the State or from an occupational pension scheme.</p>  <p>  Looking at changes in the significance of social transfers, as we might expect as a result of the recession, social transfers became much more important as a component of household income over the period.</p> <p>In 2004 for instance, on average 20% of household income came from social transfers, but by 2011 that had increased by 50% up to 30%.  There was a huge increase in the significance of social transfers.  If one looks at households in receipt of social transfers, because we are including child benefit and pensions, a very high percentage of households receive some social transfer income.  It was already very high in 2005 but it increased from 85% to 87% in 2011.  There was a more significant change in the average amount of social transfer income received by those households.  It went from an average of &euro;233 per week in 2004 to &euro;327 per week in 2011, and that is in 2011 prices.  Part of the increase was due to increasing rates of payment of social transfer payments up until 2009, and of course also, more important, an increase in the proportion of people who were receiving payments such as unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit once the recession started.</p> <p> How effective were social transfers in reducing poverty?  When we talk about poverty reduction effectiveness there are a couple of different ways to measure it, but one of the best measures is to look at how much of a gap there is between the poverty threshold - the level of income a household would need not to be considered income poor - and the income the household gets from non-social transfer sources, from market sources such as work, interest in dividends and so on.  We call that gap the poverty gap.  A measure of the effectiveness of social transfers is to ask what percentage of the average poverty gap do the social transfers bridge or close.  In 2012 for instance, the poverty threshold of a household with two adults and two children would have been &euro;473 per week, and if the family had &euro;300 per week from work the poverty gap would be &euro;173.  We ask how much of the gap is bridged by social transfers.</p> <p> Looking at the population as a whole, the reduction in the poverty gap was 84% in 2004 and increased to 88% by 2011.  There was an improvement in the extent to which social transfers bridged the income poverty gap in the period.  There are a variety of reasons for that but I will not go into them now.  I can address them later if people would like.</p> <p> Looking at different life cycle groups, what we see is that the poverty reduction effectiveness ranges from 84% for working age adults to 95% for retirement age adults.  The system is very effective at reducing poverty for adults of retirement age.  Part of the reason is that they are very dependent on social transfers and they are less likely to have income from work.  Another factor is that we are including the non-means tested pensions as well as occupational pensions in what we consider to be social transfers.  The effectiveness for children is somewhere in the middle at about 87%.</p> <p> How does Ireland compare with other European countries in this respect?  Because our social protection system and social system in general places a great deal of emphasis on cash benefits rather than on providing services, when we compare Ireland with other European countries in terms of looking at the impact of cash benefits on poverty reduction, we come out looking pretty good.  In 2005, using the measure of closing the poverty gap, Ireland was about in the middle of the EU 15 countries.  That had improved by 2010, which at that point was the latest year we were able to look at, where Ireland had moved towards the top of the distribution.  In terms of poverty reduction effectiveness, Ireland compared favourably with other European countries.</p> <p> To summarise, the analysis indicated that social transfers in Ireland increased in terms of how effective they were in reducing poverty between 2004 and 2011.  That was mainly due to an increase in social protection spending, because a larger number of people were receiving social protection payments, in particular those related to unemployment.  The effectiveness is particularly high for pensioners.  Ireland compared favourably in that respect with other EU 15 countries.</p></speech>

A detailed paper was circulated and I will speak about some key points.  I am happy to take questions about the details in the paper as well.</p>  <p>  To understand the impact of social protection on the overall distribution of income, we need to understand the distribution of market incomes, that is principally incomes from paid employment but also income from investments and other sources.  This baseline sets the context for how social protection affects the distribution of income.  Immediately we see something striking.  Ireland is the most unequal country in the OECD when it comes to market incomes.  This is measured using a Gini coefficient of pre-tax, pre-social welfare incomes.  The next most unequal countries are Greece, Portugal, Chile and the UK.</p>  <p>  Inequality of market incomes has been growing since the 1970s.  This is not unique to Ireland.  It is part of a global trend that affected most industrial economies, highlighted by the work of Thomas Piketty and others.  In the circulated paper, the distribution of income by tax cases is shown in chart 1 and by adults in chart 2.  From Revenue statistics we know that the top 10% of tax cases in Ireland receive 34% of all income, despite representing only 12% of the adult population.  That is up from 28% in the 1970s.  In terms of the distribution of income, those in the top 1% of tax cases have an average income of &euro;370,000.  The top 10% have an average income of &euro;130,000.  Many of those tax cases relate to couples so the per adult income is lower.  A single person or a married person as one tax case needs an income of &euro;75,000 to be in the top 10% of tax cases.  The incomes at the top compare with an average for the bottom 90% of &euro;27,000.  It is important to understand this underlying inequality because it provides the context in which social protection payments are made.  Taxes and social protection payments mean the net income inequality in Ireland is much lower than gross market income inequality, but as gross income inequality rises over time, the tax and social welfare system has to work increasingly hard to reduce net inequality to the same extent.  It is also important to note that the Gini coefficient is a measure of income inequality, not income distribution or income adequacy.  The Gini coefficient is measured from 100 &ndash; the most unequal &ndash; to zero &ndash; the most equal.</p>  <p>  Taxation alone has a marginal effect on the Gini coefficient, moving it from 56.8 to 53.5, meaning that tax reduces inequality only slightly.  However, social protection payments move the Gini coefficient from 53.5 to 29.9, which is a much greater reduction in inequality.  The reason net income inequality falls significantly in Ireland is because social protection payments provide an income floor.  There are 1.4 million weekly recipients of a social protection payment which means that 40% of adults in Ireland are on low fixed weekly incomes.  More than 900,000 adults of a working age receive a weekly welfare payment.  Only a fifth of social protection spending is on those who are unemployed, with the majority going to those who are retired, to children or to those who cannot work due to disability or care duties.</p>  <p>  Because social protection is paid at subsistence levels, its impact is to swell the numbers of people at the bottom of the income distribution.  In terms of income adequacy, social protection rates are in effect between &euro;8,000 and &euro;12,000 per year per adult compared to an average annual income of approximately &euro;18,000 on the minimum wage or &euro;23,000 for an adult single living wage.  As well as providing subsistence to many people who have had a far lower income without social protection, these payments are vital for the functioning of Ireland&rsquo;s market economy.  The spending by recipients becomes consumption in the market which pays wages and taxes.  If we did not have an income floor, we would have a crisis in many local economies, but because social protection rates are not linked to market forces, such as changes in the cost of living or changes in market incomes, they do not continue to guarantee the same level of subsistence over time nor do they address the underlying root causes of economic inequality.  That is shown by what happened to income inequality since the economic crash.  The Gini coefficient shows that income inequality was lower in 2009.  That was due to the decline in higher incomes after the crash while core social protection payments provided a floor that was largely unchanged.  Since then, however, we have seen evidence that the income distribution is stretching again, leaving people on social protection payments further behind.  Provisional figures from Revenue show that incomes above &euro;100,000 have risen from 2009 to 2013.</p> <p>That indicates a growth in income inequality both before and after welfare payments are accounted for.</p> <p> The distribution of income is one indicator of economic inequality.  There is strong evidence that more equal societies do better on a range of social indicators.  There is also an increasing acceptance among mainstream economists and leading economic institutions such as the IMF and the OECD that more equal economies are more stable and have better long-term growth.  However, understanding the depth of economic inequality in Ireland requires us to examine other factors, including taxes, wealth and public services.  In the coming weeks TASC will be publishing a report that seeks to bring together all of these factors and more, which we hope will provide a fuller understanding of the nature of economic inequality in Ireland.  I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Evidence from the OECD shows that the distribution of income in Ireland before taxes and social transfers is the most unequal in the OECD.  It is, surprisingly, perhaps a little more unequal than that in the United States.<br/>We have the most progressive tax and transfer system in the OECD both absolutely and proportionately.  As a result, the post-tax and transfer system reduces income inequality to around the OECD average.  The countries with the next most progressive systems are Finland and Denmark, though these systems are considerably less progressive than ours.  While the income tax system is highly progressive, the social protection system plays a very important role.<br/>The at risk of poverty rates pre-tax and transfers is 50.3%.  That was in last year's survey of income and living conditions, SILC.  There was one out at 11 o'clock today which I have not had time to read so I am not sure if it has changed much in the past year.  The 50.3% is reduced to 16.5% after taxes and transfers, so it is a dramatic difference.<br/>In the case of the elderly, the State pension is very important, particularly for low income retirees who get 90% of their income from the State pension.  The only source of income for 26% of these is the State pension.  That is why the sustainability of the State pension is a critically important issue.<br/>Much attention is focused on the bottom 10% of the population.  This group has some puzzling features.  Only 60% have medical cards compared with 74% in the third decile, that is, the third group from the bottom, and the recorded expenditure of the bottom decile is 186% of their recorded income.  Their recorded income is less than the<b></b>basic supplementary welfare allowance plus child benefit, where appropriate.  The result is clear.  Those in the bottom decile are not in receipt of basic social welfare benefits.  Possible reasons for this include that they are entitled to benefits but they are not claiming them; they are not entitled to benefits because while their income is low, they fail the means test due to their holdings of assets; they are self-employed and making very low incomes or losses during the survey period; or they are in full-time education.<br/>One of the disturbing features in Ireland is the very high proportion of workless households.  This refers to households where the adults aged up to 59 work less than 20% of their total work potential during the past year.  Almost one in four Irish households, or 23.4%, are in this category.  That is by far the highest in the EU and is over twice the EU average of 10.7%.  Even in 2008 the number was very high at 13.7%, almost one in seven.  Adults in this category disproportionately have low education, are unskilled, are lone parents or carers or have a disability.  This is a complex issue and we need to increase our understanding of the barriers to work affecting this group if we are to tackle the problem.  I am happy to explore these issues.</p></speech>

Since the crisis hit after 2007, GDP has fallen by about 14% up to 2011, which was the bottom of the crisis, but Government revenue fell by 20%.  In spite of the fall, Government expenditure was up 3%.  The reason for that was welfare payments.  There was a dramatic increase in the expenditure on welfare payments.  It rose by about &euro;5 billion.  If the share of welfare payments had been held unchanged at the 2007 level, there would have been &euro;9.5 billion less expenditure.  If we consider that &euro;30 billion is roughly the cuts and tax increases we have had, one third of that has gone to fund a dramatic increase in expenditure on welfare over the crisis period.  By contrast, only 5% has gone to fund the interest on the bank debt.</p>  <p>  Looking across the European Union, in the crisis countries there has been a significant increase over the same period in the percentage of GDP going on transfers, but Ireland stands out as having a much bigger increase.  By contrast with, say, Greece or Spain, there was a much bigger increase in unemployment.  Therefore, that tallies with the Irish data.</p>  <p>  With regard to what happened to the income distribution, one of the problems in terms of tax revenue was that there was a wipeout of people on very high incomes, for example, in excess of &euro;275,000.  Their number was down 28%.  Their average income was down 15% and their total income in that category was down 40%.  The effect of this was that whereas previously a great deal of our tax revenue came from people on a very high income, their income fell.  Therefore, the difference had to be made up by people on incomes below &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  I will not revisit what Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir has said on the Gini coefficient.  Everybody has said that before the tax and welfare payments, the market income is fairly uneven.  We have a very uneven distribution of income, but after tax and welfare payments, we have a much more even distribution of income, and after the crisis it is marginally more evenly distributed than before the crisis.  The crisis has been good in that sense for distribution of income.</p>  <p>  To sum up, there has been a big fall in everyone's income because of the crisis.  Successive Governments have allocated a huge increase in funding for welfare - approximately &euro;9.5 billion in terms of the share of GDP - and that has taken up about one third of the cuts.  For those on high incomes, numbers have fallen dramatically and their tax rate has increased, but the amount of income tax coming from that group is substantially down as a result.  That has left more of the burden to be carried by people on incomes below &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  A consequence of the changes has been that without tax and welfare payments, there would have been a big increase in equality but because of the increase in welfare expenditure and taxes, there has been a small fall in inequality.  I have not heard today's figures but I would not expect there is much action in that respect.  That has not been enough to prevent a rise in those at risk of poverty, which Professor Dorothy Watson and my colleagues have talked about.  Unemployment has had a major impact, which public policy and welfare has only partially offset.  When a great number of people lose their jobs and move down to the bottom of the income distribution, even with a big increase in resources for welfare it has not been enough to move them up, as my colleagues have stated.</p>  <p>  While individual policy changes announced in successive budgets, as Professor Tim Callan will talk about, taken together have not been particularly progressive, the overall impact of Government policy on expenditure and taxation of successive Governments has had a progressive impact, reducing inequality and, to some extent, insulating those who lost very heavily in the crisis from the worst effects.</p></speech>

I will skip the first two pages of my presentation and start on page 3.  In terms of the broad picture of what is happening in income distribution, another perspective on this is to examine what has happened to average real incomes, corrected for prices, over the period 2008 to 2012.  The figures in the presentation show that the lowest income group falls by over 25% while the average fall is 14%.  There is also an above average fall for the second and the top income groups.  We have done a rapid update of those numbers since 11 o'clock and they have changed slightly because the share of the bottom income group has risen slightly but it is still a fall of 20% for the bottom income group compared with that 14%.  That is a useful perspective.</p></speech>

That points to something going on in the income distribution which a single number such as the Gini coefficient, which is the most commonly used, cannot capture.</p> <p>The fall at the bottom is disequalising, while an above average fall at the top is an equalising factor  They are washing out in the two and thus one gets a full picture from the income deciles.</p> <p> I compliment Professor Dorothy Watson and Professor John FitzGerald on what they have been saying.  Another point concerns isolating what is going on when comparing income distribution in two years.  Policy effects are coming through on two routes, one of which is the structure of policy such that one can set up a tax system and a welfare system with certain characteristics.  The other is the structure of market income.  Consequently, with a given policy structure - if it is a progressive system as most modern European systems are - as one has more unemployment or more people with very high incomes, they do more work on account of this.  Consequently, when one is comparing figures for two years or two countries, one is simply not comparing systems but an effect that has to do with pre-existing income distribution.  In order to isolate the effect of changes in policy structure, we use a tax benefit model.  SWITCH is the ESRI's model which is very much along the lines of other international models.  When we do this and look at the full picture in the period from 2009 to 2015, we get the graph shown as figure 2 in the submission, where the greatest reduction in income imposed by changes in policy structure is at the top decile and next at the bottom decile.  It is a complex picture in between, but for many groups, the loss in disposable income is close to 10%.  This is quite different from what people sometimes perceive as being the squeezed middle as it is the top and bottom groups that are being squeezed more.  We have not yet had the chance to update the figures since 11 a.m. and will do so as soon as we can, but I would not expect them to shift to a major degree in respect of the policy impact.  This is to explain why what may at first appear to be different answers from different parts of the ESRI and so on are actually answers to different questions.</p></speech>

Economics is not my best point.  It never was and it becomes even more complicated when one hears Professor Callan outline the different outcomes from the different questions being asked.  Does the ESRI's analysis take into account public services in different countries?  Other countries provide public services that Ireland does not, which has an impact on those at the lower end who are obliged to pay for these services.  Similarly, does it take into account increases in the cost of living, the price of fuel and so on and how they have an impact on it?  Does it take in sections of society such as the under-25s?  For example, the other day I met a young lad who was in receipt of social welfare benefits and was under 25 years.  He is in receipt of the lowest rate of jobseeker's allowance and as it is impossible to live on it - in terms of paying rent and trying to get anywhere - his independence is completely gone.  It has that impact.  </p>  <p>  As for migrant groups, a report was published yesterday on the challenges facing migrants in accessing community welfare services.  According to the report, they are not receiving these services.  Does the ESRI's analysis break down matters in that way?  All of the reports one reads point to growing inequality in favour of the highest percentile of the population globally.  Moreover, the numbers in the lowest percentage groups, those on low wages or welfare, are also growing in this regard.</p></speech>

The Minister was actually on her way into the Seanad and I asked her whether she had read Professor FitzGerald's paper on the distribution of income, social welfare payments and the public finances because he had some interesting things to say about the protection of those who were less well off and about the protection of social protection measures in the Government's policies.  I am not advocating for the Government, as I am here as an Independent, but I absolutely agree with Senator Michael D'Arcy in that I am very confused.  Professor FitzGerald is saying good things to the effect that there was a massive effort to raise taxes and protect social welfare payments, as well as a massive effort to protect those on low incomes, but because Professor Tim Callan is stating the income of those on low incomes fell by 20%, I am a little confused.  Perhaps, as Professor Callan suggested, it has to do with answering different questions.</p>  <p>  In addition, I note that persons earning &euro;100,000 or more paid 46% of all income tax in 2007.  How many of us are now earning &euro;100,000?  Are there are statistics available in this regard?  How many of the earning population are earning &euro;100,000 or more?  I note that the numbers earning &euro;275,000 or more fell by 28%.  Who is now earning that amount?  I am a tiny bit confused and while the delegates probably think these are baby questions, I ask them to balance the figures.  This is because, in one sense, the point is being made that the policies introduced by the Government to protect social welfare payments and those on low incomes worked or are working and that the money went towards those who were not working and were in receipt of social welfare payments.  On the other hand, I would have thought there was such a group as the squeezed middle, those earning between &euro;40,000 and &euro;70,000.  While I could be very wrong, perhaps the delegates might outline the point a little better.  However, it was the most informed paper I had read in a while, for which I thank Professor FitzGerald.  I ask the delegates to bear with me on some of the questions asked.</p></speech>

That is my strong point, not figures.  </p>  <p>  While Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir stated we had the most progressive tax and transfer system in the OECD, both absolutely and proportionately, I note that whenever somebody appears on television, he or she claims we have the most regressive tax system.</p> <p>I cannot understand why people differ in those views.  I ask Professor Callan to tell us why everyone differs in this assessment.  The witness has outlined reasons some households are, so to speak, workless.  I refer to the Minister's proposal on the back to work dividend.  Will this have a positive effect for getting people back to work?  Much of the time, the people I meet say they are better off not working because they can claim all these benefits.  It is terrible to think that a person could be better off being unemployed rather than working.  It is important that people are working and we should make every effort in our power to ensure that people are in the workforce.  It is preferable for their own good socially, even if it is not economically preferable.  It is important for people to be out working and interacting with others.</p> <p> I have a concern about the future of the State pension.  People are living longer, thankfully, and they are in better health.  If we do not take action, will it be possible to provide State pensions in the future?  It is vital that all those currently working know that at the end of their working days a State pension will be available.  I ask for the views of the delegation on this point.</p></speech>

Where is the exemplar?  Who is doing this well and how do we compare?  In the opinion of the delegates, is there, as of yet, an untapped source of either income or wealth or a combination of both, of a magnitude that can genuinely make an impact and will achieve further equality in Irish society in the future?  Is this opportunity available for us and, if so, is it of a magnitude that can make a real and tangible impact?  If this is the case, why has it not been done up to now?</p></speech>

One question was whether public services are included.  The answer is that, for the most part, they are not, and this is true internationally because it is a lot easier to analyse things that are measured and arrive in cash.  Some parts of the work are being extended into non-cash areas, such as the ongoing new research on reform of the health system and medical cards, for example.  A seminar next week will hear a person from the UK Treasury speaking about their approach to these matters.  We are not unusual internationally in looking purely at the cash-led aspect, because that is the focus of the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, which focuses on cash income and benefits.</p>  <p>  The figure of minus 20% in my submission is simply derived from two tables in the CSO's press release, which has been updated today.  There is nothing very fancy about it, as it is what has been observed as happening in low-income groups.  It is total income, so it is not the case that it is due to a reduction in transfers or welfare payments, because it is mostly due to loss of employment income and so on.  We are digging further into that and we will produce more research later this year in order to explain why this is happening.  It is not particularly to do with the transfer side of things.</p>  <p>  The back to work dividend is a work in progress, along with medical cards and the housing assistance payment.  Reforms in all those areas will certainly contribute to making work pay.  As to exactly how much they will contribute, that is to be determined, and exactly how much people will respond remains to be known.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cannon asked about an exemplar.  I would not pin my colours to any single mast.  However, in preparing this submission I noted that we tend to think of the Scandinavian countries as having arrived at a very equal distribution of income, because they have quite compressed wage distributions so the pre-transfer income is already quite equal.  Looking at figures from the EU-SILC, it looks very much as though Denmark had quite high pre-transfer income and also the same configuration as ourselves.  I flag this information because it is worth examining further.</p>  <p>  On the question of whether there is a squeezed middle, there are two senses to that question, one being whether people in the middle are being squeezed.  Definitely they are.  Everybody is being squeezed when we see average incomes going down by 10% to 14%, and nobody is escaping.  There is often an implication, in talking about a squeezed middle, that the middle is being squeezed by more than some other people, who can only be at the top or bottom of the distribution.  That does not seem to be the case either in these figures or in the updated figures we arrived at after 11 a.m. today.</p></speech>

Where public services are paid, they are picked up in the expenditure surveys.  Information on migrants is included in all the data, but asylum seekers are not, so they should be represented.  Senator D'Arcy and Senator O'Donnell asked how to reconcile what seems to be two different stories.  It depends on how one defines policy - Professor Callan may wish to respond on this.  The way Professor Callan defines policy changes is if social welfare payments are increased in real terms or cut in real terms or if tax rates are moved up or down.  That is a fairly standard definition of policy changes.  What I am referring to is allocation of expenditure.  There was no basic change in policy initially in terms of welfare payments.  There were major changes for the under-25s, which will be mentioned by Professor Callan.  However, it is the allocation of a further very significant amount of money.  Economists refer to automatic stabilisers.  When a lot more people are unemployed, if the welfare rates and entitlements are not changed, there will be a very significant increase in expenditure.  As Professor Callan said, it depends on the question asked.  When one sees these catastrophic and massive changes in allocation and expenditure and &euro;30 billion in cuts, then I think one must look at it both ways.  There was a decision to protect.  I know that people on welfare do not think they are being protected relative to what might otherwise have been.  There would have been suggestions from the troika - although not very strong - that maybe it would be easier to cut welfare payments by more so that taxes would not need to be raised by as much.  The decision was taken by successive Governments not to do that.  I do not know whether that makes it any clearer; it depends on how one defines what is policy.</p>  <p>  Senator O'Donnell asked me how many people earn above and below &euro;100,000.  I have that information in my laptop, but I will revert to the Senator because it would take more time than it is worth.  It is worth a lot to answer you, Senator.</p></speech>

They were paying more tax than the average, and the average tax rate for people earning above &euro;100,000 has actually gone up, as one would expect.</p>  <p>  Senator Moloney asked a question which I will ask Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir to answer.  On the question about future State pensions, that is a serious issue. </p> <p>It is not a problem for me; I will be dead before the crisis hits.  However, the question of how we finance pensions concerns younger people.  I have been very critical of policy in the past decade, but I believe one policy that was wise was building up a pension fund.  In the longer term, the Government needs to run a continuing surplus, on average, over the cycle to allow a fund to build up so that my grandchildren's pensions will be paid; otherwise, they will have a big problem.  It is not an issue for today or tomorrow, but the committee is correct to focus on it.  It is a very important issue.</p> <p> A question was asked about exemplars.  If one wants to examine redistribution of income by a state, Ireland is the exemplar, as Mr. de Buitl&eacute;ir highlighted.  There is a reason we tend not to think about that.  A really important research question, to which I do not have an answer, is why market incomes in Ireland are the most unequal in the OECD area.  That is the puzzle.  The welfare and taxation systems have to do considerable running to make a really big difference.  I do not know whether the members have an answer to the question.  It is an important question that deserves a response but I am afraid I cannot answer it.</p></speech>

Whether that is good or bad is a matter for politics.  People who state in the media that it is not the most progressive are just talking rubbish, but sometimes that happens.  Nobody in this room would be guilty of that, of course.</p>  <p>  I was asked about the back to work dividend.  I will come back to that.  The issue I am really concerned about is the high number of workless households.  The national expert on that subject, Professor Dorothy Watson, is in the room.  She has done really ground-breaking research on this.  The issue is really important economically and socially.  I speculate that this has a significant part to play in explaining why our market income distribution is so unequal.  If 23% of people, or approximately one quarter of the population, have little or no market income, it seems there will be a very unequal distribution.</p>  <p>  On the question of why the Irish economy is unusual by comparison with others, we have a very large multinational sector.  We generally have a dual economy in Ireland, comprising a multinational sector and a domestic economy.  Incomes in the multinational sector, I suspect, are significantly higher than in the rest of the economy.  I do not have any data and it may be hard to quantify.</p>  <p>  I am really concerned about pension sustainability, not only in respect of the State pension but also in respect of the occupational pension.  Life expectancy is increasing.  This is alarming to a pension fund manager, although the rest of us believe it is very good.</p></speech>

One does not have to do anything about it today because nothing much changes, but if it is not addressed it will be a problem.  It is one of the most strategically important questions.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Cannon's question on whose system works well, I agree with Professor FitzGerald that ours does.  We have put a lot of emphasis on the tax and transfer system.  The solution to this problem may require other measures, such as tackling the number of households that do not have work.  That is a complicated issue.  Is it a question of providing better child care, training and education?  There is a real problem of social exclusion and social disadvantage among the group in question, and this comprises a real problem that we need to do something about.</p>  <p>  Senator D'Arcy asked whether taxing the rich would solve the problem and Deputy Cannon alluded to an untapped source of wealth.  According to my judgment, there is no real pot of gold.  I spent two terms in the Revenue Commissioners and noted that we were certainly very good at finding where money was.  Therefore, I do not believe there is any simple answer to the question.  I wish there were.</p></speech>

On the subject of the most progressive tax system in the world, I want to make two points.  Obviously, the number is available; it is published by the OECD.  There are couple of points that are very important to understand about that number.  It is measured by calculating the gap between the tax rate on two thirds of the average income and the tax rate on what is either one and two thirds or twice the average income - I cannot recall which is correct.  Ireland has the biggest jump in the effective tax rate actually paid on the incomes.  The reason we have the biggest jump is not because we have the highest taxes on people with twice the average wage but because we have lower taxes for people who have below-average wages.  Our tax rates applicable to those on twice the average wage demonstrate that we are not in any way different from other countries.  However, it is in respect of taxes at lower rates that we are different.  This is where we get the big jump.</p>  <p>  Another point to remember is that the measure does not account for taxes on incomes beyond one and two thirds or twice the average income.  In other countries, the tax keeps going up with one's wage.  One's taxes increase progressively as a percentage of one's income, including when one is on three or four times the average wage.  In Ireland, however, the progressivity of our tax system flatlines because we have just two rates.  Now, with the changes to the USC, one could argue that we have more rates but, up until the recent budget, there was really no difference in one's tax rate once one reached the threshold of &euro;32,800.  The new USC level results in a slight increase in progressivity, but not much.  The curve of progressivity starts off low, jumps and then flatlines again.</p>  <p>  I have outlined two reasons for the number.  It is important to understand that.</p></speech>

We need to examine further why Ireland's distribution is the most unequal before taxes and transfers are taken into account.  There are some points to make on this, however, and they are included in the handouts we submitted.  We have a quite low employment level overall.  I am not referring to the unemployment level.  Some 65% of working age adults are in employment.  It is 70% for men and only 60% for women.  Therefore, only 60% of women of working age are actually in employment.  By contrast, countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Denmark have a figure of 76%.  In Sweden, 80% of working age adults are actually in employment.  One needs to ask why the Irish rate is low.  A reason could be the cost of child care, for example.  Perhaps for certain families it is not economically viable to have a second person working and paying child care costs.  This is just one example of many that could be examined.</p>  <p>  On the other issues, I was asked whether we should consider public services and factors such as the cost of living.  The figures account for cash, and Ireland is very heavily weighted towards cash payments.  We are not accounting in these figures for public services and the cost of living.  As I stated in my presentation, TASC is to produce a report that will attempt to examine inequality in the round.  It takes into account how we deliver public services.  It will examine wealth and the cost of living in Ireland and how such factors affect overall economic inequality, not just income inequality or the distribution of income, which we were considering today.</p>  <p>  On the question of inequality falling in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, I tried to address in my presentation the point that the inequality rate falls because something happens either at the bottom or the top.</p> <p>The point I tried to address in my presentation is that inequality decreases because something happens either at the bottom or at the top.  In Ireland, because of the crisis, incomes at the top were squeezed and pushed down.  The income floor provided by the social protection system and the fact that it was not changed radically meant that nothing happened at the bottom.  Therefore, we had a contraction.  Now, the income floors have not changed, more people are working and incomes are going up, but the underlying inequality is still in place and, therefore, we are probably going to see a stretching of the distribution of income again.</p> <p> The payments themselves do not address the underlying causes of inequality.  In fact, the crash caused the major contraction.  It was not because anything underlying had changed or because Ireland necessarily became a more equal country structurally.  It was the crash or crisis that really caused it.</p></speech>

I was keen to highlight a point about public services at the end of my brief talk because it is an important issue.  The proportion of services provided publicly in Ireland is lower than elsewhere.  This should be taken into account when we consider the significance of cash benefits.  Some research we have done shows that the quality of life of people who are economically vulnerable is more strongly affected in Ireland by poor-quality public services than the quality of life of the general population.  This is an important question.</p>  <p>  I was asked why we are coming up with different answers and apparently contradictory pointers.  I suppose the issue is that we are examining different parts of the distribution.  My comments focused particularly on social transfers and on poverty at the lower end of the distribution of social transfers.  Professor Callan took account of taxation and examined the whole range of income distribution.  Others have considered market income as well.  All of these work in slightly different directions.  Another issue is whether we compare Ireland with other countries now or the changes in Ireland over time.  That can give a slightly different picture as well.</p>  <p>  I am keen to reiterate that the bottom line in terms of social transfers is that they did a great deal of heavy lifting in the recession.  This was because there was a great deal of heavy lifting to be done, because market incomes collapsed.  There was a high rate of joblessness and therefore social transfers became decidedly important in keeping people above a very basic income level.  That does not mean their standard of living was adequate.  We still saw an increase in basic deprivation, and some people lacked basic goods and services, but they were seriously important none the less.  Policy might have gone in a different direction.  It might have slashed social transfers and the outcome would have been very different.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to jobless households.  I understand the committee had a major discussion about that last week.</p></speech>

We have many zeros in Ireland relative to other European countries.  Why are we so high?  More of our working age adults are not working, as Mr. Staunton said.  In particular, we have a high joblessness rate among lone-parent households, a particularly high-risk group in Ireland.  Affordability of child care is undoubtedly an issue in this regard.  We also have a high rate of joblessness among those with a disability in Ireland.  If more policy effort were focused on that issue there might be some benefits as well.</p>  <p>  Let us consider jobless households.  Approximately 50% contain either children or adults with a disability.  One of the reasons we differ from other European countries is that adults in jobless households are more likely to have children in Ireland compared other European countries.  Moreover, they are more likely to have larger numbers of children compared to other European countries.  There is a barrier to work associated with children.  Child care would be an obvious place to look for an explanation.</p></speech>

That money is still in the system.</p>  <p>  Another question I am keen to ask relates to property tax.

Does it extend it out?  Do the deputations believe it is an equal way of taking in tax?<br />Perhaps I picked up another point incorrectly.  Is VAT considered from the point of view of tax in respect of those on higher incomes?  I read some commentary from Michael Taft.  He suggested that when we take all the other taxes into account, the wealthy benefit more than the poor.  I accept the fact that there is no crock of gold anywhere.  However, people want to see a progressive taxation system under which those who have more wealth pay more.  Last year, the assets of the wealthiest in society - the top 10% - grew by &euro;6.5 billion, which brought the figure to over &euro;60 billion worth of assets.  This includes boats and portraits and so on.  We are awaiting the figures for this year.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>usually does it every year.  Anyway, this vast wealth is not being taxed or tackled in any shape or form.  What if there was a 1% tax on all of that?  What would that bring to an economy that could utilise that money in a way that would benefit society?  These are the questions we should be asking.</p></speech>

Is it a good thing or a bad thing?  Do the witnesses believe we should hold it or change it?  I believe people overlook some of the facts.  Some say the multinationals in this country are not paying enough tax.  If they left the country we would have a cohort who would be unemployed and we would not have tax coming in from them.  Furthermore, we would have to pay social welfare to those unemployed.  People seem to overlook that every time they speak about the matter.  No one seems to realise the dangers of what we are doing.</p>  <p>  People can debate it if they wish, but I believe a major wedge has been driven into Irish society.  There is great anti-social behaviour in Ireland in the sense of public versus private sectors and the self-employed versus the unemployed.  Someone might say that it is all right for those in the public sector because they have a job and are not going to lose it.  Others in the private sector maintain they have to pay everything but could lose their job in the morning.  Some people who are employed maintain that those who are unemployed get everything and they get nothing.  There has been an awful divide in Ireland over the recession.  How can we bring that back to where we were?  During the good times, people did not seem to care what other people were getting or what they were doing, but they do now.  They look at everything; they look at what people have and what they are getting.</p>  <p>  What is the view of the witnesses on how the self-employed fare in Ireland?  Do they believe they are being excessively taxed?  They do not have all the benefits that a PAYE worker has.  I know they get a good deal for the 4% they pay in PRSI.  We have discussed the matter at length.  If we were to bring them into the PAYE system or the full benefit system, their PRSI contributions would go up to 15%.  This would be a major blow to people, particularly the smaller self-employed people who are struggling from day to day to make ends meet.  I am keen to hear the views of the witnesses on those points.</p></speech>

Referring to the period after the property bubble burst, he stated: "The need for increased taxes and for cuts elsewhere in the economy was greatly increased by the decision by successive governments to protect those on low incomes who were dependent on the welfare system."  Therefore, we had tax cuts to protect people on low incomes.  He then went on to say that the bulk of the burden of increases in taxation had to be carried by those on middle incomes.</p> <p>Will he tell me what he means by "middle incomes"?  How does Professor FitzGerald define it because if that is the case - to protect the less well-off; I know all about the ramifications - we are back at square one with regard to what Mr. Staunton said about progressive taxation.  While it is actually progressive, there is a massive plateau.  It kicks in around &euro;30,000, bar the universal social charge, USC, which is the same at &euro;17,000 and &euro;70,000.  I brought up this issue with the Minister because there was a cut below &euro;12,500, as it does not appear to be progressive in the sense that those earning &euro;70,000 are nearly paying less than those earning &euro;42,000.  Is the Chairman with me?</p></speech>

However, I ask Professor FitzGerald to answer the question.  I do not believe the taxation system is progressive and Professor FitzGerald said it was not.  He said it was linguistically but that realistically and mathematically, it was called a plateau.  Is Mr. Staunton with me on this point?</p></speech>

Perhaps Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir might respond to the question of whether it is progressive, how it is and so on with regard to the points made by Mr. Cormac Staunton.  I was wondering about the budget.  I am not an economist, but to try to figure it out, I looked closely at the tables provided in which the effective rates of tax were considered.  I could see the system was progressive if one took someone on &euro;15,000 versus someone on &euro;120,000.  However, I thought those on &euro;25,000 - in other words, the lower middle income group - were losing out.  I invite the delegates to comment in this regard.<br />I saw a paper - I believe it was on the <i>PublicPolicy.ie</i>website - which mentioned that the gap between lower and middle income earners might be increasing, as opposed to between lower and top income earners.  Am I incorrect?  I read somewhere that there might be an issue in this regard.  When one examines the last budget, proportionately those in the middle did the best.  Those on incomes between &euro;40,000 and &euro;70,000 approximately were the ones who came out the best in how their tax position had improved if one went through the tables and appendices.  <br />I was wondering about the SWITCH model because there was a debate over the weekend in some media outlets on whether the threshold was too low in the case of inheritance tax for children, a point on which I personally disagree.  However, I recently tabled a parliamentary question and it appears as though the Exchequer has managed to maintain the level of capital taxes and that appears to be because the percentages and rates were increased, while the thresholds for inheritance tax were lowered.  Does the SWITCH model now take this into account?  The pension levy and pay cuts for public sector workers in the course of the recession were progressive in that the more one was paid, the bigger the percentage cut was, while caps were placed on public sector salaries.  Is the fact that there is a high proportion of public sector workers in the economy factored into the issue in terms of outcomes?  <br />My other question concerns the black economy.  While I do not know how it compares with that in other countries, is it an issue for those on lower incomes?  I refer, in particular, to the self-employed.  Are there issues in this regard?  Can they be investigated in any way or is it just something about which we know nothing?<br />I invite the delegates, starting with Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir, to come back on as many of these questions as possible, including the question about progressivity.</p></speech>

If one looks at the numbers, property taxes in Ireland are quite low and were I a betting man, they may not always be as low.  The most regressive part of the tax system is the excise duty on tobacco, in particular, followed by the excise duty on alcohol.  This raises really interesting questions.  If one was driven solely by income distribution considerations, one would cut the excise duty on tobacco to zero.  I do not think that would be a good idea, but it is something to think about.  </p>  <p>  As to whether the idea behind the corporation tax rate is a good one, we have been doing it since approximately 1956.  When we started, the tax rate for Irish exporters was zero, while the average corporation tax rate in the European Union was 50% and the differential was 50%.  We charge 12.5%, while the average rate is in the middle 20s.  As a consequence, the differential has moved from 50% to 12.5%.  Moreover, my assessment is that the next movement in rates in Europe will be downwards.  As Sir Humphrey might say, it would be courageous for a Minister to decide to tamper with it because one simply does not know what the tipping point will be.

I acknowledge that they are pretty low numbers and part of the reason is the PAYE credit of &euro;1,650 which was introduced in the budget for 1980, primarily because at the time self-employed persons paid tax based on their income in the previous year, while employees paid on a current-year income basis.  Inflation was running at 18%; therefore, as a result, one's income in the previous year was a good deal lower.  That anomaly was dealt with and self-employed persons now pay tax based on their income in the current year, but the compensation introduced through the PAYE credit was not amended.  One thing of which one can be sure in respect of taxation is that persons on the same income should pay the same in tax, but that does not happen right across the system.  Incidentally, were one to impose religiously the principle that those on the same income pay the same in tax, it would impose radical changes in income distribution.  However, self-employed persons on low incomes, in particular, are treated extremely badly.</p></speech>

However, one will not receive a credit towards contributory pension.  There is an anomaly in this regard that hits the self-employed and, in particular, self-employed persons on low incomes.</p></speech>

As one moves up the income distribution ladder, one pays a higher percentage of one's income in tax.  That is how I define it.  If one considers it, the basis for my statement that Ireland has the most progressive tax and transfer system is the OECD numbers which show the pre-tax and transfer Gini coefficient and the post-tax position; it is not just two particular points of income distribution, although some measure it in that way.  Incidentally, if one does measures it in that way, one gets the same answer, but looking at it globally, unless the OECD is wrong, it is an incontrovertible fact that Ireland has the most progressive tax and transfer system in the OECD.  It is a question for politicians as to whether that is good or bad, but to my mind, it is a fact.  If one looks at the numbers, for single people on half of average earnings, we have the lowest tax burden in the OECD.  For a single person on average earnings, we are about in the middle of the pack and as one moves up to two and a half times average income, I believe we are ninth.  As one moves up the income distribution scale, Ireland climbs towards the top in the OECD.  We will probably never get to the position that obtains in Denmark, but at the bottom, the differential between Ireland and Denmark is in the mid-teens.</p> <p>Those on low incomes in countries with progressive systems pay relatively high taxes, although they receive a lot of services in reeturn.  I assure Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell that the tax system in Ireland, no matter how it is measured, is highly progressive.  At 52%, while not the highest in the OECD, our marginal tax rate is not too far from it and is not the lowest.  It hits at a low level of income in Ireland, at about average earnings for a single person, whereas in Germany it hits at six times average earnings.  Belgium is nearest to Ireland.  If members are interested in pursuing these questions, I am happy to spend hours talking about them and our office is just around the corner.</p></speech>

Senator Marie Moloney asked questions about the division between public and private sector employees and the unemployed.  People also wonder whether they are particularly hard done by compared to others.  The only remedy is to improve the quality and quantity of information available on these topics, as we are trying to do in making the research available and known.</p>  <p>  The Chairman asked about the SWITCH model.  It takes account of the complicated structure of public sector pay and changes over a period.  We could not take into account straightaway the increase in the capital gains tax rate, but, with information supplied by the Revenue Commissioners, we have patched it in for the budget for the next year.  It is a difficult area and the CSO has announced today that it expects to publish the findings of the new survey of household wealth soon.  A lot of work must be done on this issue, which will open up these topics in ways that can feed into the debate.</p>  <p>  I have some concerns about whether the property tax can be described as progressive.  That does not mean that it is a bad thing, but looking at the burden as a proportion of income, it comes out as being higher on those on low incomes.  The way the United Kingdom has chosen to deal with the issue is to have a special council tax benefit, a name for its property tax.  I am not saying it is ideal, but it is an issue for debate.  There is a deferral option, but it is not the same as the waiver option provided in the United Kingdom.  It is tenable to say the system is progressive in many other ways, but it is a political decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015012100011#K00400"><p>To respond to the question asked by Deputy Joan Collins about where the money had gone, at the top end I suspect there were people who were making money from property.  A company was seeing capital gains as office buildings increased in value and it was taken as income, but that has disappeared and a lot of money has disappeared.</p>  <p>  On the question of raising more from people who are richer, an idea I support, the answer is not to raise the marginal tax rate but to find other ways of doing it.  There are many allowances at the top end and getting rid of them would have a major impact.  The nice thing about the USC is that there are no exemptions at the top end.  Switching USC for income tax at the top end was a good idea.  It is, therefore, a question of finding different ways of doing it.  Doing it at the marginal tax rate discourages people and there is a lot of evidence to support this.  People tend to think of the marginal tax rate as applying to really rich people, but it could apply to a couple one of whom is earning &euro;80,000, while the other is earning &euro;30,000.  Raising the marginal tax rate, because of the cost of child care, means that it is not worth both of them working and it disproportionately hits women.  It means that we could well see a further reduction in the female participation in the labour force.  If it is applied to property tax, people may have to go out to work to pay the property tax.  As an economist, having a property tax is a really good idea because it does not distort these incentives.  A couple pay the tax and can work out how to do so.  There is major evidence that property taxes do much less damage than other taxes in terms of people's work behaviour.  That is why economists tend to favour them.  While there are distortions, a 50% rate is okay, but going much above it could lead to a problem.</p>  <p>  In 1999 and 2001 I proposed increasing the rate of corporation tax a decade hence to 17.5% and there was uproar.  I would not do it today.  However, the funny business around it means that we need to tighten the rules because it is doing huge reputational damage to us around the world.  It could have upset the apple cart in terms of the bailout as people wanted to be really nasty to us because of it.  Some 12 or 13 companies are referred to as redomiciled plcs.  Although located in Ireland, they are doing nothing.  People fly over once a year for an AGM in a hotel and we are paying between &euro;50 million and &euro;75 million in tax on their income which we never see to the European Union in a budgetary contribution.  If we could chase them out, we would be better off by between &euro;50 million and &euro;75 million.  I have talked to multinationals that are concerned about the funny business because they create real jobs and are really important to us.  They are afraid that Ireland might be screwed on this issue and that they might be screwed as a result.  They think they can justify the 12.5% rate on what they do.  There is a reputational issue.</p>  <p>  Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir dealt with the issue of the self-employed who, with regard to PRSI, obtain very good value, as it more than pays for their pensions.  I totally agree on the other points made and with what he said about tobacco.</p>  <p>  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell picked me up on an issue raised by the Chairman.  A middle income figure is not less than &euro;100,000.  I changed the reference in one place but not the other.  The Senator picked me up on something that I deeply regret when I referred to someone earning less than &euro;100,000 as a middle income earner.</p></speech>

There are complications, but I tend to work on the basis of &euro;35,000 to &euro;40,000.</p>  <p>  On the question of whether the tax system is progressive, I seem to remember research from the dim and distant past when I was a middle-aged economist conducted by colleagues in the ESRI, Professor Brian Nolan and others, which suggested that what made the system progressive was the welfare system.  We have a targeted, not a universalist, system and try to get better value for money from welfare payments.  Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir talked about the two Gini coefficients, which provide a very good measure.  One could undertake a research project to work it out, but it is my suspicion that it is the welfare system that makes it progressive.</p>  <p>  The Chairman referred to inheritance tax.  I do not see why we should leave money to children and think my children will buy into this.</p></speech>

In the black market my suspicion would be that there is, as in most economies, but I do not know they are making a huge amount of money.  When I think about the people I come across who might not be declaring for tax and what I am paying them and multiplied by the number of hours they would want very hard to make an awful lot of money outside the tax net.  My suspicion is that it is the allowances which people on high incomes have - they are doing it legitimately - that need to be looked at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.578" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Staunton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015012100012#L00200"><p>Firstly, on the progressivity and severity of the tax system, as Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins said we have also to look at the effects of VAT, excise and so on.  The tax system is not only income tax, it is just one small part of it.  The overall progressivity needs to be measured by examining the tax system as a whole.  On the issue of whether it is the tax or welfare that reduces income equality, the OCED give a figure before taxes and transfers of 56.8%, the higher the number the more unequal we are, before transfers after taxes 53.5% and after taxes and after transfers 29.9%.  Therefore, it is clear that the social transfers, not the tax on its own, that makes us more equal.</p>  <p>  On the question of middle incomes I am not sure if the Senators have a copy of our submission but we use the Revenue data that was quoted here.  It is the TASC submission, which includes chart 1 and chart 2.  Chart 1 is the raw data which is done by tax case.  It can be a single person, a couple with one earner or a couple with two earners.  We have translated it into the number of adults in chart 2.  We have put the actual earnings, namely, gross earnings before taxes and transfers into groups.  We have also added in those not captured in Revenue data.  These are the people who are not working or getting an income.  We have not given them an income as such but have just put them aside.  The chart shows that the vast majority of people, probably 60% or more are under &euro;30,000, and in fact the &euro;40,000 to &euro;100,000 grouping is not 50% of people, it is a much smaller group of people so that the middle is probably somewhere in the &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000 range.  As it is income and because it is skewed one needs a lot of people on &euro;20,000 to bring the average down to compare to one person on &euro;100,000.  The average income from work is &euro;35,000 but the average income of all adults is probably much lower than that.</p></speech>

Where there is a dual earner couple we have split it 50:50.  At TASC we do not think that &euro;40,000 to &euro;70,000 is really the middle, we would see that as the upper middle; the middle is probably &euro;20,000 to &euro;40,000.

Different families on the same income will look differently in that distribution.  That is the data.  One can see from it how many people are over &euro;75,000 and it is a very small number.  If is above &euro;75,000 one is in the top 10%.  That is not the middle.  I guess when welfare incomes are included one is talking about adding between &euro;8,000 and &euro;12,000 per adult in the first two columns in the data.  That is in answer to what is the middle.</p></speech>

It is a privilege to be here because the issue has been researched and reasoned.  Communication is terribly important.  Sometimes in the media we do not get the reality of what is going on.  We get a bit of it or a doorway into it but we never really get it.

If a person works in Ireland for ten years and leaves the country and works for 40 years in another country, at pension age that person will receive a pension from Ireland based on what he or she paid in Ireland plus what he or she paid in another country, because we have bilateral agreements with America, England and other countries.  I feel a pension should be based on the contributions the person paid in this country of, say, &euro;95 or whatever per week.  We take into account all the contributions the person has paid for 40 years in another country and he or she receives a <i>pro rata</i>pension which is at a much higher rate while not having contributed here for more than 40 years, except for the ten odd years.  I am convinced we should be looking at a pension based on what they paid in this country.  They will also get a pension in the other country based on what they paid in that country and on other Irish contributions as well.  Therefore, they are benefitting on the double from contributions.  In recent years many non-nationals who worked in Ireland have returned to their own country because of the crash in the economy.  Going forward we will be paying a pension to these people despite the fact that they have contributed only for, say, a minimum number of years here.  I would like to here the views of the representatives on that issue.</p></speech>

One feature of the Irish social protection system that has come up in the discussion is a heavy reliance on means tested payments so that if the person starts earning income the social transfer is reduced right ay.  That is a good strategy if the emphasis is on getting the best value for money in terms of targeting it towards the people who are least well off, who have no income from other sources.</p> <p>It begins to create difficulties with the transition from being dependent on welfare to being in employment.  The significance and implications of means testing for the transition period needs some attention.  It comes from the general concern with household joblessness.</p> <p> I am not familiar with the pension issue, which sounds very intricate and complicated.  I thought Ireland could apply for a transfer of funding from the country in which the person made the 40 years' worth of contributions.  Given that I am not sure about that, I am better off not commenting.</p></speech>

We will have a budget perspectives conference in June and we are working on two papers related to potential improvements for it.  One is about the idea of the back to work family dividend, medical cards and housing assistance payment improving the incentive to work.  The other is examining options for tax and universal social charge, USC, and will be a forward-looking rather than a backward-looking paper. I hope they will contribute something.</p>  <p>  Given that our role is to produce accurate numbers and let others judge, I will adopt a similar strategy to Professor Watson's on comparisons between this Government and the previous one.  There is a theme in economics around the idea that one can observe the actions of governments in these distributive areas and infer their preferences between different income groups.  It has always struck me that there is a missing link in the literature - namely, that governments at different times are choosing from different possibilities and choice sets, and this comes into play when one is trying to evaluate them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.598" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015012100013#M00500"><p>While my colleagues are probably more knowledgeable on improving the welfare system, the area where there is a gain to be made is that of lone parents.  This goes back to the issue of jobless households.  There is a double dividend to be had from finding a way for lone parents to get married or have a partner and get back to work.  The Government would save on welfare and increase its tax take and would also get more output.  The work I did suggests that one percentage point of the growth rate in the second half of the 1990s was due to women joining the labour market, and given that we are running out of women who are doing this, this growth had to slow.</p>  <p>  I am not an expert on corporation tax.  In the past two budgets the Government has made significant changes, and I hope that closes off the issue.  Mr. de Buitl&eacute;ir is much more expert on it than I.</p>  <p>  There is still a very significant transfer to Ireland from the British Government to pay for pensions.  There are EU regulations on such transfers.  Given that immigrants are much less likely to draw benefits than natives, they are doing badly from the system.  Although they pay taxes, when they lose their jobs, they tend to go home and not draw benefits.  This mirrors what has happened in the UK.  A series of papers for the UK have shown that the pensions of people there are being significantly supported by the number of immigrants.  If all the immigrants in Britain went home, the UK would have a significant problem.  Immigrants pay much more tax than they draw in benefits and the conclusion is that immigrants are good for pensions.</p></speech>

While there is more to do in corporation tax, it was well done.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about unemployment traps.  EU numbers show that the unemployment trap for somebody on half the average wage is 87%.  For three years in the 1990s I was on a committee which examined the issue, and it is time to study it again.  It may be related to the jobless household issue, and there is work to do on it.  Now is the time to do some work on the sustainability of the State pension.  We need to address it before it becomes a crisis.</p>  <p>  We have taken &euro;2.8 billion out of tax reliefs since 2008, and this is often not factored into the distribution issue.  The USC base for taxpayers in general is lower than the income tax base because the State pension is exempt from USC, and this comes to &euro;6 billion.  At the top of the income distribution, the USC base is wider on average by approximately 5%.  There are large variations in the category.  Some people would not use tax reliefs while others use significant amounts.  That was probably a positive.  Like many issues in this area, it is complicated.</p></speech>

I understand Professor FitzGerald&rsquo;s points about making marginal rates too high.  Because of the way the tax system is structured, there is an opportunity for tax on incomes above &euro;100,000.  The Government could raise &euro;360 million from a tax of 60% on people's incomes above &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

As chief procurement officer, CPO, I welcome this debate, and the advice and guidance that committees such as this can provide, as we start to make significant changes to how procurement is done in the State and the policy framework that underpins the processes involved.  I understand the committee is interested, in particular, in the possible impacts of the new suite of procurement directives that were agreed by the EU Parliament and Council earlier this year.  I welcome this opportunity to provide it with an update on the transposition process and the procurement reform programme currently under way across the public sector.</p>  <p>  The procurement reform programme is an important element of the Government&rsquo;s overall reform programme and is tasked with delivering increased value for money, more accurate and timely data and improvement in the capacity and capability of procurement across the public service.  The State spends significant amounts of money on goods and services, with an estimated spend in 2014 of &euro;8.5 billion.  Of this, &euro;5.8 billion was addressable by procurement.  In addition, approximately &euro;3.5 billion is spent by the State on capital works.  This does not currently come within the scope of the operational reforms.  A new model for procurement was approved by the Government in September 2012, with common goods and services to be procured by a new central sourcing organisation, the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and with central sectoral sourcing organisations in health, education, local government and defence procuring sectoral-specific goods and services.</p>  <p>  In January 2013, I took up my role as the State&rsquo;s first chief procurement officer.</p> <p>In consultation with the key State sectors, I developed a high-level implementation plan for the new model.  This plan was approved by Government in April 2013.  In addition to its operational procurement role, the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, also provides the national procurement policy function, customer support services, and systems for all the sourcing organisations, including electronic tendering systems, business intelligence and electronic catalogues, etc.  The new structural arrangements for the OGP and the sector-sourcing organisations are currently being put in place.  Staff are being recruited into the OGP largely from the public service, thereby concentrating and leveraging the public sector's procurement expertise.  Similar processes are taking place in local government, education and health in order to create the centralised sourcing organisations in those sectors.  Transition arrangements are being managed across these sourcing organisations to realign responsibilities.  It is anticipated that completion of structural changes will take place in 2015.  The OGP has met with most of its key customers, namely, Departments and agencies, to commence the process of transferring their pipeline of sourcing projects to the OGP and to the other sector-sourcing organisations.</p> <p> The new model is underpinned by a common governance model.  The arrangements include a procurement executive to bring together the sourcing organisations at an operational level to co-operate and collaborate; a steering group to oversee the transition to the new model; and an interim board chaired, by the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, to provide strategic advice on procurement matters to the OGP and to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p> Accountability for the legal compliance of the sourcing process will rest with the sourcing organisation that undertakes the tendering.  The OGP does not have the resources or mandate to oversee or audit the actions of other sourcing organisations.  The OGP relies upon the existing governance arrangements in place for those public bodies, including the offices of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Audit Service, to provide such assurance.  Budget responsibility remains with the public service bodies.  The contractual arrangements put in place by the new sourcing organisations will help these bodies to remain compliant and to deliver value for money.  Any savings arising from procurement remains with these bodies, enabling them operate within their budgets, to deal with increased demand or to deliver new projects or services.  Value for money is defined by more than price alone; it also takes into account the quality of the goods or services provided, the management of risk, such as the financial stability of the service providers, and the contractual protections suppliers are providing to the State, such as the warranties they are providing and the risks they are bearing.</p> <p> There continues to be wide-ranging data quoted regarding procurement spend.  There are thousands of State bodies spending money, the larger of whom have IT systems for processing spend, the smaller of whom are probably using spreadsheets or even paper to record their spend information.  The State previously had no mechanism for collecting detailed data on the amount of moneys spent across the public service on goods and services.  It has not been possible to determine in detail how much is spent, with whom, on what, and at what price.</p> <p> I will explain to the committee what OGP is doing to bring about better data on procurement.  In autumn 2013, the OGP initiated a project to begin collecting the spend information from the larger sectors, namely, health, education, local government and justice, which account for over 80% of the State's spend on goods and services.  The OGP has collected approximately &euro;8.7 billion of the State's spend in one central repository.  This is a total figure from 2011 to 2014.  The project has moved on to a second phase which, when complete, will include central government.  For the first time this will allow the OGP in the coming months to publish far more accurate estimates of spend.  </p> <p> The OGP is fully aware of the significant role that small and medium enterprises play in the economy and it is strongly committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  The office works with State and industry representative bodies in developing and implementing policy initiatives and in driving supplier education and awareness.  In that regard, it is important to mention Circular 10/14 which was launched in April 2014 in order to further assist SMEs and which accelerates the delivery of certain measures in the new procurement Directive 2014/24/EC.  The OGP has also delivered a number of improvements in Ireland's electronic tendering platform - e-tenders - including changes to registration and recording of awards for contracts in excess of &euro;25,000.</p> <p> As part of my submission to the committee, I have attached a report from the EU Commission entitled, SMEs' Access to Public Procurement Markets and Aggregation of Demand in the EU.  The report, which was published in 2014, outlines the increasing drive towards centralised professional procurement and the administrative and competitive benefits arising. The report highlights the competitive nature of the Irish marketplace and the open nature of Irish public procurement in that context.  The report - on page 71 - highlights measures which Governments can undertake to assist SMEs.  Many of these have been implemented in Ireland. </p> <p> I will speak about the legal framework for public procurement.  The main purpose of the EU public procurement regime is to open up the market and to ensure the free movement of supplies, services and works within the EU.  The legal framework for public procurement is drawn from the core Treaty of Rome principles, including openness, transparency, proportionality, non-discrimination and equal treatment.  These principles shape the detailed rules governing the regime and as set out in the directives.</p> <p> A new suite of public procurement directives was politically agreed under the Irish EU Presidency.  The three new directives will govern general public procurement of goods, services and works, procurement in the utilities sector and new rules for concessions procurement.  These new directives will repeal the existing rules governing the conduct of procurement across the EU but the overall framework of EU procurement remains intact.  The implementing regulations will continue to uphold transparency in money outcomes for contracting authorities and entities.  </p> <p> The changes agreed in the directives are intended to help to make the public procurement process more efficient and to seek more simplified and flexible rules for the selection of suppliers in order to allow contracting authorities to carry out procurement in a more timely manner and with less red tape.  In broader economic policy terms, the changes are intended to achieve better value-for-money outcomes for the taxpayer from public procurement; to facilitate greater SME participation in the public procurement market across Europe by improving access to public procurement opportunities; and to reinforce adherence to applicable obligations in the areas of environmental, social and labour law.  It is important that in transposing EU rules into national law, contracting authorities and tenderers are not unduly burdened by requirements that increase their administrative overhead and bureaucratic load.  The planned approach, therefore, is to avoid creating unnecessary legislative burdens on contracting authorities or in placing Irish economic operators - the suppliers - at a competitive disadvantage when compared with their EU neighbours.  Where appropriate, contract conditions can be used in pursuance of policy objectives if related to the subject matter of the contract and if clearly set out in the tender documentation. </p> <p> While most of the changes in the new directives are mandatory for Ireland and all member states to implement into national law, there is some limited policy latitude permitted to member states in transposing the new regime into national legislation.  This office is exploring policy choices as part of the transposition process and has carried out internal consultation with key stakeholders and initiated a public consultation process.  The public consultation on the new directives was launched on 31 October 2014 by the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris.  Responses on the key policy questions posed in the document were required by 12 December 2014.  Given the importance of public procurement, we received submissions across a broad spectrum of areas, including legal, SME, academic and industry representative bodies.  This office is currently examining the submissions received and consideration will be given to the responses received when drafting the statutory instruments to implement the EU rules into national law.</p> <p>The new directives are required to be transposed by 17 April 2016-----</p></speech>

I will highlight a couple of points.</p>  <p>  Circular 10/14 was a key policy instrument that we launched in April 2014.  It is critically important in terms of implementation across contracting authorities because it opens up and sets the rules for them as they address the marketplace and it is SME friendly.  We did that in consultation with the industry groups, including ISME, SFA, IBEC and CIF.  We consulted broadly with them before implementing the circular.</p>  <p>  I will talk further about social clauses during the meeting but considerable work is under way.  The Minister launched a group in 2014 to establish social clauses policy work and it has identified 11 projects to date to further test and develop social clauses in contracts.  We also mentioned in the report positive developments on the schools bundle programme where existing social clauses are being rolled out.  There have been positive and welcome developments in that context.</p>  <p>  We can discuss PPPs and concessions during the question and answer session.</p>  <p>  We mentioned the community and voluntary sector.  This office has met The Wheel, in particular, as a key representative of that sector.  We had a positive meeting in the context of understanding where the sector is coming from and helping people to understand the new changes being brought to bear by the directives and legislation introduced at EU level.</p>  <p>  Public procurement is still incredibly important to the State and the taxpayer in terms of the value for money it can generate.  We are bringing new structures to bear in this respect but we are at an early stage.  The OGP is still only building its capability and capacity; 2015 will be a key year of transition.  It is important during the transition, though, that we listen to all our stakeholders.  We have good mechanisms for that and we have put in place good structures.  I welcome further discussion with the committee.</p></speech>

I will not make an opening statement.  I will ask questions and if Mr. Quinn does not have sufficient time to respond, I ask him to forward his responses to the committee in the next day or two.  He said &euro;8.5 billion out of current expenditure is spent annually, &euro;5.8 billion of which is addressable by procurement.  Will he explain the other &euro;2.7 billion that cannot be addressed by procurement?  He said the capital expenditure programme, which is valued at &euro;3.5 billion, is not included in his office's work.  Why not?</p>  <p>  He stated the EU Commission report "highlights the competitive nature of the Irish marketplace and the open nature of Irish public procurement in that context".  That is the particular problem Irish companies face.  "Open" means open to companies outside Ireland to bid.  That is where Ireland is losing out.  I tabled a parliamentary question asking the Minister why we were not at the European standard in terms of businesses in Ireland getting business from Irish public bodies and he replied that this was because all our documents are printed in English.  Companies in every country are familiar with English and are well able to tender and bid for our contacts whereas in Italy, France, Greece and Spain procurement documents are printed in the home language, which is not as readily accessible by companies in every other member state.  I would like Mr. Quinn to address that issue because I was surprised by that comment.  If we published the documents in Irish and helped Irish people to translate them in some way, we might keep some of the others out, as they successfully do in other countries by using their native language.</p>  <p>  Will Mr. Quinn confirm that commercial semi-State bodies are not covered by his office?  That is the largest gap in his operation.  I acknowledge these bodies have a commercial mandate.  I will not even mention how much Irish Water is supposed to spend but if that does not come under procurement rules, where are we going?</p>  <p>  Mr. Quinn mentioned the Department of Health but another significant gap relates to the procurement of drugs and medicines.  The HSE, which is not covered by the OGP, is not competent and it is afraid of the large pharmaceutical companies.  It goes cap in hand to them because they are significant employers.  Has Mr. Quinn examined his office taking over responsibility for procurement in this area and perhaps working with an equivalent officer in another member state to jointly procure?  I do not accept, nor does anybody in Ireland, that we are getting value for money in this regard.  Part of the reason for this is we feel a little insecure in putting it up to large employers and we are afraid to upset them.  Perhaps if the OGP worked with a similar office in England, France or Spain, a better deal might be achieved.</p>  <p>  Mr. Quinn made no mention of the cost of his office, the number of staff and the break even period.  It obviously cost tens of millions of euro to set up the operation.  Will he provide the figures?</p>  <p>  Everybody wants social clauses included in contracts.  When will he review the 11 projects under way?  Will that be at the end of the contracts, which could be a few years away?</p>  <p>  When Mr. Quinn visits the Department of Education and Skills with a procurement list, there is a breakdown in communication between his office and some schools.  The procurement list includes photocopying paper, pencils, rulers, IT equipment and so on and schools are told they must operate from the list unless they can get a better deal locally.  Schools use the supplier on the list as the nominated supplier when they want items that are not on the list that were tendered for.  The school principals are being rolled over for the additional items not on the list when they order online.  Will Mr. Quinn address this?</p>  <p>  I refer to the links to payment.  It is fine for the OGP to have a role in procurement but does it have a role in making sure the payments correspond with the procurement contracts, given there are overruns all over the place?</p>  <p>  Shame on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation because the Construction Contacts Act 2013 has not yet been implemented.  There is, therefore, no protection for subcontractors in public procurement contracts.  The Act was passed two years ago, having been on the legislative list for five years.  Officials are fluting around over which Department should be responsible or who should be the chair of the bodies that come under it.  The industry came under the remit of the Department of Finance for years but it is now under another Department and years later there are no agreed chairmen and mediation procedures in place.  The OGP is deliberately dragging its feet.  If there was a will to implement the legislation, it would have been implemented.</p>  <p>  When will the public contracts review be completed?  Mr. Quinn said that perhaps this might happen next year.  Are zero energy contracts being considered in buildings such as schools?  The office should be working towards energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  Does his office examine the payment record of companies that tender?  That has been a problem.  It is known that directors of many of the companies that won contracts operated through different shelf companies and did not pay people in the past.  They produced financial statements, accountants' reports and tax clearance certificates but one will know in one's heart that these are not honest people but the OGP is trapped in having to award them contracts.  The payment record of the principals of companies must be factored it.  The office should have a mechanism to track that.</p>  <p>  That is my series of questions.  I am happy with that and if Mr. Quinn runs out of time, I would like the answers to the other questions forwarded to the committee.</p></speech>

The first item might be better handled in a tabular format through a separate written response.  We believe we can make more progress quickly with regard to main goods and services.  Capital is included in the office's remit from a policy perspective and Mr. Campbell's policy team deals with procurement policy across both goods and services and capital works.  Operationally, capital works are typically large bespoke projects, where the procurement bit is a small aspect of the overall tendering process.  At this time, from a taxpayer perspective we would be best to focus on working on goods and services, which is a major part of the transactional activity - and repeat transactional activity - taking place within the State.  I would not rule it out at a later stage but where we are in our development, I do not think it will happen.</p>  <p>  If the committee has the PwC report that was circulated, I will give some very useful information relating to the open nature of Irish public procurement.  A document from the EU was its genesis and it was drafted by PwC and other parties.  It is the first time it has contrasted not only works awarded by the Irish State to businesses outside the State but it also brings into play contracts awarded to Irish companies by other jurisdictions.  Pages 66 and 67 of the report give the relevant figures.  In summary, between 2009 and 2011, for above-threshold procurements or large procurements that must go into the EU Journal, 14.3% of the expenditure by value went outside the Irish State.  In contrast, 17.2% of the value of goods and services that the Irish State has as above threshold came into the economy.  Being open is not a one-way street and Irish businesses are winning more in Europe than is flowing the other way.</p></speech>

I will speak a little more about what we are doing about that.  I have already mentioned Circular 10/14 and there are a number of various initiatives to try to help not only from a policy perspective but to enable small and medium enterprises, SMEs, by breaking larger contracts into lots by reducing turnover requirements and by being flexible in not requiring SMEs to submit lots of documentation in advance.  These are good initiatives as well but on the other side we are doing much with building awareness and education within the SME community.  We work very closely with Enterprise Ireland and Intertrade Ireland.  Some Deputies were able to attend the event we had in October or early November in Citywest which had approximately 700 suppliers in attendance.  That was great as those attending could meet people from our office and other sectoral organisations in the new structures.  We are doing much in helping awareness and education in Irish companies.</p></speech>

I will comment on another issue that is worth mentioning.  I regret that semi-State bodies are not included from an operational perspective.  From a policy perspective, they are obliged to follow the policies set by the Government and the office.  With regard to the HSE and drugs in particular, that arrangement is overseen, by and large, by the Department and not the HSE.  We have offered our assistance, as was mentioned to the Committee of Public Accounts, to the Department of Health to help it procure those goods and services.</p></speech>

The State spends a lot of money on procuring goods and services, with the objective of driving efficiencies in that sector, which is beneficial for the taxpayer.  My experience at a constituency level is that nobody has come into me to tell me a business is thriving because of the Office of Government procurement; I have had the opposite experience, with small businesses in my constituency squeezed out of contracts they had in the public service.  Will the witnesses flesh out how this is beneficial for service providers?  I appreciate the point that given the European aspect, we could gain business on that level.  That refers to individual companies which are doing business for themselves with opportunities.  On the other hand, many indigenous small Irish companies who are not in a position to avail of the big opportunities in Europe are being squeezed out by companies coming in and taking Irish business.</p>  <p>  It is important to have assistance in place for people buying and selling, whether we are talking about toilet paper, paper clips or school books.  It is also important to have systems in place.  Let us not become preoccupied with having systems in place if there is no delivery for business, workers, employees and the State in general.  Will the witnesses give me the good news story as it exists for Irish SMEs, as I have not seen in.  As I noted, in my constituency I have seen the opposite.  I know two companies, one of which was involved with education and one which dealt with hospitality, that have lost substantial business in this process.  They would be highly critical of what has happened with regard to the businesses that replaced them.  When we look behind a company facade, it amounts to import substitution, as it may be bringing in products from China as opposed to using indigenous products.  It is not all about price and should it be all about price.</p>  <p>  If there is any remaining time, I would be interested in getting answers to some of the questions raised by Deputy Fleming.</p></speech>

I can give a better flavour of some of the performance statistics and spend information.  The PwC report I mentioned relates to above-threshold expenditure.  As part of my submission, I mentioned that the office has been gathering spend information since October 2013.  We now have a fairly good picture of expenditure, although it is still a sample.  We have a fairly good picture of the profile of expenditure which now takes place across the State.</p>  <p>  In that regard, out of our approximately &euro;12 billion, we have analysis at a detailed level for approximately &euro;3.2 billion for 2013.  It is approximately a quarter of the total for the sample size.  It is statistically valid because it is such a big sample.  There is detail of expenditure for some key sectors, including health, education, justice and local government, so it includes much of the infrastructure of the State.  It would include garda&iacute; and local authorities, and we have much information for health and the education sector, albeit not small national schools.  This provides a good understanding of how the State spends its money.</p>  <p>  I can give some headlines on what that means as the above-threshold section only provides a view of the bigger picture.  The PwC report draws attention to this.</p> <p>In terms of small goods and services contracts, they are almost all won within the State.  The information I will provide will reinforce this statement.  The Minister read into the record of the D&aacute;il the fact that the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, had estimated that approximately 95% of all goods and services spend remained within the island of Ireland and approximately 75% of that expenditure was with small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  From the sample that we have in place, we have associated statistics.  There was &euro;2.7 billion of a spend in 2013.  The good news is that, while this is not quite 95%, 93.34% of all expenditure stayed within the island.</p> <p> Procurement is all about driving competition and some suppliers that might have had long-standing relationships with small public bodies do not like having to go through public competitions.  From the perspective of the taxpayer and procurement, it is a question of fairness, openness and transparency and of bringing a competition to bear, be it small or large, in which people routinely participate.  Sometimes, those long-standing relationships must be put to the test on behalf of the taxpayer.  Ultimately, this is why the directives and legislation are there.  On behalf of taxpayers, they require public bodies to go through this process and buy their goods and services in a fair, open and transparent way.  Our competitions often see anywhere between five and ten bidders.  As there can only be one winner, sometimes business moves.  We do not see the profile changing substantially at an overall level, however, so the business will stay on the island.  We are working with the business representative bodies to try to support Irish businesses to understand public procurement so that not only can they win business here, but also look to export more.</p> <p> I will discuss the statistics on SMEs.  Our previous estimate from a small sample was approximately 75%.  From this sample size of &euro;2.742 billion, 79% remains with SMEs and just under 21% goes to large businesses.  Relative to other countries, SMEs in Ireland do well.  Then again, Ireland has many small businesses relative to other European countries.</p> <p> There is a great deal of good news for Irish SMEs and other businesses, but we want to help them to become better.  Ultimately, our office is concerned with delivering value for money for the taxpayer via a competition process.  We want to assist SMEs in understanding that process and in developing their skills and capabilities so that they can compete fairly.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn referred to SMEs but it might be beyond many micro businesses that service Munster, for example, to tender elsewhere because they do not have the distribution networks and personnel to bid for the national supply of education material, etc.  How effective has the regionalisation of the market been?  We must be unapologetic in our structuring.  We must get prices, but we can also be creative so as to tilt the pitch more in favour of indigenous companies.  Micro and small businesses in particular could remain in service provision if the country was carved up in a way that suited them.  This cannot be done if prices are exorbitant, but many businesses with long-established records of regional service provision are finding that they cannot compete nationally because of scale.</p></speech>

Price is only one small aspect of the overall formula when assessing value for money.  We need to ensure that there is quality in the goods and services that are delivered, that the service level associated with that delivery, for example, after-sales support, is good, and that contractual protections are in place to protect the State.  The standing instruction from the Government under circular 10/14 is that it is not just a question of price.  Rather, the valuation should be based on what is called the most economically advantageous tender.</p>  <p>  In terms of regionalisation, many services that are delivered within the State are provided on a local basis.  For example, solicitor services for local authorities are delivered locally.  One would not find someone who would travel from Donegal to Dingle to provide a legal service.  It does not work that way.  Many of the goods and services that are consumed by the State are often consumed locally.  Consider cleaning.  One would not find people who would travel long distances to deliver that service.  However, there are other sectors in which services are delivered at a national level.  For example, energy and electricity are not delivered locally.  Neither is software.</p></speech>

I would like to believe that this will not be a one-off event.  The work that the office is doing is of such significance that we need to get into a rhythm of exchanges, feedback and oversight.</p>  <p>  I will not ask for a direct answer now, but I will say something for Mr. Quinn to consider.  He mentioned how the community and voluntary sector had been caught under the procurement process. Many in the sector are concerned that they will be outplayed by for-profit organisations.  Those in the sector work to a different ethos.  While the committee has an extensive work programme, it would be interesting to tease this argument out and to hear from The Wheel and other such organisations.  I urge Mr. Quinn to watch this situation carefully so that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water.</p>  <p>  I will make an observation on circular 10/14 relating to a matter that I have raised with Mr. Quinn and Mr. Campbell previously, namely, access for SMEs and micro businesses to the tendering process.  The office's exhortations to them to form alliances and networks do not always work and have caused them considerable difficulties.  Some of the businesses in question are in Deputy Creed's neck of the woods and elsewhere.  People have lost business.  This approach needs to be reworked, as it does not work for everyone and no amount of training courses or encouragement will alter that.</p>  <p>  What, if any, engagement, oversight or role does the office have in the flagship infrastructure enterprises, for example, Grangegorman and the children's hospital?  What linkage has the office with NAMA or other organisations in respect of the development of Dublin's docklands?</p>  <p>  The witnesses are aware that, like others, I am keen on social clauses in large contracts.  Mr. Quinn referred to piloting 11 projects.  While this is to be welcomed, it strikes me as being timid.</p> <p>The new European regime recognises in a more expansive way that it is not solely a question of price because there are consequences and knock-on effects for State expenditure from a social point of view, in terms of long-term unemployment, poverty and environmental concerns.  Beyond the 11 projects, what is the game plan for implementing these clauses?  Can we be assured that, within the boundaries of the law, the office will be as imaginative and expansive as it can in getting a return for society and the community?</p> <p> In his opening remarks, Mr. Quinn stated that responsibility and accountability for legal compliance rests with the organisation which undertakes the tender because the OGP lacks the resources and mandate to perform this crucial task centrally.  Is that a desirable state of affairs?  I ask that in light of the experience of school building projects overseen by the Department of Education and Skills, which gave rise to worrying controversies with, for example, Rhatigans and Kishogue college in Lucan.  There are similar cases elsewhere in Dublin.  I am concerned that while the office maintains rigorous standards of compliance for those who enter the tendering process, without a tight oversight mechanism the process could become sloppy and wide open to abuse.</p> <p> I have many other questions but the Chairman will not tolerate anything that stretches the committee's time unreasonably.  The definition of value for money is not just about price; it also includes quality and other factors.  I ask Mr. Quinn to set out the definition of value for money to which the OGP works.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to Grangegorman, the docklands and the children's hospital as examples of such projects.  We are not running procurement at an operational level for those individual projects.  In terms of policy, we have a clear remit in that regard.  Through our government construction contracts committee, we pull together the key stakeholders involved in executing capital works on an ongoing basis to examine the issues arising.  This could include the review of public works contracts or various other emerging requirements identified by the committee on behalf of constituent stakeholders, including the Department of Education and Skills, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Health.  From a policy perspective, we push out policy through that committee and consult it on the development of policy.  However, the office does not get involved with the day-to-day procurement activities of the individual projects.  I am a board member of the children's hospital and, as such, am intimately involved in procurement for that project but that is restricted to my personal role on the board.  As part of larger infrastructure projects, the policy team in particular works closely with the relevant organisations.  Thus, for example, our key construction advisor, Mr. David O'Brien, has a close working relationship with the CEO of Grangegorman Development Agency, Mr. Michael Hand.  We work hand-in-glove on bigger projects in the State because our advice is often sought in regard to various policy matters.  Implementation is left to the bodies concerned, however.</p>  <p>  On the question of social clauses, 11 projects are a reasonable start given our previous position.  I do not agree that it is a timid number because one of the key aspects of what we are trying to do is move outside of the construction space.  Internationally many social clauses focus on construction and employment.  We are trying to look beyond that to consider other services in respect of which ongoing social clauses can be implemented at an operational level.  We want to test this mechanism because we may need to consider specific aspects of individual goods or services, including in particular services for which social clauses might be difficult to implement in some cases but easy in others.  One of the reasons for setting up the group was to learn how we can do this well.  We can then publish guidelines and take the findings on board in developing legislation.  There are positive indications for what can be achieved from social clauses but there are also concerns about issues such as SME costs and the potential imbalance between the obligations of national and international parties.  If, for example, a tender obliges a construction firm to increase employment and the contract is won by a firm from outside the country, the workers could potentially be hired from outside of the State and the training could be provided outside of the State.  We do not want to create an uneven burden for national firms.  Concerns also arise in regard to displacement of jobs.  While we could force employers to hire, that could also require them to shed jobs.  We want to act carefully in regard to the advice we give to the Minister on how this policy will be formed.  We intend to learn a lot from expanding those arrangements.</p></speech>

There is a point at which the old adage, small is beautiful, is true.  I was at first quite pleased with circular 10-14, which issued on 16 April 2014.  Appendix 2 to the report sets out a matrix that can be used as a general guide to setting insurance level requirements for routine low to medium risk goods and services.  What is a low to medium risk good or service?  In other words, what value would it comprise and what type of service is potentially involved?</p></speech>

The reason I raise this is because I have come across situations in which people have been providing management consultancy services and have been asked for public liability insurance of &euro;6.5 million.  Does Mr. Quinn know how much it costs to procure public liability insurance of &euro;6.5 million?</p>  <p>  I know from reading the guidance notes that those tendering for business have to be able to get the insurance, without having to have it in place at the time they apply for the tender.  I know this to be the case because I have been approached on this point by people in my constituency who say they would not apply for a tender which they would be able to perform because as, say, a two-person company they would not be able to afford the cost of public liability insurance of &euro;6.5 million or &euro;12.7 million.  Unless I am losing the plot, although I do not think so, those levels of public liability insurance are outrageous.  What is the logic of it?  For the sake of argument, let us suppose I am providing arts and crafts material to the local school then under the public procurements requirement I am required to have this level of public liability insurance.  That does not make sense.</p>  <p>  In respect of professional indemnity, I am aware of contracts below the value of &euro;50,000 that have been put out to tender which required professional indemnity insurance of &euro;3.6 million.  It is stated in the documentation that the level of insurance must be proportionate to the job that is being done, that the level of turnover has to be related to the contract.  I was very pleased initially to see this but when I read the conditions on the back page they made no sense.</p></speech>

It is not specific.  Some of these items may have no relevance to the good and services being procured.  The Senator mentioned advisory and consultancy services but environmental liability insurance has no relevance to those services and would not be required.  It is a general guide.</p></speech>

The reason we put in place this guidance and in particular appendix 2, is to deal with professional indemnity and product liability.  Some of the numbers that were appearing in tenders were extraordinary relative to the procurements that were taking place.  The general guidance on employer's liability, public liability and environmental liability, where they apply, are typical and having spent many years in procurement these are typical values and would generally be put in place by professional firms that are undertaking works in those areas.</p></speech>

Deputy McDonald made the point about micro-businesses.  We are trying to put the economy back on its feet and encourage people into business.  Not all of the tenders will be from large professional firms that would have standing insurance in place but might, for the sake of argument, be by people who are trying to set up a business.</p></speech>

Prior to the issue of the guidance advice, if in the past one were to pick up a tender that would have included professional indemnity and product liability insurance the person concerned might have had to deal with extraordinary values.  We have brought the values down and this has been welcomed by bodies such as IBEC because previously firms were being asked to procure ridiculous levels of insurance.</p></speech>

I take his point, and I raised with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on a number of occasions the fact that outlandish amounts of insurance, in particular professional indemnity insurance, has been required for contracts.  With regard to one size fits all, I note Mr. Quinn's point in section 6 that those who considered tendering could obtain advice but from my experience I suspect that what is happening is that the one size fits all is in the public domain but it does not fit all.  It certainly does not fit small, sole traders or very small companies trying to bid for contracts.</p></speech>

This is general guidance, it is set out and written down as general guidance.  It provides an opportunity for contracting authorities to go back to the State Claims Agency and have a conversation with them about the limits they should actually put in place.  It was broadly welcomed by industry because it brought down the level of professional indemnity and product liability insurance.  It brought the numbers down very considerably from what went beforehand.  People did not know what levels to apply and typically took an extraordinarily conservation view, whereas most contracting authorities simply need to cover a basic level of risk.  Risk is a specific area and there are people who far better trained in that-----</p></speech>

With regard to the collation of information, Mr. Quinn has stated that he is not collating information from capital projects now.  Is it his intention to collate this information in the future?  If not, will it be the case that the Departments will collate the information because there is an information deficit?  The second question concerns a report on the review of performance of public works contracts.  The construction industry is in chaos in many ways.  Construction at Kishoge Community College is a prime example.  On this project workers have been out on picket on a daily basis for nearly a year.  I understand the review looks at industrial disputes between the main contractor on the site and the people who are contracting the tender.</p> <p>However, the problem is much deeper than this with subcontracting.  There are subcontractors on the site at Kishoge who are not even paying the minimum wage.  All of the issues associated with terms and conditions are completely ignored.  In such a case, the main contractor throws up his hands and says it has nothing to do him.  That is what is happening is further down the contracting food chain.  The problem is arising on the site at Kishoge and we know that it is arising on other sites also.  Owing to the broken nature of the construction industry and the fact that most new contracts are State contracts, what I describe is becoming the norm in the case of private contracts.  Therefore, there is a contagion effect.  Is it important that the Office of Government Procurement seek to ensure what I have described does not happen and fix this element of the system?  Will it be able to ensure contracts between a contracting organisation and the main contractor are actually adhered to?  My information is that the contracts determine that all responsibility falls on subcontractors further down the food chain.</p> <p> My second question is on the performance of public works contracts.  Will the CPO formally include the workers' aspects in the performance of public works contracts in the future?</p></speech>

We published, just prior to Christmas, a set of interim recommendations for implementation.  These recommendations have been welcomed broadly by the construction industry, which is good.  In fact, the industry is anxious that we implement the recommendations quickly, which is welcome.  The majority of the interim recommendations will involve changes in the first calendar quarter.  One of them will extend into the second calendar quarter because of its complexity.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has mentioned, in particular, that there is a new role envisaged within the public works arrangements, namely, that of what is called a dispute convener.  For larger contracts, I understand the process applies for values in excess of &euro;10 million.  A dispute convener would be appointed at a very early stage in the contract and his or her role would be to try to resolve disputes as they occurred during the life cycle of the project, rather than hitting a brick wall, which would involve the walls coming down and the project stopping.  In such circumstances, people walk off site and difficulties ensue from everybody's perspective, not only that of the workers but also those of the State and contractors.  When works stop, it is very difficult and costly for everybody.</p>  <p>  The dispute convener's responsibility is to keep the parties talking and become familiar with the project, the arrangements and progress made.  Another duty is to iron out issues as they arise and keep momentum going in a project.  This may stop issues becoming part of more formal contract dispute arrangements, conciliation, arbitration and, ultimately, court proceedings.  I guess the colloquial term would be "nipping things in the bud" in trying to have them resolved early and on site.</p>  <p>  In regard to the site at Kishoge, we discussed the matter previously.  There are a number of layers of protection that the State ensures within the procurement process.  These place obligations not only on the main contractors but also on subcontractors.  They apply at tender stage in terms of declarations that the parties will adhere to and are clear on parties' obligations regarding social welfare contributions and tax, in regard to which there is clearance.  At award stage, the parties must certify their tax clearance certificates.  Most importantly, at implementation stage, the contractors and subcontractors have to adhere to all legal obligations.  To continue to be paid, they must submit on an ongoing basis a certificate, under clause 5.3, stating they are continuing to adhere to all obligations.  They must maintain records indicating they are discharging these obligations.  The State has the right to audit the payments and withhold payment if certification is not provided.  Ultimately, it can terminate the contract if the contractor fails to remedy a problem.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked, in particular, about my office's ability or oversight of these matters.  On occasion, we are drawn into arrangements such as those mentioned, but we do not have a mandate or operational capability to oversee the thousands of projects in train.  On oversight, we rely on other bodies such as NERA which has expertise in matters of payment and the payment of social welfare, etc.  It  is the compliance body in these matters.</p></speech>

I welcome from the Department of Finance Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, and Mr. John Hogan, assistant secretary, banking division.  The format is that they will make some opening remarks which will be followed by a question and answer session.  I remind members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off as they interfere with the broadcasting of proceedings.<br />By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br />I ask the delegates to restrict their presentations to a maximum of ten to 15 minutes, if possible, so as to answer the maximum number of questions from members.</p></speech>

I will make a short statement on the annual growth survey and the alert mechanism report, while Mr. Hogan will speak about the investment plan for Europe.  Our opening statements will be very short.</p>  <p>  I thank the joint committee for the invitation to discuss the annual growth survey and the alert mechanism report for 2015.  I am the assistant secretary in charge of the economic division of the Department.  The European semester is the annual cycle of policy co-ordination in the European Union, the aim of which is to improve policy making in member states, taking into account the greater interconnectedness among them.  The starting point of the semester is, as always, publication by the Commission of the annual growth survey each November.  The role of the survey is to highlight the general economic priorities for the European Union for the coming year.  It is debated by both the Council and the Parliament and subsequently endorsed by the March European Council.  Once endorsed, the priorities are supposed to be taken into account by member states in their national reform plans and stability programme updates which are submitted to the Commission and the Council in April.  The Council subsequently adopts country-specific recommendations for each member state in June.  This year's survey was published last November, thus beginning the fifth cycle of policy co-ordination in the semester, and it is the second time Ireland has formally participated in the process.  As a programme country, it was exempt from the process until 2013.</p>  <p>  Three interrelated reform priorities were identified in the 2015 survey, namely, a renewed commitment to structural reforms, a co-ordinated approach to boosting investment in the European Union and a pursuit of fiscal responsibility.  The Commission argued that action was needed in all three areas.  It also adopted the so-called alert mechanism report, AMR, an early warning system that is embedded in the macroeconomic imbalances procedure.  The origins of the procedure lie in the fact that economic imbalances, not just fiscal imbalances, were at the heart of the euro area crisis.  Therefore, the role of the procedure is to identify and address imbalances that hinder the smooth functioning of monetary union.  The AMR is an initial screening device based on a scoreboard of 11 economic indicators, each with indicative thresholds.  The indicators cover both internal and external imbalances.  Based on an overall assessment, rather than a purely mechanical reading of the scoreboard, the Commission may decide an in-depth review is warranted in order to assess whether a policy response is needed in a member state.  The in-depth review forms the analytical base for dialogue between member states and the Commission on the appropriate policies to correct the imbalances.</p>  <p>  For this year, based on the scoreboard, the Commission has decided that in-depth reviews are warranted in 16 member states, including Ireland.  In the Irish case, the imbalances are legacy ones.  They are stock variables, rather than flow variables.  I have included the list of 11 variables as an appendix to my presentation to the committee.  When I refer to stock variables, I refer to imbalances that accumulated during the bubble years and which are in the process of unwinding, although the unwinding will take time.  The new Commission has proposed a streamlining of the semester, which means the publication of a single analytical in March this year, incorporating the results of the in-depth review.  The rationale for this is to allow member states to engage in a more meaningful way with the Commission before publication of the CSRs in June.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.693" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hogan" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012100012#M00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address the joint committee on the investment plan for Europe which aims to address the low level of investment in Europe in recent years, thereby promoting economic growth and increased employment.  Although European Commission estimates put the drop in investment at about 15% compared to 2007 figures, within this there are variations across member states.  In response, the Commission has brought forward its proposals for action in the form of the investment plan for Europe.  Launched on 26 November last and endorsed by European leaders in December, the plan proposes a number of measures to unlock public and private investment in the European economy of some &euro;315 billion in the next three years.<br/>The plan has three key strands, namely, actions to mobilise finance for investments, ensuring finance reaches the real economy in Europe, and measures to improve the investment environment in Europe.  In order to mobilise finance for investment, as the key action, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank have proposed the establishment of a new European fund for strategic investments, EFSI.  Seed capital for the fund will be provided by the Commission in the form of an EU guarantee of some &euro;16 billion, together with an investment of &euro;5 billion from the EIB.  While other possible public and private contributions may add to this total, the Commission and the EIB estimate that the initial funding of &euro;21 billion can be leveraged to facilitate a total investment of some &euro;315 billion, with &euro;240 billion earmarked for long-term investments and &euro;75 billion channelled to SME and mid-cap companies.<br/>A legislative proposal in the form of a regulation to give effect to the EFSI has been published and this week member states began discussions on the instrument in Brussels.  The Latvian Presidency has set out an intensive programme of meetings aimed at working through the proposed regulation in order to reach common agreement across member states in time for the March ECOFIN.  Building in discussions with the Parliament, the timeline for adoption of the regulation is envisaged for the summer, which means that, with the establishment of the fund, the formalisation of the governance arrangements, etc., the first activity by the fund is not likely to happen until the autumn.  It is expected that advance work will be undertaken to warehouse projects which can be assessed as being supportable <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the EFSI&rsquo;s criteria.  These could be funded quickly under the EFSI once it is active.<br/>Under the second strand to ensure finance can reach the real economy, a special task force was established last October to develop an EU project pipeline of viable investments of European significance.  The task force was jointly chaired by the EIB and the European Commission and included a representative from each member state.  The task force had a key objective of compiling, by the end of the year, a list of economically valuable strategic investments across the public and private sectors.  The aim was to try to identify and highlight projects across Europe that not being advanced owing to economic, regulatory, financial or other reasons.  The task force also sought to identify barriers and bottlenecks to project investment and propose solutions.  The complete list contains approximately 2,000 projects from the 28 member states, with a total investment value of &euro;1.3 trillion.<br/>As part of this process, Ireland submitted a list of 70 projects, valued at approximately &euro;23 billion.  The Irish project list represented a compilation of potential investment projects as put forward by the Departments with policy responsibility for the relevant sectors but without any overall assessment or prioritisation of the projects from a national perspective.  Inclusion in the list submitted to the EU-EIB task force does not confer any particular status or guarantee of funding for the projects in question, either at a national or European level.  It represents a compilation of potential investment projects in the relevant sectors, any of which could potentially be commenced between 2015 and 2017, subject to being evaluated and approved by the relevant sanctioning authority, typically the relevant Government Department, in compliance with the public spending code and subject to funding being available.  There is no prioritisation of projects within the list.  The Irish projects were not assessed or endorsed by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance prior to their submission to the EU-EIB task force as the urgency attaching to the European request did not allow time for Ireland or other member states to do this.<br/>Similar statements attached to almost all of the lists submitted by the 28 member states and any proposal to proceed on Irish projects would be subject to the normal capital expenditure and cost-benefit assessments and having regard to Government priorities for investment.  The overall list does, however, serve the useful purpose of highlighting for potential investors a pipeline of projects across Europe which, with some risk support from the EFSI, could proceed.  The EFSI is intended to provide support through the provision of debt funding, not grants for such projects.  This has implications for the debt and fiscal position of member states in the context of public investment projects.<br/>As the committee is aware, the Commission published guidance on the existing flexibility under the Stability and Growth Pact rules, following through on a commitment given at the June 2014 European Council and given concerns voiced by member states in the lead-up to the December European Council.  The Commission's release accompanying its guidance stated member state contributions to the EFSI would not be counted when assessing the fiscal adjustment.  This will be the case for all member states, whether in the preventive or corrective arm of the pact.  The Commission&rsquo;s release also stated for countries benefiting from the so-called &quot;investment clause&quot;, co-financing with the EFSI of projects or investment platforms would also benefit from favourable treatment under the pact.  The Commission also stated that, irrespective of the EUROSTAT accounting treatment, it would take a favourable position towards such voluntary capital contributions to the EFSI for the purposes of the assessment of the debt and deficit criteria under the Stability and Growth Pact.</p> <p> We are still considering the exact value of this guidance to Ireland in the context of the positive developments in the Irish economy in 2014 and the expectations for 2015.  Finally, in promoting the final strand of work on the plan in the area of improving the investment environment, the Commission is committed to improving the predictability and quality of regulation in Europe and to removing sector-specific and financial barriers to investment.</p> <p> Ireland is approaching work around the European investment plan in as open and constructive a fashion as possible through full participation in the negotiation of the European fund for strategic investments regulation and any continuation of the work under the project task force.  This is necessary to ensure that we take appropriate opportunities which make economic and budgetary sense if they arise as part of the final political agreement on the EFSI proposal.</p> <p> I thank the committee members for their attention.  We are happy to take follow-up questions and provide further clarity if required.</p></speech>

Can the officials explain why GDP growth is ahead outside the eurozone countries?  Why is there greater growth outside the eurozone by comparison with the eurozone?  We have the figures.  Is this the trend we have been seeing in recent times?</p></speech>

Obviously, that has a large weight in the overall EU figures.  The UK is generally perceived to be further down the line in terms of balance sheet repair.  The UK was ahead of the curve in respect of monetary policy being more supportive of growth and so forth.  It is a more flexible economy.  The UK does not have some of the issues that arise in the euro area as a whole in terms of the fragmentation of financial markets or the debt overhang to which I referred.  I will put some figures on it.  For this year, the IMF is forecasting euro area growth of 1.1% and EU growth of 1.5%.  The main difference between the two is due to the rapid growth in the UK.</p></speech>

It is a more aggressive approach to tax evasion.  Is the Department's position still that there is nothing to see here in respect of the Commission's investigation into the activities of a multinational company here?  Has the Department formalised an approach on whether it will co-operate with the European Parliament investigation into deals in this member state and others?</p></speech>

We hear the term time and again.  During the budget, the Minister for Finance and other senior Ministers referred to how reducing the tax rate at the highest level would create so many jobs over so many years.  Is it the case that an investment or social transfer of equal value would create the same amount of jobs?  Has any analysis been done in that area?</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty is correct.  The document refers to growth-friendly fiscal consolidation.  This applies on the revenue side as well as on the expenditure side.  On the revenue side, essentially the Commission is referring to a budget-neutral shift away from taxation of labour towards more environmentally friendly areas, including indirect taxes and so forth.  On the expenditure side, the Commission is referring to maintaining investment in physical capital as well as human capital.  The research in this area suggests that we can do this in a budget-neutral way and that it would have a favourable impact on potential growth in the economy through, for example, participation rates on the labour supply side.  Moreover, the thinking goes, if we are investing then we are boosting our capital stock.  This is essentially where the Commission is coming from in respect of this recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.708" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012100013#N01500"><p>That translates into what I have referenced in respect of the statement on budget day to the effect that reduction of the top rate of tax would create X jobs over X years.  If an investment or social transfer of equal value were to take place, would it have the same impact in terms of job creation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.709" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012100013#N01600"><p>It depends on the type of investment undertaken.  We published some analysis approximately 18 months ago showing the impact of different types of reform, including changes in labour tax.  The analysis included the impact they might have on the economy, the impact on the supply side and the impact on job creation.  The specific answer to Deputy Doherty's question is that it depends on the type of investment.  For example, if we opted to import more trains and so on it would have no impact in terms of job creation because they are sourced from abroad.  However, if we do more investment in building and construction then we will get typically more bang for our buck.</p></speech>

One of the EU budgetary rules is the expenditure benchmark, something the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has raised several times, as have I.  This limits new spending, including tax cuts, to the rate of growth.  Can the Department officials set out the legal basis of this rule?  How does it differ from rules such as the 3% deficit rule and the 60% debt rule?  In drafting next year's budget with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will the Department of Finance consider the rule binding?  What are the penalties if the Government were to breach it?  I am keen for the officials to comment, given the fact that in a reply to a Parliamentary Question the Minister provided figures suggesting that sticking to the benchmark would mean that any adjustment in budget 2016 would be limited to &euro;400 million.  Is that figure still accurate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012100013#N01800"><p>The legal basis for the expenditure benchmark is Article 126 of the treaty.  That is the primary legislation.  The secondary legislation is Regulation No. 1466.  This is the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, which was reformed in 2011.  Essentially, the anchor of the preventive arm is the so-called balanced budget or medium-term budgetary objective.  In the past, this was assessed on the basis of changes in the structural balance and how fast countries were approaching their medium-term budgetary objective.  The reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact in 2011 introduced the concept of the expenditure benchmark.  The legal basis for that is Article 126.</p>  <p>  The overall objective of the benchmark is to set spending in line with the potential growth rate of the economy.  It is averaged over a ten-year period.  If a country is not at its medium-term budgetary objective, there is a so-called convergence margin.  The county must have expenditure below the benchmark and must be converging sufficiently rapidly to the medium-term budgetary objective.</p>  <p>  In respect of what it actually means in monetary terms, I am simply not in a position to answer today, I am afraid.</p></speech>

Is it one of these rules that are somewhat fluffy around the edges?  What if we breach it?  I realise things can change in terms of revenues and growth rates and so on.  I expect the Department's information was correct late last year when it produced a figure of &euro;400 million.  What if the Government were to surpass that in terms of expenditure or tax cuts?  The Government has already announced that it will cut taxes.  This will suck up some of the &euro;400 million.  What would actually happen if we break this rule?  What kicks in?</p></speech>

We must be approaching the medium-term budgetary objective based on either a change in structural balance or an assessment of the benchmark.  Finally, an overall assessment is undertaken, and we must be approaching the medium-term budgetary objective at a sufficient pace.  That is binding.</p> <p>The reforms of the pact in 2011 introduced what is called the sanctions regulation, which provides for sanctions in the preventive arm of the pact.  They never existed previously.  They were only ever in the corrective arm of the pact.  In terms of what that means, the rules are very much binding.<br/>With regard to the draft budgetary plans of euro area member states that were assessed last November and December, the Commission kicked to touch on a number of countries, including Italy.  Italy has to revert to it in March because it is breaching the requirements of the preventive arm.  Italy has to sort it out and come back to the Commission.  Otherwise, potentially there are sanctions coming down the line.  <br/>I stress that financial sanctions can only apply in an <i>ex-post</i>manner.  In other words, a country cannot be sanctioned on the basis of projections.  It is only on the basis of outturn data.  However, there is a regulation that has introduced financial sanctions and those sanctions are quasi-automatic, in other words, one is guilty unless one is proven innocent.  The Commission will adopt a decision to impose sanctions and that cannot be overturned unless a reverse qualified majority of member states overturn it.</p></speech>

The legal and procedural implications are in the remit of the Commission and the Council.  I stress that the investment clause we are talking about here only applies in the preventive arm of the pact.  If a country's deficit is greater than 3%, it cannot apply the investment clause.  Even within the preventive arm of the pact a country must have negative GDP growth or a negative output gap in excess of 1.5% of GDP.  It needs to build in a safety margin with respect to the 3%, therefore, it is not a free for all on the investment side.</p></speech>

Each Presidency has tried to improve the operation of the semester.  In terms of this year, the overall streamlining involves the publication of a single analytical document.  Until now, two documents have been published, namely, the in-depth review and what is known as the staff working document, which was published every June.  The intention is that these documents will be rolled into one document that will be published in mid-March.  This will allow member states and the Commission to better prepare the country-specific recommendations.  These are the types of concrete changes being made; I would not describe them as "game changers".  The new Commission has proposed a little streamlining and the Latvian Presidency is running with its proposal.  The purpose is to allow member states and the Commission to engage in a more meaningful manner and come up with more appropriate country-specific recommendations, which form the policy plank, if one likes, for the following 18 months.</p></speech>

This is important because the growth survey and other information on developments in the European semester refer to the European institutions and national governments.  However, the joint committee could also be more involved in the process.  Is that not the case?  I am concerned that the committee could become a little detached from the process.  Should it seek more resources and do more on this issue?</p></speech>

The two concrete pieces of work that are done by the Irish system in the European semester are the publication of national reform plans, which are overseen by our colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach, and the publication by the Department of Finance of the stability programme update in mid or late April.  Last year was the first year that Ireland was formally involved in the process.  The Minister appeared before the committee to present in draft form the main results of the stability programme update.  At that time, he indicated he was open to taking on board comments from committee members.  Subject to the Minister's approval, we would certainly be willing to do that again.  The Chairman is correct - this point is stressed by the Commission in the survey - that there is greater scope for national parliaments to engage in this process.</p></speech>

I wrote to the former President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, following his refusal to attend the banking inquiry, which is taking place in the adjacent committee room.  I indicated to Mr. Draghi that his decision would be a lost opportunity for the ECB to present its case to Irish people via the Irish Parliament.  There is always the risk that people will not have a sense of ownership of the budgetary process if it is primarily dealt with in the European institutions and they do not see a public pathway for Parliament to deal with the budget.</p>  <p>  Mr. McCarthy indicated that the Minister, as part of the Executive, may seek the considered opinions of the joint committee.  The committee does not receive much in the way of resources to fully address issues of this nature.  Given how important the European semester will become in the years ahead and as this process is new to the joint committee, perhaps a mechanism should be established to involve the committee in the process at the deepest possible level in order that it will be viewed as a participant in the semester procedure.  This is the only way the process will gain public acceptance in the long term.</p> <p>This process might be beneficial and seen as an area of co-operation between us rather than the EU imposing its opinions on us.</p></speech>

In regard to the global figures, obviously, there is a great deal of criticism of the fact that there is no new money in that the &euro;8 billion, multiplied by two, for existing projects and &euro;5 billion from the EIB, is being leveraged up until the figure of &euro;315 billion is reached.  Is this a serious weakness in terms of the investment plan?  The focus on investment is welcome.  This was absent from the mainstream analysis of the crisis up until a couple of years ago.  However, does this plan really address the problem if no new money is being invested in it?</p></speech>

The Commission estimates that the drop in investment will be approximately 15% as compared with 2007.  The incoming Commission was very focused on how to get investment moving again in Europe and at looking and new and innovative ways of doing this.  What we see here is an attempt to do it on a number of different levels, including through the putting in place, through the ESFI, of a fund, which as the Deputy rightly says can be leveraged up.  I will ask Mr. Petris to comment later on the mechanics of that.  </p>  <p>  The Commission also wanted to find a mechanism by which private finance could be encouraged to invest in the future of Europe.  It is seeking to facilitate this through making available this project pipeline to enable investors to get a real picture of large-scale projects at a European level, which by virtue of the fact that there may not be sufficient finance available through traditional means, may be open for new and innovative forms of financing.  These are projects in which the European authorities were prepared to invest, take a first-loss piece in or guarantee during the initial phase of the investment and in respect of which they are now seeking to unlock private sector investment.  The building blocks to allow this are being put in place.  Mr. Petris will speak a little now about the transformation of the &euro;8 billion from the EU budget and the &euro;5 billion from the EIB.</p></speech>

It is seeking to do this by leveraging its resources to de-risk projects which, in turn, will attract private sector co-investment.  In terms of the mechanics around the cash contributions, the EIB and the Commission are seeking to put in a total of &euro;21 billion, &euro;16 billion of which will come in via guarantees from the Commission and &euro;5 billion will be provided by the EIB using own resources.  Some of the media headlines have taken the &euro;21 billion and the end project pipeline of &euro;315 billion and come up with a 15 times leverage, which is considered bonkers.  I will try to explain the dynamics of this which, to me, makes more sense.  The EIB takes the &euro;21 billion and leverages that internally in order to bring the &euro;21 billion to &euro;60 billion.  This is something that banks do all of the time.  They issue bonds and they raise their capital and then have more money to invest.  The EIB-Commission bucket of investment is in the context of a three-times leverage, &euro;63 billion.  What the EIB-Commission are seeking to do is leverage this a further five times with private sector co-investment so as to reach an end total project volume of &euro;315 billion.  A five-times leverage is not that unbelievable.</p></speech>

We have just been through a financial crisis which arose because of fictitious capital and this is our answer.  In the context of a social revolution across Europe and a Government committed to public investment, would it not be preferable to have an actual &euro;300 billion investment as opposed to a notional &euro;300 billion based on &euro;13 billion?</p></speech>

He is correct that it would always be preferable to have the cash available waiting to be deployed.  What the EIB and Commission are seeking to do in this case is use their limited resources in a more efficient way and to try to de-risk projects and attract in private sector co-investment.  As I understand it, and based on my experience having attended EIB board meetings, there is no shortage of private sector co-investors seeking to invest at a senior level.  Institutional investors and funds are interested in investing now.</p></speech>

As such any losses incurred will in the first instance hit the public and, second, the private investment.  Risk still exists.  A project will either have risks or no risks on its own merits so that risk is being transferred from private to public.</p></speech>

In terms of dead-weight, how do the Commission and EIB know that these people would not have invested and risked their own money in any case?  In other words, the investors, because of the public offering in the form of the Commission and the EIB, now propose to take the risk on and allow the public to take the risk in what they would have invested in any case.</p></speech>

We are at early stages in terms of the negotiation around the European Fund for Strategic Investment.  I can tell the Deputy, based on the regulation that has been published, that a steering committee, consisting of the European Commission, the EIB and other participants, for example, from members states, is to be put in place.  There will also be an investment committee which will include market experts and a managing director and will assess the projects from an investment perspective.  The investment guidelines have yet to be determined and drafted.  As we understand it from the early stages of the negotiation on the regulation, they will be drafted by the steering committee when in place.  At that stage, it will be possible to make a more sensible assessment of what is being done in terms of the approach by the investment committee.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that the EIB has been involved in this particular venture over a long number of years.  The European Investment Fund has previously looked at taking first-loss pieces and has been able to unlock valuable private sector investment in projects Europe for a number of years.  As Mr. Petris said there is to a certain extent a fairly safe track record at Europe level in some of the approaches that are being suggested in this regard.  It is an attempt by the Commission, taking account of the dearth of investment in Europe over the past number of years, to find some mechanism to unlock it against what we still see as a background of economic uncertainty.</p></speech>

Mr. Juncker referred in his speech to a school in Thessalonika in Greece and other grand projects in the public services area that could now be properly funded as a result of this.  I presume the projects about which we are now speaking are projects that previously would have been paid for by the State or through public-private partnerships.  How do the private investors get a return?</p> <p>To take the example of a school building project, the money presumably comes directly from the taxpayer.  How does this work when a project is not generating revenue?  Where is the return for private investors? </p></speech>

In sectoral terms, in the energy sector, the total investment in the projects put forward by Ireland was approximately &euro;2.55 billion; it was estimated that &euro;2.25 billion of this could possibly be invested between 2015 and 2017.  In the knowledge and digital economy the total investment suggested was &euro;730 million, with &euro;500 million possibly being invested between 2015 and 2017.  In the broad area of resources and the environment the total investment suggested was approximately &euro;1.86 billion, with &euro;460 million possibly being invested between 2015 and 2017.  The figure for the transport sector was &euro;11.32 billion, with &euro;1.71 billion possibly being invested in the next two years.  The figure for social infrastructure was &euro;5 billion, with the last category being SME lending, in respect of which a total investment of &euro;800 million was suggested, with a further investment of &euro;800 million being possible between 2015 and 2017.</p>  <p>  In terms of a return on its investment for the private sector, it depends on the nature and construct of the proposal being put in place.  It really depends on the outcome of individual operation agreements but is not without precedent.  We have a number of PPP projects in Ireland involving private sector investors.  Such projects have been under way here for a number of years and I do not see any major difference in the approach taken.</p></speech>

I ask the Chairman to guide me in that regard.  </p>  <p>  The issue of house prices in Ireland was flagged, but when I read the report, I could not see it highlighted hugely by the Commission.  A concern about house prices is highlighted in the Department's briefing note.  I consider it to be a big issue and would like to know what the Commission is saying about it.</p>  <p>  On the question of structural reforms, there are four examples given on page 11 of the annual growth survey of structural reforms that have been implemented in Spain, Portugal, Poland and Italy.  While I accept that Ireland's economy has been reformed and that a lot of reforms have taken place, there is still a lot more to be done.  I contend that since the end of the troika programme we have been extremely slow to reform and open up the legal profession and to deal with top-level consultants in the medical profession.  We have also been slow in dealing with the issue of pharmacological products, although there have been some changes made in that area.  Italy, for example, has implemented measures aimed at increasing competition and transparency in the gas and electricity markets.  We have not done a whole lot in that regard and are certainly not being singled out by the Commission as a good example.</p>  <p>  Another issue raised in the annual growth survey is responsible, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation.  On page 15 of the report the Commission highlights the fall in investment expenditure.  Capital expenditure has dropped dramatically here.  I argue that it has dropped much more under the Government than was envisaged under the troika agreement and the national recovery plan of the previous Government.  This was done to avoid more politically unpalatable decisions on current expenditure, but it means that we are now less growth-friendly in terms of fiscal consolidation in that we have cut expenditure that would have helped us to grow.  Do the delegates have any view on the matter?</p></speech>

The Senator made a very valid point about house prices.  I stress that the scoreboard is backward looking and only based on data from 2013.  I strongly suspect that when the Commission engages in this exercise next year, the indicator for Ireland will be flashing red because, in all likelihood, we will be above the threshold.</p></speech>

That is being done in various ways within the Construction 2020 framework which includes 75 time-bound actions to help to address various issues, including planning, access to finance, regulations and so forth.  There are a number of initiatives under way.  Unfortunately, increasing supply is not something that happens over night.  There is a long lead-in time, which is just the nature of the beast.</p>  <p>  On structural reforms, I will not be specific, but I tend to agree with the Senator that there is scope for further structural reforms in the economy.  There is a need for more competition and to reduce regulatory barriers and so forth.  The Senator has also correctly made the point that we already have a flexible economy.  If one looks at the OECD's research in this area, one will find that Ireland tends to be at the more flexible end, both in product markets and factor markets, but that is not to say there is not more to be done.  I tend to agree with the Senator in that regard.</p>  <p>  On growth-friendly consolidation, if I recall correctly, we were the subject of a CSR, country specific recommendation, last year and could easily be the subject of one again this year, that the composition of the fiscal adjustment or our fiscal stance be more growth-friendly.  I am 90% sure that was the case last year and it is not inconceivable that we could receive the same recommendation this year.</p></speech>

I have misgivings about what the Commission is up to.  The fiscal council has shown that, in terms of gains being made in a small, open economy, there is no multiplier.  On Senator Thomas Byrne's point, we had to cut capital spending because of the debt burden, partly due to the bank guarantee.  Prior to that happening, however, we did not run too many Government deficits, but there were many capital projects which did not yield a return.  We need an appraisal from people like our guests to be published in advance to determine if projects would be worthwhile.  We must determine if they would be the fruit of lobbying by those looking for soft financial conditions or a sop to the construction industry, as happened frequently in the past.  Spending on such projects reduces the efficiency of the overall economy.</p>  <p>  I was a member of a cross-Border committee which was told that the first cost estimate for the construction of the Narrow Water bridge was &euro;12 million.  Someone then heard that the European Union was involved in providing finance and the estimate jumped to &euro;40 million.  The money is now being spent instead on the Enterprise service, but they are probably both dud projects in terms of yielding a return.  </p>  <p>  Interest rates are at a record low level in Europe, but the private sector is not investing.  Is this just the provision of a subsidy for the banking and construction sectors by a different route?  Will it really stimulate output?</p> <p>Is it the problem in the United States of Wall Street versus Main Street?  As for a strong public sector with good project appraisal, I have written some appraisals for the Institute of Public Administration and so on, but in respect of the mixtures, I always fear that the taxpayer gets stuck with the dud ones and stuck with the debt.  I am particularly concerned about the off-balance sheet financing of Irish Water.  While it has not yet been sanctioned by EUROSTAT, there is an element of illusion about it.  In the past, I thought that Transport 21 was the worst one in that it was just grandiose projects whereby engineers feel better, the construction industry thinks they are great but nothing happens in terms of the growth of the economy.  While one can assume these are great projects and so on, after all that has happened to us since 2008 one needs really strong evidence that they are.</p> <p> I do not know what will happen in Greece on Sunday but how much of the economy in a place like Greece would be stimulated by having a flexible exchange rate to get into the market economy or if it had the ability to set its own interest rates?  It is the economics of being locked into something that obviously is not working and, unfortunately, we came at the very end.  Is there any way in which we can substitute for the rigidity the eurozone imposes on us while thanking the Lord that the United Kingdom and United States are buying lots of stuff from us?  As a country that has just come out of a rescue plan, it is very difficult for Ireland in particular to reform Europe but, as it stands, the system is highly deficient.  Projects are determined by who lobbies or by who has the biggest public relations department.  Perhaps the studies have all been done and are being kept in secret somewhere in Brussels or Frankfurt but when some of them are announced, people just think there will be a massive cost overrun, there usually is and it does not really have any great impact.  When one robs Peter to pay Paul, although Paul, his accountant, his tax lawyer and his banker usually think it is a great idea, what about the rest of us?</p> <p> While I do not know what will emerge tomorrow when Mr. Draghi is to decide, it should be something other than being construction-based.  As housing has been mentioned, I note that Mr. Brendan Burgess appeared before the joint committee recently and sat in the seat currently occupied by Mr. John McCarthy.  He reckoned that approximately &euro;67,000 of the average house price is accounted for by taxes, levies, planning and so on.  Would reducing the price of houses by &euro;67,000 not be the best way?  That would get the markets going.  However, if one pours in more demand, one starts out with the problem with prices and I support Professor Honohan on the 20% deposit.  I am not sure that Brussels and Frankfurt inspire the brightest ideas for what is wrong with the Irish economy at present.  That could be a reaction to Monday's conference at which we were patted on the back, told we were very good and so on.  Not many people in the audience felt very good; the last session sort of collapsed.  There must be something better coming from Brussels in respect of economic policy.  I know what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, seeks tomorrow and I wish him well in that regard.  These projects are almost a Joe Stalin kind of economics, except that the private sector gets a substantial bailout from them.  I do not know how the projects are chosen, how they are evaluated or where one can read what they are worth and so on, but I must express disquiet about the process.  I will leave it at that and thank the four witnesses.</p></speech>

I tend to agree with the first point he made about how it was necessary to cut capital.  I agree because, in 2010, the OECD undertook a survey of the Irish economy, as it does every two years.  It stated there were a number of projects in the pipeline that only just crossed the cost-benefit analysis line.  However, that cost-benefit analysis had been done on the basis of growth rates of 4% or 4.5% coming down the line and once there was a reassessment of the position to the effect that the potential growth rate of the economy was lower than had been assumed, many of these projects were not viable.  As the OECD recommended that some capital projects should be cut, there is research to support one argument the Senator is making.  I should stress that what the growth survey does is very much European Union-wide and within that, when fiscal responsibility is being talked about, it is not simply aimed at consolidation.  There are implicit recommendations to some countries that have fiscal space.  I think the Senator knows about which country I am talking.  It has large infrastructural needs and, as the Senator quite rightly noted, can pretty much borrow at record lows.  As a result, the rate of return on the investment would be very high relative to its cost.  That would stimulate its economy, would boost its potential growth rate and would have a spillover effect to the rest of the European Union by helping to reduce imbalances.  It is not just about fiscal adjustment on the way down and so forth.  These are a couple of preliminary comments in response to the Senator's observations.</p></speech>

The approach was that the Secretaries General of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform wrote to the relevant Departments asking for their suggestions in this regard.  The project list was chosen from that but, to be frank, the Senator will note our understanding is the exercise was also conducted by the other 27 member states across the Union in a similar way.  From the lists and the production of the publication from the European Commission on the 2,000 projects on the overall list, it is clear that no particular status or guaranteed funding arises from the presence of a particular project on the list.  Ultimately, from both the European and national perspectives, a cost-benefit analysis must be done to ascertain whether the approach and the particular project merit any funding.  Ultimately, if there is private sector involvement, the participants must themselves be sure that the expectation of returns is there.  I do not think anyone wishes to be building highways to nowhere or white elephants.  That is not what this particular process is about.  We have a list that has been put together at short notice across all the member states.  It may well be that this list will evolve over time.  Certainly, from what we see, it will be rationalised and is something that will be perceived as the end of the beginning of the process, to describe it that way, and ultimately, it will be revisited with a review as to what is a potentially viable and sustainable project being funded from the available resources.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.766" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012100018#T00400"><p>I contest strongly the assertion made by Mr. McCarthy in response to Senator Barrett - who was making similar assertions - that cutting capital when the crisis hit was anything but stupidity and folly.  There was absolutely no rationale for it because it cost us more to do that.  I will provide two examples, the first of which is housing.  Cutting the budget for social housing  in 2008 has cost us more.  Obviously, it has cost us in terms of homelessness and an increased housing crisis, but it has also cost the Exchequer more because the State has been obliged to fork out a hell of a lot more to the private sector to cover the housing crisis.  We must pay more to private landlords because we did not provide council housing.  Is this not a classic example of how, when the market turns down crashes, we need things that are not linked to the ups and downs of the economy because they always are needed, such as housing?</p> <p>It is not to do with the ups and downs of the market but how many people need roofs over their heads.  Whether the market goes down or whatever it does, we need roofs over people's heads.  One way or the other, it must be done.  The question is whether to do it cheaply or expensively.  What is the best value for money in doing something that simply must be done?  Is that not one example that runs completely contrary to the assertion that we had to do it?  We are paying a huge price for a massive mistake in that area.</p> <p> Can anyone puzzle me how the leveraged investment model does not end up costing ordinary people, the taxpayer, more for whatever project?  The difference between this and doing it with 100% public investment for vital infrastructure and services, such as housing, is that there must be a profit for the private investor so it costs us more.  It is not even disputable.  It must cost us more because someone else is in the picture who wants a cut.  In order to get in the money, we must provide guarantees that we will take the first hit if there are losses.  If things go belly up, we promise, in order to get in private investors, that we will take the first hit.  Second, we must promise enough profit and return for the private investor to come in in the first place.  Our answer to the fact that we have a dysfunctional economy where the market decides it is not profitable to invest is to get down on our knees and say please invest and we guarantee, if anything goes wrong, that the taxpayer will cover the losses and the return is guaranteed.  How can that possibly be a better way to invest than us doing it ourselves, where we do not have to give a cut to someone else?  We invest in something because we need houses, roads and water infrastructure.  These are vital and, regardless of the ups and downs of the markets, we must have them.</p> <p> One can possibly make a different argument for areas of the economy that are not vital and we can debate where that line begins and ends but in certain areas we just must have certain things.  Bringing in the private sector, where it must have a profit, cannot be as good value for money as us doing it ourselves.</p> <p> How confident can we be that we can get this investment?  We have big announcements about how we will get an investment with our &euro;8 billion seed capital, which will increase to &euro;21 billion and magically turn to &euro;300 billion.  How do we know that it will be coming in?  Is it possible it will not appear?  Is the list of projects publicly available?  Does social housing feature in the list of projects?</p></speech>

There are priorities and we need to maintain issues on the social housing front.  I was simply pointing out some projects were based on a rate of return that was no longer viable once the economy hit.  With some projects, the costs exceeded the benefits and they were the projects that had to be cut.  I was not talking about an across the board cut in capital investment.  We had to prioritise once the recession hit and the research shows that a number of projects were no longer viable on the basis of 2% or 3% trend growth rate as opposed to the 4% or 4.5% trend growth rate assumed when the projects were being compiled.</p>  <p>  I will hand over to my colleagues to speak on the investment plan.</p></speech>

There are a number of issues about how the private sector might fund the initiative and how it might organise the project.  Perhaps the private sector is more operationally efficient in terms of the administration of a schools programme.  It is difficult to make statements about whether it is more problematic or more difficult to have the private sector involved where there would be an upfront and immediate capital investment from the public sector.  These are some of the issues at play in terms of how the Commission envisages unlocking the available private sector capital to meet investment projects across Europe that, by themselves are unable to avail of funding to have them completed.</p></speech>

We know there are set pieces whereby member states produce certain things and these are discussed by the Commission and at Council level.  It happens in parallel across member states.  In practice and culturally, has there been a shift after the introduction of the European semester in terms of interaction on a regular basis outside the formal set pieces with the Commission?  Does the Commission have more of a hand in the drafting of budgets than was previously the case?  Is there more informal contact or contact on a regular basis between civil servants?</p></speech>

This is our second cycle of surveillance and we had more interaction with the Commission from 2010 on as part of the programme but everyone is now in the same boat.  There are three bilateral meetings with the Commission leading up to the adoption of the country-specific recommendations, CSRs, the first of which took place in December.  If memory serves me correctly, there is another at the end of this month and a bilateral meeting after publication of the single analytical document.</p> <p>This single analytical document is published in mid-March.  That is all about where the Commission and the member states see the priorities and what can be done.  There is far more engagement with the Commission.</p> <p> There is also a noticeable change at committee level, by which I mean the various European committees such as the Economic Policy Committee, EPC, the Economic and Financial Committee, EFC, and so forth.  There is far more multilateral surveillance than would have been the case in the past.  In the past, a state would have drawn up a policy and the Commission and that member state would have discussed it across the table, with the representatives of the other member states on their BlackBerries.  Now, because there is a greater recognition that policies adopted in one member state have implications for Ireland and policies adopted in Ireland have implications for other members states, there is much more peer review, peer pressure and multilateral surveillance.  It is not just between the Commission and the members states, but the member states trying to act in unison.</p> <p> There has been a change.  I would not call it a sea change, but as I mentioned earlier the process is evolving over time with incremental changes each year.  For example, all euro area member states must have the same budgetary timelines, so they all submit budgets by mid-October.  They are peer reviewed by officials, which then leads up to a ministerial assessment of every country's budget.  There is far more interaction between the member states and also between the member states and the Commission.</p> <p> I am sorry if I have spoken for too long.</p></speech>

I have another question on the collapse of investment.  The witness gave a figure of 15% at EU level and it is a multiple of that in the Irish level.  It is probably still 50% or 60% down on what it was.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy says that is the main reason for the scale of the collapse, but why are we still bumping along the bottom?  Obviously, there was an uptick in investment but according to the latest quarter for which we have reports, it went down again slightly and certainly did not rise.  Why is Ireland lagging behind?  As a percentage of GDP, we are at the bottom or very close to it in terms of investment.  What is Mr. McCarthy's analysis of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.780" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015012100020#V00500"><p>Off the top of my head I do not know where we are in terms of the league table, as it were, but the Deputy is correct that there was a huge collapse in investment.  The investment to GDP ratio fell to a level where the acquisition of new capital assets was only just sufficient to cover the depreciation of capital stock, which is more or less unheard of.  It fell to 10% or 11% of GDP, which is absolutely unheard of.  It is also fair to state that it came after a period of over-investment, producing 90,000 to 92,000 houses.  As the Deputy says, it was simply unviable and unsustainable.  That must be borne in mind as well.</p>  <p>  However, we have bottomed out on the investment side.  Over the past 18 months we have seen very strong double digit growth, although I will caveat that in a moment.  For example, the data we have for last year shows that in the first three quarters overall investment is up by just under 11% relative to the previous period.  However, the caveat I must stress is that this is the law of small numbers.  In absolute terms it is not a big increase in investment.  It is simply because the base is so low.  The improvement in investment that is undoubtedly under way is broad based.  It can be seen in the building and construction sector as well as in housing.  Again, the law of small numbers applies here.  We produced 11,000 units last year.  In absolute terms, that is too low, but it is still 30% above the previous year.  Other forms of building and construction are very strong.  The other component of investment we examine is the so-called machinery and equipment investment, that is, investment in software and so forth.  That has been running at 30% for the past 18 months.</p>  <p>  I will not say we are back to where we should be.  As an advanced economy we would typically allocate between one fifth and one quarter of national income to capital formation or investment.  Our numbers are based on investment growth last year of approximately 14%, and 12% this year.  That will only bring the investment to GDP ratio back to 17% or 18%.  We are still a long way from what one might refer to as equilibrium or the norm.</p></speech>

The Deputy might recall that there was much discussion last July, when the Central Statistics Office, CSO, introduced methodological changes.  It focused on black economy type activity.  That was quite small.  The big methodological change was the capitalisation of research and development spending.  Overall, it increased the level of investment by approximately &euro;10 billion, and approximately &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion was due to research and development.  However, it was included retrospectively.  I believe it fell slightly last year, but it is very volatile on a year to year basis.</p></speech>

The IMF published its interim world economic outlook last Tuesday and it stated that the overall impact of falling oil prices would be to add between 0.4% and 0.7% to overall world output.  From an Irish perspective, our rule of thumb is that each &euro;10 per barrel reduction in oil prices increases the growth rate by between 0.1% and 0.2%.  It used to be higher, but the dependence on oil is much lower now because we have become a software driven economy rather than heavy manufacturing.  That is the rule of thumb we would typically use.  The fall we have seen since last summer will have a positive impact, as will the depreciation of the exchange rate.  However, as Deputy Doherty mentioned, there have been downward revisions to the euro area and so forth, so they are operating in opposite directions.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to be here among Deputies from across parties and those of an Independent hue.  I am delighted that we have the opportunity so early in the year to deal with these important matters.  I hope we can reach a conclusion today and send a positive message back to the plenary session of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I also welcome a number of ambassadors, some of whom are from countries that are the subject matter of our proceedings this afternoon, and wish them all the best for 2015.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the three motions which been proposed and referred to this committee for consideration.</p>  <p>  The motions seek D&aacute;il approval of the terms of EU association agreements with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, respectively.  These countries are three of six members of the EU's Eastern Partnership which was launched in 2009.  It is a joint initiative within the European neighbourhood policy to provide a coherent framework for EU co-operation with six countries of eastern Europe and the south Caucasus &ndash; Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.  These three association agreements are a new generation of agreements offered in the framework of the Eastern Partnership.  Up to now, relations between the EU and Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine have been based on partnership and co-operation agreements which entered into force over 15 years ago.  The European Commission negotiated the association agreements on behalf of the EU and the member states, including Ireland, were kept fully informed of progress in the negotiations, particularly through the relevant EU Council working groups. </p> <p>The conclusion of the agreements, which are ambitious in scope, is a milestone in the EU&rsquo;s relationships with these countries.</p> <p> The overall aims of the agreements are to accelerate the deepening of political and economic relations with these countries on the basis of common values.  The agreements aim to strengthen the framework for enhanced political dialogue and promote peace and stability.  They provide the conditions for enhanced economic and trade relations, which will lead towards the gradual economic integration of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine with the EU Internal Market in selected areas.</p> <p> The agreements will enhance justice, freedom and security co-operation with the aim of reinforcing the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  These countries will benefit under the agreements from financial assistance through the appropriate EU funding mechanisms and instruments.</p> <p> A key element of each agreement is enhanced co-operation with the EU in some 28 policy sectors focusing on core reforms.  The sectors include, for example, energy, transport, management of public finances, agriculture and rural development.  Key to the sectoral co-operation chapter is a comprehensive menu of regulatory approximation contained in annexes to the agreements, which set out the EU legislation to be adopted within a specified timeframe.</p> <p> The three agreements provide for the creation of a deep and comprehensive free trade area.  Through this, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will be gradually integrated into the EU&rsquo;s Internal Market.  The agreements not only offer improved trade and investment opportunities but also assistance with trade-related reforms.  This has the aim of contributing to economic recovery and growth, and, for example, an improved and more predictable business environment, including for the small business sector. </p> <p> The EU estimates that the deep and comprehensive free trade area, DCFTA, will boost substantially the GDP of the three countries and their exports to the EU, provided that reforms are completed.</p> <p> The EU will provide assistance to the three countries with the implementation of the reform measures, from assistance with the modernisation of the agricultural sector to better regulating financial services.  In terms of financial assistance, the EU made available &euro;131 million each to Georgia and Moldova, and &euro;365 million to Ukraine, in 2014 to support a programme of reform and modernisation efforts and the implementation of the DCFTA.  The EU will continue to provide assistance in the current and future years.  The Eastern Partnership summit in Riga in May will be a good opportunity to assess their progress in this regard. </p> <p> The conclusion of these agreements responds to the desire of the peoples of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to come closer to the EU on the basis of our shared European values.  The agreements will contribute to the promotion of stability and democratic values in the EU&rsquo;s neighbourhood.</p> <p> The agreements were signed last year at the March and June European Councils.  Each EU member state is a party to these agreements because some aspects of the agreements remain in the competence of member states, such as in relation to justice and home affairs.  The agreements can only enter into force after they have been ratified by all member states and the European Parliament has given its consent.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is required prior to the ratification of this type of agreement. </p> <p> Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine have already ratified the agreements.  Ratification by the 28 member states is proceeding, and has been completed by ten EU states to date.  In many other member states the process is at an advanced stage.  The European Parliament has given its consent to all three agreements.  As it may take some time before ratification procedures are fully complete, some aspects of the agreements, including the deep and comprehensive free trade area, DCFTA, are applied on a provisional basis, pending their formal entry into force at a later date. </p> <p> However, in relation to Ukraine, following a trilateral meeting between the EU, Ukraine and Russia in September, the European Commission has agreed to suspend the provisional application of the trade part of the agreement, including the establishment of a free trade area, until 1 January 2016.  In the meantime, Ukraine will continue to benefit from trade preferences for goods entering the EU.  The delay in applying the trade provisions of the agreement with Ukraine was considered necessary as Ukraine feared that its threatened removal from the Russia-CIS free trade regime would have a serious impact on its already struggling economy.  For its part, Russia confirmed that the CIS-FTA preferential regime with Ukraine will continue to apply.</p> <p> The EU&rsquo;s relationship with Ukraine has, despite the adversity of the ongoing crisis, developed and deepened substantially.  The ratification of the EU-Ukraine association agreement not only strengthens the foundation of this relationship, but charts a course for much-needed political and economic reform programme as Ukraine seeks to become a modern, prosperous democracy.  Both at Maidan Square and in the recent parliamentary election, the people of Ukraine have made their voices heard on the question of these reforms, and on the desire of the people of Ukraine for this association agreement to secure a firm and productive friendship between Ukraine and the European Union.  Through Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of this association agreement, we will show our own support for this process, and for a brighter future for the people of Ukraine.</p> <p> It should be noted that Georgia is the only country of the Caucasus region which has concluded an association agreement with the EU and opinion polls show the people of Georgia are strongly supportive of this agreement.  Moldova has recently held parliamentary elections, and is currently in the process of forming a new government.  Following the elections, High Representative, Ms Federica Mogherini, stressed the EU&rsquo;s intention to remain a reliable partner supporting the reform programme in Moldova and working towards unleashing the full benefits of the association agreement in the interest of all its citizens.  In the course of the recent election, one of the members of the committee, Deputy Eric Byrne, in his capacity as a monitor, represented Ireland.  I would be anxious to hear his views on the election and the electoral process in Moldova.  The High Representative, Ms Mogherini, recently noted the preliminary findings of the International Election Observation Mission.</p> <p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to present these three motions which I hope will meet the committee&rsquo;s approval.  The association agreements will broaden and deepen the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine on the basis of shared values and interests.  Closer economic integration with the EU will be a powerful stimulant for economic growth in these three countries.  This, in turn, will open up opportunities for Ireland to forge stronger political and economic relations with these countries.  I hope the committee will support the motions which I have proposed, and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will approve the terms of these three association agreements so that Ireland will proceed to ratify these agreements in the near future.</p> <p> I am happy to take questions at this point.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I welcome and support the association agreements.  The Minister clearly outlined the potential of the agreements to deepen and broaden relationships with our neighbours in the European Union.  Is there a timeline for the ratification of the association agreements by all 28 member states?  Is the coming into force of the provisions of the association agreements dependent on each member state having ratified the association agreements?  The Minister stated these agreements "will lead towards the gradual economic integration of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine with the EU Internal Market in selected areas."  If one is a participant in the EU Internal Market, how many steps is that away from accession to the European Union?  I presume one is well on the way to working one's way through the accession process if one can participate in the Internal Market, which is a cornerstone of the European Union?</p>  <p>  We had the opportunity to have a worthwhile discussion with the new High Representative.  I mentioned the concern about the working of Eastern Partnership during the past number of years, which could have been more effective.  The Eastern Partnership has not built the relationships that are needed with our neighbouring countries.</p> <p>There are widespread concerns about relations between Ukraine, the EU and Russia.  Is the issue of trade sanctions and EU-Russia relations included in each meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council?  We are aware of the knock-on effects on sectors in our own country, particularly agriculture, of the sanctions imposed on European exports to Russia.  This is an issue we need to address at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

To what extent does the Minister envisage eastern partnership countries accessing the same market relationship with the European Union as, for example, Switzerland or Norway?  Is it likely that the relationship will grow and, if so, to what extent?</p>  <p>  In regard to the impasse that led to sanctions against Russia, to what extent have negotiations been renewed or are ongoing with a view to achieving better relations between the EU, Ukraine and Russia?  Considerable economic and political benefits could accrue to all sides and it is in the interest of all parties to renew negotiations at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  I compliment the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, on her efforts to deal with a multiplicity of issues over the Christmas period.  Is it expected that the principles of freedom, justice and openness - dare I mention perestroika - will prevail as a result of the motion we are currently considering?  Is the European Union conscious of the need to build on the progress made not only with the countries mentioned here but also with the other countries in the region the Minister mentioned?  In regard to security in the European Union and its neighbours, particularly in the eastern partnership and eastern neighbourhood, to what extent has the need for observation of good security practice been accepted by all concerned, especially given the current situation?</p>  <p>  I have always believed it is necessary to have respect for each other in any negotiations where may be clashes of culture, history, religion or whatever.  The first condition should be to establish the necessity to respect each other's position.  That means we must do so in every sense of the word.  It may mean different things to different people, but it is absolutely necessary, if we are to achieve a better working relationship, the kind of security that is required globally, and between either side in any dispute, whether in Northern Ireland, eastern Europe or across Europe, or between Christian and Muslim countries or whatever, that we start from the basis of trying to ensure we respect each other's position.  The Minister knows I have raised that through parliamentary questions.  It is fundamental to where we are going.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.805" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015012100004#C00300"><p>I am in a minority in the committee on this issue.  I will be opposing the Minister's proposal, and I will expand on the reasons for that if I get the chance.  It is not that I or my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, are opposed to the attempts to expand the EU.  Association agreements are supposedly aimed at bringing countries closer to the EU politically and economically.  However, moving closer to the EU in these ways requires the countries concerned to move away from other models.  That is part of the difficulty.  Deputy Smith spoke about the timing of this.  I think the timing is all wrong and particularly bad if one looks at what is happening in that part of the world and the difficulties that have arisen there.  One could ask when would be a good time.  Would the Minister accept that the agreement will force countries to make economic changes based on privatisation and market liberalisation?  It is not simply a trade agreement aimed at mutually reducing tariffs or increasing trade.  It will lock countries into an economic paradigm on the chance that they will get a shot at gaining EU membership.  Does the Minister accept that there is EU fatigue across Europe when it comes to enlargement?  We are selling this proposal down the line but it is unlikely that enlargement will be the result.</p>  <p>  It is obvious why people are looking towards the EU because they see it as progress.  They are caught between the EU and Russia and the latter reminds them in many cases of a negative past.  The break-up of the Soviet Union was economically crippling for many of these countries and the EU presents itself as a modern partner with unlimited opportunities.  If we look more closely at what is happening in Europe, however, youth unemployment is 53% in Spain, 43% in Italy, 44% in Portugal and 22% in Ireland, as well as there being emigration.</p>  <p>  It is not a case of being opposed to any new trade agreements, once they are based on simple mutual benefit and do not force countries into so-called economic reforms aimed at selling the countries' resources and state services to the highest bidder.  That is what I have a difficulty with in relation to this agreement.  Would the Minister not accept that, unfortunately, these type of association agreements force these countries to throw their lot in with the EU or else put up with Russia's heavy-handed response?  That is the difficulty I have.  The offer of EU membership is always hinted at but never explicitly promised, so they are caught economically and tied to the EU while outside the bloc.  Is there any explicit promise of or a framework for future EU membership in these agreements?  It is important that we be truthful and honest with people in this regard.</p>  <p>  There was a lot of criticism of the speed at which the EU was enlarged to include Bulgaria and Romania.  I know there are talks with other countries and they are hopeful that will happen.  I am not opposed to the accession of new countries but I have serious concerns about and objections to EU federalism, the EU democratic deficit and the loss of member state sovereignty.  That is the debate that is taking place in many countries across Europe.  I strongly welcome that these issues are being debated strongly here and that the committee has the opportunity to do so, although I would probably like to have a lot more time for the debate.</p> <p>Does the Minister agree that some time should be set aside in the D&aacute;il to debate this issue in greater detail?  The committee structure is useful but this issue requires a wider debate not only in the D&aacute;il but in the Seanad.</p></speech>

I recognise the amount of work that goes into producing an agreement such as this one that crosses 28 policy sectors.  It cannot but be mutually beneficial both at an economic and a political level.  As the Minister said, it will enhance our shared values of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.  I recognise that these countries have a geography and a history which are different from ours.  I welcome that Russia has recognised the fact, as do we, that these countries do not have to turn their back on their past simply by joining an association agreement with the European Union.  That is important and I welcome the fact that the trade agreements can continue with Russia, but nevertheless that should not blind us to the fact that it is beneficial for us in the EU and for these countries to have an agreement like this, and it is to be welcomed and endorsed by the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.809" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015012100005#D00400"><p>I welcome the Minister and his colleagues.  I have a number of concerns about this.  First and foremost, apropros of what Deputy Crowe said or what he read out on behalf of his party, the European Union is a unique institution and it is the only political union in the world that people want to join or with which they want to have an association agreement.   There is no queue of nations wanting to join the United States, Canada or any other rich country in that particular manner.  We should ask ourselves why that is the case.  This is an association agreement based on mutual benefit with regard to trade.  I advise Deputy Crowe that this is not compulsory and that they do not have join or apply.  As a representative of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, I would have thought he would rather celebrate the idea that a recently independent state, exercising its own democracy and sovereignty, albeit in difficult circumstances, would - taking a meaning from the name of his party - itself decide that it would like to apply and it is old enough, big enough and wise enough, and in many cases probably much smarter than we are, to decide whether the terms and conditions hit the contours of its aspirations for the future of its country.</p>  <p>  Another factor is that association agreements are not guarantee of full membership.  Ask the Turks about it.  They have been a member of NATO since 1952 and a member of an association agreement with the European Union in terms of trade and association, if my memory serves me right, from 1958 or 1959.  The path to full membership requires the individual vote of every national parliament, currently 28.  That bridge, if we have to cross it, is a long way away and at the time probably 30 bridges will have to be crossed and unanimity on that will be required, not the agreement of a majority of the member states.</p>  <p>  I have a concern given the difficulties we have had in the past with our overseas development programme with regard to corruption and misuse of money, some of it accidental, some of it deliberate and some it fraudulent.  We saw that with our overseas development programme with Uganda and others.  I am sure this is a concern everybody would have.  There is an anti-European movement within our own country and within other member states and they will use malfeasance of one kind or another to denounce that this is money being wasted by Brussels.  We know the orchestration of histrionics of Nigel Farage and other UKIP-type parties.  The Minister might indicate what safeguards and sanctions are provided if bona fide European taxpayers' money is badly spent.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the very fraught relationship that exists between the current political leadership in the Commonwealth of Independent States, or what we would call Russia, is there a sense that some of this could be seen as a political provocation?  All these three applicant countries, as we well know, notwithstanding their independence and sovereignty on the international stage, have been treated extremely badly by the current occupant of the Kremlin.  To what extent will the process of these agreements, which are coming along in a normal manner, have a negative or no impact on the wider Russian-European relationship now that the economic basis upon which the aggressive prosperity of President Putin's aggressions are being undermined by the collapse in oil prices at a level that will cause massive economic hardship in the former Soviet Union?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.810" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015012100005#D00500"><p>I thank the Minister for his reference to my experience of the Moldovan elections but we will not go into that.  He has a lovely presentation here and I am sure it is all on the record.  If he wants to talk to me privately, I will be very happy to give him my personal view of the elections in Moldova, on which I will touch in my contribution.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister and enthusiastically welcome these association agreements and their ratification.  I am blessed in the sense that I am one of the few politicians in this room who has experience of Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia.  I am disappointed Sinn F&eacute;in would take a position that somehow or other these people are being coerced into an agreement that they do not want.  It is a sad day in many ways in that up in the Phoenix Park the Armenian ambassador to Ireland and England is presenting his papers to the President today.  The tragedy about the missing Armenian name to the list is that they were very heavily subjected to pressure by the Russian Federation into pulling back from the association agreement and being forced against their will into the Eurasian Customs Union with the Russian Federation.  It will be something for our committee to engage on with the Armenian ambassador at another stage.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding my well-documented concerns about the European relationship with Ukraine in the early days of the association agreement, and it is water under the bridge now, I ask the Minister, who I am sure is acutely aware of the composition of these three countries where there is a Russian influence, be it a Russian border or Russian speaking minorities, to be very conscious of that.  He spoke about what became of the elections in Moldova.  The biggest party to be returned in the Moldovan elections was the most pro-Putin, pro-Russian Federation Party.  That is not to say that the composition of potential coalition partners will not be greater in terms of being pro-European than pro-Russian.  The fact that this is a reality for Moldova makes us acutely aware, having noted the mistakes that were made in the early stages of the association agreement with Ukraine, that Russia has threatened and carried out its threats in the past, as the Minister will know with Transnistria being the industrial core of the region, which was and is part of Moldova.  Moldova is an agricultural country and society, depending on the exports of its agricultural produce, its wine, fruit and vegetables.  The Russians have severed their link with the Moldovan wine industry, notwithstanding the fact that I have seen in the cellars President Putin's allocated portion of very fine Moldovan wines.  Also, in the case of Georgia we know about South Ossetia and about the relationship between Georgia and the Russian Federation.  These are difficult countries and I would be keen to be assured that this little country of ours, in our negotiations with these partners, is acutely conscious of the historical relationships of the Russians, back to the Second World War and liberation from Nazism, their attachment to their language and the fact that there is a predominant Russian influence in Transnistria.</p> <p> I wish the three countries well and I welcome them on board.  I wish to ask the Minister a question relating to Ukraine.  Let us praise the OSCE.  It has done a phenomenal job.  The Minister is aware the OSCE only acts with the agreement of 57 countries.  We have Irish representatives operating there as part of the EU advisory mission, EUAM, for the reform of civilian security.  Whose role is it to monitor the Ukrainian military?  The fighting force known as the Right Sector is disconnected from the military hierarchy.  That is very important because it could potentially be prone to breaking a ceasefire or to provocation of the Russian-speaking people of eastern Ukraine.  That is a key area.</p> <p> I have nothing further to add.  The Minister is aware of the sensitivities of the three countries and their relationship with the region.  We must applaud the High Representative.  When she was before the committee she told us that we are a community of nations.  We are all neighbours.  The 28 member states have neighbours who are our friends and we want to be friends with the neighbour of our neighbours.  Europe will be well represented by the new High Representative in her leadership role.</p></speech>

I support the motion.  We have seen how the Common Market has developed and contributed.  Nobody would pull back from anything that has taken place since the foundation of the Common Market after the Second World War.  We support its ongoing development to ensure peace as well as prosperity, and in some cases to provide an opportunity for prosperity in the context of the agreements with the three states.  I thank the Minister for his presentation in that regard.</p></speech>

While we acknowledge the sovereignty of each of the three countries, is there a sense that this is throwing down the gauntlet to Russia because there are disputed areas in each of the three countries?  I do not think the principle of self-determination is very much respected by the Russian authorities.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned trade related reforms.  Could he expand on what he means by that?  We were to debate the Colombia free trade agreement.  In that context, concerns arose about workers' rights and related issues.  Is the Minister confident that the issues we examined in the context of Colombia are also significantly addressed in the three trade agreements under discussion?</p></speech>

I very much value the advice, commentary, observations and guidance of committee members.  I thank them for that.  I am sure that in the course of 2015 we will have an opportunity to deepen our engagement.  I will endeavour to ensure my schedule facilitates that end.  The expertise in the committee is very much underlined by the fact that some of the questions that have been asked earlier have been answered satisfactorily by members of the committee.  That is testament to the importance of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in the Parliament.</p>  <p>  I was very pleased that High Representative Mogherini included in her programme an opportunity to engage, however briefly, with the committee.  She told me prior to Christmas that, when coming to Dublin, she was most anxious to respect the input of parliamentarians and that her visit would not be complete without an opportunity to engage with committee members.  I accept that Monday is often not the most appropriate day for either the Chairman or committee members.  On behalf of the committee I will again convey to the High Commissioner the gratitude of members for the opportunity to engage with her.</p>  <p>  A number of issues were raised.  Deputy Smith and others raised the matter of the timeframe.  The timeframe for completion is 1 January 2016 but it is hoped that matters will be completed in advance of that with particular reference to the partnership summit in Riga in May.  Already ten states have satisfactorily ratified the agreements.  I hope this country will do so at an early opportunity, notwithstanding the opposition of Deputy Crowe and his party.  By May, it is expected that states will have ratified the agreements.  I would be happy to keep the committee informed of developments in that regard.</p>  <p>  The issue of sanctions against Russia was raised by Deputies Smith, Durkan and others.  This issue has a priority position on the agenda of each and every meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, the most recent of which was on Monday last.  Again, it was an issue that attracted widespread debate involving active oral contributions from most of the 28 member state representatives around the table.  It is an issue where the Union has maintained an element of flexibility.  Sanctions will be intensified and weakened or reduced in accordance with the de-escalation or otherwise of the position in eastern Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position is such that we support the sanctions and we will continue to do so.  We are monitoring the situation, not only in respect of the adverse economic impact on Russia, which is having some effect in terms of consequential issues, but also the impact on this country of the retaliatory impositions on the part of Russia.  It is clear that the current sanctions imposed by the European Union are having an impact, and they will continue to be a main element of the European Union approach to the current crisis in Ukraine.  We have always said that there is an element of flexibility and that the restrictive measures are scalable.  They can be eased and strengthened depending on developments.</p>  <p>  To date, the impact of the sanctions against Russia, however evident they might be in terms of trade, have been relatively modest.  The impact of the retaliatory measures as far as our economy is concerned are being closely monitored and they have not had the effect or consequences that were initially flagged in some quarters.  We will continue to keep a very close eye on the situation, not only at Foreign Affairs Council level but perhaps more particularly at European Council level where the issue will again be discussed shortly.</p>  <p>  Deputy Durkan and others spoke of a possible EU membership accession and the fact that the current agreements will put the party states firmly along the path of EU membership.</p> <p>EU membership is dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis in the context of individual applications.  The actual participation of states in these agreements or in the Eastern Partnership does not offer candidate status.  However, it is quite clear that the comprehensive agreement leaves the way open for future developments in that regard.  The European Union has offered the Eastern Partnership countries closer ties and deeper integration with its structures through these agreements.  I must inform Deputy Crowe that any offer of EU membership would require a certain unanimity among EU member states.  It is fair to say that there is not any real prospect of achieving that level of agreement.  Even if such a prospect were evident - I do not believe it is - it is doubtful whether any of the Eastern Partnership countries would be in a position to assume the obligations of membership in any event.  It is not really appropriate to suggest, therefore, that membership will follow.<br/>Deputy Durkan and others referred to the position of neighbouring countries such as Azerbaijan, Armenia and Belarus.  As the committee will be aware, the Union has continued to seek progress in the context of relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan.  Like Deputy Eric Byrne, I welcome the new ambassador who is presenting his credentials at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in this afternoon.  I look forward to having an early opportunity to engage with him.  Members will be aware that although Armenia decided not to complete the association agreement which it had successfully negotiated with the European Union, it continues to express an interest in concluding a new agreement.  Both sides will continue with the discussions on the extent of future agreement.<br/>Deputy Crowe expressed his opposition in respect of this matter, which he is entitled to do, and sought further debate at D&aacute;il level.  I presume the Deputy's opposition will be included in the committee's report.  I do not believe Deputy Crowe is well guided in his thesis.  There is no evidence to show that any of the states which are the subject of the agreements we are discussing have been pushed by the European Union into concluding such agreements.  Each of the agreements is the result of negotiations into which the three countries involved entered freely.  I do not believe there is any evidence to suggest otherwise.  In each individual case, the negotiations were lengthy and detailed.  This was always going to be the case.  The negotiations were conducted by the European Commission on behalf of the Union.  The outcome responded clearly to the will of the three countries in question to move closer to the European Union.  The specific terms of the three agreements reflect that as far as the three countries are concerned.  The parliaments of these three countries have again, on behalf of their people, ratified the agreements.  There is no promise of EU membership and there are no side deals involved.  The agreements do not contain anything which was not concluded openly or which is not reflective of the principles of democracy.  The fact that two other Eastern Partnership countries chose not to conclude such agreements is clear evidence that decisions relating to these agreements are made on the basis of sovereignty.  Far from exerting pressure on countries which choose not to sign, the Union has made continued efforts to seek progress in respect of the matter of relations between it and those countries.  I do not believe there is any evidence of the type of influence, duress or any undue pressure to which the Deputy refers.<br/>Deputy Quinn raised a number of important concerns and made particular reference to the issue of a possible future misappropriation or mishandling of funds in a way which would not be in accordance with proper procedures.  Article 392 of the agreements deals with measures to prevent and fight corruption, fraud and any other illegal activities in connection with the implementation of EU funds <i>inter alia</i>by means of mutual administrative assistance or mutual legal assistance in the fields covered by the agreement.  The power exists to suspend one of the association agreements or expel the state involved in the event of conclusive evidence of the nature described by the Deputy having been identified.  Deputy Quinn is quite right to stress the importance of respecting the independence and freedom of the Eastern Partnership countries to decide on their own external relations.  As stated earlier, at no stage did the EU pressurise any of the countries involved to make a choice between it and Russia.  That is evidenced in the context of the different activities undertaken in the countries with reference to Georgia, on one hand, and Armenia, on the other.<br/>The EU trade offer was compatible with agreements that already existed with Russia.  I note Deputy Quinn's comment regarding the current crisis and the perception that perhaps competitive interests may well be at stake between the European Union and Russia.  However, I am of the view that the agreements stand on their own merits.  The decisions relating to them were taken in the aftermath of the sovereign decisions taken by the parliaments involved while exercising their own free choice.  It would be a misrepresentation if that which I describe were to be regarded in Moscow as any form of provocation.<br/>The EU Advisory Mission for Civilian Security Sector Reform Ukraine was established by the European Council in July of last year in order to support the authorities in Ukraine in reforming its security sector.  The aim of the mission is to help Ukraine develop an effective and accountable security service that contributes to strengthening the rule of law.  I remind Deputy Eric Byrne that Ireland has two members on that mission and they keep the Government fully informed of developments in Ukraine.<br/>I acknowledge the comments made by Deputy Mitchell and I must inform Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that we are very mindful of the issue of trade with Colombia.  The latter is in no way reflective of any form of parallel with the current agreement.</p></speech>

The one relating to Georgia refers to the &quot;deep and comprehensive&quot; free-trade agreement as &quot;one of the most ambitious free trade agreements that the EU has ever negotiated with a third country&quot;.  There are plenty of references to Russia, perhaps not all unfair but some certainly unhelpful.  It congratulates Georgia on redirecting exports to new markets, which I presume means away from Russia and to the EU.  It also asserts, &quot;there is strong national and cross-party consensus in Georgia in favour of integration with the West&quot;.  When I met the <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>yesterday, he stressed that.  However, it also refers to the EU and NATO, which is not language that we, as a neutral country, would support.<br />My big problem is with the timing.  People can argue over whether there is ever a good time in that regard.  My view is that it was a zero-sum game.  People were given the ultimatum that they either agree or not.  The Minister has said that is not his view of it.  There is a view across many countries and parties within Europe that, given all the tension, the timing of the agreement with Ukraine was bad.<br />There was mention of the High Representative's statement that it was necessary to move away from slogans and start to take practical steps to approach the difficulties in the region.  I accept that parliaments and governments in those countries want to move this forward, but as we know, other parliaments, if we are to be part of this, have gone the opposite way.  There is the view that it was a zero-sum game and there was not much of a choice.  We have already seen sanctions.  The Russians have placed sanctions on Moldova and the EU confirmed that it would open up its markets in that regard.  This again represents an escalation.  Many of these countries are seen as a buffer zone between Europe and Russia.  That does not justify any of the actions of the Russians.  There are huge concerns there.  The timing is bad.  The message people in those countries are getting is that things will improve regarding their economies and so on, but it might not necessarily happen that way.</p></speech>

Political and economic integration is extremely important.  Obviously, enhanced co-operation in the areas of security, freedom and justice is extremely important, given the times we have at the moment.  The association agreements enhance these, and co-operation in these areas is important.  There are also the other opportunities in trade and investment.  I believe it can only be good for our relationships with these three countries.<br />I acknowledge the presence today of members of the diplomatic corps, particularly the <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>and ambassador of Ukraine and Georgia.  They have kept in touch with members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and briefed us on their desire to get these association agreements passed.  I acknowledge the work they have done on behalf of their countries.<br />I also acknowledge the presence of the Latvian ambassador.  I wish his country well in its Presidency during the first six months of the year.  We look forward to having him before the committee to deal with foreign affairs issues in the near future.<br />Does the Minister wish to say anything else before we wrap up?</p></speech>

Deputy Smith asked about the provisional application or otherwise of the agreements.  The agreements provide for provisional application of certain aspects that fall under EU competence until such time as each member state has concluded ratification when they come into force.  I say this particularly in the matter of economic and sectoral co-operation.  I again stress that the target date is that it be completed by the time of the Riga summit in May.  Already some aspects of the matter of Georgia and Moldova have been provided on a provisional basis since last year.  The target date is 1 January 2016 for Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I again acknowledge the contribution of Deputy Eric Byrne with regard to the region.  I would be happy at any stage to hear from him by way of report, engagement or otherwise.  It is a very important contribution and I laud him in that regard.</p>  <p>  The second issue that I may not have adequately addressed was raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who stressed the relationship between the agreements and reform in the area of human rights.  I refer to Article 2 of the agreement, which specifically states that the principle of the rule of law shall form the basis of domestic and external policies of the parties.  The essential elements of the agreement will involve issues such as respect for sovereignty, respect for territorial integrity and respect for human rights.  These are issues that can be the subject matter of a suspension if deemed appropriate or necessary.</p>  <p>  We have heard opposition from Deputy Crowe.  I assume the Chairman will now put the question.</p></speech>

We need to encourage economic development and a greater level of social integration.  It is very much in the best interests of the countries on the basis of their own application that we proceed to ratify at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

This morning, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and I met the Dublin representative of Concern to discuss the flooding in coastal Mozambique and southern Malawi, which are both programme countries, as the Minister knows.  Approximately 200,000 people are now completely homeless and have lost everything.  Goal and Concern are both working on the ground there.  They had a specific request that, if at all possible, we release some of our non-food supplies from Accra or Dubai.  I do not expect him to reply now.  However, I am raising it because it is a crisis, and perhaps he could come back to us.  I do not expect him to respond now.</p></speech>

The purpose of this meeting is to have an engagement with a number of those who made submissions on the review of firearms licensing.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Nicholas Flood, Mr. Kaz Balinski, Mr. Damien Hannigan, Mr. Declan Keogh, Mr. Kealan Symes and Mr. Desmond Crofton.  I thank our guests for attending in order that we might hear their expert views on this important matter.  I compliment them on the quality of their submissions.  As they are aware, officials from the Department and representatives from the Garda came before the committee prior to Christmas to outline their views on this issue.  We want to ensure that everyone's views on this very technical and detailed issue are heard.  Members have a great deal to learn about this matter and in many ways our guests are the experts.  We will be all ears when they make their presentations.  The format of the meeting will be that I will invite each organisation or individual to make opening remarks that will last approximately five minutes.  There will then be a question-and-answer session with members.  If people wish to bring any additional points or information to our attention, they should please do so.<br />I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they will be entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br />Members are reminded that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I invite Mr. Flood to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It was very disturbing to read the proposal as made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  To give a little background of my experience in shooting sports, I have been honoured to represent Ireland in silhouette target shooting professionally for seven years.  I was a carded athlete on the Irish Sports Council PACE carding scheme and had gained the rating of world class II athlete.  I trained seven days a week, sometimes three times a day.  I would have expended approximately 25,000 rounds - quite a significant amount - down range per year.  I was lucky in that during my career I won the Irish national championships seven times, eight European championship titles and gold medals, a bronze medal at the 2004 world championships and placed in the top three in the US national championships.  In my final year - I eventually retired as a result of a couple of injuries I had suffered - I won the US championship title, beating the reigning world champion.  In the same year I won the German open championships and the Irish national championships.  I decided that it was a really good year to stop and move on to something else.</p>  <p>  When I read the draft of the proposed Bill, I was really insulted by its contents.</p> <p>This vein has been followed for a number of years, namely, the attachment of crime and criminality to sporting firearms and those involved in shooting sports.  From my experience of meeting people in Ireland and abroad, it is the furthest thing from the truth.  I was disturbed.  The working group might have benefited greatly from the inclusion of interested parties as a whole in forming its proposals.  We should take the opportunity to consider the proposals, not in their form as suggested, but with changes that take into account the reality of what might be needed today and in the future.  I thank the committee for taking the time to listen.</p></speech>

The format followed by the Oireachtas involves pre-legislative scrutiny, in that, before Bills are properly published, their heads must be laid before committees such as this one for examination and so that members of the public, NGOs and experts can give their points of view and engage.  We have done this with 11 Bills so far.  It is a productive and useful process and proposals emanating from the Department have often been changed significantly because of it.  As such, no decisions have been made on this Bill yet and will not be until we are finished with our deliberations.</p></speech>

I am delighted to speak.  I wrote a document entitled, "Working Solution", based on my findings of the working group's review of the potential for firearm legislative reform.  It was published last November.  The idea of "Working Solution" is to encourage synergies and to provide a forum through which the coalition can work towards a thinking solution on which it can then act.  I am not sure if we are quite there yet.</p>  <p>  The underlying message of "Working Solution" recommends a review of the current firearm legislation in terms of its application and licensing system by way of the adoption of a new comprehensive system that can be organised into two sectors.  One is the practical side.  Handled by the private sector through clubs, this deals with the applicant's firearm choice, courses in proper management and use, subsequent assessments and tests and, finally, accreditation, which has the potential for firearm NCTs or DOEs.  The length of the programme should be important, as the period of time needs to be drawn out enough so as to allow for information to be properly absorbed and assimilated by applicants.  This underlines firearm ownership as a privilege, since individuals would have to work hard to own firearms while learning and appreciating in the process of so doing.</p>  <p>  Administration is the other side.  This sees the Garda dealing with policing and administrative aspects such as psychological profiling and due diligence of applicants as well as the issuing and control of firearms licences, which it already does well.</p>  <p>  The practical side promotes sport, industry growth within the private sector and community growth within clubs by way of self-policing, as the club environment promotes safety as a natural progression, which is a point that Mr. Flood made.  This greatly reduces the likelihood for an atrocity, as clubs would inform the Garda of any concerning character trait or "single" mentality of an applicant.  Garda&iacute; may already be aware of such concerns, being part of the same social community in which the applicant in question lives.  The administration side promotes an ease at Government level, since garda&iacute;, who already understand the community and, more particularly, individual applicants, would not have to worry about not understanding firearms.  This is a cool way of looking at it and an interesting point.  It also provides a standardised platform by review, which will lead to the cessation of unnecessary court appearances by garda&iacute; and the resultant costs to the State, which also needs to be considered.  Both sides promote safety and rid the process of postcode discrimination.  I can never remember the name, but it is either a proficiency or a proliferation issue, whereby there are two licensing platforms between jurisdictions.  This would be standardised by a new system.</p>  <p>  The link between the practical and administrative sides is the Garda. In the new comprehensive system, the Garda would be empowered by the introduction of properly trained firearms officers who interact with and monitor the practical side and safety at a club level.  These officers would have the opportunity to be involved with firearm and magazine manufacturers regarding the issue of reducing magazine load maximums to Irish standards.  In my document, I recommended a ten-cartridge magazine maximum, as the new system promotes considerably safer shooting within a controlled environment and, as a trickle-down effect, a safer storage mentality, reducing the potential for firearm thefts.</p>  <p>  The current emphasis on justification for firearm ownership needs to make way for a more progressive regime that places more responsibility on the applicant in terms of performance, which in turn should allow for the availability of a variety of firearm platforms without the need to restrict calibres or magazine capacities.  If an applicant desires a firearm, and desiring versus justification being the point, then the time and costs associated with gaining accreditation prior to due diligence should be worthwhile.  Not only that but, in having a better understanding of a firearm, its storage, its capability, its maintenance and its ownership, both the licensee and the firearm should be safer as a result.  There is a trend to my point, with justification, responsibility, desire and fun heading in the right direction.</p>  <p>  Aside from the animal husbandry issue, there is no justification for civilians to own and shoot firearms in the Republic other than for sport and fun.  Thus, a provision for the responsible ownership of firearms over and above that of limiting the choice of firearm available to the potentially irresponsible needs to be considered.  I will cite an example of the firearm licensing application process from the review document.  According to it, "other rifles could be licensed for the same purpose" as the semi-automatic platform that is under review today, but this implies that such other rifles could as easily be used for wrongdoing or unlawful concerns.  This point is worth reviewing, as it places the responsibility on the firearm as opposed to the user.</p>  <p>  The proposal in "Working Solution" is the implementation of a new comprehensive system based upon years of gathered experience that educates firearm users to be responsible as opposed to the placing of limits on the equipment that uneducated firearm users can access.  This will promote the sport and safety on the practical side while greatly reducing the likelihood of crime, for example, a lower risk of theft, and the risk of an atrocity because the practical and administrative sides will work well together.</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge the courtesy and assistance that the association has received from the committee secretariat, notably Mr. Alan Guidon, in preparing for this session.</p>  <p>  Please let me introduce myself.  My name is Damien Hannigan and I am secretary of the Wild Deer Association of Ireland.  This organisation represents the interests of more than 4,500 deer stalkers throughout Ireland.  Our members also partake in other licensed sports, including competition target shooting, another activity affected by the proposed amendments.  Our interest goes beyond one of sport, though.  We assist with the training and certification of deer stalkers and educate in the skills of ethical deer management.  The association also focuses on the conservation of Ireland's deer population and continues to work closely with the Garda and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, in tackling Ireland's wildlife crime epidemic.  We work with other leading country sports organisations, such as Countryside Alliance Ireland, to ensure these animals are protected for future generations.</p>  <p>  As the committee will be aware, there has been considerable controversy about the proposals contained in the working group report.  This is because the report is not only flawed, but also highly offensive to Ireland's responsible sporting shooters.  Several statements and comments have been made by the working group that suggest there is a relationship between the ownership of legally held, sporting firearms and criminal activity.  The report cites public safety as the basis for the proposed changes.  While public safety is to the fore of the association's objectives, we strongly disagree with this aspect of the report, as there is no evidence to show any link between legally held sporting firearms and a risk to the safety of the general public.</p> <p>If we look to other examples of firearms legislation, we can receive guidance on what is effective for both the responsible sporting shooters and public safety.  Northern Ireland has some of the strictest gun licensing laws but the use of handguns and the reloading of ammunition in a private residence are licensed without negative consequences for public safety or an increase in criminal activity.  In fact, a recent report published by the PSNI shows a year-on-year decline in firearm and ammunition offences since 2003, resulting in just four offences in 2014.</p> <p> We fully agree that any firearm licensing policy must satisfy the suitability of an individual to hold a firearm licence in the interests of public safety.  The association and Ireland&rsquo;s responsible shooters see the current licensing system as completely sufficient in this regard.  Our current licensing system ranks as one of the most restrictive within the EU.  As a responsible hunting organisation, we welcome any attempt to end the criminal misuse of firearms.  However, we reiterate that there is no relationship between the ownership of legally held sporting firearms and criminal activity.  If our organisation can provide any further information to the Chairman or members of the committee, we would be happy to oblige.</p></speech>

I am chief range safety officer and firearms instructor at Harbour House Sports Club, which is a sporting amenity based in Athy, County Kildare.  We cater for the sporting needs of the local community and a wider community of target shooting members by providing rifle and pistol facilities.  Harbour House Sports Club was formed in 2006.  Our ranges have been inspected by the Department of Justice and Equality appointed range inspector and are approved for the purpose of target shooting with pistols and rifles.<br/>Harbour House has been authorised by the local Garda superintendent to operate as a target rifle and pistol club.  The club is operated to statutory requirements as dictated by the current firearms legislation.  Conditions have been attached to the operation of the club and range by the authorising letter from the Garda superintendent, copies of which were supplied to the committee.  Given such scrutiny and our compliance with the strict regulations laid down by the 2006 amendments to the Firearms Acts and associated statutory instruments, the committee might be of a mind to acknowledge that we are a highly regulated sport and that the substantial thrust of such regulation is in the interest of public safety.<br/>Harbour House has just over 300 members.  We cater for male and female members as well as individuals with disabilities.  Target shooting sports are one of the sports in which men and women, disabled and able-bodied, can compete equally side by side.  Some 188 pistols are currently licensed to our members.  Harbour House is passionate about the safe use of firearms.  Since we opened in 2006, we have trained 72 members to an internationally recognised level as certified range safety officers.  Target shooting in its various forms is practised every week of the year, and we cater for rifle and pistol shooting.  Our membership is very safety conscious, with members having to undergo a mandatory course in the safe handling of firearms in the first month of membership.  As a sporting amenity with more than 300 members, we provide a valuable contribution to the local and wider community.  With our membership possessing 188 licensed pistols, the proposed changes to the legislation would have a devastating impact on our club.  Volunteerism and community are the fundamental values on which the club is run.  The membership of the Harbour House would certainly drop below the critical level required to sustain the viability of the club and range.  The livelihoods of our proprietors would be ruined.  Men and women who have suffered the long years of austerity comforted by the knowledge that they could pursue their sport in peace will feel a deep disappointment in a Government which they have supported but which now oversees the removal of their sporting pastime while avoiding any liability for compensation.  Criminal activity would be unimpeded by any such move and would likely continue apace, as was the experience in the UK when short firearms were banned in that jurisdiction.<br/>In our nearest neighbour, Northern Ireland, in excess of 13,935 handguns are licensed to private citizens.  Northern Ireland has carried out several reviews of its legislation and has not made any changes to lawful firearms ownership or access.  In 1998, in the aftermath of the tragedy in Dunblane, the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, with a full understanding of Lord Cullen's report, stated: &quot;After much thought, I am not persuaded of the need to prohibit the possession and use of target handguns in Northern Ireland.&quot;  To this day, target handgun shooting is alive and well in Northern Ireland.  Given that pistols have been licensed in this State since 2004 and have been used safely since then, we ask for evidence that would validate the claim by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that our sport is a danger to public safety.Removing our ability to practise this sport would benefit the economy of Northern Ireland because the prosperity related to shooting sports will move there.<br/>In 2006, amendments to the firearms legislation introduced standards for the development and operation of shooting ranges.  Legislators saw fit to provide for the construction of rifle and pistol ranges with the clear intention of facilitating rifle and pistol target shooting while meeting the primary objective of ensuring public safety.  The investment in the range facilities at Harbour House to comply with the legislation has amounted to more than &euro;400,000.  The review conducted by the Garda and the Department of Justice and Equality makes a mockery of the construction standards, as well as the regulation and certification of the ranges by departmentally appointed range inspectors and, in particular, the highly regulated conditions set out by the Garda for the operation of the club and ranges at Harbour House.  The legislative amendments of 2006 recognised the legitimacy of pistol shooting.<br/>Harbour House has not recorded any breach of the firearms legislation by its members in the storage, transport or use of firearms for target shooting.  Our ranges have not been cited for any breach in the conditions as laid down by the local Garda superintendent.  Ranges operate to the standards dictated by legislation but now we find our sport under attack from the Garda through speculation and scaremongering about the potential for a limited number of firearms and, by extension, their owners to commit an atrocity.  Not one shred of evidence has been recorded by the Garda of any malpractice by Harbour House or indeed any other authorised sports club in the State.  Harbour House urges the members of the joint committee to see through this report because it carries no substance, provides no evidence as to the real likelihood of an atrocity being perpetrated by a lawfully licensed firearms holder, and to initiate an investigation into the maladministration of the firearms legislation by the Garda, which has resulted in 650 District Court cases and nearly 200 judicial review proceedings.  It is the considered view of members of Harbour House Sports Club that the recommendations are aimed at nothing other than legitimising the maladministration of the firearms legislation and will give unreasonable power to the Garda with respect to firearms licensing.  The effect of such changes would be far-reaching but no substantial evidence as to their need has been offered in the report.<br/>The Minister for Justice and Equality was reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>as stating that politics is the place where, through one's actions, one can change people's lives for the better.  We believe the recommendations in this report would not constitute a change for the better.  With the Minister's thoughts in mind, I urge the committee to determine what evidence, if any, exists with respect to the misuse of the firearms which the Garda wants to remove from civilian ownership and what proof has been offered that the removal of such firearms would have any effect other than the negative impact on sports people's lives.  I am happy to answer any questions that members may wish to raise regarding the submission of Harbour House Sporting Club.</p></speech>

I have been director of the association since 2006 and I am currently its treasurer.  I have served as international team manager and I am one of the association&rsquo;s delegates to the Olympic Council of Ireland.  I am also a qualified International Shooting Sports Federation, ISSF, judge and an active participant in our sports up to and including national level.</p>  <p>  The National Target Shooting Association, NTSA, is the sole national governing body for the rifle and pistol disciplines of the ISSF.  Seven of these ISSF disciplines are Olympic events.  The NTSA is a member of the Olympic Council of Ireland as the recognised national governing body for Olympic rifle and pistol events and is affiliated to the Federation of Irish Sports and to the European Shooting Confederation.  Our membership is drawn from affiliated clubs on the island of Ireland and our athletes compete nationally and internationally in ISSF world cups and European and World Championships.  Members have participated in previous Olympic Games and most recently in the London Paralympics.</p>  <p>  It is a somewhat surreal experience for a sporting body to be invited before a committee such as this in the context of legislation and, primarily, criminal legislation.</p> <p>Be that as it may, we fully understand that the equipment we use is not available as a right but as a privilege bestowed by these Houses and by extension, the people of this State.  In that context, we have engaged fully with the firearms consultative panel which was put in place by the late Minister, Brian Lenihan and see our submission to this committee as a continuation of that process.<br/>The review was carried out for the following reasons.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had expressed concerns in respect of the continued licensing of certain firearms in the interests of public safety.  Members of the Judiciary had also cited lack of clarity and difficulty in interpretation of existing legislative provisions and had also raised the question of whether certain firearms should be banned given the concerns raised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of appeals of their decisions to refuse the licensing of such firearms.<br/>This issue of public safety is addressed in the Firearms Act many times.  An extension of the meaning of public safety beyond the consideration of an individual application seems unwieldy and in the context of an Act that concerns itself with such applications may well prove unworkable in practice.  The quote by Mr. Justice Charleton in the working group report seems to indicate that it is unnecessary.  He said: &quot;The Act makes it clear that considerations of public safety, the good order of the community and the proliferation of weapons within a particular district, and within the community generally, are all matters ... which can and should be taken into account.&quot;  The issue of theft is a concern to us all.  There are provisions in the current Firearms Act under SI 307 of 2009 that specify the minimum level of security required for every category of licensed firearm.  If further security requirements are deemed necessary to safeguard the public, we would be happy to discuss these with the interested parties, as we have done in the lead-up to the original statutory instrument being published.<br/>In our written submission to the committee, we described the basis of the Firearms Acts as resting on the individual, so-called good reason and the licensing authority.  It is our belief that the diverse nature of the licensing authority coupled with the complexity of the law as written and amended is at the root of most of the issues encountered.<br/>One of the most striking omissions in the report was that of inconsistency in the application of the law with regard to firearms licensing.  This has been a problem throughout the more recent history of the Firearms Act and is rooted in the fact that there are in excess of 100 different licensing authorities in the State - Garda districts and divisions.  With even the best systems and training, it is almost impossible to find consistency with such a large and varied administrative base.  This is further exacerbated by the normally occurring personnel changes through promotion, relocation or retirement.  Add to this a legislative framework that runs to more than 60 pages, including statutory instruments, and systems failure is inevitable.<br/>We are proposing that licensing should be centralised.  The benefits of a centralised system are: consistency in application of the law in respect of firearms; the capacity to create a team of knowledgeable professionals capable of dealing with all matters relating to civilian firearms ownership - as in the UK, these need not be serving garda&iacute;; the freeing up of district and divisional resources for core activities; the creation of a permanent knowledge base within the team; a corresponding reduction in costs for every district in the State; a far more efficient system of administration; the ending of the <i>persona designata</i>anomaly; the almost certain reduction in court appeals that seem to have inconsistency at their kernel; and the capability of a centralised licensing authority to take a more holistic view of the entire licensing landscape and influence policy directly.<br/>The argument made against this kind of system was alluded to in the report.  This was that district officers would have a far greater knowledge of local matters and therefore be in a better position to adjudicate on applications than a central authority.  This cannot be gainsaid.  Clearly, district officers are indeed in a better place to adjudicate on applications, but this seems to rule out any possibility of communication between a centralised licensing authority and a local district superintendent or other officer.  It is difficult to understand how this can be such a strong case against centralisation as to outweigh the many positives outlined above.<br/>It is our belief that the current licensing system has many failings but ease of access to firearms is not one of them.  The current situation, which appears to be driven by a small number of court cases, could be paraphrased as hard cases make bad law.  If a review of the Firearms Act seems necessary, our view is that it is necessary to modernise and simplify its operation first.  If there is a recognised need to improve security, consultation with the relevant stakeholders would surely provide mutually agreeable solutions.  We would respectfully suggest recalling the firearms consultative panel to discuss these proposals.</p></speech>

I work for the National Association of Regional Game Councils, which is the largest shooting organisation in the State.  In respect of the matter before the committee, I am also representing eight additional associations.  On behalf of all of them and the various supporting organisations, I thank the Chairman for affording me the opportunity to address the committee on their behalf.</p>  <p>  Sport shooting in its various forms has always been popular in Ireland and today is passionately enjoyed by tens of thousands of hunting and competitive target shooting enthusiasts.  It is an honourable pastime which demands skill, discipline, commitment and a very high level of responsibility.  Some people enjoy golf or cycling or canoeing with great passion, and sports shooting people are no different except in one regard.  Each and every one must pass a rigorous character vetting by the Garda, provide strict home security measures and meet a raft of other personal requirements to be allowed participate in their sport.  This is a singularly unique difference between sports shooting and other sports, but Irish firearms owners have been staunch supporters of our strict licensing regime which is the toughest in Europe, as the committee has already heard from one of my colleagues.  The current regime was agreed by all the stakeholders, both State and sporting, and was implemented in August 2009, so it is only five years old.  It is, therefore, not an exaggeration to say that all who participate in shooting sports are among the most law-abiding citizens in the State, having had to submit to rigorous vetting.</p>  <p>  It should be no surprise to anyone, therefore, that the current measures to place further restrictions on access to our sport without just cause have been received with alarm and anger by sports shooting enthusiasts.  A joint working group comprising representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have produced a report and recommendations which purport to address a public safety issue based on an unsubstantiated allegation of a connection between lawful firearms ownership and criminal use of firearms and a further unsubstantiated allegation that members of the Judiciary have expressed difficulty in interpreting the provisions of the Firearms Acts.</p>  <p>  The data supplied to support the recommendations are variously false, selective, self-serving and biased.  The facts of the matter are there is no credible evidence that such a link, and therefore risk, exists.  The Sports Coalition submits that no data have been provided to support the contentions and recommendations in the report and we assert that no data exist which would substantiate the arguments made.  On the contrary, we have submitted significant evidence that there is no link between legal firearms ownership and criminal use of firearms.  We say that all the international data and studies demonstrate that restrictions on legal ownership of firearms have never resulted in a reduction in either gun crime or risk to public safety.  In pressing that argument, we have repeatedly called for an independent risk assessment and we believe this is warranted where the State proposes to ban our lawful activities and seize our property.  That request has thus far been refused.  We submit that where the State proposes to seize private property, and in this case without compensation, which we believe would in any event be ultimately held to be unlawful, the State has a very high duty of care to ensure that its proposed actions are justified and proportionate to the risk alleged.  That bar has not been met in this case.</p>  <p>  The report and recommendations must be viewed against a background of serial breaches of the firearms legislation by the licensing authorities since 2009-----</p></speech>

The current recommendations have nothing to do with a link between lawful firearms ownership and crime but seek to legitimise the breaches of the legislation and to provide a legislative framework within which they can happen.  To use the arguments which have been put forward to justify these recommendations is extremely offensive to a very large section of society, the members of which, as I have said, are four square law-abiding.  Having suffered five years of inconvenience, cost, arbitrary decisions and disregard for the laws which govern our sport at the hands of those whose constitutional duty is to uphold the law, this group of citizens have become exasperated and exhausted and have had enough.</p> <p>There are still 40 cases of challenges in the High Court.  Only yesterday, the Deputy Master of the court remarked that it was rather unfair to the applicants, and the matter has now been referred to the President of the High Court.</p> <p> We are willing, able and ready to work with the authorities if there is a problem in order to address it, but nobody has approached us to work with us on that.  We trust that the committee members will have due regard to our factual arguments, data and proposals, as set out in our submission.  I am quite happy to answer any questions the Chairman's colleagues may have.</p></speech>

We will now open the discussion to members of the committee for questions.  The format is that each member will ask just three questions initially so no one can monopolise the proceedings.

I welcome the contributors and thank them for their submission.  Bearing in mind that they represent people involved in an activity that is legal and licensed and that they rightly take exception to their being compared with people who engage in unlawful activity, could they describe the engagement they have had, individually or collectively, with the Department of Justice and Equality?  How did it go for them?  Is a channel available to them through which they can communicate with the relevant officials engaged in formulating policy and making decisions in the Department?  That question is open to all.</p></speech>

As a representative of the shooting bodies between 1995 and 2004, I engaged directly with the Department on all the issues we had.  Leading up to the 2004 High Court challenges and the licensing of the first handgun, we experienced no co-operation or no meeting of the waters.  There was no engagement to meet us halfway.  When the High Court ruled on the first pistol and the pistols were licensed as a consequence of that ruling, a raft of legislative changes were proposed.  There were 42 amendments to the Firearms Acts.</p>  <p>  We worked directly with the principal officer in the Department, Mr. Tom Lynch, on the content and format of the changes to the legislation.  While it did not come out perfectly, it was very successful.  In the engagement we brought the officials of the Department to Northern Ireland and showed them the range standards that were applied.  Prior to the amendments in 2006, there were no range standards in Ireland.  One could put a pistol range in a field if one wanted.  We found that was a considerable issue affecting the security and future providence of our sport.  We brought the departmental officials to Northern Ireland and showed them the clubs and ranges there.  At that time, consideration was given to not licensing or perhaps removing some handguns.  A decision was made by the legislators at the time that handguns should be licensed in a very controlled manner.  We engaged in that legislative process.  The outcome was the 42 amendments to the legislation, which brought forward the storage conditions and the question of restricted and non-restricted licences, separating the elements of the decision-making process within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The legislative changes were absolutely in line with public safety guidelines.  Everything in them related to public safety, including the storage conditions.  The storage facility required in a person's home to hold a firearm is extremely expensive and requires a very arduous process.  It is very secure, however.  A person with a restricted firearm needs to have a monitored alarm and a gun safe.  If he has more than one restricted firearm, he needs to have a GSM backed-up monitored alarm, which is extremely expensive.  One has to be a member of an authorised and recognised club.  This was a requirement in the legislation if one wanted to own a pistol or restricted firearm.</p>  <p>  At the time in question, the amendments brought forward were very onerous but resulted in a range of standards.  As I stated in my opening submission, the cost of applying the standard to the clubs was extremely high.  The range inspector was appointed.  A range inspector has a very good function.  He inspects the ranges and then makes a recommendation to the local superintendent on bringing the club and range in question up to a particular standard.  The local superintendent then applies conditions for the running of the club.  These apply to the membership, range access, etc.</p>  <p>  The regulation brought forward in 2004 made the process very functional and safe.  I am absolutely at a loss as to why the joint review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the justice officials resulted in such a raft of ridiculous and unnecessary proposals when our sport is so well-regulated.  There is no evidence that we have any problems.</p>  <p>  To return to the main point, engagement with the Department was very effective in 2004.  We sat with the person who wrote the legislation and made our comments.  Changes were made to the legislation and the final result was very satisfying.  We all agreed on it.</p></speech>

I listened carefully to their submissions, as I did to Chief Superintendent Healy when he was before the committee.  I am not a firearms expert so witnesses will have to bear with me.  They will probably find I make points on which I am not accurate.  However, I am just giving the picture as I see it.  I represent a north Dublin constituency where, unfortunately, there is gangland crime and where illegally held firearms are used.  People are shot in the street and in their homes.  I recall, in particular, the shooting of a young woman called Donna Cleary in 2006 in Coolock.</p></speech>

Chief Superintendent Healy referred to the fact that licensed firearms are sometimes stolen and used by criminal gangs.  There are grounds for believing that.  The chief superintendent also raised the issue of what he termed assault rifles.  I acknowledge Mr. Flood has won international competitions in this area.  The superintendent made the point that some of the rifles used in target shooting and sports are what he called assault rifles.  The rifle automatically reloads every time it is fired.  It is not the old-style bolt action rifle that requires the shooter to work the bolt each time and then re-aim.  The weapons in question fire continuously.  The chief superintendent asked why a shooter who wishes to improve his target shooting and game shooting needs an assault rifle, which is basically a military-style weapon.</p></speech>

Assaults rifles are illegal in Ireland and every other country in Europe but the difficulty is the use of language.  It may have been the case that Chief Superintendent Healy made an error.  An assault rifle is selectable fire and when the trigger is pulled, it will fire many rounds.  No such rifle is held by a legally held licensee in Ireland.</p></speech>

The terminology "assault rifle" is interspersed inaccurately throughout the review document.  As Mr. Flood said, assault rifles by their very nature are prohibited within the EU under its guidelines.  For the Garda to even use the terminology and to state assault rifles are licensed in this jurisdiction is emotive and it does not do the credibility of the report any good.  Let us stick to the facts.  There are licensed rifles in this country that self-load when the trigger is pulled.  These are semi-automatic rifles.  That is common not only of centre fire rifles or what the Garda refers to as assault rifles, but it is also common to .22 rimfire rifles------</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.878" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Keogh" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015012100007#F00600"><p>Centre fire rifles are primarily used by deer stalkers and target shooters at long distances because the bullet is much larger and the firing pin hits the centre of the back of the cartridge, which is why it is designated centre fire.  It is an accurate and powerful cartridge.  Rimfire cartridges have a little indent on the side of the rim because there is very little powder in them.  They are popular in Ireland.  There are approximately 35,000 licensed rimfire rifles.</p>  <p>  I refer back to the mainstay of the concept of assault rifles and why we are under threat in respect of them.  There is a perception that they look like assault rifles.  Function is everything in firearms.  Function is the important aspect of a firearm.  Whether a person picks up a rifle with a bolt action or a semi-automatic rifle, they may have the same calibre cartridge and, therefore, the function will be the same.  Every firearm in the possession of a civilian was originally designed and evolved from a military look-alike rifle.  The 1903 Springfield rifle is an original rifle before the old .303s.  Every hunting rifle our colleagues in the wild deer society use is based on that.  If the argument was taken to its extreme, it could be said that there should be no licensed firearms in this State because they all look like or emanated from assault rifles or military style rifles.</p>  <p>  The reason we need to keep centre fire rifles that self-load is there is a significant competitive edge.  My colleagues in the target shooting area will agree with this.  When one gets down to shoot a rifle at a bullseye, which is small, from 600 m or 1,000 m, the slightest movement in one's body can set the rifle off.  Conventional rifles for target shooting have a bolt, which is lifted up and pulled back.  If I am lying prone, lift the bolt, pull it back and manipulate it into position, I will change my position.  The reason self-loading rifles are so popular in competitive target shooting is the movement of the body is neutralised.  The competitor can pull the trigger once, the gun fires and it reloads itself and, therefore, from a competitive point of view, it is an important firearm to have.</p>  <p>  We must get the terminology right.  Self-loading rifles that look traditionally like assault rifles and are accused of being so are modern sporting rifles.  They are manufactured to current standards.  It is similar to cars.  Do we want to have cars that were manufactured in 1960 for everyday use or do we want to move forward with a hybrid and use a car for a particular purpose based on efficiency and improvement?  The terminology used in the report is disingenuous, misleading and amounts to scaremongering because we do not have assault rifles.  Perhaps the rifles we use look like assault rifles.</p>  <p>  There is a provision in the current Act under which .22 rifles that look assault rifles have to be registered as restricted firearms, which is ridiculous, because they are black and have pistol grips.  Their function is the same as standard .22 semi-automatic rifles but if members of our clubs want one for a particular purpose, they have to apply to the chief superintendent and, under normal circumstances because it is a restricted firearm, he will interview the applicants, which is a waste of police time. </p></speech>

Where does that come into competitive shooting?  If somebody is aiming at a target and firing single shots, is there a timeframe involved?  I expect that each time a shooter reloads a single shot rifle, it will be just as accurate as a rifle that automatically reloads.  Will Mr. Keogh explain how the competitive edge blends into this?</p></speech>

One of the ways is when people are shooting long distance, they have to deal with external ballistics, which could be wind, mirage and a number of other factors.  There could be a particular type of wind and the shooter will know it will blow his round off a particular distance.  He will make an allowance on his scope and make up for the continuous wind he is seeing.  He tries to shoot with the wind.  A semi-automatic rifle will reload the round and the shooter can fire a round every few seconds.  Not only as Mr. Keogh said can the person get away from having to come out of the rifle position, pull the bolt, reload the round and get down, which takes a few seconds, but he can hold position on the target as well as defeat the wind characteristics.  It is used by competitors in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

Do not get me wrong.  Many guys will train and train and they have equipment jackets, swings and so on which will bring them tight in around the rifle.  However, they can secure an additional advantage in some type of competitions with a semi-automatic rifle.</p></speech>

If a shooter wants to take a follow-on shot having acquired a target, he wants to shoot the animal instantly in case he has taken a bad shot to begin with.  The semi-automatic platform allows for that much more quickly and with more ease than cycling the bolt because one has to move away from the target.</p>  <p>  A semi-automatic platform, given the way it is manufactured and works, is much softer on the shoulder, which is easier for elderly shooters.  I had a shoulder injury and I went to use my semi-automatic platform because it was nicer when I was recovering.  One can get a hell of a kick off a .308 rifle.  The semi-automatic platform is better for certain reasons.</p></speech>

I take great issue with the statistics used because depending on who one listens to and where the question is posed, one tends to hear a different statistic in this regard.</p> <p>Where the question is posed, one tends to get a different statistic on this particular matter but I draw the committee's attention to the figure quoted in the report, namely, 1,134 stolen firearms in the period 2010 to 2013.  That represents 0.554% of all firearms licensed in the State during that period and taken on an annual basis, it is 0.138%.  It is minuscule.</p> <p> On 17 December the joint group came before the committee and it was alluded to that 45 semi-automatic shotguns would be affected.  I have an issue with that statistic.  There are 8,700 semi-automatic shotguns licensed in the State.  They are the favoured shooting tool of farmers.  In terms of having one which is restricted in its manufacture, the recommendation in the report refers to "manufactured not to hold...".  The operative word is "manufactured".  There is no semi-automatic manufactured in which the magazine cannot be changed.  That is a particular problem.  That would mean that every semi-automatic shotgun in the country would be affected by these proposals, and that is many more than 45.  Only last week in the D&aacute;il in response to a question from Deputy Collins, if I am not mistaken, the Minister stated that regarding this matter only - I note the use of the word "only" - 6% of firearms would be affected.  That is now 12,000 firearms that would be affected.  Members will see the difficulty I have with these moveable statistics.</p> <p> I want to make one last point on that.  Regarding the figure of 1,134 firearms, the committee may not be aware but that figure includes deactivated firearms, starting pistols which do not fire anything at all, humane killers, which would be stolen from vets and so on, and firearms stolen from firearms dealers' premises.  In other words, a great many firearms are not sitting with ordinary firearms licensing holders but the theft of those are being laid at our doorstep, as it were, as a justification for this report.  That is one of the reasons it has become rather offensive to support people who engage in shooting for sport.</p></speech>

I wanted to explain something I think Mr. Kenny may not understand.  It is the difference between semi-automatic and bolt action.  Semi-automatic and bolt action are fairly much the same because the action has to work after one pulls the trigger.  In other words, one cannot hold one's finger on the trigger while firing rounds; one must let go and pull the trigger again.  There is a delay between one shot and the next, and one has to consciously take one shot after another.  One cannot just blast the target out of the sky.</p>  <p>  One of the problems in terms of the terminology is that the assault rifle brings to people's mind the image of someone running around the streets spraying lead in all directions.  There is nothing like that unlicensed in this country.  A semi-automatic rifle is virtually no different from a bolt action rifle in terms of how it works except that one does not have to operate a bolt; the machine does that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.888" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Keogh" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015012100008#G00400"><p>I would like to make two points, one of which is in response to the question Deputy Kenny asked about assault rifles.  It is very important to point out that semi-automatic centre fire rifles are classified as restricted firearms, therefore, an individual who applies for a semi-automatic licence is required to have a much higher standard of requirement for that particular firearm than would be the case for a standard firearm.  I do not believe that has been emphasised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is akin to a licence for a pistol of higher calibre in that they must make an application to the chief superintendent, and they must show single cause for having that particular firearm.  I do not believe these licences have been given out lightly and, therefore, I strongly contend that they should remain.</p>  <p>  The second point is that I live in north County Dublin and I empathise with what was said about the loss of life.  It is regrettable.  I take grave exception to the contention and the evidence given by Chief Superintendent Healy in which he described that they were unable to separate the potential that a licensed firearm might be used in crime because they had not been recovered.  I refer back to the 2006 legislation.  It is disingenuous because within the 2006 legislation there is a facility for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ballistically test and ballistically signature each firearm in this country.  In that regard I refer to Northern Ireland where more than 13,500 hand guns are licensed.  Every licence for a hand gun in Northern Ireland requires the owner to hand it in for ballistic testing.  That means that the bullet and the cartridge is kept on file.  That means it is digitally retrievable and can be identified.  At a crime scene, therefore, if a bullet is recovered it can then be matched against the bank of lawfully-held firearms to rule out the implication that any firearm has been used in the crime.</p>  <p>  I keep changing my numbers but we know the number is vast in regard to hand guns in Northern Ireland.  The PSNI has never discovered a lawfully-held pistol having been used in crime that was not stolen.  From the point of view of the evidence given by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it has it in its gift to ballistically test the approximately 600 centre fire firearms.  We should make no mistake that into the future it will have no problem ensuring that it can guarantee that the firearm used in the crime was not legally held.  I strongly contend that is the case.</p></speech>

In particular, I draw his attention to section 4, which proposes amendments to the Firearms Act regarding conditions for the granting of a firearms certificate.  Without going through the full list, some of the proposed amendments that would warrant refusal for a firearms permit would be the lethality of the firearm and the size, shape and appearance of the firearm.  My colleagues described the differences in detail.</p>  <p>  In our day to day dealings with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we can find that in one Garda district a certain firearm was granted to one of our members whereas if one travels down the road to another Garda district, a person of a similar background could be refused for the same firearm.  That demonstrates the inconsistency in the process.  This proposed amendment to section 4 of the Act is of real concern to our members because it will exacerbate that issue in the future.</p></speech>

The reality is that the number of the calibre is irrelevant.  People might say that a high calibre pistol was used in a murder.  It does not matter whether one is killed by a small calibre or a high calibre firearm.</p></speech>

That is the reason they are regulated to such a high degree.  They are very well regulated.  One must have everything in place to have a firearm.</p>  <p>  The original tenet of the Firearms Act 1925 was that a determination was made that the person was suitable to acquire or own a firearm.  The calibres and the make and type of firearms are so diverse that once one is qualified to be a firearms owner, that should be the last question.  </p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, there are major differences between calibres.  We have .22 and then much larger calibre rounds.</p> <p>However, their designation does not necessarily tell the story about their size.  It is a very complex and technical area.</p></speech>

A lot of emphasis is placed on the platform, the calibre and the capacity, when really it is down to the individual.  Perhaps further checks and balances could be put in place to ensure that the individual behind the platform is much more competent.  However, the object in itself is really inanimate.</p></speech>

In the absence of natural predators, it falls on man to manage our deer populations.  When people are involved in deer management, it is in effect a job they are undertaking as opposed to something done for fun.</p></speech>

My background as a criminal lawyer means that I would disagree with the issue on perception and functionality of firearms.  In terms of perception, it is very important when firearms are being used for illegal purposes.  That is why we ban imitation handguns.  Colleagues will be glad to hear I have only two questions.</p>  <p>  I return to the issue of public safety and consistency of standards.  Some of the witnesses, particularly Mr. Symes, spoke about storage and holding conditions.  Many witnesses referred to inconsistency.  The theme through many submissions is the very real concern of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about thefts of legally held firearms.  The witnesses' concern is that that fear is being used as a reason to drive more restrictive conditions.</p>  <p>  Mr. Symes, in particular, pointed out that further security requirements, where deemed necessary to safeguard the public, could be discussed.  I understand that the current conditions on holding and storage of firearms are based on guidelines and are not contained in primary legislation.  Am I right in saying that there is no sanction for breach of those other than that the firearm holder could have his or her licence revoked in future?  Would any of the witnesses agree with strengthening some of those provisions relating to, for example, the requirement for a gun safe, alarm and so on?</p></speech>

It is not confined to guidelines, although there are published guidelines.  There is a statutory instrument, a secure accommodation order, which is not primary legislation but secondary legislation.  The Act in primary legislation sets out a requirement that the firearm must be held securely.  The statutory instrument simply sets out the detail of that.</p>  <p>  There are different levels of security depending on the number and type of firearm one seeks to own.  There are three primary considerations in the grant of a firearms certificate, of which security is one.  The others are suitability of the applicant and good reason for requiring the firearm.  All of those must combine to direct a decision either to grant or to refuse a firearm.</p>  <p>  In terms of the security of firearms, for some time we have been seeking to get an answer, and have not managed to get it, through parliamentary questions on the number of handguns stolen from firearms licence holders since the new security requirements were implemented in 2009.  Nobody has yet answered that question for us.  I believe Deputy Niall Collins has asked the question, as have various other Members of the D&aacute;il, and we still await that answer.  I suspect that we will all be surprised by the answer to that.  I think it will uphold the notion that it is not actually a problem area.</p></speech>

The point I was making in our submission is that if there is an issue with security under the current SI, we have not been consulted about that issue.  We have not been informed by any of the authorities that there is a problem with the levels of security as stated in the SI.  We have not been consulted as to whether there are any other possible levels of security that could be introduced.  We have not been consulted on or informed of any breakdowns in the current security levels.  We are in a bit of a void at the moment as regards this issue.</p></speech>

Women are some of the most formidable shooters.  Some have won world championships and compete on equal terms.  There is no gender element at all within target shooting.  It is one of the most gender-neutral sports.  One can say even from a personal perspective that, as opposed to men, a woman's hips come in quite handy when shooting standing up.  There are many advantages and there are no gender differences.  They shoot together.</p></speech>

I am employed by a hunting organisation and the dynamic tends to be somewhat different there.  It is fair to say that there would be fewer women in it.  However, it is a changing dynamic and more women are coming into the sport every week.  If we consider some other European countries, in Sweden, for example, 15% of the hunting population are women.  It is a pretty tough sport in which to be involved in those conditions.</p></speech>

I cannot give the percentage, but in our club and nationally, the National Association of Rifle and Pistol Clubs have evolved a programme, called "Women on Target", which has been in place since 2010.  That programme is open to ladies only because we want to draw more people into the support.  They have a focused firearms safety day in which they get to fire pistols and rifles.  There is morning training on pistols and training in the afternoon on rifles.  We have internationally recognised certified instructors instructing.  Since 2010, we have put about 300 ladies through the programme in various clubs in the country.  The uptake has been significant.  We usually get about 20% of the participants at Women on Target programme.</p> <p>Fortunately or unfortunately, their favoured firearm is the pistol.  They are extremely good pistol shots.  One of the consequences of the proposed amendments would be to destroy that aspect of the sport.</p></speech>

They seem to bring an important sense of calm and responsibility into the environment in a lot of sports.  If one had a system that promoted all the facilities within the clubs as infrastructure around the country, one would bring more women into the sport and that would encourage health competition, and stability as a result.  Safety is a factor of that.</p></speech>

As they were saying this, I wondered whether they understood where we and the Minister are coming from - that we are concerned that it is a public safety issue and we will ask the questions.  I got the impression that the witnesses do not seem to appreciate that firearms are dangerous weapons and there is public concern about the availability, whether illegally or legally, of firearms.  I thought some of the groups' reactions were a little lackadaisical in that they did not get that message.  My question relates to statement that there was no relationship between ownership and criminal activity.  If one looks, for example, at arms ownership in the United States and other countries, and at the amount of deaths and violence, one can see there is a link.  The other issue mentioned about which I am concerned is that of illegal activities and gangs seeking possession of legally held firearms.  I agree with Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny.  I know well Inspector Colm Healy in Coolock Garda Station, who is a top-class garda fighting gangs.</p></speech>

If he has concerns about persons in certain cities and certain towns and about gangs finding out who owns the legally held weapons, these are genuine concerns.  My question is, do they appreciate the broader concern of society that weapons are dangerous?  They use them for sports and they are very responsible, and we accept that point.  When they come in here and use terms such as "scaremongering", "insulted", "offensive" and "anger", I hope they understand the broader debate and what is going on here.</p></speech>

It is because of that agreement that we over the past number of years have worked diligently to make that the case, and that is why we have the statistics to put forward.</p>  <p>  On the criminality aspect and the feeling of insult, I will use the example that when I was looking for sponsorship, I would send out letters to various companies and they would send back a cheque, maybe for &euro;1,000, with a little caveat at the end asking us not to thank them but saying that we were welcome and they wished us all the best.  The reason for that was the association of firearms with criminality and the idea of "If it bleeds, it leads" in press coverage.  Many involved in the shooting community and shooting sports have encountered that.  They have been held in that ether.  They have participated and have done the best job they could in taking criminality extremely seriously in the responsibility of their ownership.  None of those I know who have been involved in competitive target shooting do not take it seriously.  They take it extremely seriously.  It is as a result of this that the statistics are good.</p>  <p>  I have travelled to the United States - I have been in many different countries.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has done a fantastic job over the years.  Nobody will take that away from them.  The legislation that we have and the work that has been done by the different committees over the years have resulted in a very good environment where we can carry on with our shooting sports and at the same time keep public safety, which Deputy McGrath mentioned, to the fore in how we carry out our sport.  Comparing us to the United States is not good.  I have been there, and I know.  I remember once borrowing a car from somebody and they said, "Listen, by the way, be careful.  There are a couple of firearms of mine in the car."  In that regard, there was the lackadaisical approach that Deputy McGrath mentioned.  I have seen that at first hand.  That is furthest from the truth in relation to us and the way in which we carry on our sport.  We take it really seriously, so much so that there is stress and pressure on us in terms of the way in which we hold the firearms in our possession.  I understand Deputy McGrath's point.  He is correct.  That should be his job.</p></speech>

We very much appreciate the public safety consideration.  It is why we have without reservation embraced all of the new provisions in terms of security and in terms of providing, for example, details of our medical practitioners.  The raft of requirements in a firearms licence application is quite formidable and I can assure the Deputy we comply with them to the letter.</p>  <p>  The United States is a bad comparison to make, for the simple reason that our legislative base is quite different.  In America, every citizen has the right to bear arms.  Whether or not they have been convicted of an offence, they still have the right to bear arms.  There are no security requirements placed on people in the United States.  They need not have them locked up in a gun safe and covered by alarms or adopt any such provisions.  Our provisions are very different.   It is a bad comparison to make.</p></speech>

In my opening summary, I mentioned all of the aspects of range construction, range membership, conditions that are laid down and storage conditions - everything that relates back to the 2006 Act, which is extremely strong in its requirement for a person to prove that one is the right person to hold a firearm.</p>  <p>  On the reason the term "scaremongering" was used, the reality is that the current legislation is extremely effective.  Despite the fact that people may say that criminals, if they cannot get access to firearms, may target our lawfully held firearms, the facts speak for themselves.  Our firearms are not targeted by criminals because they have no issues in importing unlawful firearms.  Indeed, in the news this week there was talk of the Balkans, where there are still 750,000 illegally held firearms in a country which has the same land mass as Europe.  The Garda has contended, and maybe has a fear, that criminals will target our firearms, but the facts speak for themselves.  They do not.  We have a good system of security and we must prove it before we get the licence.  An applicant for a firearm has to have the required security arrangements in his or her home, and sign the document stating he or she has the level of security at home that is required, before the license will be granted.  It is also a fact - this is published data, to which I included a link in my submission - that there are estimated to be 155,000 illegal firearms floating around the South of Ireland.  If the firearms are taken from us and the criminals then decide to look at Northern Ireland, there are 14,000 handguns there.  Would they not be easy targets?  The facts speak for themselves.  In relation to our firearms, we are not targets of criminality.</p></speech>

Whether the witnesses like it or not, there is an opinion that some within their associations would like us to ease up on regulation.  I am putting down a marker.  It was stated that 13,935 handguns are available in the North.  At the height of the Troubles, and even after, many people in the North had major concerns about the more than 13,000 legally held handguns.  Whether they are legal or illegal, they are handguns.  I know friends of mine, who are in the minority community in the North, have always been concerned about these thousands of legally held handguns in case there was ever an incident which spilled into violence.  We must be strong on regulating the legal availability of guns.  Will the witnesses ensure public safety is the priority?</p></speech>

I accept that in some areas there will be public concern about this.  Hard and all as it may be to do so, depending on the position one takes, one must accept that we do not seek to broaden access to firearms or seek a change in the legislation to make it easier for people to have access to firearms.  All of the submissions we have made are about a move to further restrict what we already have.  If the Oireachtas wishes to do this it must provide credible data to back it up, but this has not happened.  With regard to our consciousness of public safety, I assure the committee that nobody sitting here carries a flag or a mandate for relaxed regulation or the careless possession or use of firearms.</p></speech>

Mr. Crofton mentioned the idea of an independent risk assessment.  I am very open to this because I want to see risk assessment from a legislator's point of view.  What does Mr. Crofton mean by an independent risk assessment scheme and who would carry it out so that he and I would have confidence in the facts and data?</p></speech>

Everybody is asking questions which point to various discrepancies in the understanding of firearms, the sport and what we do.  If a standardised programme were put in place it would lay to rest all of these queries.  Mr. Crofton said he would be the first to state that we would not push past a certain point.  We are trying to restrict it, but the issue is trying to put in place checks and balances so that it is focused and public safety is not forgotten.</p></speech>

We share this concern.  As Mr. Crofton mentioned, we are nothing like the United States.  If somebody wants to buy a .22 pistol, which is non-restricted at present, to enter the sport, he or she is required to join a club, which costs approximately &euro;500, buy the pistol, which costs approximately &euro;900, install a gun safe, which costs approximately &euro;300, and put in place an alarm system, which costs approximately &euro;1,000.  This means the opportunity for people to easily enter the sport is limited.  To give the statistics, 1,000 .22 pistols have been licensed in the State since 2004, which equates to 100 a year.  Extending this out, it will be another ten years before we have 2,000 pistols and 20 years before we are anywhere near the pistol numbers that exist in Northern Ireland.  There is a self-limiting aspect in how the sport is organised.  People who enter our sport may take up rifle shooting, pistol shooting or shotgun shooting.  A variety of shooting sports are available and people need to have this choice.  The proposed amendments to the legislation would remove the choice of a .22 pistol, which is unreasonable in the current environment.</p></speech>

This is where we should be.  To put in place this reform we need to put together a big think tank which is Government- and Garda-agreed.  This would provide properly trained firearms officers.  Mr. Crofton would agree that competence should be put in place and checks and balances should be enforced.</p></speech>

The Garda needs to make this connection for us if it exists and if there is evidence for it.  The report states that the guns used to murder the Corbally brothers were stolen from a licensed dealer in Dublin.  This may not be the case, and we need to clarify it, because anything in a report put before the House must be factual.  We should ask the Garda from where the weapons were stolen.  I am led to believe they were stolen from the PSNI in the North.  We need to qualify this, because anything that comes before the House-----</p></speech>

We need a breakdown of the figure and we have asked for it.  From my knowledge, because I drafted some of the questions for Members of the Oireachtas - I am sorry Deputy Collins has left, because he asked it on a number of occasions - the answer from the Minister has always been that the Garda Commissioner has been asked to compile the statistic and it will be provided when it is to hand.  The breakdown of the statistic has never been provided.  The question has been framed to provide clarity on the statistical data from the overall figure being sought.  It has never been given.  A figure is thrown out in the report as a supporting statistic for the connection between lawfully owned firearms and criminal use of firearms.</p> <p>I would say to this committee and to whoever cares to listen that it is not acceptable in that form.  If one is going to use a statistic, one must stand it up and we have asked for that to be done.</p></speech>

On the issue of licensing bodies and the range of licensing methods of the chief superintendents throughout the country, is the preferred option to have one licensing body?  How do we get to that point?  The lack of engagement between the responsible organisations and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of grave concern to me.  The experts are here today.  I do not believe that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the same level of expert knowledge of the different firearms that are in the country.  Global statements are thrown out, including at meetings of this committee, about mass-murderers in other jurisdictions, but I do not recall any here.  I would like somebody to point to a connection between legally held firearms, particularly since the introduction in 2009 of additional security measures, and murder.  Is there a connection?  If so, somebody must point it out to us clearly and not just make global statements.</p>  <p>  I know quite a few people involved in target shooting as well as shooting pheasant, duck and so forth, and I can guarantee that they are the most responsible, safe people that I know.  I just wanted to make that statement because it is important that we are balanced in our discussions and our decisions.  Will the witnesses elaborate on where we should go from the perspective of a licensing body?  How do we strike the right balance?  It is critical that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the representative organisations present and the Department be involved in whatever structure is put in place.</p></speech>

Perhaps the witnesses could give us some idea of how they think that might work.  We do not have time to go into great detail today, but perhaps the witnesses would come back to us at a later stage with their thoughts on that.</p>  <p>  I must point out that this is an all-party parliamentary committee.  I do not know if representatives of firearms owners, clubs and so forth have appeared before a committee such as this before.</p></speech>

Nobody here is suggesting for one moment that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not be part of that system.  Everybody is of the view that the appropriate body to vet applicants is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not think anybody has an issue with that, good, bad or indifferent.  Where the system breaks down is in terms of the administration or the movement of the paperwork, leaving the assessment of the character of the applicant to one side.  A centralised system would bring clarity and consistency to the situation.  It would also allow for the build-up of expertise that is consistent in order that we do not have situations like the one referred to by Mr. Hannigan, where two members of his organisation who happened to live in two different Garda divisions got two different decisions on their licence applications which seemed to defy logic.</p>  <p>  The various organisations involved in shooting published a critique last May of the operation of the administration of the system over the past five years.  We sent a copy of that critique to every Member of the Oireachtas.  That critique set out the problems in the system and the concerns of the representative bodies, based on practical experience.  It should be noted that the report and recommendations that have been published since have not addressed or even considered a single concern outlined in the aforementioned critique.  Indeed, it did not even merit mention or acknowledgement, which is very telling.  It is also very telling that the proposals which seek to address the public safety risk from unlawful access to firearms, albeit that the potential source is not a real issue, do not include a single new penalty.  That is significant in our view.  If one wishes to address an issue of criminality, one normally addresses it by looking at the penalty structure in place, but that is absent from this set of recommendations.</p></speech>

I was in the D&aacute;il contributing to the debate there.  I have read all of the submissions and thank the representative organisations for taking the time to send those to the committee.  Having listened to the various questions and responses, the main question I have is simple.  What is the bottom line?  What is the view of the witnesses on why these proposals are being put in place?  Related to that, why do the witnesses think that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is taking so long to process applications from existing firearms licenceholders?  In certain instances, those licences are being refused, as several individuals who visited my constituency office have testified in the past eight to ten weeks, even though there has been no change in circumstances and the individuals are complying with the statutory instrument referred to.  The individuals in question are trained to a reasonable standard and are, by and large, fine upstanding citizens who happen to have a sporting interest in firearms.</p></speech>

It has done a fantastic job in that regard and still does so today.  Over the years, however, there has been a deficit of knowledge and understanding of the whole firearms issue.  Now that Ireland has moved forward and is doing a lot of amazing things in different fields, we have the opportunity to talk to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department to rectify some things.  This meeting bodes well for the future but trying to get to the genesis of it would be difficult to do today.  As the Chairman has said, this is a great starting point.</p></speech>

That puts undue pressure on them.</p> <p>If one puts oneself in their position one would say, "I have to do this or that stack of paper.  I know how to do this one; I do not how to do that".  That is where the time delay will happen.  There is a human element.  We are talking about standardisation, which would get rid of all that.  The difficult element of the problem for the Garda would be taken away, and placed into a more privatised sector with a link between the Garda by way of standardisation with trained firearms officers.  It would present garda&iacute; with the potential to do psychological profiling and due diligence testing of individuals or applicants, something which they already do very well.  That is what they do, because they do not carry.</p></speech>

I cannot answer the question properly because I will run foul of the Chairman if I do.  We have asked for a look-back and analysis of what has happened over the past five years, in light of the 650 court challenges, none of which were to change the legislation but all of which concerned administering it in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.  I will leave that exactly as I say it.</p>  <p>  To answer the other parts of the question, in terms of what is required and the bottom, line the Deputy mentioned a couple of things.  He mentioned the length of time it takes to process an application and refusals.  The problem is very simply that the Garda Commissioner's guidelines and the primary legislation require a firearms application to be dealt with within 12 weeks.  The basis for that was that, prior to the current legislation, it was a moveable feast and there was no compellability in dealing with the matter.  Even with that provision, licence applications, in many instances, go far beyond the three months. </p>  <p>  One of the flaws in the administration is that when the process goes beyond the three months, under the primary legislation it is deemed have been refused.  Therefore, if an applicant wishes to address that he or she must go to the District Court.  That is a dreadfully unsatisfactory situation for a sporting activity.  We are want the guidelines to be mandatory, rather than simply being guidelines, as we have been told.  </p>  <p>  I am familiar with the refusals.  There are many situations where people have firearms, have licensed them and which were listed on an annex as unrestricted firearms under the Commissioner's guidelines.  The goalposts have been changed mid-stream.  We are now being told some firearms are actually restricted firearms but they have already been licensed as restricted firearms.  We can take it from this that when our licences come up for renewal they will be refused, despite the fact that we have licensed them and complied with the legislation.  This is why we have asked for a look-back and an analysis of what happened.  We have suggested that the Garda Inspectorate may the appropriate body to do that.</p></speech>

Right now we have a great opportunity to build a great system, which could potentially be the best in the world because it is the most recent.

I have been a licence holder for 40 years and held my first licence when I was 18 years old.  When I applied for my second licence I was told by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it was illegal for me to have two rifles.  At 18 years of age I went into Molesworth Street and bought the Firearms Act for 1/6 and could not find the provision in the legislation which stated that it was illegal to have two firearms.  The experience I have had for many years is that there is no accountability in the interpretation of the legislation.  </p>  <p>  I referred to the raft of changes brought forward in 2006.  I sat with the people who put the legislation together.  It was agreed with the shooting bodies that there would be certain aspects.  One of the major aspects was the fact that there was no accountability in regard to the process of a firearms application.  One could apply in one jurisdiction and it could take two years to get a licence.  There could be a combination of paperwork being lost and three applications having to be made.</p>  <p>  In 2006, accountability was brought to the situation.  If a decision is not made within three months, it is deemed to be refused.  One has 30 days to appeal, and the only recourse is to appeal to the District Court.  Tom Lynch put the legislation together and we understood that the three month limit was introduced to ensure that we were treated fairly.  It was designed to be the exception, not the rule, and to be used in the very odd case where one would have the right to appeal to the District Court and would not be used regularly.  Some 650 District Court cases have been taken as a consequence of refusals.  Most of the cases granted by the courts are being reassessed by them.  There have been nearly 200 High Court cases.  </p>  <p>  The current accountability regime set out in the legislation is excellent.  It would be a lot easier to get rid of the .22 pistols and other pistols from the environment in Ireland.  We would not then have any problem.  The issue here is throwing the baby out with the bath water.  They are trying to get rid of our sport because they have created a problem which needs a resolution.  The resolution involves sitting down, holding discussions and reaching agreement between us.</p></speech>

Given the length of time we have been here, the other members have asked plenty of questions.  When An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na came before the committee to discuss this issue, I was surprised by the lack of databases on gun ownership and, more specifically, bullets.  I do not watch a large amount of television, but I do watch a lot of box series, one of which is "CSI".  People can laugh, but I like watching them.</p></speech>

Is it the case in other jurisdictions that when a firearm is licensed an agency of the state takes a record of the striations of the barrel of the gun on a bullet for record purposes so that if instances of criminality or theft take place, a weapon can be traced back to the source?  </p>  <p>  I have an inter-related question on that, which is linked to what I would deem to be the civilianisation of the application process, notwithstanding what Deputy McGrath had to say regarding the necessity for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be involved at some stage in that process.  A civilian or State authority could bring the licensing process to point B or C in the process, and then allow the Garda to complete its section of the process.  The bottom line comes down to whether an applicant is a criminal or there is a risk.  An adjudication could then be made by a civilian authority using the best advice given to it by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Would that be pertinent?</p> <p>I posed two questions - one on a database and the second on the method we might use to explore the civilianisation of the process.</p></speech>

It is most likely that we would all be very happy with that.  The matter could be discussed later.<br/>In terms of a centralised system, the difficulty with chief superintendents and superintendents who are making decisions on areas on which they are not necessarily completely and utterly <i>au fait</i>, is that it can cause a little bit of apprehension because their job is public safety.  A similar system such as that in the UK whereby everything is centralised and the experts are in one particular place and one chief superintendent signs off on everything would make their job so much easier.<br/>As Deputy Farrell said, having a process whereby a group, association, civil servants or the post office can take in an application and move it forward after which it can be signed off by a central committee would make things a lot easier for everybody.</p></speech>

Much emphasis was placed on the inability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, based on the evidence given to the committee, to identify the potential for licensed firearms to be used for criminal purposes.  In some cases that was due to the firearm not being recovered.  However, bullets would be recovered.  Rightly, there was reference to ballistic testing.</p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland every single handgun is ballistically tested.  There is no problem there with the use of lawfully held guns being used in crime.  No such cases have been identified.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the ability, under the 2006 firearms Act to ballistically test the firearms we have in our possession.  The operation to do so has never been taken.  That is the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  In such a case the witnesses would have been able to quite categorically state that no licensed firearms were used in the particular crimes referenced.  Ballistics experts in court could spend days giving evidence and claiming that my .22 pistol is a military firearm would have been better employed doing the ballistic testing on the firearms that are legally held and then they would have a database.</p></speech>

I will have to research whether standard practice is to privatise testing, but if the licensed firearms community was asked to provide a photograph or digital record of a certain quality and a report of a certain quality to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a civilian authority at a specific cost of approximately &euro;200 for a new firearm licence, would it be prepared to bear the cost itself?  The last thing I want to do is put more cost onto the budgets of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would much rather that would go into front-line services.</p></speech>

Before we start talking about additional cost we must get some quality into the system that is consistent with the amount of money we are spending on it.</p></speech>

There is nothing wrong with suggesting that, and it would help the business because the industry needs to be supported.  The infrastructure is there and if it is not expanded upon and taken into account then the system will fail again.  So what if &euro;16 million is spent in every three years; I would like to see even more spent on an annual basis based on the very numbers that were spoken about on an individual system which would then increase taxes for the State and promote the industry and the sport.  It would be a good thing.</p></speech>

There is not a whole lot of work to be done to change the current system to a centralised one.  It is really not that difficult.  The current firearms Act does not require a team from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to fix it.  All it requires is willingness and the ability to create a team to do it.  That would be a huge boon to the whole system and for everybody involved in it.</p></speech>

We are more or less finished.  I spent a number of years in the FCA-Army Reserve and one was not allowed to use a firearm until one was highly competent in every aspect of it.

It is a reasonably broadly based in that one can be a member of a recognised club and by virtue of that one is deemed to be competent in the use of a particular firearm.  The recognised clubs have protocols in place for safety training and firearms training.  A certificate can also be provided by a body.  In our clubs we have brought forward a structure of firearms instructor training and individual training.  Between 2004 and 2006, I personally trained more than 350 people in competency in pistols because I am a pistol instructor.  That ethos has gone forward so every club has a mandatory safety course.  There is also individual coaching for individual firearms because they are all different.  That structure does exist and the proof of the pudding is when we look at the safety record of our clubs.  In the 30 years in which I have been involved in clubs, we have not had one firearms related accident on our ranges that resulted in injury.</p></speech>

In regard to safety, one of the great things about the club that I have seen over the years is that there is always an opportunity for someone to go back and do another safety course.  Even though I shot 25,000 to 30,000 rounds a year I routinely went and did another safety course.  It was because the idea of complacency does not have any role in shooting.  That is part of the ethos we design.  We protect the sport that we love and we make sure that we are up to scratch.</p></speech>

Effectively, that entails both a written examination and a range test as well.  It is a first step in terms of basic knowledge of target identification, safety and other aspects of firearms use.  To date, more than 1,000 people have been put through the programme.</p></speech>

I also thank committee members for listening to my submission.</p>  <p>  I first started shooting at 17 when I joined the then Foras Cosanta Aituil, FCA, and have continued shooting in my personal time with various firearms over the last 15 years.  Since getting my first shotgun and rifle at 19 I have owned in total one non-restricted rim fire rifle, two restricted centrefire pistols, three restricted shotguns and seven restricted semi-auto centrefire rifles. </p>  <p>  I qualified as an armourer having completed a four year apprenticeship in 2007.  Part of the responsibilities of my job include but is not limited to the inspection and maintenance of small arms.  I have a vast knowledge in the workings of both civilian and military firearms to include pistols, shotguns, bolt action rifles, assault rifles, light and heavy machine guns, mortars and grenade launchers.  I am also studying mechanical science in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.</p>  <p>  I have on several occasions given evidence in cases against the State where people had a pistol and-or rifle licence application refused by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The reason for these refusals was due to the Garda classifying such firearms as military pistols or assault rifles.  I am here to talk about and answer any questions of a technical nature in relation to these types of firearms and correct the information presented to this committee. </p>  <p>  While firearms legislation in itself is fragmented and flawed the problem is grossly compounded by the organisation left to run the firearms licensing system.  My submission outlines how I believe the Garda and the Department of Justice and Equality have used legislation in a way not intended by legislators to slowly remove legally licensed firearms from law abiding citizens. </p>  <p>  I have in my submission addressed only a few issues that stem from the working group's report.  These include Garda statistics; the Oireachtas debate in 2009; background to prohibition on centerfire pistols; mass shootings; the Connelly Hospital report; and licensing of firearms in other jurisdictions.  My proposals are my personal opinion of how I believe we can start getting away from the mistrust and frustration built up over decades because of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I ask that the committee listen with an open mind and thank members for their time.</p></speech>

It is good to see those being impacted upon directly by the proposed changes in the working group's review document being afforded this opportunity.  The committee has read my submission which contains more detailed notes, and I am happy to answer any questions on that but I want to open by trying to explain what we want from the law, why we want it and why the committee wants it too.</p>  <p>  As I said in my submission, what I, and many other shooters, would wish to see in the Firearms Act is a clear and unambiguous set of rules regarding firearms licensing which are readily readable by everyone and which are enforced equally in all Garda districts.  In my submission I have gone into some detail on some of the technical problems that prevent that being the case at present, such as the layered nature of the Firearms Act and the other Acts that make up the body of firearms law in Ireland; others will no doubt present other aspects of this problem and I expect the national governing bodies will present the details of their respective sports but there is a fundamental perspective on this problem which I suspect may not be obvious to those outside the shooting community and which would assist the committee in understanding our viewpoint.</p>  <p>  In our sport, everything is measurable.  The size, shape and weight of our firearms, the calibre of the rounds used, the weight and thickness and tailoring of the clothing used, our scores and where our shots land and how they were fired and so on.  Our sports coaching is built on this fact; our rulebooks are based on it and it permeates every aspect of what we do and the culture that surrounds it.  We are in a sport unique for its brutal honesty.  You aim the shotgun, rifle or pistol, and you pull the trigger.  Then either you hit the target or you do not.  You cannot hide from it.  Everyone sees what happens.  You cannot say you did well but some judge gave you a biassed opinion.  You cannot say that you did well but your team let you down.  You cannot say the referee was blind.  You cannot say that anything, other than your own skill, was the reason for the good or bad outcome of that shot.</p> <p>It is a fundamental part of the attraction to the sport.  It is why, 20 years into the sport, I enjoy every minute I spend on the range as much as the first.  I have found nothing like it in sport and very little like it in life.  To answer some of the questions that were asked earlier, this is why we do this.  This is the fundamental attraction for the sport.</p> <p> It has the side-effect that we are used to clear, objective rules which make judgements based on physical features or events that can be measured in the real world with instruments, so the judgements are mathematical in their objectivity.  For example, an ISSF air rifle must weigh 5.5 kg or less according to the rule book.  At the start of a competition, my rifle is weighed and if the scales say 5.5 I can enter the competition, and if they say 5.6 I cannot.  The judge running equipment control does not have to make a subjective decision - he or she just reads the scale.  The rule is clear and easy to read and everyone can look at a single rule book and see what that rule is.   Competitors can check that they pass that rule ahead of time using the same equipment the judge will use and be confident that they will pass on the day.</p> <p> In contrast to this, the Firearms Act is frustratingly complex to read and there is no single rule book for everyone to look at.  The judgements it calls for are highly subjective and how they are reached is opaque to the applicant.  The decisions which affect us vary from issuing officer to issuing officer, so what is allowed and what is not under the Act is often a function of one's address, with no way to tell ahead of time what the decision might be.   I am not even touching on the problems of those parts of Irish firearms law that are plainly daft, although we can discuss them if the committee wishes.</p> <p> This might sound like a niche problem which affects a small number of sportspeople in a minority sport but it is not.  It has an effect on the public in general.  We have seen hundreds of District, High and Supreme Court cases over the last decade or so, many of which have as a fundamental cause a Firearms Act that is effectively unreadable to the average person.  These cases not only represent enormous amounts of time, money and stress to shooters &ndash; the equivalent of building and equipping several  badly-needed national-level shooting ranges &ndash; they also represent thousands of Garda man hours, millions of euro of public money, and the court's time, all of which are badly needed elsewhere, not arguing in a court over fiddly points of badly-written law with people who would rather be on the range taking part in our sport.</p> <p> I have spent years involved in the legislative side of our sport which I regard that as time wasted and sporting opportunities lost.  We had no choice but to be involved - even from the first days our sports were at risk of being crippled purely by oversight or misunderstandings in the drafting process - but there are far better uses for our resources.  If we had clear, universal rules in the Act, that would be possible.  The only way I know to get to that happy scenario from where we are now is, as I recommended in my submission, to undertake a restatement of the Firearms Act.  Once we have the Act written clearly in one place, we can consider correcting some of its more obvious anomalies but until then, if we apply more patches to an already over-patched body of law, we will simply be confusing the situation even more than it currently is and will in all likelihood create more problems than we solve.  If we go down that road, we will be back here again in a few years, with even more Garda man hours and public money and sporting resources lost as a result.</p> <p> In the meantime, the average voter is even more in the dark about what protections the law provides them and, given how the media portray problems like gun crime, this can be nothing but a source of fear.  Good law should reassure people by showing that a potential risk is understood and a fair system exists to govern it.  The Firearms Act at present fails woefully in this task because almost nobody really knows what is in it.  I therefore urge the committee to reject the review's proposals in their current form and to recommend that the Firearms Act be restated to give us a known baseline from which to work.  I ask the committee to recommend that those changes - whose necessity will be clear and obvious to everyone - be worked on by all the stakeholders together, to produce a clear, readable, boringly consistent law which everybody understands and can follow.  The first Firearms Act stood unamended for almost 40 years because it had those characteristics, so while it is a privilege to appear before the committee today, I would hope that its decision will mean we do not meet again until 2055, with all due respect.</p></speech>

I would like to describe my personal background, my involvement in the sport of target shooting and some of the issues of the proposed legislation we are discussing.<br/>I am a type 1 diabetic.  I used to be a scout leader, undertook many outdoor pursuits and used to play rugby.  Due to diabetic complications I am now unable to take part in a number of these competitions.  As a challenge, and to get myself out of the house, a few years ago I took up clay pigeon shooting and moved on into target shooting for the camaraderie of getting out of the house and working with people.  That has moved on and I have now become an honorary treasurer of the Munster Target Shooting Club.  We are a not-for-profit organisation and as part of this role, I am responsible for the organisation of our club training days and competitions.  We are associated with NASRPC, with Mr. Topes here, and we undertake a large amount of safety training with all our new members.  That covers things like handling firearms, storage when off the range, travelling to and from the range, and range operations - what people need to do when they are actually on the range.  We also run mandatory safety refresher courses for all members on an annual basis.  Safety is very much the most important thing while on the range.<br/>We are comprised of over 50 current members, shooting in a variety of disciplines, including bench-rest rifle and pistol, WA1500 competitions and local competitions within the club.  We are also part of the Munster League and are involved national competitions.  I have also shot at some international competitions with a small-bore pistol.  Target shooting is the only sport I am aware of where those over 17, male or female, disabled or able-bodied, or of any nationality, can compete together on equal terms.  In my time with the club, we have supported disabled shooters, people in wheelchairs.  We have had everybody from novices - 14 year-olds with their fathers on a training licence learning how to fire a bolt-action shotgun - right through to Irish champions who have competed internationally.  We also have a number of club members who are in their 80s and still competing successfully.  The phrase, &quot;right through from the docker to the doctor&quot; is used within the organisation.  There is a very strong community spirit, bringing these disparate members of society together through their love of the sport. <br/>On the issue of firearms licensing in general, there has been a discussion around the statistics used in the discussion document.  We have to agree that gun crime is a worldwide issue, however illegal acquisition of illegally-held firearms is usually via organised crime gangs and has nothing to do with the sporting community.  As an example, quoting Deputy Niall Collins' piece in the <i>Limerick Leader </i>a couple of weeks ago, &quot;a strategy focused on policing that targets known offenders&quot; has led to the murder rate in the Limerick region dropping from six murders in 2008 to no recorded murders in 2014, purely through focusing on organised crime.  The report and recommendations of November 2014 - the document that was provided - gave no statistics pointing towards legally-held firearms being lost or stolen, be it from registered firearms dealers, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces, or the civilian population.  It is very hard to work out from the numbers that are cited what is actually relevant for the sporting population.  Nor does the report provide any evidence of illegal acts committed, with the exception of the Corbally brothers.  While a tragic event, it has been reported in the <i>Herald</i>that the firearm in that case was stolen outside the jurisdiction and would never have been classified as an illegally-held firearm in the Republic of Ireland. <br/>Firearms licensing is a civil, not a criminal matter.  I have never received as much as a parking ticket in my life and to be dealt with in this matter under criminal legislation is unusual.  Looking at other European countries, in Germany the issue is dealt with by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, not the Federal Criminal Police Office or BKA.  I believe the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have a veto on a person possessing firearms certificates, however it should pertain to the person, not against individual firearms as is currently the case. <br/>I would like to see a meaningful consolidation of the legislation.  It is very complex at the moment to try and work out anything.  It is very disjointed.  I would also like to see a progressive, logical firearms policy implemented.  I believe firearms licensing is a civil matter and should be dealt with as such.</p> <p>Firearms licensing is a civil matter, not a criminal one, and I query whether it should be managed by criminal law legislation.  We should look at best practice elsewhere.  For example, in Germany, the municipal authorities deal with firearms licensing, while in Northern Ireland 15,000 short firearms are held legally.</p> <p> I thank the Chairman and all members of the committee for giving me this chance to address them on this matter.  I hope and trust we can work together to find an amicable and safe method of continuing the sport of target shooting in this country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.1016" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Conroy" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015012100017#R00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for inviting <i>gunshop.ie</i>to present our submission on firearms licensing.  Due to business travel arrangements made some time ago, Mr. Frank Brennan of <i>gunshop.ie</i>is unable to address the committee on this date.  He would be available to attend any future meeting.<br/>I am a registered firearms dealer, a family man and also a commissioned officer of the Defence Forces with 16 years of service to the State.  Some may see a little irony in the fact that <i>gunshop.ie</i>has asked another firearms dealer to present its submission to the Oireachtas justice committee.  While it is true to say that as firearms dealers we compete on a business footing, it should also be noted that as sportsmen, engaged in a business established solely to support our chosen sport, we have a great deal of mutual respect.  Hence, I am present today to represent the position of <i>gunshop.ie</i>.<br/>We wish first to express our complete disagreement with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Department of Justice and Equality working group report on the licensing of firearms.  This report seeks to create fear where none should exist.  It is entirely biased and was constructed with little or no input from the groups which it would impact most.  Indeed, we are aware through our colleagues within the sporting groups that only a token gesture of consultation would be afforded to the sporting stakeholders and that it would be disingenuous.<br/>Many well-respected sports people will speak for our sport and elaborate on the social good which derives from it.  Accordingly, I will concentrate on the effect which this report may have upon dealers in sporting firearms.  Amendments in legislation in 2009 saw a ban introduced on the licensing of centre fire handguns.  As a result, no new entrants could participate in this sport.  Even the sharing of a centre fire handgun on a licensed shooting range was made illegal.<br/>A concession, however, was made toward the sport of handgun shooting in that a sports person could apply to license a handgun which uses rimfire ammunition which is of a smaller calibre.  This concession was further underpinned by the publication of the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s guidelines on firearms licensing.  In this document, a list of small calibre handguns used worldwide in sport shooting was published.  This list was known as annexe F.  Since that date, the guideline document became a mantra in many Garda districts with Garda licensing persons sticking slavishly to it.  In fact, the list contained several firearms no longer in production.  In late 2014, the annexe F list was withdrawn without any consultation with stakeholders in any section of sport shooting.  As a result, the stocks of <i>gunshop.ie</i>are now in limbo.  We have purchased firearms which must be held with wholesalers in Europe until such time as a domestic licence is granted.  These firearms are bought and paid for but now are proving impossible to sell because of the move by the Department without any consultation with the stakeholders.<br/>The Garda-Department report seems to suggest a pressure release valve to the situation is to simply deflate the business of firearms dealers and have the stocks of heretofore legally licensed firearms sent to the North of Ireland.  I can assure the committee having spoken with numerous firearms dealers in Northern Ireland that this is a complete non-runner.  Strict quotas exist there and the pricing offered, even for firearms in which there was interest, would be only 10% to 15% of the value of the firearm.<br/>We fear any such immediate moves will result in certain categories of firearms dealers being asked to store firearms in number, thus creating a security risk.  It should be noted the Garda and Department seem to regard the granting of a firearms licence as a gift and, accordingly, that it can be taken back.  While sporting firearms licenceholders do certainly acknowledge it is indeed a privilege to be considered competent to safely hold a firearm, they do not regard it as any kind of gift.  It is not given freely as is the very definition of a gift.  It is in fact typically hard won having spent several months in the application process and a significant amount of money for the licence, as well as the ancillary security upgrading which surrounds any licence application.<br/>The Garda-Department document refers to the UK handgun ban and speaks of its success.  It was not a success.  For ten years after the ban, gun crime continued to rise.  Only a significant policing policy shift eventually saw the gun crime figures there plateau.  This document is awash with unsupported statistics.  We note it does not spell out the nature of the compensation scheme arrived at in the UK, whereby sporting shooters were compensated financially for not only their firearms, but the ancillary accessories purchased in support of their sport.  A similar package would be the least sporting shooters here will demand.<br/>As for the trade, the committee must note the 200 plus firearms dealers to be affected will seek to pursue the defence of our livelihoods through the courts.  Having invested heavily to meet storage criteria and security standards set down by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality, this report proposes to remove the very mechanism by which we could recoup the investment.<br/>Some strategists say the best defence is a good offence.  We earnestly believe this report is an offence.  It is a slight on sporting society and is made to deflect attention from the poor administration of the firearms licensing duty of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We believe this report is grounded in interpersonal differences arising out of over 600 court challenges to the application of the legislation.  We respectfully ask the committee to consider the setting aside of this report.  We feel it is not a balanced presentation of the facts.  We ask that genuine engagement with the sporting and trade interests be sought and that such engagement be incorporated into the formulation of future firearms licensing strategy.</p></speech>

I must point out that the committee does not have the authority to set aside the report as such.  It will, however be making recommendations to the Minister based on our hearings.</p>  <p>  I call Mr. Joe Costello of the National Rifle Association of Ireland, NRAI, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.1018" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Costello" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015012100017#R00500"><p>We already have some of the most restrictive firearms policy in the world.  As a member of the committee recently pointed out correctly, the root cause of most of the gun crime in Ireland is strongly related to the drugs problem.  It is plainly obvious that those who illegally import dangerous and addictive drugs have no problem importing and using illegal firearms to commit crime.  That is a well-established fact.  The drugs trade, the violence and disregard for human life as criminals carry out their vendettas is a matter for the Garda and the security forces of the State.  Making firearms legislation even more restrictive has no effect on these people who have no regard for law and order.  It has, however, a profoundly negative effect on law-abiding citizens who have already been vetted and approved by the Garda.  As many will point out, there needs to be more clarity in the legislation and a removal of many subjective terms.</p>  <p>  We have concerns as shooters too that in whatever way the legislation is changed, that the Garda honours the letter and the spirit of the law in its application.  Sadly, that has not been our experience in many cases.  For example, a list of permitted firearms was published in the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s guidelines.  I was involved in that as a member of the FCP, the firearms consultation panel.</p> <p>This list, while not all encompassing, was agreed by all of the stakeholders involved, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice and Equality, the firearms dealers and the representatives of the shooting organisations.  Yet, almost from its publication, these recommendations have been largely ignored.  Of concern to us is whether if we engage in further discussion or agreement we will be treated any better.</p></speech>

This organisation is the largest target shooting organisation in the country and represents the vast majority of rifle and pistol clubs engaged in target shooting.  The NASRPC is the national governing body for a range of non-Olympic target shooting sports in Ireland.  Currently, membership consists of 18 clubs, with combined membership of approximately 2,500.  The sportsmen and women we represent have achieved international success on many occasions and currently Ireland is Gallery Rifle World Champions, having won the competition last year.  Furthermore, Ireland will be hosting the Gallery Rifle World Championships in 2017.</p>  <p>  I would like to make it clear that the members of the clubs that we represent are Garda vetted, law abiding citizens.  Furthermore, they are sportsmen and women who seek only to participate in their chosen sport and develop it in a safe sustainable manner.  With this in mind, we sought to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality over an extended period to bring about a mutually acceptable solution to the ongoing litigation, which has been a feature of firearms licensing over the past number of years.  Alas, despite our best endeavours, we failed to make any progress.  In the context of firearms licensing, we would point out to the committee that in 650 or 92% of cases firearms certificates were granted by the courts to sportsmen and women who were initially denied these certificates by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  We are not seeking the liberalisation of the nation&rsquo;s gun laws, nor are we seeking a dramatic increase in the number of licences issued.  We are asking the committee to recommend the firearms legislation implementation process be independently reviewed, ultimately, to enable us to continue in our chosen sport and develop it in a safe and sustainable manner.  The claim has been made that sporting firearms owners are being targeted by criminals.  Our firearms are licensed.  There are 150,000 illegal and unlicensed firearms in the country.  In addition, given that firearms can be illegally imported with a customs detection rate on only 10%, the evidence suggests that it is easier for criminals to import guns rather than steal them.</p>  <p>  Is theft of firearms from those involved in target sports a problem?  No, it is not.  The figure for stolen firearms for the past four years, which stands at 1,136, includes firearms stolen from firearms dealers, blank firing firearms, crossbows, antique firearms, deactivated firearms, humane killers and, of course, firearms stolen from members of the Defence Forces-An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If the proposal is to ban pistols, pump-action shotguns and semi-automatic centre-fire rifles because their theft poses a danger to public safety, the key figure must be how many of this type of firearms were stolen from licensed firearms holders.  This is the key figure and we urge An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make this number available to the committee as it is key to the discussion and we believe it is likely to be in low single digits if not zero.</p>  <p>  The proposal to allow the issuing officer to refuse a license based on calibre, ammunition velocity, the appearance and lethally of a firearm is, in our view, not the way to proceed.  We believe that the focus should be on the suitability of the individual applicant and not the firearm.  We accept that all firearms pose an inherent risk if used illegally or incorrectly.  We would suggest that the most effective way of preserving a sport, where Ireland has achieved international success and is demonstrably safe, is to initiate and independent review of all aspects of firearms licensing and administration.  Such a review should include all or the relevant stakeholders.  As I mentioned, the NASRPC represents 2,500 sportsmen and women.  However, we are aware that there are at least another 100,000 sportsmen and women who will be directly affected by this legalisation.  </p>  <p>  In regard to natural justice, one can imagine a scenario where a new superintendent entering a district could, because he or she did not like the appearance of firearms being used in a particular sport, effectively wipe out that sport.  The investment made by the shooting participants, clubs and ranges in that area would be lost without compensation.  How is that fair, reasonable or constitutionally compliant?  This is another reason we need an independent review of the firearms legislation.  I urge the committee to initiate an independent assessment of the firearms legalisation and its implementation.</p></speech>

The vast majority of firearms sold in Ireland would be sporting shotguns, followed by sporting rifles and then sporting handguns-pistols.  These would not comparable to the type of firearms the Deputy might have seen when on his travels in eastern Europe, where the purchase of firearms would not have been for sporting reasons.  It is important to point that out.</p></speech>

I have had a chance to read the submissions, so I have a good sense of the issues the witnesses are raising.</p>  <p>  As an Oireachtas justice committee, we must try to find a balance between the different perspectives.  As the witnesses know, representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department attended the committee before Christmas and now we have the witnesses.  The witnesses said they had engaged with the Department and the Garda.  A significant number of refusals have been overturned in the courts, so clearly the perspective of the Judiciary is that the law is on the side of licensed firearms users such as the witnesses.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the fact that we have law-abiding citizens here who are participating in a sport and who are not a threat.  That is a major aspect of the grievance the witnesses have, given their professionalism and commitment to their sport.  Large numbers of people throughout the State, in every county, are involved in this.  Obviously the witnesses will be engaging with the Minister and the Department.  Is there a middle ground to be found in terms of security and reassuring the public?  A very good question was asked in one of the submissions - how many weapons is it proposed to ban?  How many have been stolen?  I have been trying, over several months, to get responses from the Department and the Garda Commissioner to parliamentary questions I have submitted so that the committee can get the most specific information possible.</p>  <p>  My first question relates to security arrangements.  It may have been dealt with in the first session.  I apologise for not being present at that.  What type of security, in terms of safes and so on, can be put in place to reassure the public?  Second, from the information the witnesses have, how many of these weapons have been stolen?  Mr. McCann suggests that maybe none has.  That is a very important point - it is possible that not one of these weapons, which are apparently a threat to the public and which the witnesses use for their sport, have been stolen and have become a threat to the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.1044" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Costello" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015012100019#T00700"><p>There are a number of issues with regard to security.  I am not speaking on behalf of firearms dealers.  The inevitable arrangement is that if one has a rifle, even an air rifle - some of us would have referred to them as pellet guns growing up, with all due respect to Mr. Dennehy and people who partake in the sport of Olympic air rifle, just to make clear what we are talking about - in one's house, one needs a gun safe.  One needs a steel safe which has been properly scrutinised and passed, fixed solidly to the structure of the house.  That is just for an air rifle.  There are about four different levels of security requirement depending on what type of firearm one has.  There is an actual safe storage requirement, because part of the work of the firearms consultative panel was to look at the various levels.  A bolt-action rifle, such as a .22 that somebody could use for shooting rabbits or targets, would also require a gun safe.  One would need an alarm.  Generally, the crime prevention officer from the Garda would inspect the applicant's premises, check it was in a safe area, and ensure that sufficient precautions had been taken.</p>  <p>  A great exception, which we find very disturbing and ambiguous, is that one is not required to have a safe for a single-barrel shotgun.  Anybody who has ever seen the movies knows that a single-barrel shotgun and a hacksaw, which is pretty low-tech stuff, can be turned into one of the most lethal firearms in the world.  Such firearms can punch a hole through the engine of a car.  They are colossal.  Yet they are not required to be kept in any form of gun safe or anything similar.  Those are mostly owned by farmers.  I am not castigating a particular group, but they are mostly owned by farmers for vermin control, for protection of their sheep against foxes and so on.  The result is that often they are unguarded, available in farmhouses all over the country, and make a soft target.  In the last two weeks, from a casual reading of the reports in the daily papers, there have been three or four firearms incidents involving stolen shotguns.  When a bullet leaves the end of a barrel, the shape, size, colour or appearance of the gun does not really matter.  It is the same thing, whether it is a .22 rifle or a .22 pistol.  If one is a safe, sane person and judged as such by the Garda, one is at no greater risk with one than the other, just as if one is a safe driver, it does not matter what brand of car one drives.  However, shotguns were cast in a very benign light.  I was astounded that Superintendent Healy said, basically, that he did not see them as being of any concern, while he saw the other firearms as a great threat.  The contrast is that the majority of pistols of any calibre, even the smaller ones such as .22s, are held in armouries on target ranges, which are of a very high standard and are also inspected.  The rest are under very severe personal security requirements, with multiple alarms and so on.</p>  <p>  I would like people to consider the reality.  If people talk about the concealability of a short firearm, I would be willing to demonstrate with a deactivated firearm that in about five minutes, any member of the committee could turn an apparently very benign gun - the most common and cheapest is probably a Baikal hammer-action gun, which costs about &euro;80 or &euro;90 new - into something about eight inches long.  That would be a horrendous firearm to be confronted with.  Our security is second to none.  It is inspected, it is a factor in the granting of our licences and it is a condition of our licence that we must fulfil and that we are happy to fulfil, because most of us have families.  We do not want children to be exposed to these guns, we do not want any members of the public to be put in danger, we do not want to put ourselves in danger and we do not want to risk the loss of our property.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.1045" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Tope" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015012100019#T00800"><p>I agree with everything Mr. Costello has said.  I absolutely take the point on the shotguns.  From a home security point of view, every target shooter - I think that is everyone around the table - has invested very significant amounts of money in home security.</p> <p>I have certainly invested over &euro;10,000 in personal home security.   I know my experience is mirrored by that of many others, because we all talk about security.  Recently, I had a visit from a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na crime prevention officer.  We have had an excellent working relationship with the Garda in Kildare since the beginning of the licensing issue.  Kildare is one of the few districts in which there is such a good working relationship, under Chief Superintendent Byrnes, for whom I have great respect and time.  Unfortunately, he retired at Christmas.  The crime prevention officer comes to our homes.  In considering crime prevention, we must literally begin at our front gates and go through the entire home, and the officer checks everything.  I do not want to go into the details of my personal security or those of any other shooter.  However, the crime prevention officer spent 45 minutes in my house checking security, and I do not live in a mansion.  He checked absolutely everything.</p> <p> If stolen firearms are a concern, why were recommendations not made on improving security?  This brings me to the question regarding the middle ground.  The shooting community would be more than willing to discuss improved home security measures, but all stakeholders would have to be involved in that.  As Mr. Costello said and as I pointed out in my submission, the country is, effectively, awash with stolen firearms and there are almost the same number of stolen firearms as licensed ones.  We have a target-shooting community that is willing to engage in security and has invested greatly in it, yet there are shotguns in many houses that are relatively unprotected.  Why, therefore, are the target shooters the focus of attention?  This defies logic.  However, in regard to whether there is a middle ground and whether we are prepared to discuss it, I am sure there is, and the NASRPC - and, I suspect, the other groups - are more than willing to discuss the issue.</p></speech>

As mentioned, there are four levels of security.  Level one is for one non-restricted shotgun - the standard side-by-side or over-and-under shotgun that farmers would have.  The regulations state that the shotgun should be disassembled and each part stored securely and separately in the house, but there is no requirement for a safe.  Under level two, which allows for one restricted firearm or three or fewer non-restricted firearms, each firearm should be stored securely in a gun safe which complies with British standard BS7558 and which is securely fixed to a solid structure.  Level three provides that if a person has two restricted firearms or more than three non-restricted firearms, the firearms must be stored in a safe but an alarm must also be fitted and external doors must be fitted with locks that comply with British standard BS3621.  The highest category, level four, provides for three or more restricted firearms or six or more firearms of any type.  At this level, in addition to the requirements under the previous standards, the owner must have a monitored alarm that has been installed by a licensed installer from a private security party which complies with Irish Standard EN 50131.  The alarm must be connected to a monitoring service operated by a person licensed to be a private security operator and supported with GSM mobile service backup.  I do not want to go into the detail of my security arrangements, but those regulations are the minimum of what I have.  This is also the minimum for many people I know who have restricted firearms.  They all go above and beyond the regulations to protect their investment, because generally the firearms they own are worth several thousand euro.</p></speech>

Therefore, when the crime prevention officer comes to a person's house and inspects it, he is completely free in his recommendations to the superintendent to ask for more security than the statutory instrument calls for.  This has happened and has been upheld by the Supreme Court.  Basically, it is law.  If the superintendent wants a person to have a higher level of security, he is entitled to ask for that on a case-by-case basis.  If, for example, he believes a person needs a monitored alarm because of the area the owner lives in, although it is a class of arm that does not require this by law, he can ask for that.  There is no public safety issue in this regard, because the law has considered the issue fully.</p></speech>

These would obviously cause concern to the public.  Why would anybody need military-type weapons?  I note that Mr. Slattery has particular technical expertise.  Will he explain at length why the weapons the Garda suggest might be banned are not military-type weapons?  I believe his contribution would be important in that regard.</p></speech>

I have dealt with several cases against the State in which, prior to the change of law in 2008, people had certain types of pistol or rifle.  When the new system began, these were classed as assault rifles under Irish law, and the owners appealed that decision.  Under Irish law, an assault rifle is a rifle capable of functioning as a semi-automatic, which is legal here, and as fully automatic, which is illegal here, or a rifle that resembles that rifle.  Therefore, once it looks like it, it is it.</p>  <p>  I believe that at the previous meeting Deputy Alan Farrell mentioned that there are cars made in Korea that look like Ferraris but are not Ferraris.  The case is the same here.  These guns might look like an assault rifle, but actually they are so far from one that there is no comparison.  The first picture on the handout I provided shows a Ruger 10/22 rifle.  These rifles are probably the most commonly licensed semi-automatic .22s in the country and in their standard form are licensed as unrestricted.  If an individual buys a gun with a wooden stock and then decides to change the stock, perhaps because the stock has broken or because wooden stocks absorb moisture, need more care and are heavier than synthetic stocks, and if the change makes the rifle look more like an assault rifle, he has converted his gun into what looks like an assault rifle and now requires a new licence because of the change.  That is the scenario if the rifle looks like an assault rifle.</p></speech>

Certain features of a firearm change it from non-restricted to restricted.  Therefore, if an owner makes a rifle look like an assault rifle, it is then classed as restricted, but the owner only has a licence for a non-restricted firearm and essentially does not have a licence for that gun.</p></speech>

Another picture shows a Remington R-25.  This relates to a case I dealt with in Limerick in which the owner was refused a licence for this firearm because it was classed as an assault rifle.  It can be seen from my notes that I have included the manufacturer's website classification of the firearm.  While it is based on a miniature rifle, it is so far from it that it is not one at all.  The rifle can never be fired in a fully automatic manner.</p> <p>For these firearms to be licensed and imported into Germany, the BKA has to conduct a test on them.  Section 3a of the documentation I have furnished to the committee consists of a translation of the official document that was used when an importer wanted to import a firearm from Remington Arms, provide it with different magazines and change the colour patterns, etc.  Essentially the BKA decided that the firearm in question could not be converted to being fully automatic with the use of simple tools.  While it might look like an assault rifle to a lay person, it can never function in that way.  Its colour has never been used by any military force.  Its barrel does not offer any military advantage - in fact, the opposite is the case as it is designed solely for accuracy.  Its magazine capacity is relatively low compared to that of an assault rifle.</p> <p> Last week the committee was shown a picture of an Overland Arms rifle, which is manufactured in Germany for the German and worldwide markets.  If this was an assault rifle, it would not be permissible to manufacture it in Germany.  It cannot function as a fully automatic weapon.</p> <p> The same applies to the Heckler &amp;amp; Koch SL8 which is shown on page 6 of my documentation.  I was involved in a case involving this rifle in Dublin.  Interestingly enough, it involved a person living in Lucan who had a pistol also.  He was refused a firearms licence on the grounds that they were military weapons.  When we went to court, he got his guns back.  This case revealed some of the differences in this area.  The person's friend who was living in Phibsboro had two pistols and a semi-automatic rifle that were licensed.  These two people travelled all over the world to shoot with their guns.  That is the level of difference.  It is made clear on the website of the maker of this rifle that it is designed to be used for target shooting.  It is not designed for assaulting or anything other than what it is designed for.</p> <p> The MKE T43 which is shown in section 5 of my documentation is a copy of the Heckler &amp;amp; Koch 33 which is an assault rifle.  This one is for sale in the German market.  It was my gun.  I used to own it until I sold it.  I licensed it in County Clare, but the new owner could not license it in Limerick.  On the day the case went to court, the new owner of the gun produced a technical document from the German federal police - this can be seen in section 5a of my documentation - showing all aspects of the design of the gun that ensured it could never function as a fully automatic weapon.  The new owner of the gun uses it for target shooting.</p> <p> A licence for an M1 Grand rifle which is shown in section 6 on page 9 of my documentation was granted in Limerick following a court case.  However, the Garda again described it as being an assault rifle.  Under Irish law, an assault rifle is a fully automatic firearm or one that resembles it.  The M1 Grand rifle was never produced as a fully automatic.  It is an ex-service rifle that was used by the Americans, much like the FN rifle was used by the FCA.</p> <p> The pistol that corresponds with the Heckler &amp;amp; Koch SL8 that I mentioned is shown on page 10 of my documentation.  This custom made gun was hand built at a cost of &euro;2,800.  My client in this case was refused a licence on the basis that it was used by military and police forces around the world.  I e-mailed the guy in Germany who had built it when I was conducted research for the case.  He told me it was like comparing a Willys Jeep to a Ferrari.  He said they were so different that they were incomparable.  No part of this gun will fit the Colt 45 from which it was originally designed.  If members turn to page 11, they will see what the original pistol is like.  This gun is so advanced that it is called the 2011 rather than the 1911 pistol.  As I said, no part of it will fit the original pistol.  The stance the Garda has taken in this regard is that these pistols are military firearms when, in fact, they are not.  If one put a grain of sand inside one of these pistols, it would not work.  Their tolerance levels are that tight and the firearms are that accurate.  Such a level of dirt in the gun would stop it.  A military firearm would keep on working in the same circumstances.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

If members want to read it, that is fine.  The word "weapon" does not appear on the certificate or in the legislation that governs the issuing of certificates.  We always train everybody from the first day they start target shooting to believe every firearm is lethal, or could be lethal if abused.  The certificate is for my air pistol, which could be lethal.  I would have to hold someone down and beat him or her with it in order to kill him or her with it.  If I were to try to shoot someone with it, he or she would just get annoyed.  If I wanted to harm someone with this thing, I would have to feed him or her the pellets in the stew from the cafeteria to give him or her lead poisoning.  When I have presented the licence for it to customs agents in other countries, they have looked at me and said, "that is not a real gun; what are you talking about?"  When people keep using the word "weapon," it sustains their rather unusual beliefs about what we do.  They keep seeing Hollywood films in their heads.  During the years I have trained approximately 1,000 people to shoot.  I have never met one who knew what we did before he or she started.  They are always of the opinion that it is nothing like what they thought it would be.  When someone said our sports were like golf without the exciting bits, it was about the best description I had ever heard.  When people keep using the word "weapon," it is confusing on one level and downright silly on another.  I would love if we could stop using the word.</p></speech>

I mentioned in my opening statement that there were many daft areas and anomalies in Irish firearms law.  This is one of them.  The law considers a semi-automatic or an automatic rifle, or something that looks like one, to be an assault rifle.  Somebody has to make a judgment on what a rifle looks like in order to decide what kind of licence - for example, an unrestricted or a restricted licence - should be issued for it.  Unrestricted and restricted licences are not like supersets of one another.  I cannot get the harder version and expect it to cover me for the other case.  It is like a motorcycle licence and a car licence - if I have a licence for one and I am stopped while using the other, I will be for the high jump.  It is the same with firearms - if I have a licence for an unrestricted firearm and I am told that I have a restricted firearm in my hands, I will be in trouble.  The same applies the other way around - if I have a unrestricted firearm in my hands and I am found to have an restricted licence, that licence will not cover me.  Given that the only way to tell whether one licence or the other should be obtained is to get somebody to say, "that looks like this to me," and bearing in mind a severe penalty of up to seven years in jail and a &euro;20,000 in fines applies in this area, I suggest there is a problem with the law.  It is a legislative issue that should have been fixed a long time ago.  We brought it up at the time, but it is still an issue.</p></speech>

We were asked why sportsmen and sportswomen needed semi-automatic firearms or rifles.  We use the Ruger 10/22 in many cases, particularly for gallery rifle shooting, in which our team has been successful.  If one uses a semi-automatic rifle, one does not have to change one's shooting position when firing.  Typically, one can be more accurate, particularly in gallery rifle shooting, provided one has made the investment.  My colleague shoots to 1,000 yards, which is slightly different.</p>  <p>  The second point I want to make is that the design of target firearms is evolving.  The equipment used in this sport is evolving like the equipment used in any other sport.  Many of the platforms on which target firearms are now being manufactured could be said to look like assault firearms to the untrained eye.  The German sporting company Ansch&uuml;tz makes the MSR 22 rifle.  When I was having one of these firearms licensed recently, I had to obtain a restricted licence simply because it had a pistol whip.</p> <p>Ansch&uuml;tz never made a military firearm.  It only makes target firearms and this is its latest.  I take on board completely the points made on appearance, but appearance means nothing.  My MSR .22 is no more lethal than the Ruger 10/22 with the wooden stock and it probably has a lower magazine capacity.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

The other is the concept of resembling something.  If one asks someone to consider something that resembles a car or a spaceship, that is fine, as long as he or she knows what a spaceship and a car are.  However, if a person was one of the early explorers talking to someone in the Polynesian islands, he or she would probably not know what either was.  It would be very hard for that person to make a good accurate judgment on whether something looked like them, apart from it being a flawed concept in the first place.  The appearance of something has absolutely no bearing on its use or effectiveness.  A black shotgun is no more and no less dangerous than another shotgun.  If it was pink, it would not be safer.  I would not feel particularly happy to see a burglar coming in with a pink shotgun.  The appearance means nothing, but I have heard about many cases in which people have had difficulty in having licensed something because it was black.  To me, it is a non-issue.</p>  <p>  The other term that comes up a lot is "designed for".  There are many things that are designed for one particular purpose that could be used for another.  Jamie Oliver's kitchen knives can be used very successfully in preparing meals.  Unfortunately, if a person is of ill intent, he or she could use them to inflict serious harm on somebody.  I propose that the criteria be the suitability of a person to hold something and his or her intent in using it.  Legitimate target shooters and firearms owners have already been through a very rigorous vetting exercise and, surely, their intent has been spoken to; their sanity and their health.  It is an ongoing matter which can be examined and the licence withdrawn.  Their intent is covered, after which the phrases "designed for" and "appearance of" are largely immaterial.  </p>  <p>  The idea that something should be done in case somebody does something is an equally flawed piece of logic.  If one were to follow it to its ultimate conclusion, one could not sell a car that could exceed the speed limit as the person might exceed it.  It would be a huge restriction on civil liberties.  Normally, we make a law and expect citizens to follow it.  If they do not, there is a penalty.  We do not say we will penalise a person on the basis that he or she might do something in the future.  That is what a lot of those calling to restrict the legislation even further are looking to do.</p></speech>

I do not agree with the delegates' point.  They must remember that they are members of sports clubs, that we are lay people in the Oireachtas and that the vast majority of citizens would not draw a distinction between a weapon and a firearm.  We live in the world of Hollywood culture and watch movies.  While the delegates are focusing on the terminology used for weapons and firearms, most people do not see a difference.  It is not the most important point.  On the issue of automatic rifles and weapons that might be used, the concern of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces is that they do not want anybody to have possession of a weapon that would give him or her an advantage against garda&iacute; on the streets.  If someone has an automatic weapon or rifle and there was a situation, that person would have an advantage.  That is the practical concern which is a reasonable one.</p>  <p>  The delegates make the strong point that if something resembles something but is not it, there must be a logical and sensible way to say that while something looks like an automatic rifle, it clearly is not one.  That takes me to my question.  Is there an international practice or an international body to adjudicate and state that what we want safely to be in the hands of sports clubs is fine and will not be in the category about which one is worried?  </p>  <p>  The delegates spoke about crime prevention officers visiting their homes.  Is there a space for an independent body that would do two things - adjudicate on whether the weapon is one that is internationally understood to be used for sporting purposes and hunky dory if secured safely and have the responsibility instead of crime prevention officers of visiting the homes of sports body members to ensure they were complying with the security requirements?  It strikes me that there is a way to find common ground that does not put the sport at risk, while reassuring the public who are lay people and do not have the delegates' understanding.  I am a layperson and to me, weapons and firearms are the same.  It is about giving that sense of assurance in a sensible way that reassures the public.</p></speech>

We would welcome the establishment of a centralised licensing authority.  If it was to take on responsibility for considering the issue of home security, we would not have an issue with it.  Equally, we do not have an issue with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na making home security checks.  My experience is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does a very good job when it comes home security checks.  That said, from a licensing administration point of view, the Deputy is correct that it has to be objective and specification-based.  If we were to involve the stakeholders, agree, if necessary, the specification following debate and have an independent body to implement it, I would totally support it, as would the team present.</p></speech>

I do not have a problem with this.  I have trained several hundred people.  When they come, they do not know anything about our sport and we do not turn around, slap them on the face and say, "Get out because you called it a weapon."  It is our job to train them.  If I am talking to my father as I did a few days ago in my kitchen and he uses the word "weapon," I do not haul him up on it.  It is an informal chat.  I do not have one of those lovely little light-up microphones in my kitchen and do not talk to the people who draft our laws in my kitchen.

In my submission I mentioned the German model, in which there are a number of tiers of licensing, starting with meeting simple shotgun licensing requirements.  There are also stringent requirements to be met within them for those who seek to own a licence.  Looking at international best practice, Germany, Canada and New Zealand are all classified as having restrictive firearms policies and equal or lower firearms related crime rates to Ireland, while having much higher numbers of firearms <i>per capita</i>.  This should be looked at and taken on board as a possible solution.</p></speech>

The cosmetics of it have changed.  It is moving it from unrestricted to restricted.  Mr. Tope made the point of having genuine consultation and debate with the Garda and the other authorities regarding what is and is not a suitable firearm.  That is what we must decide in that regard.  Will the witnesses elaborate on where they envisage this consultation process going?  They have given their presentation today and we will move on from here.  I appreciate getting an understanding of what firearms are.  I have looked at the photographs but they effectively all do the same thing.  They are all for the purpose of target shooting.</p> <p> The other matter of note is that there are two members of the Defence Forces, although I realise they are not giving the view of the Defence Forces but their personal opinions.  However, it certainly adds balance to the debate after the original presentation we were given by the Garda.  We would trust our Defence Forces as much as we trust the Garda on this.  From what I have heard today there is a level of expertise that must be engaged with before we finalise or sign off on anything, and that level of expertise is before us.  I know the Garda has resources and the witnesses have said that they trust the Garda implicitly, but I cannot see how a scattered licensing arrangement with over 50 to 100 districts and decision makers can be a fair process for those partaking in sport.  We must have some type of single licensing authority and an agreed calibre, or whatever word one wishes to use.</p></speech>

There must be an independent review of some type.  A sub-committee of this committee, for example, might be the ideal group of people to complete such an independent review and take the views of all stakeholders into account.  As has been mentioned this afternoon, with more than 650 court cases there will be interpersonal issues arising from that so we desperately need independence.  I believe a review that includes the views of all stakeholders is a critical first step.  An independent licensing authority is a very desirable second step so we can prevent the type of litigation that has occurred in the past and where there is a working appeals mechanism that is outside the courts.  That is the point we must reach.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

Much good work was done and there was great progress.  It was the first time there was anything like that.  It went on for some time.</p>  <p>  What strikes me is how much we are talking about the same things as we discussed then.  One matter that arose early, when we were doing an outline of a type of wish list, as Mr. Dennehy said, was that we would like to have impartial and objective decisions.  We would like to see a centralised system, hopefully, rather than a scaremongering that these are horrible things and why would one want them because they are evil and nasty.  As Senator Mulcahy pointed out, changing the appearance of something cosmetically makes no difference to what it does or does not do.  It is like changing the colour of one's car.</p>  <p>  We really sought to do that and to get that going, but we were told it could not be done.  For one reason or another it was shelved.  That was a huge loss.  It cost the State millions and it cost the citizens of the State an unbelievable amount of money.  It created frustration and distrust, which was the most important casualty.  Instead of have the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda and shooters working together, it created the distrust that started to gel.  It was a tragedy that it happened.  Speaking for myself and my shooting colleagues, any of the stakeholders involved would welcome the opportunity to have an interface like that again.</p></speech>

Many of them would have made written or e-mailed submissions, but will they comment on face-to-face engagement?</p>  <p>  Second, can the witnesses give us an overview, to their knowledge, of the number of other jurisdictions where the licensing or permitting of firearms is entirely within the remit of the police service in those jurisdictions?

Our objective was to try to bring an end to the ongoing litigation, as I have previously mentioned.  We were invited by the Department and we discussed what we believed were its problems or issues.  We produced a lengthy and detailed submission suggesting alternative approaches to resolving those issues.  We also discussed matters such as increased home security and so forth and an apprenticeship scheme for pistol ownership.  It would be much like the motor cycle licensing model, where one started off with low calibre firearms and one trained and demonstrated one's capability and interest in the sport, after which one could move on to different types of firearms.  Believe it or not, that idea came from a senior civil servant and we worked on it.  Unfortunately, the submission was put forward and I believe it was read, but we never discussed it.  We never received a single question on it or anything that resembled a negotiation.  It became apparent to us that we were going nowhere.  We did not stop engagement.  We had a meeting and there were no further meetings called.</p>  <p>  It is interesting to note that the senior person in charge of the section in the Department of Justice and Equality moved shortly thereafter and that might have had something to do with it.  I do not know.  We then engaged with the replacement.  We invited that civil servant out to one of our ranges so we could explain our sport.  We were somewhat disheartened and a little suspicious, and I do not wish to do anybody wrong so I will not mention anybody-----</p></speech>

It is the second largest range in Europe.  It was built from our membership fees and moneys and with the work and effort of the members involved.</p> <p>It is an approved range and has been inspected and approved by the range inspector.  We have had engagement with the Department and the Garda and various branches.  As I said, we engaged with them on the firearms consultative panel in the past but more than that, we had a pretty good relationship with the Department of Justice and Equality.  We put in a submission, in which I was involved, to advance the idea of ammunition reloading in Ireland.  After some negotiation and so on, as one can imagine, we were granted that facility.  We are currently the only club in Ireland which is allowed to legally reload rifle ammunition.  That was done because it is an essential part of our sport.  What we do is somewhat like the Formula One of shooting, where little things mean a lot, as the song says.  We try to eliminate all the little things - the cumulative errors and so on.  If someone who did not know what was involved in that were to watch somebody loading ammunition for a competition, he or she would probably fall asleep before anything happened.</p> <p> However, we have engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality and the department of explosives extensively and they visited the range several times.  We had meetings with them once every three or four weeks and there was somebody on the range.  Reloading is a section of the legislation, so I offer an invitation to any member, or all interested members, of the committee to visit and to see the facilities. </p></speech>

Our system is very different from anywhere else in the world.  We do not license the individual but rather the firearm, which has some interesting side effects.  For example, we can tell members how many firearms are licensed in Ireland today.  If they ask me how many people have a firearm or who are the licensed owners, I cannot tell them that.  I do not think I have ever seen that figure presented to the D&aacute;il.  The answer to the simple question of many people have guns is that no one knows.  We can have people who have two or three licences and we can have a firearm which is licensed to two or three people.  One would have audit all the data and it would be a monumental task to come up with that figure, simply because of the way the system is structured.  In terms of trying to compare ourselves to other jurisdictions, there are fundamental differences as to how we do things here which make simple comparisons almost impossible.</p></speech>

I am sorry I could not make it this morning but I would welcome the opportunity to make a couple of brief points and ask a couple of questions.  The input of this committee is very important and I welcome the work it is doing on this because it will bring a balance to the debate, which is very important.  Ultimately, this whole thing is very subjective.  Much of the concern I have with the report from the Garda and with what has happened in the past and all the litigation is subjective in terms of interpreting what is there already and what could change.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point was that perception and use of language are important, as has been accepted.  The people in Harbour House Sports Club, my local club, and in others, who take their sport and their responsibilities dealing with firearms very seriously, are being portrayed as gun-toting irresponsible citizens.  That is a problem and that is where the use of language is very important.</p></speech>

Nobody in this room wants a legally or an illegally held gun to be involved in an incident in the future.  From the Garda's point of view, have any incidents happened in the recent past - since the change in the legislation - which the witnesses believe are driving these further changes?</p></speech>

The question was about whether there have been incidents since the 2009 legislative change which we feel might underscore the proposed changes in this draft document.  Speaking as a representative of the trade and, to some degree, wearing my hat as a committee member of the Harbour House Sports Club, we do not believe there have been any incidents which underpin this legislative drive.</p></speech>

Mr. Tope referred to the significant investment to upgrade clubs' security facilities and those of anybody who has licensed weaponry, and this was touched on in a number of the presentations.  One could say there is a greater threat from illegally held firearms and there seem to be a lot more of them in this country.  Irrespective of the outcome of this, things cannot say the same because we cannot keep having 600 or 700 court cases.  I am not a member of this committee, which has to decide on things, but I very much support the calls for an independent licensing committee and authority.  I welcome the opportunity to make my points.</p></speech>

For example, it is not right that since 2009, those at stag party paint-balling in Wicklow for a weekend is committing a breach of the Firearms Act.  Technically, that requires them to be put in jail for seven years and fined &euro;20,000, along with everybody who works in the companies that run these services.  I do not think anybody would think that is a great way to have the law.  If hunters going out to shoot rabbits for the pot take a shot before they start hunting the rabbits to ensure their sights are aligned, that is technically target shooting outside of an authorised range, which is illegal act.  The Minister for Justice and Equality at the time said afterwards that was unintentional mistake in the law.  There are many errors in the law to which we can point and that is really awful.  There is the Firearms Act 1925 and there are eight more Acts which amend parts of it.  Nothing has ever been repealed.  There are another 12 Acts which have parts in them which define the behaviour target shooters and hunters are supposed to follow, including the wildlife Acts, the Airports Act and the Explosives Act, which covers the reloading shooters do.  There are Acts from before the foundation of State, including both of the Explosive Acts.  The Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act 1851 still applies.  It relates to how far away from a road one has to be before one can start hunting bunnies.  There is no single place a person starting off in the sport can go to see what the rules are to which they must adhere.  Before we start to make any changes to these things, and there is a list, we need to have a solid base from which to work.</p>  <p>  What has to be done is that all of those nine or ten Acts, which amended the Firearms Act, need to be restated under a Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002.  That was called for by the Law Reform Commission in 2004 and by Mr. Justice Charleton in the High Court a few years ago but it has never been done.  The Law Reform Commission has prepared informal restatements of these Acts.  The only textbook ever written on firearms law in Ireland, which was only just published last year, has a restatement in one of the appendices but that is not the same thing as a restatement of the Act under the law, because at that point, we would take all that has gone before it, repeal it and replace it with the Firearms Act, as amended, and we would have a single document to which we could all go.  </p>  <p>  If we do that, then we can start to talk about the fairly silly things in it that need to be fixed.  For example,  if I am doing my Christmas shopping and I walk into a popular shop in a popular shopping centre and see a shelf full of toy crossbows being sold &ndash; they are obviously toys and are meant for firing suction darts at walls and so on - under the current Firearms Act, they are restricted firearms.</p> <p>These are obviously toys and meant for firing suction darts at walls and this kind of thing.  Under the current firearms Act, these are restricted firearms and need to be licensed.  If a person does not have a licence for it, he or she faces seven years in jail and &euro;20,000 in fines.  This is beyond silly.</p></speech>

We spoke for much of the time about assault rifles and how, if a thing looks like an assault rifle, the laws in this regard will operate.  As Deputies, we often meet people who have been the victims of a robbery.  I met a postal worker who described what it was like to be looking down the barrel of a firearm or a weapon or whatever one wishes to call it.  He was not a firearms expert.  He was looking down the barrel of what he thought was an automatic weapon.  I know the witnesses are as much against this as we are.  However, to understand the perception that exists and why the regulations cover assault rifles or something which looks like one, if someone is holding up a bank with what looks like an assault rifle to the people behind the counter, it is one to them.  This could be one of the reasons for this in the current Act.  I ask the witnesses to comment on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.1114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Dennehy" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015012100025#Z00800"><p>In 2004, I was the secretary of the National Target Shooting Association, NTSA.  We met Department of Justice officials, because at that time they were starting to draft the firearms Bill 2004, which became the 2006 Act.  One of the initial suggestions in the draft was to describe assault rifles as rifles that had a pistol grip and a collapsible stock.  Every air rifle and small bore rifle used in the Olympics has a pistol grip and a stock which adjusts, which could be defined as collapsible, because every single human being has a different distance from where the stock goes on one's arm - for air rifles it goes on one's shoulder - to one's eye, which is doing the aim.  It has to be adjustable because a person is paying &euro;2,500 for a rifle and he or she will want it to fit.  We talk about how we define these things in the Act, but this is the effect it has on sportspeople.</p>  <p>  However, the Act is kind of odd in that it deals with two separate groups.  There are two separate scenarios.  On one hand, the Act deals with law-abiding people engaged in sports, hunting, veterinary practice, airport safety and so forth and it covers how these things are licensed.  The assault rifle part deals with this.  On the other hand, another section of the Act deals with every murderer, terrorist and drug dealer.  This section deals with possessing firearms without licences and with intent to endanger life and so on.  This has nothing to do with us.  When we find the definition of assault rifle going into our section of the Act, we are confused.  It is not, to our minds, a fantastic association to have.</p>  <p>  In the scenario the Deputy described, where someone walks into a post office and points a gun at the poor woman behind the counter, under Irish law it does not matter if it is a gun.  If I point a toy at someone behind the counter and say, "This is a robbery.  Stick 'em up", I will go to jail for the same length of time as if I had used a loaded firearm.  The law does not make a distinction between whether the firearm is real, loaded or anything else.  It is an offence for a person to point something at another person which the second person thinks is a loaded firearm and the first person acts like it is.  The person is going to jail for the same amount of time, regardless of what it is he or she is actually holding in his or her hands.</p>  <p>  There is this idea that we are trying to get around things that would concern public safety.  It is very difficult to explain how foreign a concept this is.  Most of us here have children.  If the Deputy wishes, after the meeting I can sit him down and show him photographs of the most beautiful child ever born in Irish history and quite happily bore him to death with it.  I am very concerned about this child's public safety.  He is a member of the public, as am I.  When we start talking about that with this, it is a bit confusing, because there is nothing in this law which says that we are a separate group from the public.  When we speak about the firearms licensing laws and the half of the firearms Act that applies to us, it is really important to keep it distinct in our minds from the other half of the firearms Act, which is about people none of us would like to be seen given the time of day and which most of us would like to see locked up for the rest of their lives.  That is what the law applies to in most cases.  There is a life sentence for half these things.</p></speech>

I cannot imagine how traumatising a situation like that would be.  It is totally repugnant to any target shooter or law-abiding citizen.  I would make the point, while not wishing to be insensitive, that if someone walked in my front door and pointed any kind of firearm at me, I would be more worried about the fact that they were pointing a firearm rather than the type of firearm it was, its shape, colour and so forth.  I can understand that the person relating the story to the Deputy said that it was an assault rifle.  In a way it is a moot point, because it could have been a single barrel shotgun or a piece of pipe with a handle on it.  It might not have been a real gun, but it would have had a very traumatising effect.  I understand the public safety aspect.  However, it is no basis for deciding what type of firearm or what the appearance of something is or whatever.</p></speech>

I dispute there is one.  If the Deputy were to walk into any firearm shop, the nonsense of this appearance argument would become apparent.  A person can buy a realistic imitation firearm and I would not be able to tell the difference between it and a real firearm.  A child could buy one.

I did not hang around thinking, "It is okay; it is only a semi-automatic", or "It is a sawn-off shotgun".  It took quite a while to be able to sit down and recall it.  When the police were questioning me, all I was able to tell them was that there were two barrels.  That is all I knew.  I could not say if it was large or small, and it did not matter.  No matter what that weapon - I use that term because it was a weapon at that stage as it was threatening me - was being used for or what it was, it was lethal at that stage if that person had pulled that trigger.  On Mr. Tope's point, that was a malevolent person using a firearm for purposes that are not ours and with which we should not be linked.</p></speech>

However, one might not have the normal range of ballistic testing that one can do.</p>  <p>  It is a funny thing that the Chairman mentioned ballistic testing because I ran this idea by some of our members.  Some of them commented that if the idea of ballistic testing was put out there, and if this would exonerate us or our firearms from involvement, they would happily pay their travelling expenses and even a fee to have it done.  That possibly sounds very dramatic but we take it that seriously.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Costello agree that it is a lot easier to change the configuration of a firing pin than a barrel?  I could adjust the striations left by a firing pin in a shotgun with a nailfile in 30 seconds to make it completely unrecognisable from the record previously taken.  To do the same with a barrel of a rifle or handgun is a completely different kettle of fish.</p></speech>

It is not just the firing pin that is involved.  There are grooves on the cases, which we call the brass of the case, even in a shotgun which are much harder to change than just the firing pin.  The German authorities say that 77% of all cases recovered at crime scenes at the moment are useful in the identification of the crime.</p></speech>

We put it forward to address the concerns raised by the Department of Justice and Equality about a perceived dramatic growth in centre fire pistol ownership.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the Department's perception, we felt we should help solve the problem.</p>  <p>  In our view the Department did not seem to have an issue with the right type of people - target firearms people - having firearms.  It was concerned that people who were not necessarily dedicated target shooters might get a licence for these firearms.  We then built on an idea from a senior civil servant to have a graduated scheme like motorcycle licensing, from 50 cc up to a 1,000 cc motorcycle.  We developed a scheme which we felt would work and put it forward in our submission to the Department.  Let me give an example.  If centre fire pistol licensing was back on the table again, and I hope that it is, there would not be a dramatic rise in applications because it was only people who had proved their interest in the sport and developed a capability who would be capable of obtaining such licences.  The same applies for small calibre pistols and various types of rifles.  One must work one's way up the categories.</p></speech>

The difference is semi-automatic is a single shot weapon so it is far more accurate.  An automatic firearm like a rifle can spray shots all over the place which may not be very accurate.  Will Mr. Slattery comment on that, explain the differences and why people perceive one to be more lethal than the other?  To me, the single shot can be more lethal because a person has more control and accuracy.</p></speech>

In terms of the development of firearms, realistically we are now going as far as lasers.  Firearms cannot develop any more so a lot of manufacturers have moved to a semi-automatic platform.  That means every time one pulls the trigger, one has a one round fire.  For a fully automatic platform, every time one pulls the trigger and as long as one holds back the trigger, the firearm or weapon, depending on its use, will continue to fire until there is no more ammunition or it jams.  In the past it was perceived that bolt action rifles were far more accurate than semi-automatic rifles.  Nowadays, several manufacturers produce semi-automatic rifles that are as accurate if not more so than a lot of bolt action rifles on the market.  We must legislate for this development or we will be left in the dark again.</p></speech>

Under Article 6 of the EU Directive 91/477, that has been out since 1991 and is part of our law, any automatic firearm comes under the heading of category A in the EU and cannot be licensed to any civilian.  One can only possess them with specific permission from Government.  That means Enda Kenny would have to write a note saying one could have one.  The directive states that all member states should prohibit people from having such firearms and, therefore, this is not an issue in Ireland.</p></speech>

We are pleased to welcome Mr. Gaynor, who submitted a petition to the committee entitled "Equality and fairness regarding the raising of the State pension age to 66 and beyond."  Since the raising of the pension age, a number of lobby groups have highlighted what they believe to be the unfairness of this position for individuals who had an expectation relating to pension or retirement.  I thank Mr. Gaynor for forwarding his presentation.  Members are keen to hear his views on the raising of the State pension age and following his presentation, there will be a questions and answer session with members.</p>  <p>  This D&aacute;il is the first to have a committee dealing with petitions, although one has been in the European Parliament for many years.

I presume members have already read the detail of my submission so I will give a brief overview of it.  The Government is concerned about increased life expectancy and an increased length of time spent in retirement, along with a difficulty we may have funding State pensions.  The Government has begun a series of reforms, including the raising of the State pension age to 66 and beyond from the beginning of last year.  Not everyone is being treated equally.</p>  <p>  I am comparing what is happening in the private sector with the public sector but I am not against the public sector.  I am merely comparing how the two sectors are being treated differently.  Before proceeding I will tell a story about a friend of mine who is retiring from his work next month.  He has worked for 51 years since he was 14 but he will not get a State pension for the first year of his retirement.  He must sign on and we hope he will get his stamps.  He was born in 1950 and began working in 1964.  We can compare this to a public servant who began before 1995.  When that person has completed 40 years of work, he or she is entitled to a full pension.  A public representative like the committee members elected before 2004 is entitled to a full pension after 20 years when the person turns 50.  My colleague has worked for 51 years.  The dates of 1995 and 2004 are cut-off points in the public sector but one could call his cut-off date 1963.  That is a massive gap.  The Government is using dates of birth to decide when a private sector worker is cut off from a pension but it is using a date of work termination for a public sector worker.  I do not see why the public sector cannot have this as the relevant date.</p>  <p>  In her submission to a committee on 2 October 2013, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, revealed that because of our increasing life expectancy, men are now living to an average age of 82, with women living to an average age of 85.  From this we can work out that if an elected representative retired at 50 on a full pension, he or she would draw a pension for 32 years.  A public servant retiring at 60 would draw a pension for 22 years but a private sector worker would only draw a pension for 14 to 16 years, depending on age.  The private sector worker would be expected to work longer and have a lower life expectancy, meaning his or her time drawing a pension would be smaller again.  The Minister referred to an OECD report on the pension system and in its view, the State is moving very fast against the private sector compared with the public sector.  It has noticed the private sector is being treated differently.</p>  <p>  In Kerry we have been campaigning for the past three years against these proposed changes.  We have even been lobbying Deputies.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, seems to believe the problem is we will be in retirement for too long and she wants to shorten that period.  Data from the Central Statistics Office indicate that a person's job has an effect on life expectancy.  If the Minister wishes to reduce the amount of time people spend in retirement, she should consider a person's job and work out the life expectancy, with retirement age being extrapolated from that.  The Minister has used the financial crisis as an excuse for changes to the pension.</p> <p>I am speaking for most of my colleagues when I say that none of us got involved in the madness of the Celtic tiger.  We feel very hard done by to be blamed and punished for what happened to the banking system.  We also note that those who were involved in the running and supervision of the banks managed to get away with their giant pensions.  No one seems to have done anything about it.</p> <p> In her submission, the T&aacute;naiste suggested that by 2050, we will not have enough people of working age to fund people in retirement.  To me, it is not correct to use the statistics for people of working age.  There are approximately 3 million people of working age in Ireland.  The CSO defines "working age" as between the ages of 15 and 64.  Many people in that age bracket are not paying tax because they are going to school or college or are home-makers or carers.  The T&aacute;naiste should be comparing the number of people who are working with the number of retired people.  Such a comparison reveals that in the private sector there are approximately 3.2 people working for every retired person, whereas in the public sector there are approximately 1.9 people working for every retired person.  The problem is more in the public sector than in the private sector.  Having said that, I have nothing against the public sector.</p> <p> The Government has let us down badly.  Governments are elected to govern us in a fair and objective manner.  In our view, its pension reforms can be regarded as anything but objective.  We feel that if reforms are necessary, all the parties involved should be brought together and a deal should be hammered out.  Why not have the same cut-off date for everyone?  Something like that would make it fairer.  I look forward to any questions that the members of the committee might have.</p></speech>

This is a new process.

What specific changes would he like the T&aacute;naiste to make?</p></speech>

First, everyone should be brought up to 65.  Some people can retire at 50.  More people can retire at 60.  If further measures are needed when everyone is at 65, it would be more acceptable to raise the age together for everyone.  We also feel that retrospective changes are a step too far.  When changes are made in the public sector, they are generally applied to new people going forward.  We feel that any changes should apply to new entrants to the workforce.  In 2012, a significant change was made as part of the reform of public sector pensions.  Why not use that date and say that the changes being implemented relate to those who started work after 2012?  We feel that going back to the 1960s to get at private sector workers is going back too far.  Many people who left school young in the 1960s have been working for 50 years.  I remind the committee that work was a lot harder then than it is now.  We are always told to plan our pensions and tick all the boxes, for example by making additional voluntary contributions.  However, as we approach retirement, we do not know where we stand.<br/>We believe the Government should legislate to ensure employers keep us on in our jobs.  At the moment, we are depending on the goodwill of the employers who are deciding whether to keep us on.  In my workplace, we have to let management know two months in advance whether we are planning to stay on.  If management agrees to allow us stay on, we have to undertake a medical and seek the approval of the human resources division.  Up to two months before retirement age, we might not know where we stand.  We feel legislation should be passed to remove this uncertainty.<br/>I am aware that a letter has been sent to this committee by officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation who seem to be of the view that a person who is let go at the age of 65 can take an unfair dismissals case against his or her employer.  To be honest, do people who are about to retire want to be starting litigation against their employers?  A retiring person who has no pension does not want to start litigation.  That is no way for anyone to start retirement.<br/>A solicitor who wrote an article about this issue in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>on 11 January last conceded that this is &quot;very much a grey area&quot;.  She suggested that a court might rule in favour of one person but against another person.  An employer can use several reasons to justify letting people go.  There is no security at all for anybody approaching retirement.  We feel let down, to be honest.</p></speech>

I thank him for all the work he has put into this issue.  It is clear that he has put a great deal of thought into it.  Any citizen who makes such an effort has to be commended.  He has hit the nail on the head with regard to two aspects of this matter about which something needs to be done.  First, if the State is saying it will not pay the State pension until people reach a certain age, they should certainly be entitled to work until they reach that age.  Second, a person in these circumstances who is not getting a pension and is not working should receive a standard social welfare payment.  It is wrong to expect people who are retiring for reasons beyond their control to sign on as if they were jobseekers when it is clear that they are not.  They are two very important principles.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask Mr. Gaynor a question about something that has struck me on the basis of my reading of this issue.  The pension received by a civil servant is distinct from the State pension.  The pension that a private employee gets from paying into his or her pension fund is distinct from the State pension.  They are two separate things.  There are people working for private employers in defined benefit schemes whose retirement age is 65 and whose pensions will pay out at that age.  Their pensions are unaffected by the decision to raise the State pension age.  They will still get their full pensions at the age of 65.  In many ways, the public and private sectors are not that different in this regard.  The pension entitlements of a public servant who has been paying into the system for 40 years are the subject of a contract between that public servant and the State.  That happens in the private sector as well.  It is not necessarily true to say that private sector workers are the only workers who are affected by the decision to raise the retirement age.  There are people in the private sector who have pensions that are not affected by the decision to raise the pension age.  It is something that has occurred to me.  I wonder if Mr. Gaynor could comment on that.  Does that point change Mr. Gaynor's analysis a little, given that much of it involved a comparison between the private and public sectors?  I do not think that distinction has been drawn clearly in his analysis.  A person who worked in the public sector for five years before leaving it to work in the private sector will get a small portion of a public sector pension.</p></speech>

I understand that public sector workers who started before 1995 and who have 40 years of service are entitled to a full pension at the age of 60, 61, 62 or whatever age they decide to retire at.  Once they have 40 years done, they can retire.  My friend about whom I was talking started well before 1995.  He is being treated completely differently from a person in the public sector who started in the same year.  His public sector counterpart would be untouched.</p> <p>However, he would be losing his pension at 65.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in what he says.  At work, our employer has a pension scheme.  It is called an integrated pension scheme, in that the pension we get from our employer plus the State pension will make up two thirds of our basic salary.  The experts in the pension industry reckon that to have a decent retirement, one needs about two thirds of one's paid salary to maintain one's standard of living.  In my case, when I retire under the plans that are being put forward at present, I will get my work pension on the first year I retire and might be able to draw stamps, that is, a social welfare payment for the first year.  For the second and third years, I will be means-tested and because I have a work pension, it will mean I either will get a greatly reduced social welfare payment or no payment at all.</p></speech>

All of my plans up to now have been built around the point that on retiring at 65, I would have two thirds of my basic salary from the age of 65 onwards.  However, the changes proposed by the Minister mean I will be badly dented for the first three years.</p></speech>

While I do not wish to personalise this issue too much, has Mr. Gaynor's employer changed its policy as to the age at which employees can retire or until they can work?</p></speech>

My employer is IBEC and what we think is happening is IBEC is just watching and waiting to see what happens.  I presume that if one starts to interfere with the terms of a pension fund or pension scheme, it probably would cause all kinds of problems.  I do not know but what I do know is that our pension from work will be reduced slightly because of the pension levy that was imposed over the past few years.</p></speech>

Is it possible that Mr. Gaynor may continue to work with IBEC until he is 68 and that he might actually start to get some small pension payments at 65 or 66?</p></speech>

People get tired and it is known that people age differently.  Ideally, if the Minister wants us to work on, it should be voluntary.  Legislation should be put in place whereby if I wished to work on for three years, I would know when coming up to the age of 65 that I could work on until I was 66, 67 or 68.  At present, however, no one knows exactly where they stand.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Gaynor see the point that were there a voluntary aspect, they would leave before they get the State pension?  Is there a danger that the Department of Social Protection then would take a view that a person had left work voluntarily and therefore did not actually qualify because one must be actively seeking work for either jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance?</p></speech>

Everyone differs, in that some people feel burned out by the time they hit 60 and it all depends on the job one is doing.  I can imagine that a guy putting up scaffolding will not be swinging off the scaffolding at 70 years of age.  In any event, probably no one would wish to take him on for that kind of work.</p></speech>

To be honest, in an environment in which a huge pensions train wreck is coming down the track as to how the country will fund pensions over the next ten, 15 or 20 years, it will be a huge issue.  It might not be a part of-----</p></speech>

In some countries, their birthrate is not keeping pace with the ageing of the population but is declining.  However, Ireland is the opposite and I believe it has one of the highest birth rates in Europe.  Ireland is producing the young people to keep the system going.  I believe our birth rate over the past few years has confounded some experts in that it is jumped up and now stands at approximately 72,000 or 73,000 per year.</p></speech>

Actually, no, they come from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It reckoned there were 1,390 such people in 2012.  Presumably, the person who makes it all the way has fully contributed to PRSI or, before that was introduced in 1979, stamps for 40 or 50 years.  Such people feel that they have fully contributed what was asked of them.  They worked through the recession in the 1980s and paid penal tax rates but, when coming to retirement, are told from out of the blue that, sorry, they will not get a pension.</p></speech>

We need to have a serious discussion on this matter.  For those of us who are at an age when, having not done so to date, we must start thinking about such issues, the debate Mr. Gaynor has raised will be helpful.</p>  <p>  I am sympathetic to what Mr. Gaynor is saying.  His main point seems to be that a private sector employee who has worked for all of his or her life and made contributions will be substantially disadvantaged compared with a public sector employee who started working before certain dates.  Incredibly, the issue to do with Ministers is sickening.  I do not know how Mr. Gaynor is not in a rage about how anyone elected before a certain year was ring-fenced.  Was it 2004?</p></speech>

Apparently, what is good for the goose is not good for the gander.  We should be outraged and insist that people receive equal treatment.  Whatever about the situation in future, which is something that we need to discuss, it is outrageous that politicians would insulate themselves from the changes they were making.

It is extraordinary.  I thank Mr. Gaynor for highlighting this issue.  Despite the circumstances, he has been calm in putting it across.  He should be outraged.  He is seeking equality for private sector workers caught in this unfair and discriminatory position.  Essentially, they should also be ring-fenced against these changes, after which we could discuss the issue.</p>  <p>  I agree with Mr. Gaynor, who probably knows much more than me, but I always revert to a point.  It relates to one of my strongest memories from sixth class or first or second year in school in the early 1980s.  The geography books of the time claimed that, due to advances in technology and how it would be labour saving, more wealth would be produced and productivity would increase, but that the amount of labour people would have to do to produce that wealth would be considerably less.  According to the books, there would be shorter working lives and a shorter working week, meaning that society's main problem would be what to do with all of that leisure time.  This was completely logical, yet we have got ourselves into a situation-----</p></speech>

It is extraordinary and bizarre.  The books were being rational in claiming that our working lives and week should be shorter.  That was the expectation in the late 1960s right up to the early 1980s, but we have gone in the opposite direction.  People living longer is now a problem and a cost, and we must make them work longer.  Where did all of the wealth that was produced as a result of the increased productivity go?  The amount of wealth that our society has produced has increased exponentially, so we should be able to afford people living longer.  It should not be a problem.  Mr. Gaynor is correct in that is it not a problem objectively.  Rather, it is a problem because the system is structured incorrectly and the people who benefited from the exponential growth in wealth are not the ones who did the work and made the contributions.  We must debate this issue.  To be clear, Mr. Gaynor is proposing that we revert to the 65-year mark and that we should not entertain an increase in the working lifetime unless that is what individuals want to do on a voluntary basis.</p></speech>

If the retirement age is to be increased, that should only be done in respect of new workers.  For those in the public sector and elected representatives, the Minister has set the day they started work as the criterion.  For the private sector, it is the day someone was born.  If a person was born after 1 January 1949, he or she will not receive a pension before turning 66 years of age.  The year 1949 is a long way back.  Many of those born in that year left school early.  Fourteen years was the leaving age, so people would have started working in 1963.  The year that has been set for elected representatives is 2004 and 1995 in respect of public sector workers, although there have been other changes regarding the latter, for example, 2004 and 2012.  For a private sector worker, though, one must go back a very long time to 1963.</p></speech>

To summarise, the response indicates a need for a change in legislation.  The Minister and the Department made the point that, under equality legislation, including European, if a company was to say that it would not employ someone beyond the age of 65 years, defending that stance would be difficult legally.</p> <p>If a company were to say it would not employ one beyond the age of 65 it would be very hard, legally, to defend that.  Mr. Gaynor makes the point that when somebody is 65 the last thing that person wants to do is to go to the Equality Tribunal to defend his or her position.  Maybe clarity and legislation are needed to state that the retirement age must be at the point at which the State pension is provided.</p> <p> Is the committee agreed that we publish this letter on the website as part of the petition documentation?  Agreed.  This is an ongoing deliberation.  We need to engage with the Department and so on.</p></speech>

The deal must be the same for everyone, whether the cut-off date is 1995, 2004 or 2012.  I am not in a position to say what the whole country wants.  The Government must also legislate on the basis that if it raises the pension age the employer has no choice but to keep one on.</p>  <p>  As the Chairman said, one can take a case to the Equality Tribunal but it takes approximately two years for it to hear a case.  I have come across two pieces of information, one on a website on employment law set up by a barrister, which cites cases heard by the European Court of Justice.  If an employer can show that he needs to let people go at 65 he can do so.  The court will accept this if the employer has younger workers coming in whom he wants to promote.  It is a grey area.  One cannot be sure of winning a case.  If it takes two years, the time will have passed.</p></speech>

At the very least, there is a lacuna there.</p></speech>

It is not easy to put together a volume of work and stick at it long enough to present a case.  I applaud that.  I share some of the views on the value of this petition, not least that it seems extraordinary that there is no statutory retirement age as part of the apparatus of the working environment.  Employers use a one-year fixed contract to bridge the gap.  Can Mr. Gaynor explain that in more detail and tell us what he thinks of it?  Is it happening, and if so how widespread is it?</p></speech>

In my workplace, a person approaches a manager two months before retirement to say whether he or she wants to stay on.  The manager will tell the human resources department and it sends the person for a medical examination, depending on the results of which he or she can stay on.  It is like going through a job application for the last year at work.  I know of three people who are due to retire this year but want to stay on.  None of them is sure of what will happen.  They have to be almost at the door before they will find out whether they are staying or going.</p></speech>

One of the documents provided on the employment law website states that if an employer can show that the normal retirement age in his place of work is 65, that can be acceptable as a retirement age.  In the system we had for the past 40 years, everyone knew where they stood.  In the private sector one worked up to 65, retired and got one&rsquo;s pension.  In the public sector, whatever one had applied.  When the Minister for Social Protection started interfering with this, she grabbed the money but left the problems.  We have been campaigning for the past three years and I do not think she is interested in tackling the problems.  She sounds like a broken record, saying we are living longer and we must work longer.</p></speech>

That is reasonable, and we ought to discuss those to see what we as a committee can clarify or pursue to effect change.  Sometimes people put things in place and, until they are in place, do not realise the unintended consequence or the incomplete consequence.</p>  <p>  Is the one-year contract separate from the person&rsquo;s original contract of employment?  In that circumstance, are the worker&rsquo;s rights diminished, or is it a continuation of the existing terms?</p></speech>

The change came in last year.  As far as I am aware, only one person was due to retire last year, and he asked to stay.  We succeeded with that because we were lobbying our Deputies.  We had meetings between our company, Jack O&rsquo;Connor of SIPTU and Deputies Deenihan and Spring, and eventually we thrashed out a deal to the effect that two months before retirement we approach our manager, and if he agrees to keep us on he contacts the HR department, which sends us for a medical, and if we pass that we continue as we are.  That happened because we were agitating for something.  I think there should be legislation that is clear for everyone if the pension age must be raised.  There should be no ifs and buts about it.</p></speech>

It asserts:</p><blockquote>While Section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Acts provides that it is not unlawful for an employer to fix a compulsory retirement age for employees, the Equality Tribunal has, in recent decisions, interpreted those Acts in the light of rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) cases concerning Framework Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibits discrimination in employment and occupation on various grounds, including age.  In those cases, the CJEU has found that terminating someone&rsquo;s employment on the basis of their chronological age is considered as direct discrimination under EU law.</blockquote> <p>I would like to hear Mr. Gaynor's response to that.  It raises two questions.  If the grounds are so solid then why was legislation not introduced to prevent an employer from refusing to employ somebody?  Why leave it to the employer?</p></speech>

It has found in favour of the employer and the employee.  From what I can gather, an employer must be able to show that he or she has a valid reason for letting a person go.  An employer cannot just say to an employee that he or she must go on reaching 65 years.  If the employer says, &quot;I have a young person here whom I want to promote,&quot; then that is considered a valid reason.  Let me give the example of an engineering firm that has trained apprentices who have almost completed training, but also employs older fitters or electricians.  In that case, an employer would have a valid reason to let the older guys go at 65, because he or she has new guys trained.  That is acceptable, from what I can gather, but please remember that I am not a lawyer or barrister.  Mr. Stephen O'Sullivan has created a website, <i>employmentlawireland.wordpress.com</i>, which lists a few examples of cases in which the court has found in favour of either the employer or the employee.  This section of law is a grey area and is unclear.</p></speech>

He said this section of law was a grey area for the European Court of Justice.  I would appreciate if he sent us on some examples to strengthen his case and help us in our work.</p></speech>

Mr. Gaynor said that around 1,400 people join the pension system in this way every year, and the day after their 65th birthday they become eligible for the State pension.  There is a sense that the change was brought in to save a lot of money.  However, if the number increases for two years cumulatively - let us say 1,400 leave work one year and another 1,400 leave work the next year - and that is multiplied by 288, then one gets around &euro;800,000 in a full year.  On the other hand, the State loses tax revenue amounting to, give or take, a couple of hundred thousand euro.  Really, the saving involved, from the figures given to us by Mr. Gaynor, is possibly around &euro;500,000 per year, so one would wonder-----</p></speech>

There is some saving in terms of the pension that would have been payable.  Jobseeker's allowance is paid, so there is possibly only a saving of a couple of hundred thousand euro for the State.  Is there a financial benefit to the State?  I am not sure whether Mr. Gaynor has any thoughts on the matter.</p></speech>

About 11,000 people per year reach the age of 65, with about 1,400 people leaving work.</p>  <p>  The State also makes a saving in terms of social welfare payments.  For example, a person on unemployment benefit receives &euro;188 per week, so the State would save &euro;42 per week.  The people who are working argue that they have stayed the course.  Perhaps some people receiving welfare were burned out by work or receive a disability allowance due to being injured.  I do not see why such people should lose out either, but today I will just focus on people who are working.</p>  <p>  As far as I can make out, the total cost of State pensions per year is &euro;6.5 billion.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh has said, a couple of hundred thousand euro out of &euro;6.5 billion is peanuts.  It boggles the mind why people are being targeted.</p></speech>

Has Mr. Gaynor a view on that requirement?  It seems preposterous that people are put on jobseeker's allowance for that year.  They must go through all the hoops to get jobseeker's allowance, with labour activation, questions about whether they are looking for a job, and all the rest.</p></speech>

It is years 2 and 3 that will be the problem when the State raises the retirement age from 66 to 67 and 68, because one will be means tested.  In our case we will have a small pension from work, and people may have put money aside in AVCs in order to boost income.  We have ticked all the right boxes and followed the State's advice to prepare and provide for retirement.  Unfortunately, when we reach retirement the State wants to chop its piece out of it.</p>  <p>  I can see the following problem.  The State has talked about getting everyone to have their own private pension.  If the State is doing what we have outlined, it will be very difficult to convince a person that he or she will benefit down the line.  A person will think that if one provides one's own pension the State will take a lump of it when one reaches 66 or 67 years.  With regard to the pension levy, a lot of us have AVCs but the State has taken a lump sum out of it over four years.  That situation will have a negative impact on us as well.  In one sense the Government encourages people to provide for their retirement.  Unfortunately, when people follow its advice they discover that having a pension works against them.  As a result, one is left wondering, "Why bother?".</p></speech>

The European Union&rsquo;s external aviation policy has developed gradually, particularly over the past decade since the European Court&rsquo;s so-called open skies ruling in 2002.  This ruling clarified that the European Union had legal competency in some matters relating to the Union&rsquo;s external aviation relations.  In particular the ruling has allowed the Union to negotiate a range of EU aviation agreements with third countries since 2002.</p> <p>The provisions of such agreements prevail over the relevant provisions of any existing bilateral air services agreements between individual member states and these countries.  Ireland has always been supportive of the European policy of negotiating such agreements with neighbouring countries.  The D&aacute;il has approved the terms of a number of very similar agreements in the past, such as the EU aviation agreements with the United States, Israel and the Balkan countries. </p> <p> The agreements with Canada, Georgia, Moldova and Jordan were negotiated over a number of years and were signed between 2010 and 2012.  The agreements have been applied provisionally since signature pending full ratification by all 28 member states of the EU, which can take several years to complete.  The European Commission led the negotiations leading to the four agreements and consulted with stakeholders throughout the process, including the member states, airlines, airports, and labour organisations.</p> <p> Ireland is among a number of member states that still have to complete domestic procedures to allow the agreements to be fully ratified.  The purpose of the D&aacute;il motion is to allow the Government proceed with such ratification as soon as possible.  The agreements are largely based on existing European aviation law that is already in force in Ireland.  For this reason no additional Irish legislation is required to allow Ireland ratify the agreements.  For administrative efficiency and to minimise the D&aacute;il time required, D&aacute;il approval is being sought for all four agreements in one motion. </p> <p> International aviation agreements generally follow a prescribed format and these EU agreements are no different in that regard.  The four agreements are quite similar in content.  The main issues that the agreements provide for are as follows: market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity, on a reciprocal basis; promoting regulatory co-operation in the field of aviation; promoting air services based on competition among air carriers with minimum government interference and regulation; and promoting non-discrimination and a level playing field for air operators.</p> <p> The agreement with Canada is by far the most significant for Ireland.  The development of the market for air services between Ireland and Canada since the agreement was signed is a good example of how such agreements stimulate growth and facilitate competition in the market.  In 2014 Aer Lingus launched direct services to Canada for the first time since the 1970s.  In addition, three Canadian airlines now operate direct scheduled services between the two countries &ndash; Air Canada Rouge, Air Transat and Westjet.  Westjet, is a successful low-cost Canadian airline and the seasonal service it launched to Ireland in 2014 is the airline&rsquo;s first transatlantic route.  This new choice of routes and airlines is obviously of huge benefit for tourism and trade, and also the many Irish emigrants in Canada.</p> <p> In the case of the other three countries, there are only very limited direct services to and from Ireland.  Air Moldova operates a seasonal service between Moldova and Ireland, but there are currently no direct routes between Ireland and Jordan or Georgia.  However, even without direct services to or from Ireland, the agreements with these countries can still be beneficial to Irish airlines, as they allow Irish airlines to freely operate services to these countries from any EU member state. </p> <p> All four agreements are mixed competency agreements.  This means that as well as the EU being a party to the agreements, Ireland and the other EU member states are also parties in their own right.  Hence the need for all member states to ratify the agreements individually. </p> <p> There is a standard clause in EU aviation agreements dealing with dispute resolution procedures.  This stipulates that the expenses of any arbitration under the clause will be shared between all the parties, including Ireland.  Such arbitration expenses arise very rarely under such agreements and in any case such expenses would not be high.  Nonetheless, this clause of the agreements is deemed to create a potential charge on public funds and this is one of the reasons the approval of the D&aacute;il is required under Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution.</p> <p> I avail of the opportunity to give the committee a short update on national aviation policy.  As an island nation, aviation plays a crucial role in Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  It is essential for our tourism industry, for our trading relationships and fundamental for connecting Ireland with the rest of the world.  We are far more dependent on aviation than many of our continental neighbours and trading partners.  This is why I believe it is so important to provide an appropriate policy framework within which the sector can continue to develop and grow to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  With this in mind, a new national aviation policy has been under preparation and is close to finalisation.  I intend to publish the new policy document in the near future.  This will address all aspects of aviation policy from safety, security and economic regulation, to competition and connectivity issues.  It will reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s support for the EU external aviation policy and for EU aviation agreements such as the ones before the committee today.</p> <p> I thank the Chairman for his time.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his presentation.  While these agreements are being updated and accepting their existence, is there any potential benefit other than what we are already gaining from them from Ireland's perspective?  As a new Minister in the Department perhaps he would take a look at our relationship with the various states outside Europe to see whether there is potential for future business in any of those regions?  Obviously it would be a matter for individual airlines to exploit any potential commercial interest.  Notwithstanding that, with his tourism hat on, is there anything more we could do in terms of the Canadian market in particular?  From a tourism point of view a great deal of effort has gone into the Asian market in recent years.  Are there any other benefits we may be able to gain for the State arising from those European agreements?</p></speech>

Canada is the most important in terms of these agreements.  Does Ireland conduct an audit of all the countries where we are not up to speed in regard to agreements and particularly the countries with which we trade most?  Is any country being left outside the loop from an EU point of view and from Ireland's point of view?  The Minister mentioned that he is drawing up a new national aviation policy and, obviously, that will come before the committee for debate.  However, we need to get it well in advance in order that we can study it.  Given the way aviation is moving, the new aviation policy is very important.  As markets are opening up across the world, is Ireland targeting specific countries with which we want to conclude new agreements?  When the issue arises at EU level, do we make suggestions about different countries with which we would like to conclude agreements or do we have an input?</p></speech>

In that context our national carrier especially in terms of the development of further transatlantic routes out of Dublin and Shannon is of huge importance to the economy.  There has been much recent commentary on a possible sale of a Government stake in Aer Lingus.  The Minister referred to the development of North American markets and routes, and that the Government is mindful of the connectivity between Shannon, New York, Boston and the greater North American continent but even more particularly the connectivity between Shannon and London and onwards into the far East, Asia and such places.  There is much comment in regard to what would happen in the event of any proposed sale of the Government stake.</p> <p>Certainly in my region, we ask for an assurance that any action taken is based on the greatest possible due diligence.  The perception is that it did not happen last time.</p></speech>

Deputy Dooley asked about our plans to make the most of our agreement with Canada.  This was also referred to by Deputy Ellis.  This is a good example of the importance of finding common ground between the transport and tourism parts of my Department.  One of the most important insights I have had from my role pertains to the fundamental importance of aviation policy to tourism, not to mention the broader area of foreign direct investment and our ability to develop as a trading country.  Tourism Ireland has prepared a marketing plan specifically for Canada, which I launched just before Christmas.  Its marketing plans and funds are aimed specifically at what it wants to achieve from the Canadian market.  Our tourist figures from the Canadian market are doing well but we believe they can do even better in future.  The fact that we have seen an increase in the number of visitors from Canada shows how the two can come together.  With the passage of this agreement through the D&aacute;il, I hope it will provide a foundation on which access can be improved in the future.</p>  <p>  In regard to the point raised by Deputy Ellis on the audit of other countries and the role we might play when the European Union seeks to open negotiations, the decision on the parties with which to enter discussions is primarily led by the European Commission.  It is currently involved in discussions with Australia and Brazil in regard to the further agreements that might be reached.  The people who are best aware of the possible opportunities in this regard are those who run our airports.  I refer members to the work done by the airports to develop access to other destinations, and the successes and setbacks they have encountered.  My Department supports the airports in that work, and the Irish Aviation Authority is also aware of it.  In terms of making the most of our access to new routes, that can be achieved by co-operation between our airports, my Department and Tourism Ireland.  I have been impressed by the extent of co-operation to date.  The work that has been done in Canada is a clear example of such co-operation.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Donovan raised the issue of slots at Shannon Airport.  Last night I responded to a Topical Issue matter tabled by Deputy Dooley and others on the issue.  I am limited in what I can say at present because the Irish Takeover Panel has deemed this to be a takeover period.  As a representative of a shareholder in the Aer Lingus company, I am limited in what I can say for fear of being seen to be playing a role in influencing the share price.  As I pointed out in the D&aacute;il last night, the kinds of issues raised in previous takeover bids for Aer Lingus included connectivity, competition, bases and brand development, as well as the value of shares in the company.  It is fair to assume these criteria would be uppermost for the Government in its evaluation of what may happen in the future.  At this point in time, however, a formal takeover bid has not been received by the board of Aer Lingus.</p>  <p>  Deputy McCarthy asked about the development of Cork Airport.  I assume he is referring to recent changes in the passenger figures in and out of the airport.  The body with direct operational responsibility for Cork Airport is the DAA and it has been engaging directly with the airport to support its business.  I expect the DAA to develop plans to respond to the issues arising, and I would be happy to reply in more detail to any questions the Deputy might care to raise in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

The PSO was removed and no carrier is willing to fly to the airport in its absence.  People in Galway also consider Shannon as a local airport and its flights to Heathrow make it an important hub for the west of Ireland.  I acknowledge that the Minister is constrained in what he can say but does he have the power to use our shareholding in Aer Lingus to make it a condition of sale that the slots in Shannon cannot be disposed of?  We have a minority shareholding of 25%.  Is that sufficient to give the Minister power to block the sale of the slots?</p></speech>

Perhaps it would be useful if I rehearsed the comments I made to the D&aacute;il last night in regard to any potential disposal of Heathrow slots.  I stated:</p><blockquote>A specific mechanism was built into the company's memorandum and articles of association whereby any proposal for the disposal of slots over which the airline had rights at the time of listing on the Stock Exchange may be subject to a requirement for a resolution approved by shareholders voting at an extraordinary general meeting, EGM.  Where a resolution by shareholders is called for, the voting threshold to prevent a disposal of slots proposed by the company is such that the percentage vote against disposal at the EGM must be greater than the percentage of the company's shares held by the Minister for Finance plus 5%, or 25% if greater.  The ability of the State's shareholding to block a disposal of slots is not guaranteed under this mechanism, as the support of at least another 5% of shareholders is required.  This mechanism also relates only to a proposed disposal of slots.  Aer Lingus does not require any shareholder approval to change the routes for which it uses the slots.</blockquote></speech>

The direct answer to the Chairman's question is that we can and do negotiate bilateral agreements.  I could give a number of examples of the importance of that.  One of the factors that any general business involved in aviation, such as aircraft leasing, would point to when asked why Ireland is such a strong location to do business in is the breadth of treaties we have negotiated with other countries.  We have the ability to do it, we can do it and we have already done it.  We have a very extensive suite of arrangements in place, but the European Union has the competency to develop those relationships with other countries, which we then ratify through this.  I hope it will give a further spur to the development of markets such as Canada, to which we already have access.  Regarding the other countries referred to in the motion, if the demand is there, it would enable the development of routes and access to those.</p></speech>

Members will recall that on 3 December, we met officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners regarding this matter in order to establish how the scourge of fuel fraud, particularly petrol stretching or fuel contamination, might be satisfactorily addressed.<br />On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Kevin Thompson, CEO, and Mr. Michael Horan from Insurance Ireland and, from the Consumers Association of Ireland, Mr. Dermott Jewell and Mr. Raymond O'Rourke.  I wish to draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise them that any submission or opening statement they make to the committee will be published on our website after the meeting.<br />Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I invite Mr. Thompson to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I will make a brief presentation, the first part of which outlines Insurance Ireland's background so as to set out the context of who we are and what we do.  The second part comprises a brief statement on insurance and the issue of petrol stretching.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland is the leading voice of insurance in Ireland, representing 95% of domestic insurance companies and 85% of international life assurance companies.  Insurance Ireland members pay out on behalf of our customers &euro;5.4 billion claims each year to Irish consumers and contribute more than &euro;1.6 billion in taxes to the Exchequer annually.  We also employ more than 27,000 people.  Motor claims exceeded &euro;1 billion in 2013 with approximately 235,000 motor claims.</p>  <p>  There are 16 motor insurers in the market.  Damage to cars arising from petrol stretching is generally covered by comprehensive motor insurance policies, but it is not covered under third party, fire or theft policies.  Insurance Ireland members have settled approximately 600 motor claims resulting from petrol stretching, with an additional 250 claims being validated in the pipeline.  Our members have seen a decrease in notifications of damages claims due to petrol stretching in the past two months.  Policyholders who have suffered damage should check the full extent of their policies and contact their insurers directly or, where appropriate, via their intermediaries.</p>  <p>  This is a concise statement of how we view the position of insurance in terms of petrol stretching.  I am more than happy to take questions from the committee on the issue.  I am  joined by Mr. Horan, our general insurance claims manager.</p></speech>

We are pleased to be present and appreciate the opportunity to contribute on what is a significant, serious and detrimental issue for many consumers and citizens.  I am joined by our chairperson, Mr. O'Rourke.  While we have not received a large number of complaints, we have received a significant number of inquiries from consumers frustrated over whom they should approach to find recompense for or resolution to problems that they subsequently found owed to petrol stretching.  The difficulty is that while there is a good degree of anecdotal evidence relating to numbers and areas, predominantly along the Border and in Mayo and Galway, we are receiving inquiries from other pockets around the country, which is confusing.  We have been relying too much on anecdotal evidence.  I understand doing this to some degree, but Revenue, Customs and Excise and the Garda are also involved.  As of December 2014, the Garda still had 308 official complaints open in respect of this issue.  In view of this it is possible to see how ascertaining greater detail will probably happen in time.</p>  <p>  The average cost to a consumer is in the region of &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,000, but more in some cases of which we have heard, and a small number of cases are outside the insurance coverage that has been suggested at this meeting.  This amounts to a consumer loss of more than &euro;1.5 million, which is significant.</p>  <p>  In terms of consumer protection, consumers generally find themselves supported by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980.  Unfortunately, the Act is not being applied in this instance because the consumers cannot find a degree of appreciation of the proof they are able to provide regarding where and from whom they purchased the product because the seller often refuses to discuss the issue with them.  As consumers, this immediately puts them on the back foot.  Their consumer rights are denied, so they must predominantly take civil actions to find recompense via the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Garda or the Revenue Commissioners.  That is a problem.</p>  <p>  While a number of claims have been supported by the insurance industry, an increasing number of providers seem to be exiting that level of cover.  It is important to note that when consumers purchase second-hand vehicles, they are sold a warranty form of insurance.  Such warranties now put fuel contamination outside their range of cover.  This is a significant move.</p>  <p>  Motorists contribute significantly to the Exchequer, including the job creation measures for which its funds are used.  For example, they pay VAT on servicing.</p> <p>Somewhat frustratingly, they contribute a significant amount of tax in the level and amount of fuel they purchase.  Despite all of that, and all of the protections we provide positively for consumers, many of them have nothing to rely on in this situation.  That is why we need to hear significantly from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue about what is being achieved.  More importantly, we need to learn lessons from the fall-out from this episode.  We have made a number of suggestions to that end.  Perhaps a test case or a number of test cases might be put through the Small Claims Court.  The problem there is the &euro;2,000 limit.  It might be worth a test.  In addition, we think the burden of proof could be reversed to require the providers of the fuel to prove their fuel is not contaminated on day one.  Initiatives could be put in place to measure that on a regular basis, perhaps monthly.  On the basis of the detriment to many consumers, the industry could be asked to consider putting in place a fund.  This could be done directly from the distribution sector of the industry with no burden on the consumer.  This fund could be set up to try to mitigate in some way these costs and losses to consumers.</p></speech>

We have had a number of hearings and meetings on this issue.  All public representatives have spoken to consumers who are affected by it on many occasions.  I spoke to a number of them this morning.  They are left out at the moment.  That is the problem.  Mr. Jewell has suggested that a fund could be established to compensate consumers.  Would that be done by the Government, the insurance federation or the industry?  Could Mr. Jewell outline what he has in mind in a little more detail?  He also suggested that a consumer could bring a case to the Small Claims Court.  Who would the consumer be claiming against?</p>  <p>  I understand there are two types of insurance.  Every motorist is insured.  Mr. Thompson made it clear this kind of damage is not covered by third party insurance but is covered by comprehensive insurance.  Does the claimant in one of these cases always lose his or her no-claims bonus?  Perhaps it depends on the particular policy.  Is there an excess payment?  Does it depend on the small print of the policy? I understand that fuel stations have public liability insurance.  I understand from what I have heard anecdotally that payments have been made on the basis of some of the service stations' public liability insurance.  Could Mr. Thompson clarify whether that has happened?  Is there some possibility of redress there?  It was alleged at an early stage that insurers had removed coverage for fuel contamination from certain policies, including the policies of some people with comprehensive insurance.  Is that a fact?  If it happened, were the premiums reduced to reflect the decrease in cover?  I apologise for hitting Mr. Thompson with so many questions.  I am trying to be precise.  I know members have many questions as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.1289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Thompson" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015012100004#H00300"><p>I can look to answer them in order.  I reiterate that petrol stretching would not be covered under third party, fire or theft policies.  The effect of a claim for fuel stretching on a person's no-claims discount would ultimately depend on the type of policy he or she has.  Some people pay a tiny amount in addition to their comprehensive policy premiums to enjoy the benefit of having their no-claims discounts protected.  In such cases, they do not lose their no-claims discounts.  In other cases, depending on the terms and conditions of the policy, when a claim is made the policy holder has to take a step back in terms of the no-claims discount that is allowed against his or her premium.</p>  <p>  I was asked whether insurers have removed coverage or taken steps to exclude this from policies.  We have seen no evidence of that.  The only thing I would say in general terms is that we have 16 carriers operating within the market.  They generally compete on price, product offering and customer service.  The market dynamics ultimately dictate what they do and do not offer.  If a certain provider decides to exclude this type of coverage, that might place the provider at a competitive disadvantage by comparison with other providers.  Market forces will dictate what happens.  We have no hard facts on the public liability aspect of this issue.  Like the Chairman, we understand anecdotally that a limited number of claims have been paid under public liability from petrol stations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.1290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermott Jewell" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015012100004#H00400"><p>The fund I have proposed would be very similar to the fund that provides for the activity of the Financial Services Ombudsman, for example.  The costs of the fund would be met by the provider.  That means it would be paid for by one or more of the distributors, the garage owners and the station owners.  They would contribute to a fund on an annual basis on the basis of their turnover.  This money would probably be collected by Revenue.  This kind of approach has been proven to work and operate in a number of areas.</p>  <p>  The position of the consumer with regard to the Small Claims Court is always that he or she has a contract with the person to whom he or she paid the money.  Any time a consumer takes a claim in the Small Claims Court, it is taken against the individual to whom he or she paid the money.  In this case, it would be the owner of the petrol station where he or she purchased the fuel, as long as he or she has proof of this.  That is why I said that a number of test cases could comfortably facilitate some learning in how this might work.  A consumer who takes such a case might have to take a reduced hit.  As I said, we have not heard anecdotally about anyone whose loss was as low as &euro;2,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-01-21a.1291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015012100004#H00500"><p>I welcome both presentations.  We often get very long and windy presentations.  That is not to cast aspersions on anyone who has been before us today.  Both speakers have been succinct and helpful.  Mr. Thompson has set out what the insurance industry has done in regard to this matter.  He has indicated that approximately 600 claims have been paid.  That is very good news if it is the case.  It is not borne out by the anecdotal information I am getting.  A number of people have indicated to me that they are having real difficulties with their insurance providers.  I do not know whether that is another matter, nor do I know if there are issues around the validity of the case, etc.  It is very difficult to talk in isolation.  I am merely putting it on the record that the anecdotal information available to me suggests that quite a few people are having ongoing difficulties with their insurance companies.  I accept that there are different exclusions on policies and all of that.  I would like Insurance Ireland to follow up this meeting of the committee by seeking information from its members so that we can ascertain how many cases are currently pending where there is some dispute, or where the insurance companies have refused the claim.  That would give us a better understanding of the overall extent of the problem that exists.</p>  <p>  There is a concern that when an issue like this arises for an insurance company, we quickly start to see exclusions on policies that make it impossible to insure against it.  I do not think that would be the best way to go in this case.  It is a difficult situation for consumers, particularly those who purchase or have purchased relatively new cars.  As Mr. Thompson knows, the impact of a change of engine on the value of a new car is between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000, depending on the vehicle concerned.  It is completely outside the control of the person concerned.  That is the insurance side.  Perhaps Mr. Thompson can come back to us with details of the full extent of the problem and let us know if there are any developments coming down the track in regard to the exclusion of these matters from insurance policies.</p>  <p>  Mr. Jewell also made a very straightforward presentation.  I like his recommendations.  I will propose to the committee that rather than merely giving people an opportunity to come and say what they think, it should make some recommendations on foot of the work it has done on this issue that might ultimately find their way into legislation.</p> <p> A compensation fund exists in other areas.  It is administered by the industry but with the backing of legislation.  Mr. Thompson will be familiar with it regarding the insurance company and how that works, or perhaps how it does not work from a consumer point of view.  I believe the industry will have to do much more, and that will be part of any recommendations I will put forward.  Mr. Jewell touched on that when he spoke about monitoring and putting a much greater onus on the person who is selling the product to stand over it.  It becomes very difficult from a traceability point of view to prove that it was at the last station one got the fuel that caused the damage.  Notwithstanding that, there is a tolerable level of contaminant allowed generally in fuel because water leaks into underground tanks and so on but the State will have to become much more prescriptive about the quality of the fuel sold and the industry, in terms of the distribution, will have to stand over the product to a much greater extent.</p> <p> This should not be an impossibility, particularly regarding the consolidation that has taken place in forecourt ownership across the State.  There are now two or three big operators while the small independents are very much a thing of the past.  There are some but the bigger conglomerates are pricing them out of the market and they are operating only in small areas.  With that consolidation there is space for a much greater legislative approach and ensuring that the industry stands over the validity of its product and therefore eliminates, to the greatest extent possible, the risk of contamination occurring.  When it does occur I would have thought that will help the insurance industry to ensure it does not have to go down the road of exclusions on policies.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

In terms of insurance, if they want paperwork to verify that people who have comprehensive insurance have been sneakily done out of this money because of the small print, I will give it to them in a few minutes.  I have dealt with people with comprehensive insurance who thought they were covered for everything but who today are left with bills they cannot afford to pay.</p>  <p>  We need to examine the entire insurance industry.  Some insurance companies are pricing lower but when one reads the small print they are not offering the same cover.  That is wrong because there are people, especially in the west, who have lost two cars and cannot afford to repair them.  The way the insurance industry has handled that is disgusting.</p>  <p>  We are trying to find a needle in a haystack.  We talk about solving this problem. Revenue cannot solve it.  Cars travel from filling station to filling station.  We talk about taking people to court but one has to be able to prove where one got every drop of petrol.  It is almost a non-runner.  We should face up to these facts.</p>  <p>  I have written letters to the Department of Finance, the insurance companies and everyone I could think of but they all say it is not their problem and that I should try someone else.  Someone has to face up to this reality and if the insurance companies are to be honourable, especially with the people who have comprehensive insurance, they should stand up and be counted on this issue.  They should forget about the clause in the small print that has caught out these people.  I urge the witnesses to do that.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses.  To follow up on what Deputy Fitzmaurice said, I have had the same experience.  I was surprised to hear that 600 claims were settled because that is not the reality in terms of the few people who have contacted me.  The most recent case is a neighbour who has no idea where he got the petrol because as Deputy Fitzmaurice said, he moves around but he knows the problem has to do with petrol stretching.  The insurance company sent the adjustor to see him but the adjuster ruled it out and said it was not covered.</p></speech>

Chapter 7 of that code is explicit and I would argue strongly that our members follow that to the letter in the interests of the consumer.</p>  <p>  Part of that consumer protection code highlights that a regulated entity must endeavour to verify and validate a claim received from a claimant prior to making a decision on its outcome.  There is a duty on insurers, therefore, to make sure we pay valid claims, and that we verify that claims are valid.  We sympathise with the consumers who have been affected by this petrol stretching issue but we have an obligation to make sure that we validate claims in a correct manner.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific examples the members got from their constituents, I can only stand by the figures we have been given, and those figures are correct.  We have surveyed our members.  We have paid 600 claims.  I come back to my earlier comment in respect of the way our members compete and how the market is different.  Different policies will have different levels of cover-----</p></speech>

As I said, people often look for their insurance product in terms of price.  They should look beyond price.  They should look at price, the service that is provided by the insurer and what they are actually getting for that price.  That is how the market works.</p>  <p>  Where people have comprehensive cover, we have surveyed our members and we know that 600 have been paid and 250 are in the pipeline.  We will come back to the members and give them the figures in respect of the numbers that have been declined but in terms of declinatures, our members will have received claims in regard to that but ultimately they are third party policies.  We cannot do that.  That would be flagged as a decline, so there would be elements behind that.  We will come back on that.</p></speech>

What we really want to know are the reasons those with comprehensive cover were declined.</p></speech>

Effectively, it is an analysis of the 600 claims.  If we have evidence that some comprehensive insurance claims have not been paid it is important that the witnesses would provide us with that detail so that we can get further information.  They can do that through the clerk to allow us circulate it to members.</p></speech>

On the insurance side, I have attended public meetings and we have had representatives of the Revenue Commissioners here on this issue.  Many people have fallen between two stools and they have described the cost of repairing one or even two vehicles but we should be clear about the messages we send to people, and that includes the representatives present from the insurance industry.  As politicians we often say that the insurance company should be doing this but some of the conversations I have heard at public meetings are misleading people because they give the impression that the company will cover a policy even where there is an exclusion clause, the cover is third party only or there is some other reason people are not covered.  Yet, it must be clearly specified as an item of cover within the policy for the company to provide cover.  That is the reality.</p>  <p>  In some instances the insurance company is doing what it is legally entitled to do.  My issue is where insurance companies have been dragging their heels for months and not making a call on whether they will indemnify under a policy where it has been established that petrol stretching took place.  I am aware of such cases and I believe it is wrong.  We have to accept that the insurance company is within its legal rights to make a call on a policy but when we go beyond that we are talking about a fund to which they may contribute, such as the uninsured motorists' fund.</p> <p>Every time we have a conservation, no more than the conservation we have had with the Revenue Commissioners telling us that they are testing fuel, and so on, it gives people hope that something will come out of the investigations.  We know there are huge problems in respect of petrol stretching.  It is also an issue for the Consumers Association of Ireland.  </p> <p> It would seem that Customs and Excise has paper trails, but it does not have forensic evidence.  The damage happens after the fact.  The issue is a matter of quality control.  We need to be clear about the fund that is mooted.  Will it be a one off sum of money to deal with petrol stretching for a defined period?.  Is it envisaged that it will be generated from a levy on insurance policies?  I would like to think that consumers should be able to buy petrol at a forecourt, without discovering months later that their engine has been destroyed.  There is no evidence that the petrol has been tampered with because of the time-lag in the discovery of the damage to the engine.  Clearly the problem is that there is no evidence.</p> <p> There needs to be quality control.  The problem does not begin at the filling stations as I suggest the money is made by the distributors.  It is in the distributors' interest that there is consumer confidence in the product.  Consumers face a crisis in confidence in where they can buy fuel.  That is a very strange scenario in our consumer driven society - that people cannot be assured of the quality of a product.  </p> <p> How much engagement have people had with the organisation?  How many people have not been compensated?  The issue of public liability was raised.  Clearly motorists are going to their insurers and asking them to pay out on their individual insurance policy.  The problem is with the product sold by the retailer but it could be caused further up the supply chain.  It is important that we establish how many people have been compensated under the filling station's  public liability insurance.  An impression was given previously that things would be put right under their insurance.  We know that there is a requirement to provide evidence to claim under any insurance policy.  Clearly, there is a lack of evidence.</p> <p> People have been left high and dry.  There are false dawns about what we can do, when notwithstanding all the investigations that have gone on, it would be very difficult for anybody to pursue this in a court of law, owing to lack of evidence and problems with the chain of evidence. </p> <p> We must be very clear about what can be done and how this problem will be dealt with in the future.  At a previous meeting with the Revenue Commissioners I suggested we should have an independent body, funded by the distributors, responsible for quality control, in order that in the future people can be assured of the quality of the fuel.  The representative of the Consumers Association of Ireland suggested that consideration be given to the establishment of a fund to be created from levies paid directly by the industry and from which compensation can be managed and paid.  Is he suggesting a once-off fund or the creation of a fund going forward?  I presume he is not suggesting a fund going forward because this is an issue that we clearly have to hit on the head.</p></speech>

I suggest the creation of a once-off fund, as is needed currently to deal with this problem.  In response to one of the Deputy's questions on how many cases are involved, I will not lie as I do not know the answer.  The problem is that there is no significant evidence or detail of exactly how many people are at a loss but I know, as I mentioned earlier, that from the small number of approximately 300 people who are officially listed with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the damage runs in the  region of &euro;1.25 million to &euro;1.5 million.  Those people need to access some fund.</p>  <p>  One of the problems is that there are always terms and conditions.  The burden of proof needs to be reversed in this situation.  The burden of proof must be placed on the petrol distribution companies and the garages so that they must prove that they did not sell contaminated petrol.  Most importantly, if we are to look at an insurance product, as a consumer I would never have thought I needed to ask an insurance company whether I would be covered in the event of fuel contamination.  It would never have entered my mind that it might happen.  That is the problem.</p></speech>
