    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Ryan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100003#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend this morning.  I am joined today by colleagues from Enterprise Ireland who are present to assist the work of the committee.  In presenting the annual report and accounts for 2011, I will briefly outline the key results achieved.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland's mission is to partner with entrepreneurs, Irish businesses, and the research and investment communities to develop Ireland's international trade, innovation, leadership, and competitiveness.  The ultimate objective is increased employment and prosperity in Ireland.  The companies we work with are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland.</p><p>  To help our clients achieve growth, Enterprise Ireland uses a holistic developmental approach and engages client companies across all aspects of the value chain.  I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the contribution of the staff of Enterprise Ireland, both at home and overseas, in delivering on the objectives of the agency.</p><p>  While it is understood that the focus of the committee's session is on the Enterprise Ireland annual report and accounts for 2011, it is appreciated that members will also be keenly interested in developments during 2012.  To this end, summary updates have been provided throughout the briefing document provided to committee members in advance of today's meeting.</p><p>  Despite operating in a very challenging domestic market and in highly competitive international markets, our client companies put in an exceptionally resilient performance in 2011 following three consecutive years of decline.  At the end of that year, total employment by Enterprise Ireland clients stood at 162,692, made up of 141,228 in full-time employment and 21,464 in part-time positions.  In 2012, total employment in our client companies increased to 169,451, with 145,460 full-time jobs and 23,991 part-time positions.  During 2012, the Action Plan for Jobs was launched, containing over 270 individual actions to be delivered.  Enterprise Ireland had responsibility for more than 100 of these actions and we delivered the bulk of the actions assigned to us in the action plan in full and on time.</p><p>  In Enterprise Ireland we understand that in a small economy, exports sustain and create jobs.  The stabilisation of employment in our client companies in 2011 was supported by buoyant international sales.  With total exports reaching &euro;15.2 billion, our clients exported more in 2011 than at any time in the history of the State.  The support and promotion of in-company research and development and innovation, as well as collaborative innovation with others, is central to our clients' continued success.  Innovation is at the heart of all entrepreneurship, be it in a high-growth-potential start-up company turning knowledge into solutions or in established companies that are constantly improving their products and processes and thus their ability to compete and win sales overseas.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland's annual accounts for 2011 were signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 7 June 2012.  As our annual report demonstrates, we support companies both directly, through the provision of financial supports and non-financial support through our client support network, and indirectly, by helping to build a wider enterprise infrastructure through our work with the seed and venture capital community and the banks as well as our work with the research community.  The total budget available to Enterprise Ireland in 2011 was &euro;336 million.  This can be broken down as set out in table 1 of the briefing statement previously provided.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland client companies, located in every county, continue to make a substantial economic impact at a critical time in the State.  At Enterprise Ireland we are keenly focused on our ongoing mission to support companies and support employment creation.  We aim to move forward into 2013 with the objective of playing a central role in the implementation of the 2013 action plan, which will be published shortly.  Notwithstanding progress made during 2011 and 2012, Enterprise Ireland-supported companies will have to increase their scale significantly in the future if they are to continue to win out against global competition.  In this regard, access to finance to fund export growth will be a key determinant of success, as will the composition of the senior management teams and the leadership and ambition of the boards of emerging Irish companies.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andy Harkness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100004#L00200"><p>In respect of Enterprise Ireland's financial statement for 2011, which is the subject of today's discussion, I will outline some of the key figures to the committee.  The accounts show income of &euro;343 million and expenditure of &euro;309 million.  A clear audited opinion was issued in respect of those financial statements.  The agency's activities are mainly funded by the Exchequer, with the bulk of funding from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Vote.  Enterprise Ireland also generates income from profits on disposals of investments and seed and venture capital funds.  The agency repaid &euro;34 million to the Exchequer in respect of 2011.  This money was raised mainly from the sale of investments in client companies.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland's objectives include the provision of support for the development of Irish enterprises trading in world markets.  Expenditure in 2011 was in four main areas.  The agency provided direct financial support to companies in the form of grants and equity investments.  In 2011, &euro;59 million was provided by way of grants, an additional &euro;57 million was provided through investment in shares and seed and venture capital funds.</p><p>  &euro;97 million was spent on developing science and technology.  Approximately three quarters of the latter funding went towards developing industry collaboration with third level education bodies and realising the commercial potential of research, and the remainder was used to develop internal research and development activity in companies.</p><p>  Since 2008 Enterprise Ireland has had overall operational responsibility for the 35 county and city enterprise boards.  In 2011 it provided a total of &euro;32.7 million to the boards.  The committee will be aware that, as part of the rationalisation of public bodies, the Government plans to replace the boards with a new network of local enterprise offices.</p><p>  The agency's administration, operation and promotion costs in 2011 amounted to &euro;89 million, which was just under 30% of total expenditure.  This related to providing services and non-financial supports to Enterprise Ireland's clients, such as the client services network, and corporate services costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100004#L00300"><p>I thank Mr. Ryan and his colleagues for attending this meeting.  I thank the staff of Enterprise Ireland for the tremendous work they have done over the past several years as we attempt to rebuild and recreate our economy.  The statistics and information contained in the annual report and accounts for 2011 make it clear that the economy is being repositioned from people selling houses and property to each other to Irish companies selling their wares abroad.  Great credit must go to Enterprise Ireland and its staff for their success in recent years.  The &euro;15.2 billion exported by client companies in 2011 was more than the pre-recession amounts in 2008.  Equally, new export sales from Irish client companies, at &euro;2.4 billion in 2011, was the highest ever level of gain.  I also pay tribute to the agency's efforts to link with businesses and expositions.  I recently attended the Showcase expo in the RDS, where the engagement of Enterprise Ireland with what have traditionally been small local businesses involved in craft production was very encouraging.  The agency spoke to these business about the potential for their wares to be promoted on the global stage.</p><p>  However, a number of questions need to be addressed in order to establish that everything is going well and to find out if there is anything that can be improved.  Given our dependence on Enterprise Ireland to deliver, we need to be careful that complacency does not set in.  In reading the annual report I was struck by the figures with regard to the cost of creating a job.  The cost per job was &euro;11,761 between 1996 and 2002; &euro;4,385 between 2000 and 2006; and &euro;12,024 between 2005 and 2011.  The first question that springs to mind when looking at these figures from a remove is why has it become more expensive to create a job.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Ryan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100004#L00400"><p>I will ask Mr. Hopkins to address that question and provide some background to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Hopkins" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100004#L00500"><p>The cost per job is calculated by Forf&aacute;s and the same formula is applied to IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.  The calculation takes account of all costs associated with grant-giving, as well as income received from sale and disposal of investments over that seven-year rolling period.  This compares with the number of jobs created and sustained until the year in question.  The current year figure of &euro;12,024 applies in respect of 2011.  The low cost per job between 2004 and 2007 was due to substantial own-resource income in 2000 and 2001.  That was a mitigating factor in reducing the cost per job during that period.  Since then we have been earning income from the sale and disposal of investments but not to the same extent as during those years.</p><p>  As part of our investment strategy we are examining the cost per job with each investment we make.  That is an important factor when we decide how to support a company.  We want to make the investment at the lowest cost per job possible but we must be mindful of the state of the individual company and how it is operating so that the support we offer meets its needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100004#L00600"><p>That is a useful clarification.  The Action Plan for Jobs has played an important role in keeping State agencies focused on creating jobs.  Enterprise Ireland is responsible for approximately 100 of the 270 actions in the plan, which is a significant proportion.  How many of the 100 actions have been ticked off as done and what were the most important ones this year?  One can only imagine the pressure that will result in any organisation given 100 new tasks to complete in a year.  How did the agency deal with this pressure on its resources?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Ryan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100004#L00700"><p>I hope Deputy Harris will find this helpful.  The Action Plan for Jobs contained more than 270 individual actions to be delivered in 2012, spanning all Departments and 36 State agencies.  The 270 actions were broken down into quarterly milestones.  Enterprise Ireland had responsibility for more than 100 of these actions, representing one third of the action programme.  Progress reports on the delivery of all milestones were published at the end of each quarter.  Details of all actions delivered are available in these progress reports from the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The fourth progress report is due to be published shortly and will outline a number of actions which Enterprise Ireland concluded in the last quarter of the year.</p><p>  A number of significant objectives were realised, including the launch of the second call of the innovation fund for Ireland, the development capital funds, support for a record number of high-potential start-ups, the establishment of technology centres such as in cloud computing and support for more than 200 significant company projects involving investments of more than &euro;500,000.  Enterprise Ireland delivered in full and on time the vast majority of the more than 100 actions assigned to it by the action plan.  The precise amount was 97%.  We are, of course, operating in a challenging environment with regard to resources and I can provide details to the committee on the missing 3%.  We are looking forward to co-operating closely with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the implementation of the action plan for 2013.</p><p>  The actions have put an enormous strain on the resources of the agency.  Over the last 18 months, 217 staff out of a total of 742 have been reassigned to new duties in order to meet the demands of our client companies and the requirements under the action plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100004#L00800"><p>The annual report refers to Enterprise Ireland's 29 international offices.  A lot of the bodies that come before this committee, including the IDA and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, have international offices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Ryan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100005#M00200"><p>We have a network of offices overseas with 134.5 full-time equivalent staff.  Where EI has overseas offices, the objective is to maximise their effectiveness and they are co-located with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I welcome the opportunity to address this issue because there is a little disinformation going around.  Of our more than 20 overseas offices, 15 are currently co-located with an embassy or consulate, six are co-located with other Government agencies and the balance cannot be located beside an embassy.  For example, in Australia, our office is in Sydney, which is the business capital, but the government capital is Canberra and there is no reason for us to have an office there.  In Brazil, our office is in Sao Paulo but the government office is in Brasilia.  Our embassies are located in Canberra and Brasilia and it does not make sense, therefore, to have us located there.  In India, both ourselves and the IDA have a joint office in Mumbai, which is the business capital whereas the government capital is New Delhi.  There are business reasons for us not being co-located in a small number of countries but we are co-located in 15 countries.  The policy is clearly that first we co-locate with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade if possible.  Second, if we cannot do that, we co-locate with the IDA or other Government agencies.  It is only because of business demand that we have a small number of stand-alone offices overseas.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of resources earlier.  We have permission to have a full staff complement overseas of 149.5.  However, in recent months, we have been working with our parent Department and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and we have submitted a plan to increase our overseas representation by 20 posts.  These are people who would be employed in the field, not expatriates who would be sent from Ireland to these markets.  That plan has been endorsed by the Minister and it is currently awaiting consideration by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We believe there is an opportunity by 2015 for up to &euro;250 million in additional exports from this resource, which we estimate conservatively would create 1,200 jobs in Ireland.  We are strong in markets such as the UK, near Europe, Australia, Canada and United States but they are not the economies that are growing fastest now and, therefore, we have to be where the action is.  We have set out a plan that would see us put additional resources into Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, south east Asia, Korea, the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC - specifically, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman - Turkey and Japan.  We have to go where the business opportunity is now and we hope the Department will view the submission positively.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100005#M00300"><p>I am delighted to hear that.  The then Chinese Vice President visited last year and there were a number of reciprocal visits by our Ministers to China.  Has anything tangible happened since those visits in the context of exports?</p><p>  I am pleased EI is proactive in co-locating with our embassies in the first instance.  How do EI offices interact on a daily basis with our diplomatic missions in various countries?  What is the linkage, for example, between an ambassador and EI?  Are diplomats, many of whom do a wonderful job but who cost a great deal of money, maximising the service from the point of view of the economy as well as in the context of broader diplomatic issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Ryan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100005#M00400"><p>The visit of Vice President Xi Jinping changed everything in regard to China.  It is fair to say that prior to that visit not many Chinese people knew where Ireland was.  We have to deal with reality as well in EI.  It is probably one of the biggest coups the country has brought off in recent times.  He started out in the US and then travelled to Ireland and it was an enormous coup.  Many of our European partners would only have loved to have had that opportunity.  We had him in Ireland for three to four days, which gave us an enormous opportunity.  The press coverage of the visit in China was phenomenal.  There is a good chance if one mentions Ireland in China now, people know what one is talking about.  That is the degree of the step forward that has happened.  It is difficult for us in China because, traditionally, the Irish did not emigrate to that part of the world.  The Irish diaspora is not strong in China and, therefore, that recognition of such a visit is important to us.</p><p>  We are closely working with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to which we report on trade matters, and that is in great evidence in the context of the work of the export trade council, to which we also report.  Ambassador Declan Kelleher is Ireland's lead person in China.  He will shortly be replaced by Ambassador Paul Kavanagh from Paris.  There is an integrated plan for the top 25 countries in the world involving all the agencies, which is co-ordinated by the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Foreign Affairs and Trade and, therefore, the left hand knows exactly what the right hand is doing.  There are commitments and the ambassador is the lead person in overseeing and bringing that team together.  That is working increasingly well.  It is of huge benefit to our companies to help them to be introduced to the markets at the level of an ambassador, as it gives them increased credibility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100005#M00500"><p>Our exports grew by 5% in 2012, which was approximately twice the world average.  Clearly, we are doing well on that front but we need to have an honest discussion about what needs to be done going forward.  What are the main challenges facing Ireland's cost base as an exporting country?  Has EI identified skills or capacity gaps in the context of exporting?  If so, what needs to be done to address them?  We have heard about them from employers in the context of FDI and locating in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Ryan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100005#M00600"><p>With regard to the cost base, we are a developed economy now as opposed to a developing economy.  In a developing economy, the cost base would be tracked tightly while in a developed economy such as Ireland's innovation needs to be tracked because overseas buyers look at Ireland as a source of sophisticated products and services.  In the past, they would look to Germany, the UK, US, Japan and Switzerland for such products but Ireland is now on that list and, therefore, the companies making export gains worldwide are intellectual property, IP,  rich, highly innovative and dedicated to active research and development.  Innovation is making the difference in the numbers and the capability of the companies.   We are concerned about the cost base, particularly in manufacturing.  One of the things that happened in 2012 was our manufacturing base remained steady and we are keenly focused on that in the context of the lean manufacturing initiative on which we are working with our companies.  There is ground to be made up.  If a company is not efficient at home, it will not be efficient overseas.  We have to address efficiencies in the plants and we have continued to work with our companies on the lean manufacturing approach.</p> <p>In terms of the skills gaps, we would have exactly the same pressures IDA Ireland has in relation to the skills.  We would have vacancies currently in relation to computer science graduates, particularly software people who have five to eight years' experience.  We would have gaps in relation to semiconductor design engineers and we would have perhaps some gaps on the engineering side.  Perhaps it is a nice kind of problem to have to some extent, but what we have done in Enterprise Ireland is that we are setting up this year - at the start of it - a small skills unit within Enterprise Ireland to focus on the skill needs of our clients.  We are not in a position whereby we are supporting companies - we are actually financially supporting vacancies in concept as opposed to jobs.  We want the jobs to be filled when people get approval for jobs.</p><p> We are working closely with the Department of Education and Skills.  There has been a very good reaction from that Department in relation to the conversion courses for people who had considerable skills in the construction sector - architects, engineers and quantity surveyors.  They tend to be very good at maths and good at maths is the key discipline required to transfer successfully into a career in computer science.  The first of those people are now coming off that - I think Springboard is the name of that programme.  The reaction back from our clients to date is very positive in relation to the quality.  Our view of that is: why would it not be?  These people are very qualified and very well experienced.  They are experienced in business and experienced in life as well because they are not graduates just coming out of university - they have been around for a while, both overseas and at home, and therefore they can add value to the companies concerned.  However, it is an area of focus for us.  It is an area where we continue to liaise with IDA Ireland, with our parent Department and with the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

I know that Enterprise Ireland has undertaken some work in this area.  The <i>Sunday Business Post</i>  reported that Enterprise Ireland was in talks with banks about developing a new credit line specifically for technology and export companies.  How have those conversations with the banks on that credit line gone?  How successful has Enterprise Ireland's banking relations department been to date?</p></speech>

To give the Deputy a comprehensive answer I will ask him to comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall O'Donnellan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100006#N00400"><p>We set up the banking relations department in 2008 in response to the credit crunch.  The immediate issue was access to credit of companies that we were dealing with and which were under considerable pressure at that time.  The team consists of three experienced executives and we work with our front line.  As they are working with individual companies, issues of credit arise in various contexts and the team then interacts with contacts it has established with the banks.  In particular we have established relationships with the three primary banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.</p><p>  We have a central contact point.  We have talked about the kinds of issues our companies face.  That central contact point is responsible for helping to introduce us to the individual bank account manager who would be dealing with the individual company, obviously with the agreement of the company.  We would then engage with the bank on the particular issues that might be facing the company in relation to bank credit and the need for the company to get particular facilities.  We would deal each year with approximately 150 companies on that basis.  In some companies there would be a number of multiple interactions if they were dealing with a number of different banks.  In 2011, we had 190 interactions in that context.  Over half of those clients that we would have worked with would have got new facilities.  Some would have got restructured and confirmed facilities.  There would have been some declines - approximately 20%.  Then in some cases the company might have been offered a revised banking loan but would have found it not appropriate to their particular situation.  That is our intervention on immediate issues in relation to companies that we work with through the banking relations team.</p><p>  As we got more involved through the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, we realised that actually there were some bigger issues involved - the issues that are common to all companies in the economy, such as the lack of experience in the banks in actually dealing with business plans, cash flow lending and that kind of issue, the challenges there would be in terms of requests for collateral and so on, the reality of debt overhang on a personal or business basis, particularly coming from the property boom, but that is an inhibitor, if one does not want, to the businesses.  All of those are issues that, if one likes, are shared by our companies as well as companies in the rest of the economy.</p><p>  As we got involved in the discussions with the bank, we also realised that actually the Irish banking system was not fit for purpose for the modern exporting sector - the modern SME exporting sector in particular, and particularly in three respects.  First, the Irish banking system had not, actually, become familiar with the modern technology economy so software, for example, was a sector that Irish banks would have very little involvement in up to that period of time.  Also med-tech and clean-tech, in other words the new technology sectors, would be areas that they were not familiar with.  The second feature was and is the area of new markets.  Irish banks would have been lending to companies which were exporting to the UK and that was a reasonably common and comfortable area from a banking point of view.  However, once one went beyond the UK and particularly once one went beyond the EU, that then became a more challenging question, if one likes.  Obviously in the recent years where the Irish banks have reduced their overseas involvement, that has become an even more challenging issue.  Third, there were certain products that are important to exporting companies, such as performance bonds, invoice discounting for software companies and similar types of products that again the Irish banking system would not have been familiar with.</p><p>  So we have undertaken with the three primary banks in particular, but not exclusively, a programme of work which involves first of all a number of workshops with them in terms of educating them about the kinds of companies we work with and introducing them to various groups of companies: the Irish Software Association; the IMDA - the med-tech association, and so on.  Second, we work with them and encourage them to take on people who actually have experience in these areas.  For example, in AIB the emerging sectors team is a product of that where they have taken on five or six people who have actually worked in software, VC and so on.</p><p>  On new markets, we have been working with the three banks, encouraging them to get involved in our trade missions.  On some of the missions to China, for example, there have been representatives from the banks.  They have also, for the past number of years, participated in our international markets week where they have stalls.  The companies can meet them and talk about the financing issues that they have as they are meeting our colleagues from overseas about particular entry into new markets and so on.</p><p>  Last and by no means least on the question the Deputy asked about facilities, we have been working with them on encouraging them to think about particular new facilities they might be able to offer to innovative and exporting companies.  An example of this is that AIB has recently got a risk-sharing facility from the European Investment Bank for up to &euro;80 million.  That is particularly aimed at innovative companies in the new sectors as it were.  For us that is a very positive and heartening development.  We are engaged with particularly the two pillar banks in discussions around how they can use the recently introduced loan guarantee scheme to underpin the kinds of offers they might want to offer the kinds of companies that we work with.</p></speech>

It is very helpful to have that acknowledged here.  Is the situation in our banks improving?  Mr. O'Donnellan has been dealing with them since 2008.  How does he find the situation now?  If he does not wish to answer the question, that is okay.</p></speech>

There is much greater awareness, particularly at the centre of the banks, of the issue and the major opportunity it presents for Irish banks.  Central contact and liaison teams have been established in the banks.  In addition, our CEO meets the CEOs of all three major banks every six months which has helped stimulate and push forward the agenda.  Progress has been made but the shared view among clients, banks and ourselves is that there is certainly a lot of ground to be made up.  We are still not where we need to be from the broader perspective of being a small, open exporting economy.</p></speech>

When one hears news reports about many AIB bank branches around the country not having computers or not being linked up to the Internet, one may not be surprised by what Mr. O'Donnellan has just said.  People will be concerned about State-owned banks having that kind of skills deficit.  He picked out those three areas and said they are not fit for purpose with regard to the modern technology economy, geographical issues, markets outside the UK and the EU and the global economy.  He also pointed to issues relating to certain kinds of products.  Bankers have been telling me for some time that foreign banks located here are taking advantage of the deficits that exist in our banks and are doing so not just from the standpoint of an information or skills deficit within banks but also the lending regimes.  Could I explore this issue with Mr. O'Donnellan?  He said there is ground to be made up.  It is a serious issue.  The question is what needs to be happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall O'Donnellan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100007#O00500"><p>As I already said, there is an agenda of action and change in the three primary banks which certainly acknowledge the issue and have in various ways made investments and efforts to address the issue.  The things are major changes which require major changes within their systems to take place.  In respect of foreign banks, from our perspective, our focus is on the needs of our clients.  We are strongly of the view that there needs to be an improved response from existing banks located in Ireland.  We are also very positive about other banks getting involved and supplying the needs of those clients.  For example, the entry of Silicon Valley Bank into the Irish market is a very welcome development.  This is a highly specialised bank which originated in Silicon Valley that is deeply experienced in lending and investing in software companies and the software industry.  This is an industry worth over &euro;1 billion on the indigenous side.  Silicon Valley Bank has entered the Irish market with a view to providing facilities to some of our companies that have particular growth and export potential.  We see that it will be able to co-operate with existing Irish banks but also compete with them.  From a broader perspective, that is a welcome development.  There are other overseas banks with a particular interest in some aspects of the Irish exporting sector.</p><p>  We see it as a need for a richer and more developed ecosystem that includes all elements in competition and co-operation.  The primary banks are particularly focused on the full range of companies in terms of size while typically many foreign banks entering our market might focus on the larger SMEs or the mid-caps.  We think everybody has a role to play.  For us, it is all about the needs of our clients and building up the capability of the various elements of the banking world to respond to those needs.  The launch of the SME credit fund by the NTMA, which is a non-banking solution, is also part of attempts to build up a range of supports and credit facilities, both banking and non-banking, which meet the needs of our exporting companies and the full range of companies in the wider economy.</p></speech>

He spoke about the percentages with regard to companies with which Enterprise Ireland deals and the credit facilities they were given.  Dealing with those three main banks, what kind of problems exist with regard to that element?  Are companies going to foreign banks as a result of not getting credit from those three main banks?</p></speech>

Deputy Deasy indicated some of them with regard to the supply side in terms of the banks.  These problems concern their experience of cashflow lending and the skill they have in that.  Banks are now re-skilling and upskilling their front-line teams to be able to deal with the full range of businesses in the Irish economy from the microbusiness to the small business to the medium-sized business to exporting elements and some of the larger companies.  That is an issue of skill and confidence, particularly on the front line.  They are very important issues that banks are seeking to address.  The supply of funding is important and their relationship with the EIB is particularly important in terms of being able to access funding for SMEs.  I have already referred to the AIB facility of &euro;80 million which is particularly important because it is targeted at innovative companies, particularly exporting companies.</p></speech>

In almost every other country against whose companies ours are competing, there is some form of risk sharing scheme which is underwritten by the Government where exporting is taking place to higher risk countries and regions.  While some countries represent a higher risk now, in the long run they will offer greater opportunities.  That is the case in relation to the BRIC countries.  Risk sharing is an important element of a full suite of supports which need to be available to exporting companies.  It is an important issue and one of our top priorities in 2013 is to have it addressed.</p></speech>

I voiced my concern about this on the floor of the D&aacute;il and I am surprised others have not raised it.  My experience of local authorities and their association with the commercial world is not good.  The last place local enterprise offices should be placed is within local authorities.  A professional culture does not exist in these organisations and enterprise boards should not be put anywhere near them.  There are advanced plans to have the Leader groups around the country do the same thing.  Enterprise Ireland is associated with this.  What will its role be?  How will Enterprise Ireland guard against the very anti-commercial culture that exists in some of the local authorities seeping into these incredibly valuable organisations to affect the creation of start-ups?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Ryan" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013013100008#P00500"><p>I agree with the Deputy on the high quality work which is carried out by city and county enterprise boards.  One of our key objectives is to maintain high morale within those bodies.  A couple of months ago, we asked all of the staff of the boards to come to Enterprise Ireland to have a chat about managing the process and to provide our input into it.  The Government has decided to restructure the microenterprise and small business support system and to introduce, in due course, legislation to dissolve the 35 county and city enterprise boards and to establish instead local enterprise offices.  To date, Enterprise Ireland has had a largely financial co-ordination relationship with the enterprise boards.  The relationship will change fundamentally.  We are in the process of setting up a centre of excellence on microenterprise, which we have not had before.  The centre will work with the new local enterprise offices in relation to how they might operate.  The process is advancing apace and three sub-committees have been established by our parent Department to work on challenges to a smooth and efficient changeover.  Enterprise Ireland is represented on those sub-committees and contributing to their work.</p><p>  Going forward, there will be a service level agreement between Enterprise Ireland and each local enterprise office which will set out exactly what is expected in return for the funding which will be made available.  Performance indicators and a metrics driven system akin to the one in place in Enterprise Ireland itself will be put in place in respect of the enterprise offices.  We have a great deal of time for the work of the city and county enterprise boards and we want to see it continue.  It is important to every county to have local enterprise facilities because they are the main link to microenterprise.  Enterprise Ireland is not that link.  It operates perhaps one step up from that with a particular orientation towards exports.  We are getting increasing transfers of companies from the county and city enterprise boards which have developed and are at the stage where they are becoming clients of Enterprise Ireland.  It is a very positive development.</p></speech>

Local enterprise offices should not be placed within local authorities at all.  The role of Enterprise Ireland as a guardian of what occurs after the legislation is passed will be incredibly important.  Local authorities are political organisations and are in many respects inefficient.  They are driven by a wholly different mindset to that of the business and commercial world.  I see trouble coming down the line if that kind of influence is exerted on organisations which have worked very well.  Waterford County Enterprise Board in my constituency is a good organisation.  The integration of enterprise bodies into local authorities will take some minding and watching.  Local authorities are the last bodies under which the enterprise offices should be set up.</p><p>  I have raised the issue of the regional spread of jobs here and on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I picked out from Enterprise Ireland's annual report for 2011 that 42% of its sponsored companies are based in Dublin.  While that is understandable, there is a difficulty with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland acknowledging that certain urban areas are getting the lion's share of investment and jobs, whether originating domestically or from abroad.  No one is complaining that Dublin, Cork and Galway are centres to which enterprises are attracted, but a regional imbalance and disparity is developing.  It is becoming worrying.  Has Enterprise Ireland identified this as a problem and does it have a policy to draw investment into areas like the south east which are experiencing unemployment rates of 19%?  There are parts of Waterford City where the unemployment rate is closer to 25%.  It is becoming a major regional problem.  I have asked about how the new EU post-2013 regional guidelines will take shape as they are being drafted over the next couple of months.  Does Enterprise Ireland look at places like Waterford and see the deficit, which is worsening as the years go on?</p></speech>

As the issue is different for the IDA, I will talk about the Enterprise Ireland side of the fence.  Any region has two things going for it.  It has its existing companies and its entrepreneurship or start-up rate.  Jobs do not come from any other source in the world of Enterprise Ireland.  The slight majority of our companies and jobs are located outside Dublin.  Unlike the IDA, we have client companies in every part of every county.  It is very distributed.  I will share some of the breakdown of figures for 2012 which I hope will be helpful to Deputy Deasy.  There are 145,460 jobs in Enterprise Ireland supported companies, of which 65% are in counties other than Dublin.  Job commitments for 2012 totalled approximately 7,600, 66% of which approvals were in companies outside Dublin.  There were 97 new high potential start-up companies in 2012, of which 41% were outside Dublin.  The term "significant investment" which I mentioned earlier, relates to investments by established companies of &euro;500,000 or more.  Of the significant investments in 2012, 57% were made outside Dublin.  Those statistics highlight our starting position.  We have more jobs outside Dublin than within.  That is the portfolio.</p></speech>

I am talking about the unemployment figures, which speak for themselves.  It is indisputable that some parts of this country are experiencing massive levels of unemployment.  I am trying to get across the idea that, from a policy standpoint and based on those figures, the organisation needs to identify and accept that.  I accept everything Mr. Ryan has thrown at me about where the organisation creates these jobs and the percentages, but an imbalance has arisen to the effect that there is more unemployment in some parts than others.  This needs to be addressed from a policy standpoint within Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the Departments that have a role.  I have raised the issue of regional guidelines and incentives with the IDA.  While they may be given to these companies, they are not working.  The IDA accepts that they are not working.  They are not attracting companies to the regions that are experiencing massive levels of unemployment.  Enterprise Ireland needs to consider this, and policies within the organisation need to be geared towards spotting, identifying and accepting that there is a problem that needs to be examined.</p><p>  Picking up on what Mr. Ryan said about the small skills unit and Enterprise Ireland's position on university-led indigenous job creation, Mr. Brendan Murphy, the president of Cork Institute of Technology, said last summer that creating a vibrant technological university sector is the most important significant recommendation in the national strategy for higher education to 2030.  He highlighted how higher education can make a major contribution to the development of indigenous enterprise by pointing to CIT's association with Enterprise Ireland in operating the Genesis programme which has resulted in 200 start-up companies, over &euro;100 million in investment and the creation of almost 2,500 jobs.  Mr. O'Donnellan alluded to the importance of this, as did Mr. Ryan.  The HEA and the Department of Education and Skills are adjudicating on applications for the creation of more technological universities.  If that is where Mr. Ryan thinks the emphasis should be, what role does Enterprise Ireland, with the Department and the HEA, play to deliver on that?  The creation of these technological universities is important when it results in such figures.</p></speech>

My colleague, Gear&oacute;id Mooney, will talk a bit about the New Frontiers programme and the spin-out levels we are experiencing from universities and institutes of technology in business start-ups.  In many regions the institute is the jewel in the crown for many of the type of business start-ups that can have international success.</p></speech>

One of the significant investments of recent years has been to ensure that each institute and university has a fit for purpose campus incubation which was co-funded by Enterprise Ireland.  We also helped the institutes of technology fund the professional management of those incubation centres.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  Waterford is a shining example of how co-locating the incubation centre with the institute has led to the establishment of a software industry that probably should not have existed in Waterford.  Unlike the normal impacts of business around there, this industry has been driven from the educational facility.  Also in Waterford one sees the flow of graduates and researchers into local industry and start-ups.  It is vitally important to equip the institutes properly for incubation.  In 2011 and previous years there was a programme aimed specifically at linking companies in the region to the institutes and funding those projects.  This evolved in 2012 into the Technology Gateway programme which was set up specifically to give the institutes the resources to reach out properly to industry and to engage with it.  Rather than wait for industries to show up and ask for research, the institutes actively market the research.  This is having quite a strong influence.  Approximately 150 projects a year are completed between the institutes and companies.  More and more the companies fund these, particularly the smaller projects, without an incentive from anybody else because the infrastructure exists with which they can interact.</p><p>  Whatever shape the technological universities take, our main emphasis is to make sure that the infrastructure exists for us to get the maximum commercial impact out of them.  Even if they are re-shaped with the infrastructure between the technology gateways, we do not see any reason they would not survive any kind of restructuring or re-shaping.  We will continue to have the means to get the researchers engaged with companies in a commercially productive way.</p></speech>

It is appropriate that I should speak on behalf of my own constituency.  This issue affects the western side of my county.  Enterprise Ireland has been in talks with individuals who came together to put together a proposal to Enterprise Ireland for Cappoquin Chickens, the food processor.  Effectively, the company brings commercial life into the west of the county.  There is no great industrial manufacturing base on that side of Waterford.  Can Mr. Ryan give us an idea of how that is progressing and what we can expect from that process?</p></speech>

We have been in deep and regular, almost continuous, contact with that company and the new start-up over the past two months.  I and my colleagues met the full senior management team last Wednesday.  We continue to work with them.  We are impressed by the management team there and we continue our interaction with them.  We are very conscious that the jobs lost in that part of Waterford could not be replaced in the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

It is absolutely critical.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland is one of the most important organisations in the country at present with regard to helping to return growth and employment to their former strength.  There has been quite a change in the economy in recent years and Enterprise Ireland has a very important role as a State agency to help find solutions with regard to unemployment.  Mr. Ryan has given us a breakdown of the organisation's full-time and part-time employment by region.  Will he send us this information on a county basis and the number of clients Enterprise Ireland has?  He may not have it here.</p></speech>

The area I come from tends to get lost as the region is unusual.  I do not have a full fix.  The IDA does not know my county exists but Enterprise Ireland is a little better in this regard and I would like to see its information.</p><p>  I had a look through the accounts this morning and last night.  Page 57 details the income and expenditure for the year.  The largest item in the accounts is financial support to industry, which was &euro;194 million in 2011.  The corresponding figure for the previous year was &euro;294 million, so this represents a drop of more than &euro;100 million at a time when one would have hoped support to industry would have been at its highest.  This is referred to in the notes to the account.  The biggest drop is in the employment subsidy scheme.  According to note (a) on page 63, the scheme ended in 2011.  I would have thought that if any scheme should have been continued from 2011 onwards, it was an employment subsidy scheme to support the retention of full-time or part-time jobs and viable enterprises which might otherwise be lost as result of the impact of the global and financial recession.  To see a cutback of more than &euro;100 million under this heading is extraordinary at a time when we need to protect jobs.  One can talk about start-ups and innovation but the most important thing is to hold onto what we have.  I am amazed there was a cut of almost 50% in funding in an area I would say deals with job retention.  Will Mr. Ryan explain why this is and where we are going in terms of job retention, given that there has been such a drop-off in this area?</p><p>  I am confused by an entry on page 56 with regard to a contribution to the Exchequer of &euro;34 million during the course of the year.  This is detailed in note 10 on page 68, where it is described as excess proceeds over the amount accounted for in the Government Book of Estimates.  Enterprise Ireland is handing back approximately &euro;30 million.  Ministers fight hard for allocations for organisations such as Enterprise Ireland.  I find it mind-boggling.  The subsidy for employment for existing companies is being cut by &euro;100 million while money is being handed back to the Government.  Could the &euro;30 million handed back to the Government have been used for job retention?  These figures stick out as going in opposite directions and I ask Mr. Ryan for a comment.</p></speech>

To fund our activities we receive a grant-in-aid figure at the beginning of the year and we also have an agreed own-resource income target.  This is how we fund our overall budget for the year.  The agreement with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Finance is that any excess income we earn beyond the agreed figures is refunded to the Exchequer.  Our budgets are set on this basis.  As the Deputy can see from the accounts, we have a substantial portfolio of shares and there can sometimes be a trade sale, rights issue or conversion which brings about a windfall of own-resource income.  This happened in 2011.</p></speech>

The accounts detail Exchequer grants of &euro;304 million and own resources of &euro;9 million plus funding from third parties of &euro;18 million and some disposals.  The &euro;34 million being returned still seems a high figure.</p></speech>

This was a one-off initiative announced by the Government in late 2009 and we spent a total of &euro;114 million, most of which went out in 2010.  A small amount went out in 2011.

There are no figures for the jobs created as a result.  Enterprise Ireland was responsible for 100 actions in the action plan for jobs but there are no figures on how many jobs were created by these 100 initiatives.  It looks as if somebody got away lightly with regard to the net outcome from the announcement of the action plan and cutting the employment subsidy scheme by more than &euro;104 million in the same year.  I am not referring to the witnesses, but at political level.  We were distracted from losing &euro;104 million in the employment subsidy scheme by PR announcements and action plans for jobs.  I still do not know how many jobs were created.  Enterprise Ireland did not announce the action plan for jobs.</p></speech>

We have no authority to extend the scheme.  It came to its end.  The employment stabilisation fund also came to an end during that period.  This is the vast majority of the difference between the two numbers.  The schemes are no longer open to us.  The employment subsidy scheme finished at the end of the temporary aid approved under European State aid rules.</p></speech>

This was to help concentration of the industry.  Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;7 million in the beef and sheep meat investment fund in 2011 and more than &euro;10 million the previous year.  Are we over-concentrating key sectors in the hands of a small number of people in the private sector?  There was a time when we had many disparate co-operatives in the dairy sector.  Major rationalisation has taken place but now funding has been provided for further rationalisation.  Having a few super-companies in the dairy sector helps in the international field.</p></speech>

The dispensing of funds by Enterprise Ireland is coming to an end.</p><p>  What has been achieved on the dairy side is impressive.  The removal of the milk quota in 2015 will present an opportunity, as set out under Harvest 2020, to increase dairy production by 60%.  I assure the committee that Enterprise Ireland is working with the dairy sector on the role the latter can play in ensuring that the increased production is carried out as efficiently as possible and with as much value added to the State as possible.</p><p>  Ireland has 30 beef abattoirs.  In 2012, they slaughtered 1.5 million cattle.  We understand that three companies control approximately 56% of the market, with the balance widely held by the other abattoirs.  Many beef abattoirs do not slaughter on a five-day week.  There is little sign of an over-concentration of production capacity in the beef sector.</p><p>  We have an opportunity to secure the future of Ireland's food industry for the next ten to 20 years. How we manage the period up to 2020 will decide that future.  In terms of technology and sophistication of the product, the dairy side is probably further ahead than the beef side.  The dairy side has focused on the ingredients world, where the mark-up and value added are much greater.  There is an opportunity for a similar approach to be taken on the beef side.  We are in discussions with some of the companies regarding ingredients that might be found in the beef area that could become high-mark-up items.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland is playing a full and active role.  We are represented on the Harvest 2020 committee.  We are very awake to the opportunities.</p></speech>

People have different opinions on the matter.  Is Mr. Ryan concerned that Enterprise Ireland will lose some of its local contacts?  Its relationship with local authorities cannot be as specific.  The CEBs' chief executives are not high up in the public service and will go in at a grade below that of director of service.  Their positions will be subsumed.  Instead of paying the CEBs &euro;29.7 million, will Enterprise Ireland simply hand that money over to local authorities?

There is accountability to the Oireachtas for funding given through a national organisation such as Enterprise Ireland, given that the accounts of each CEB are laid before the Oireachtas.  That link will be broken when the money is dispensed through local authorities.  In line with the Chairman's strong opinions on this matter, the committee might consider contacting the Minister to ensure that an audit trail for State funding is not lost in the local authority system.  This committee has no authority in that regard.  I know that it is not the Chairman's decision.</p><p>  Turning to the issue of banks and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, I have read Enterprise Ireland's report.  It is working with the banks and encouraging them to concentrate their lending in strategic economic growth areas.  Encouragement is good.  Are the banks doing it?  I am encouraged to see that Enterprise Ireland has held international forums in London.  Many of its client companies are meeting overseas contacts with international management experience and knowledge of technologies.  If Irish banks are not lending, is there an opportunity for some of the foreign banks to invest in Irish manufacturers on advice from Enterprise Ireland?  Let us say that some of the companies that Enterprise Ireland deals with export to and have a strong presence in a particular country.  Is Enterprise Ireland exploring the possibility that such companies could source financing from banks in that country?</p><p>  It was stated that Enterprise Ireland had 97 high-potential start-ups.  How does it identify a high-potential project?  We are all approached by people who believe they have high-potential ideas.  They are normally directed to the enterprise boards and so on.  I believe there was a simple rule of thumb that an organisation with fewer than ten employees went to the CEBs while an organisation with more than ten employees went to Enterprise Ireland.  Will this link remain?</p><p>  The main issue facing most of Enterprise Ireland's client companies is the level of overhanging debt.  Many may have invested in premises, machinery and upgrades during the good times - the expensive times - and are now carrying large debts.  These debts are not core to manufacturing, exporting and finding new markets.</p></speech>

I would like to add a further comment which I hope committee members will find helpful.  We want our client companies to hang out with the best.  It is as simple as that.  We would like that to be the Irish banks but that is just because we are an Irish agency.  If the funding is supplied by overseas banks, that is fine.  For those of our client companies exporting to Brazil, Russia and China, the overseas banks, which have a good contact network in these areas, supply more than finance.  They supply strong sectoral and market knowledge of areas, including on what a contract in the United Arab Emirates means, because it means something different in Saudi Arabia.  We want that type of input for our clients.  We are agnostic as regards where that comes from.  We try to be commercial in that type of situation.  The Irish banks are in competition with overseas banks in relation to meeting the needs of our clients.</p><p>  Since its establishment Enterprise Ireland has invested in approximately 700 to 800 high potential start-up, HPSU, companies.  On an annual basis, approximately 450 innovators and promoters bring their projects to us.  We select the best of those, who then receive special attention, including special training programmes for their management teams and so on, to bring them to what we term "scaling companies".  In other words, companies that can reach at least &euro;5 million in turnover within a five to seven year period.  A full commercial evaluation of each project is undertaken.  We invest, with others, in these high potential start-ups.  As such, we are not investing on our own.  These companies usually raise funds from family and friends, through the seed venture capital fund or venture capital industry.  Our funds are matched by other funding.  We have found it useful to have several sets of eyes on the business opportunities being presented.</p><p>   We have in our own way addressed the issue of overhanging debt, on which I will ask Mr. Donnellan to comment.</p></speech>

We work with individual companies and their banks to find a solution that works for both.  We have also addressed this issue generally because many of our clients, as is the case with many people in the country, have personal debt as a result of property investment during the property boom or their companies are in debt because of investment in property which is now over-valued, or for other reasons.  For example, current promoters may have borrowed to buy-out previous promoters and so on.  There are a number of different types of instances where the underlying value of the assets are not reflected in the debt held by a company.  This is a major ongoing issue that needs to be resolved in some way in the future.  As I said, we have addressed this with individual companies.  From a broader point of view, we have articulated the need for some form of debt resolution.  We are not experts in banking but have articulated our view on this matter to our parent Department and the Department of Finance during the discussions on SME lending.  We see this as an issue that needs to be resolved in the context of the overall banking discussions.</p></speech>

If a business is sound, be it under the current or new owners, that business will continue.  We have not ceased our financial or non-financial engagement with companies just because they have debt overhang.  We want to see businesses continue.</p></speech>

I understand &euro;2 million was paid out the previous year.  How much was paid in 2012?  It is stated on page 61 of the accounts that European Globalisation Adjustment Fund receipts in 2011 related to Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics, which was distributed through the relevant County and City Enterprise Boards.  Did Enterprise Ireland not deal directly with those companies?  Why are small county enterprise boards, some of which have only three staff, dealing with some of the largest companies in the country?  I would have thought that was the responsibility of Enterprise Ireland.</p></speech>

Mr. Ryan can send the information on to the committee at a later date.</p><p>  I have one final question.  It was mentioned several times that Enterprise Ireland has large investments in shares and seed capital funds.  If I understand the figures on pages 70 and 71 correctly, disposal of investment in shares last year amounted to &euro;24 million and write-down, in respect of diminution in value, in terms of shares still held, was &euro;6 million, which amounts to &euro;30 million.  In respect of the seed and venture capital fund, the disposal figure is &euro;6 million and the figure in respect of diminution in value is &euro;11 million, giving a total of &euro;17 million.  It appears to me that the total cost as a result of disposals and diminution in value under the year under review is &euro;47 million.  Taking the overall total in the accounts, the diminution provision thus far in respect of shares held is &euro;147 million and in respect of diminution in value of the seed capital fund is &euro;90 million, giving a total diminution in value of &euro;237 million.  The total value of diminutions as per the balance sheet is &euro;253 million.  Am I correct that in terms of cumulative investment, there has been an almost 50% write-down in the value of shares and investments in seed capital funds held by Enterprise Ireland?  The figure provided in the balance sheet is &euro;252 billion and the figures provided in the accounts indicate a diminution in value of &euro;237 million.  Presumably, the investments were of the order of &euro;500 million and there is a diminution in value of &euro;237 million, which means the balance sheet figure, on a prudent basis, of &euro;253 million.  Is that an accurate assessment?</p></speech>

It would be nice to say we had nothing to do with the construction sector and did not have to take the associated job losses into account on our books.  Since 2008 the job losses associated with the construction and related engineering sectors have been considerable.  We are conscious of the human impact of these job losses.  For example, of all the job losses in 2008, 41.9% were in construction and construction-related sectors.</p></speech>

When the problems in the construction sector became apparent in Ireland, the challenge for most was to walk away from the construction sector without being seen to break into a run.  That is essentially what happened.  Enterprise Ireland was left to face an incredible position on jobs losses in the sector.  It required us to work on a programme for the transformation of the sector to develop it into an international construction sector with a base in Ireland, as opposed to being an Irish construction sector only.  It was necessary for us to intervene at the level of chief executive officer.  Duke University and Enterprise Ireland put together a leadership for growth programme to assist construction services companies, architects, engineers and other construction personnel such as surveyors to focus on export markets, on which they had not focused for the previous ten years.  That involved us engaging with the London Development Authority which was closely associated with the Olympic Games in London and with Irish companies to secure contracts for the Olympic Games to the tune of approximately &euro;300 million.</p></speech>

The Government has made a commitment to create 100,000 net new jobs by 2016.  That target has not been broken down and I find the figure suspect.  Enterprise Ireland is a key pillar.  Mr. Ryan referenced the action plan and his responsibility for a number of points within it.  It raises serious alarm bells and puts a serious question mark over the Government's target of 100,000 new jobs.  Enterprise Ireland was involved in the creation of 3,346 net jobs in 2011 and 2012 for its efforts.  Mr. Ryan is elated, but I am panicked.  Does he understand where I am coming from?  Can Mr. Ryan give us the figure for the number of jobs related to the London Olympics?  With regard to the 100,000 net new jobs, how many will be supported or created by Enterprise Ireland?  It is Government policy to achieve these job targets by 2016.  What will be the contribution of Enterprise Ireland?</p></speech>

Job losses in 2011 and 2012 are running at the lowest level for the past ten years.  When I say I am elated, I mean it gives me hope that indigenous performance is turning around and getting out from under the rock of the impact of the collapse of the construction sector.  The companies driving job creation are the new, modern, innovative companies.  They are contributing to the employment gain.  In past year, more than 1,000 companies in our portfolio took on between one and three people.  I hope I have not overstated the case by using the word "elated", but it gives great hope to see a trend with companies starting to employ people.</p></speech>

Mr. Ryan's organisation is a central plank of a stated plan by the Government to create 100,000 net new jobs by 2016.

Our target for 2013 is a minimum of 10,500 first-time jobs.  We cannot estimate job losses but we hope they will remain at a low level.  In Enterprise Ireland, we are realistic about what we can contribute to the overall job numbers.  We are faced with the reality that overseas exports are doing very well but the domestic side is on its knees.  Traditionally, going back over many years, we have looked at domestic activity as creating employment in client companies.  However, that is not there at the moment.  Half of our total revenues are exports and the other half is domestic.  There is no growth on the domestic side and the only growth we are getting is on the export side.  We are getting good growth on the export side.  We have no magic wand to turn it around.</p></speech>

The reason I am pressing this point with Mr. Ryan - I heard what he said and I am not gainsaying a number of very innovative things Enterprise Ireland is doing, which I acknowledge - is that there is a bottom line here for taxpayers and citizens, which is that too many of our people cannot find jobs.  Levels of emigration are similar to those in the 1800s, so we are losing talent and people are losing family members.  Mr. Ryan knows the social consequences of all of this.</p></speech>

When an agency is given the type of budget Enterprise Ireland is given, I think I speak for people with common sense when I say that a yield in 2011 of six jobs is farcical and that a yield of 3,346 jobs is a whole pile better but is still not very promising.  I do not know where the links have broken down.  I will spare the political criticisms for those who deserve them.  I wonder where this figure of 100,000 jobs has come from.  Enterprise Ireland has a projected figure for this year in terms of new jobs.  It will not go beyond that.  All of that is alarming.</p><p>  I would like to think that when the three-year plan is completed, Enterprise Ireland might come back to us to revisit this situation, because the value of its work - leaving aside the commercial interests, because businesses will obviously have their own legitimate key performance indicators in terms of Enterprise Ireland and how it is doing - for taxpayers and citizens will be called on the basis of job creation.  That will be the bottom line for people.  I have said my piece.  Those figures are far from satisfactory.</p></speech>

When it is available, perhaps we will have a further discussion with Enterprise Ireland in regard to its targets and the costs associated with the plan.  We had a general discussion on banking issues, which was raised by a number of members, including Enterprise Ireland's engagement with the banks, the new products and services required, the fact the banks are a little bit behind the curve in regard to meeting the demands of new and developing businesses and, in turn, those economies.  We will send the transcript of the meeting to the Department of Finance because there is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report on credit facilities and so on.  It may be helpful to the Accounting Officer from that Department, when he comes before us, to have the various comments from this meeting and he can answer some of those queries.</p><p>  We receive the accounts from the county enterprise boards.  It would be appropriate to bring in a number of the boards, or certainly the Accounting Officers, to discuss the county enterprise boards themselves, the costs associated with them, the jobs created by them, the spend they have in each county and the results from each county.  Arising from this meeting, I believe it would be appropriate to do that.</p><p>  I compliment the county enterprise boards on the work they have done over the years and on their achievements.  Will Mr. Ryan give us a note on the money spent by each county enterprise board over, say, the past five years, the number of jobs created from the grants, loans or whatever that each county enterprise board has given to its clients, and how much it cost each county enterprise board to create a new job within the community it represents?</p><p>  On the new local enterprise centres or offices, what was the level of consultation with Enterprise Ireland on the establishment of that policy?  I will not enter the area of policy, but has Enterprise Ireland been consulted?</p></speech>

We look at those accounts and not many red flags have been raised over the years, so we presume they are performing in line with the reports given to us through Enterprise Ireland and other agencies.  They give the accounts to us and they report to Enterprise Ireland.  What is so wrong with that system that they would then be asked to report to the local authorities?  The enterprise boards have been established and they are working.  They have their offices, their clients, their responsibilities in terms of their audit, a parent agency - namely, Enterprise Ireland - and a parent Department, which is Enterprise Ireland's parent Department.  What is the problem with the system that resulted in the decision to take that responsibility from the Department and place it with another one?</p></speech>

We are an arm of the Government, so we will be asked by our parent Department to execute a range of interfaces with the county and city enterprise boards, but until these are defined to us, we really cannot envisage what we will be asked to do.  However, from what we are aware so far, it is envisaged that we will have a much closer working relationship with the county enterprise boards going forward.</p></speech>

From a policy point of view, it is not the type of policy that sits easily with me given the background to local authorities.  I suggest the committee write to the Minister suggesting, regardless of what the new arrangements will be, that the audit in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the role played by him will not change.  If it is as separate as it is supposed to be, these new local enterprise offices should account for their spend through the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General because we can then link it to the allocation being made to Enterprise Ireland on a year-to-year basis.  We are best placed to judge the audit and performance from that perspective.</p></speech>

As I acknowledge there is a one China policy, I am not touching on policy issues.  Funding for an office in Taipei was withdrawn, perhaps owing to economic conditions, but now that we are looking at countries to support the export potential of our companies, we should consider having a presence in Taipei which has a population of 23 million through the three offices on mainland China.  Of the European Union member states,16, not including Ireland, are represented through an office supported by the European Union.  It is strange that trade agreements are being reached between Taiwan and these 16 countries through that European Union office in which we have no representative.  I would like to see this change and believe the job could be done effectively by Enterprise Ireland's officials on mainland China in connection with property rights and economic agreements between Taiwan and China.  I ask Mr. Ryan to look at this issue.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has a staff of 742.</p></speech>

We were given permission in the past two weeks to fill the vacancies overseas and within two months will be back up to full capacity.  However, we have asked for permission to increase our overseas numbers by 20, as there are opportunities for us.  In fact, an approach to servicing Taipei better could be part of this.  We have discussed the opportunities with companies and our figures are not based on our own estimate of what could be achieved.  We hope the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will give a favourable decision on our request in the very near future.</p></speech>

How does Mr. Ryan respond to the suggestion that when supplying markets or the big supermarket chains, companies are pushed to the pin of their collar to make a profit on the products they are supplying and that they often supply to the markets under cost?  Has Mr. Ryan come up against this issue when dealing not only with companies but also the industry as a whole?  In sustaining our exports and winning new markets is the loss of the contracts by the companies involved to supply burgers and other products to the markets a cause for concern?</p></speech>

The power of the multiples, particularly in the British Isles and the Republic of Ireland, is very strong.  As there are so few, there is very strong buyer power in the marketplace.  If one looks at the food sector, in particular, it depends on the individual company.  Many of our food and drink companies are exporting well beyond the British Isles and the market is very competitive.  So far the beef sector in Ireland has been able to be competitive and secure contracts.  We hope that will remain the position.  The food industry is unusual in Ireland in that it is integrated right back to farmers.  There is a significant societal impact associated with what happens in the industry.  We are certainly working with a number of food companies on lean manufacturing and world class manufacturing standards to maintain their competitiveness.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and have a number of quick questions.</p><p>  I am looking at the breakdown by region for 2011 and as a Deputy for Limerick city, I am interested in the figures for the mid-west.  Some 507 jobs were created, while 590 were lost, giving a net loss of 83.  Is there a policy on regional distribution in job creation?  Will Mr. Ryan give me the breakdown for the mid-west in 2012, between the total number employed which I understand was 12,900 at the end of 2011, the gains and losses and the net change.  Furthermore, will he give me an indication of the projections for the mid-west for 2013?  Obviously, as a Deputy for Limerick city, I am very conscious of the need to create further jobs and would like to receive an overview of Enterprise Ireland's strategy to create jobs in the city and mid-west region?</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that next week the European Council will discuss the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  Since the proposal was tabled, events have moved on.  In order to be helpful to the committee, we had agreed with the Chairman, to make a broad presentation on the MFF, rather than going through the detail, line by line of the regulation.  We are happy to answer any questions on the regulation.  There have been many developments since then and we thought it would be useful to set out the overall context.</p><p>  At national level this work is carried out jointly by the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach.  I will speak for the first five minutes and then my colleague, Mr. Kyle O'Sullivan, will speak for the second five minutes.  I will speak on the actual Commission proposal and the state of play in the current negotiations and Mr. O'Sullivan will talk about Ireland's position, the position of the other member states and the process for securing final agreement.</p><p>  I have a power point presentation, but I notice that the slides are difficult to read and I do not think members will be able to read them.</p></speech>

The Commission presented its proposal in June 2011, which was updated to take account of Croatia's accession in July 2012.  The proposal has elements inside the multi-annual financial framework, MFF and elements outside the MFF, which are being moved in and out.  There are many moving parts.  If some elements cause confusion, please ask me about it and I hope I will be able to allay the confusion.</p><p>  The treaty base for the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, is Article 312 of the Lisbon treaty, which defines the MFF as the multi-annual financial framework that sets out the ceilings for budgetary commitments and payments under a limited number of headings.  There are six headings in the current proposal.  The treaty also provides that the MFF regulation is adopted by unanimity in the Council of Ministers and with the consent of the European Parliament.  Every year the annual budget is negotiated between the Council and the European Parliament within the multi-annual framework.</p><p>  The regulation we are discussing today is the overarching regulation.  The MFF as a whole consists of about 75 sectoral regulations covering CAP, cohesion, research, education.  Once the overarching regulation is agreed work will be able to advance on the various sectoral components.  I understand these have been discussed by the Oireachtas committees dealing with the sectoral areas.  There are a number of proposals related to the Revenue side and how the EU budget is funded but we are not discussing that specifically today, but again we are happy to take questions, if the committee members wish to have information on it.</p><p>  The current MFF was for a seven year period that expires at the end of 2013.  The yellow slide deals with the Commission proposal, which is probably the second in the pack, and is the latest version of the proposal dating from July 2012.</p><p>  In the bottom corner of the right hand side, one will see the figure &euro;1,033 billion, which is the total value of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF proposal in 2011 prices.  It represents 1.08% of EU GNI, - which is basically EU GNP minus EU budget pluses and minuses.  Not to cause too much confusion, there are a number of elements outside the MFF, that are added on to the figure of &euro;1,033 billion.  This can be seen in the green slide, the provision for elements such as the emergency aid reserve, the EU globalisation fund and the solidarity fund totals &euro;58 billion. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kyle O'Sullivan" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013013100004#E00200"><p>A word first about the position Ireland has taken so far in the negotiations.  We have an overall objective, namely, to optimise Ireland's net budgetary position and establish a framework which supports growth and employment in Europe.  Within this overall objective, the Government's approach has been guided by a number of priorities.  The first is to have a properly funded and properly functioning European Union with the right mix of priorities, fair allocation of resources and a focus on jobs and growth.  As members can imagine, in allocating funding for the next seven years, we are also setting out political priorities.  It is, therefore, important that the allocations fit these particular priorities.</p><p>  The second priority is to protect Ireland's receipts under the Common Agricultural Policy to the maximum extent possible.  This is our overriding financial priority.  </p><p>  The third priority is the protection of Ireland's cohesion receipts to the maximum extent possible in the context of changing relative GDP <i>per capita</i> rates and pressure to concentrate funding on less developed regions.</p><p>  The fourth priority is to ensure adequate resources to reflect Ireland's and Europe's needs and priorities in the areas of research, infrastructure and education.</p><p>  The fifth priority is retention of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the sixth is to ensure that any changes to the revenue side of the own resource arrangements have a minimal impact on our net contributions.  I will say a word about net contributions in a moment.</p><p>  The final deal will obviously be the result of a negotiation and it seems certain at this stage that it will result in a much smaller budget than that originally proposed by the Commission.  This will involve trade-offs and compromises by all member states, including Ireland, and our negotiating tactics coming into next week's European Council must take account of that.  </p><p>  I should stress that the Government is acutely conscious of the importance to the Irish economy of European Union funding, in particular given our current national fiscal position.  Negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework have been active since last September and the General Affairs Council, COREPER and the European Council have been fully engaged, as have Irish Ministers and officials in bilateral contacts.  Irish embassies in EU capitals as well as our permanent representation in Brussels have also been intensively involved. </p><p>  I draw members' attention to our national net position in a couple of the tables that were circulated to the joint committee to put these concepts into figures.  I ask them to look at Table 10, Public Sector Receipts from and Payments to the EU Budget.  I draw their attention to the bottom row, which sets out receipts and payments for 2011.  The table states simply what we contribute and what we receive on an annual basis.  Ireland's net position in 2011 was a net gain of &euro;586 million.  Members can see the history of the Irish position for every year going back to 1973.  The &euro;586 million figure is crucial to us in negotiations. </p><p>  I draw attention to the line in Table 11, which indicates what parts of the EU budget provide the flows to Ireland.  We receive &euro;1.6 billion per annum from Pillars 1 and 2.  The two relevant figures, &euro;1.297 billion and &euro;348 million, are shown at the bottom of the table.  This is from where our income or flows from the European Union budget come.  Of the total of &euro;1.9 billion for the whole year, &euro;1.6 billion is for agriculture.  Clearly, therefore, this area is a key part of our considerations.  </p><p>  I ask members to look at a final graph which was, I believe, lifted from <i>The Economist</i>.  </p></speech>

The graph has an interesting indicator.  In many of the negotiations, discussion varies between net contributors and net recipients.  This is in some senses an artificial discussion but it is also an important one of which people are aware.  The graph features a line, above which are the countries that are net recipients and below which are the countries that are net contributors.  Ireland is a net recipient and intends to remain so.  The other axis of the graph shows gross national income <i>per capita</i>.  As members will note, Ireland is among the net recipients with the highest GNI <i>per capita</i>.  This is an advantageous position for us nationally and one we hope to retain.  I point this out because the issue frequently arises in negotiations.  That is our national net position.</p></speech>

As the debate goes on, it is quite complex and detailed.  That might be best as people could be allowed two or three opportunities to come in.  I need the groups to indicate who will lead off for those groups.  Before moving on the main questioner, perhaps I can put some questions to Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Campbell.  There are a number of issues on the agenda.  The UK has a rebate arrangement which has been in place for a number of years.  What is the current state of play with it?  Given the announcement made by the British Prime Minister in recent days, I would imagine this is a significant issue for them.  What is being proposed at the British side of the table on the rebate arrangement?</p></speech>

The discussions at the European Council have been very much focused on the expenditure side.  The Commission's proposal would replace the UK rebate by a lump sum correction.  As far as Ireland is concerned, our national position is that we do not like rebates because they are too opaque.  The British rebate will be a factor in play.  Who knows what will happen next week?</p></speech>

I do not think we would be coming back unless it was his judgment that a deal would be reached.  As he has not made new proposals, there is no new paper on the table.  We would expect that he would make those proposals on Thursday afternoon, as soon as he convenes the Council.  Certainly our preparations and those of most member states would be towards a deal.</p></speech>

At the concluding plenary session yesterday afternoon, at which Mr. Schulz was present, Mr. Barroso made a very interesting comment.  In regard to the last slide which shows net beneficiaries and net contributors Mr. Barroso's comment was that 84% of the EU budget is paid by member states but 94% of the EU budget operates in a different fashion and that all European Union countries are beneficiaries of European Union funding.  Will the witnesses explain what that means because there is much focus on the fact that a member state is a net benefactor or a net contributor but the way EU funding is allocated to member states is that every country gets more money out of it than what they put in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kyle O'Sullivan" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013013100005#F00900"><p>I know it is true of the EU budget that the spending takes place in all the larger instruments in all of the member states.  The largest recipients of Common Agricultural Policy funding will be France, Germany and other larger net contributors.  Certainly every state gets back.  However, in terms of the net balance, when one calculates exactly what goes in and what goes out, there are slight differences in net contributors.  It is probably fair to say that most of the EU spending is spent in the territories of the net contributors because they are the larger member states.</p></speech>

The Commission and Mr. Barroso do not like to have a discussion about net contributors and net beneficiaries.  They see this as EU spending for the EU as a whole and they resist this issue but they do have to come back occasionally and point out that every member state receives CAP funding, regional and Structural funding and it is spread across the European Union.</p></speech>

That proposal was made before we entered into the realm of enhanced co-operation for the financial transactions tax.  As the Chairman has said, Ireland is not participating in that.  It remains on the table for the EU budget but I think the discussion about how it would be implemented has not advanced in any way.  We know that a number of member states who will be participating in the financial transactions tax are not in favour of it being used as an EU budget resource.  Therefore, the general intelligence is that there are unlikely to be significant changes in the Union resource arrangements.  That is as much as we know.  In terms of where Ireland would fit in, our budget contributions will continue to be largely related to our GNI.</p></speech>

On the overall MFF spending, we know there is opposition from countries like Britain and the Netherlands to the overall budget being increased.  There has been a lot of talk about the EU budget being used as a vehicle for investment, growth and jobs but how can happen, given the fact that there will not be a substantial increase in the budget?  How can one square that circle, that the budget is supposed to be a vehicle for investment?</p></speech>

In fact, it is clear now that the MFF will be smaller than that proposed by the EU Commission.  That is the reality of the situation.  At the same time, the Commission's proposal regarding the MFF has focused on areas for supporting growth and competitiveness.  There is a big increase in the budget for research and infrastructure.  The overall implementation of the MFF within the cohesion area will be focused on growth and employment related measures.  It will be a smaller amount of money but there are more efforts to target it on growth-producing and employment-based measures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013013100006#G00800"><p>Obviously that will come at the expense of other measures and I am sure that the EU Commission would have argued in the past that the budget in its entirety was promoting growth, regardless of specific measures.  I will leave that aside but I am of the opinion that there is a lot of spin involved in this.  It is unfortunate that we will not see a substantial increase in the budget because I am sure countries like Ireland would have benefited from that.</p><p>  The reference date for cohesion has been altered and set to a later date, which should suit Ireland better.  I also welcome the fact that a reassessment is built in whereby if a country is doing better or worse than expected over the period, funding levels can be revisited.  Overall, in Ms Campbell's view, did Ireland and, in particular, the Irish regions get a good deal?  I understand that the Border, midland and western region, known as BMW, is still seeking recognition that may allow it to avail of greater funding opportunities.  Can Ms Campbell enlighten the committee as to how negotiations on this are progressing at this point in time?</p></speech>

Basically there is a three year reference period to determine the category of a region.  The GDP <i>per capita</i> is averaged against the other 271 regions within Europe.  Currently, the BMW region is at about 93% of the EU average over the 2007 to 2009 reference period.  In the original proposals, the reference period was 2006 to 2008.  The reference period has been changed to reflect the latest data from 2007 to 2009.  We are not sure, if the reference period was changed to 2008 to 2010, whether the BMW region would even meet the threshold because the calculations are relative.  Any decrease would have to be relative to the rest of Europe.  Basically, the problem for the BMW region is that in the current round, it is called a &quot;phasing-in&quot; or a &quot;transition&quot; region as it is moving from a less developed region to a more developed region and it will lose that status this time around.  This is a constant feature of all of our negotiations with the EU Council and Commission.  We feel that the BMW region, which has had a significant drop in real GDP and has significant unemployment issues, should be treated as a special case.  We are working on mechanisms to try to maximise the draw down for the BMW region in this context.</p></speech>

Is it possible to reconfigure or redesign the region, that is, to redefine the boundaries of the region at this point in time?  At the time of the drawing up of the BMW region, a lot of political influence was exerted by the previous Government and various counties were included.  At that time, even with the expansion of the region, it was still eligible for funding.  People in certain areas of the region that are more deprived would now feel that the expansion is inhibiting them from availing of more funding.  In that context, is it possible to redefine or even propose a region at this point in time?  Following on from that, is it possible to propose a region that crosses borders and to create, for example, a north-west region or a Border region which would be on both sides of the Border?</p></speech>

Member states can apply to have the categories redefined but it is a complicated process and it would probably take two or three years of negotiations with the EU Commission for that to happen.  The problem is that if we redefined the regions, we would probably have a smaller area that may qualify for "less developed" status but because the population is so small it would not result in much of an increase for that particular area.  We would be decreasing the population covered and population is a key factor in determining the size of the allocation to a region.  We do not envisage looking at the NUTS 2 regions in this context at this time.  However, we will have to look at them in the context of the local government reform agenda and the changes suggested by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the way the administration of local government is structured.  Nonetheless, at this point in time and in the context of these negotiations, we do not consider it to be a runner.  We are trying to focus our energies on maximising BMW draw down through seeking special allocations and examining other criteria.  Success will depend on the negotiations and we must factor in the fact that other regions throughout Europe are in a similar position.  Basically, the EU is taking money from certain areas and giving it to others.  There is only one pot of money there and the question centres on how it is divided up.  We are looking to maximise the BMW draw down but we are also looking to maximise the Irish draw down.  These are the factors we are taking into account but we are trying to address the issue through the talks process.</p></speech>

I have met members of the Commission before and discussed redefining a region which would include the six counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Derry, Fermanagh and Tyrone, which is the most deprived area on the island of Ireland.  The Commission was open to that idea about three or four years ago but said it would be a lengthy process.  Is this possible and is it something Mr. Deane thinks we should pursue?</p></speech>

The allocation is per member state and that is the way the allocations are divvied up.  There is an element of the cohesion policy which deals with territorial co-operation, with which Deputy Doherty will be familiar, which includes the PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  In that context, one can look for eligible regions on a cross-border basis.  Deputy Doherty may be aware that the EU is looking at that in the context of the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, where, for example, one could have a special area that stretches from Belfast to County Meath.  Talks are going on around that process but it is complicated.</p></speech>

This means local groups could be affected and left high and dry with regard to resources that could have been allocated to them as a result of the macro-economics of the member state.  It is a dangerous idea and one we oppose.  Is the Government trying to remove the link with the multi-annual financial framework?</p></speech>

We have concerns about how it will be applied.  The Government is signed up at member state level to ensure that there is fiscal discipline and that measures are in place to ensure that it takes place and that is part of the agenda.  However, within a Cohesion Funds context we must ensure that the application of that does not impact on programme delivery.  We are responsible for taking the legislative package through the EU Council and for the negotiations with the EU Parliament.  We are striving to ensure that there are safeguards in place in order that local people are not penalised for member states not adhering to fiscal discipline requirements.  We believe enough safeguards have been built into the Cohesion Funds regulations such that only if a member state completely disregards direction from the European Commission and the Council on adhering to targets could there be an impact on Cohesion Funds.  I share Deputy Doherty's concern in this regard but we hope we are doing enough to address it in the context of the Cohesion Funds legislative package and we must be cognisant that the Government is signed up to these at EU levels.</p></speech>

There is nothing new in treaties and articles being devoted to the reunification of countries.  In the past we have seen that the reunification of Germany was specifically allowed for in an EU treaty and it allowed the parties to avail of state aid exemptions and so on.  Has there been any discussion whatsoever on the possibility of reunification on the island of Ireland in respect of the MFF and trying to secure additional supports?  It is the stated intention of all parties here, bar one or two of the smaller parties; the larger parties are all in support of Irish reunification.  Does this factor in any way in the negotiations at European level?</p></speech>

I surmise at this stage that it is connected with the fact that there were provisions relating to Cypriot enlargement last time around which may have had some effect on the financial arrangements.  I will find out and get back to Deputy Doherty, but I do not know the reason for that being included at the moment.</p></speech>

I wish to deal with the practical aspect.  Am I correct in saying that what is proposed, ultimately, comes down to money for the State?  Although there is a decrease in percentage terms of gross national income, GNI, the physical amount of money, depending on what I am reading, will go from &euro;994 billion for 2013-17 to &euro;1,033 billion for 2014-20.  There is a physical increase in the absolute amount of money proposed by the Commission at the moment.</p><p>  Let us consider the matter based on table 11.  Some 85% of our funding for 2011 came under CAP, amounting to &euro;1.645 billion out of &euro;1.935 billion.  That means &euro;8.50 from every &euro;10 is coming from Europe through CAP.  The European Social Fund amounts to &euro;112 million, the European Regional Development Fund is &euro;49 million, the Cohesion Fund is down to a little under &euro;9 million and the various others allocations bring the total to &euro;1.935 billion.</p><p>  Let us consider the negotiations and the way funding is allocated to member states and let us bear in mind that in 2011 our net receipts were &euro;586 million according to table 10.  Will the delegation give an indication of the total amount of money we received under the MFF programme and which was negotiated for 2007-13?  Will the delegation seek to maintain that physical level of funding across the programme areas?  Does the delegation understand my question?  In simple terms, my question deals with the physical amount of funding.  Although the percentage has gone from 1.12% in the seven years to 2013 down to 1.03%, under what is being proposed, the physical amount of money to be allocated by Europe is going up.  If inflation is factored in, it has probably gone down in real terms but is the aim of the delegation in the negotiations to maintain or get an increase on the absolute amount of funding received between 2013-17 by 2020?</p></speech>

I also wish to ask a minor question on the European globalisation fund, particularly as there appears to have been a significant reduction between what was originally put forward and the revised proposal.  However, perhaps our guests will deal with the CAP first.  The latter comprises 85% of the budget and is hugely significant for Ireland.</p></speech>

We are in negotiations.  The Commission's original proposal, as to different sets of new figures which were put forward by President van Rompuy in November in respect of heading 2, namely, the CAP, is on the table.  Unfortunately, there are a number of variables so I cannot provide a direct answer to the Deputy's question.  While President van Rompuy put forward various amounts in respect of heading 2 - the overall CAP - what will determine the Irish allocation will be the way in which those funds will be allocated among the member states, both in terms of the direct payments, which come under Pillar 1, and rural development, which comes under Pillar 2.  The Commission has not yet put forward a proposal on rural development allocations.  We are aware of various proposals with regard to the overall rural development allocation for the entire EU.  However, there are no actual figures on the table from the Commission.</p></speech>

However, two problems arise.  The first is that it is being squeezed in the context of the amounts available.  As the size of the overall budget is being cut, CAP and cohesion funding tend to be protected.  However, all other items are continually being trimmed.  It is also subject to some uncertainty because the regulation relating to the fund must be renewed this year.  There is a blocking minority of member states who are opposing this at present but Ireland is obviously not among these countries.  As a result, there is uncertainty in this regard.

At present, just over &euro;52 million comes through the MFF for social infrastructure projects in rural areas.

In the context of the sectoral regulations which govern the Common Agricultural Policy, there are proposals to ensure that at least 10% of member states' rural development funding will have to be spent on Leader projects.  It will depend on how much we obtain in rural development funding but at least 10% of what we do receive will have to be devoted to Leader-type projects.</p></speech>

The type of social in question is extremely important.  Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to the NUTS 2 and BMW regions.  There are large swathes of urban areas which do not receive social infrastructure funding.  They previously received such funding via the Dormant Accounts Fund.  However, there is no longer any social infrastructure funding for urban areas in cities such as Galway, Cork and Dublin.  Are there proposals to rectify the position in this regard through the MFF?  The amounts of money involved are relatively small and rural areas benefited from the &euro;52 million spent through the Leader programmes.  Are there proposals to secure even a small amount of social infrastructure funding for urban areas?  I understand that such proposals exist but I cannot find them in the documentation provided.</p></speech>

I believe the Deputy may be referring to the cohesion legislative package, through which five funds are dealt with.  Under the regulations which govern the ERDF, 5% of a member state's allocation must be devoted to sustainable urban development activities or operations.  It is in this context that ERDF moneys could be used to support initiatives such as those to which the Deputy refers.</p></speech>

This is what gives rise to the deficit in urban areas.  It is for small businesses and allows them to connect with businesses in other cities, etc.  However, it is not used in the context of building social infrastructure such as community centres, halls, sports facilities and so forth.  It is on the latter that the &euro;52 million for rural areas is spent.  There is no similar funding for urban areas which do not suffer from deprivation.</p></speech>

It is one that has been subject to significant reduction in terms of the way the negotiations are going.  That is as a result of pressure from the CAP and cohesion areas.  The MFF discussion will only settle the overall figure for heading 4.  It will not go into the details of the individual spending instruments but we have supported funding for initiatives on food security, sustainable agriculture, the environment and gender equality in particular.  We have pressed that if there are further cuts or cuts to this heading that we would not support an across the board cut.  The larger instruments include: the European neighbour instrument which provides funding for measures in eastern Europe and the southern Mediterranean; the pre-accession instrument which covers countries joining the EU; and development co-operation instrument which covers mostly development work in middle income countries.  We have argued that the cuts should be applied to these instruments rather than to the smaller instruments covering humanitarian aid and other items, as we think they are less likely to impact on the poorest areas.  We have a particularly policy line on this.  We have been projecting that but it is clear that this area of the budget is being squeezed.</p></speech>

This aid programme is very important and I hope that during our Presidency it will be to the forefront in our considerations on this area.  Ireland's overseas aid programme is approximately &euro;639 million and the EU aid's programme is &euro;3.3 billion and, therefore, any significant cut in the EU aid programme would have a huge impact on people in the Third World.  I ask that this be kept to the forefront in next week's negotiations.</p></speech>

Similarly, the data suggest that we have been net recipients but I have analysis from Deutsche Bank - I appreciate none of the witnesses has seen this and I do not expect them to comment on the analysis but they may be aware of it - which uses five different methodologies to determine our position and four of them show us to be net contributors to the tune of between &euro;100 million and &euro;200 million.  The GNI figure on this graph is far lower than the real figure, perhaps it is a very old figure and there are still comparable.  This shows us as being net recipients as opposed to the Deutsche Bank analysis which shows us as being as net contributors.

Let us assume that figures given in <i>The Economist</i> are right, then according to this chart we are somewhat of an outlier.  I can imagine the argument put forward by the net contributor countries such as France, Germany, etc., that Ireland in terms of its GDP <i>per capita</i> and standard wealth metrics is as wealthy as they and yet we are on the wrong side of the line here and why are we not net contributors?  Within the context of very sensitive euro level negotiations on Ireland's debt, the banking debt and all of those issues, is there any reputational risk to us of still being a net recipient even though we are one of the wealthiest countries in the eurozone?</p></speech>

This is an interesting table because it shows where we are <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the EU budget.  Much of it has to do with the nature of the EU budget in that the reality is that CAP and cohesion is the way the EU budget is structured.  Our membership goes back longer than many of the eastern European countries whose cohesion receipts are relatively lower in regard to their GNI.  People at European level are aware that Ireland has been a very successful beneficiary from the EU budget.</p></speech>

We have drawn down significant cohesion funding.  We have been very good at spending it.  We have very good absorption rates, very good rates in terms of proper spending and correctness about that and the cohesion receipts are falling and have been falling for many years and that is correct.  We have a large agricultural sector and we are operating that very well and very much in line with the Common Agricultural Policy.</p></speech>

That mitigates our arguments for special allocations.  Notwithstanding that, we still fight the good fight in that regard, but I accept it is a factor.</p></speech>

Sticking with the net amounts for a moment, the figures we have - let us assume we are net recipients - are in aggregate.  Do the witnesses have analyses for the various pots of European money?  Ms Campbell mentioned earlier that a lot of the pots are open for competitive tender.  In Wicklow I am involved in drawing up strategic plans, seeking investment and a variety of areas where there might be European money.  One of the things I am quite struck by - academic colleagues have told me the same for their research in universities - is that a large amount of money is available but in certain areas in this country we are probably not getting as much of it as we could because we do not know about it.  In academia, when one finds out about the various European pots of money it is fantastic because one knows where to go, but many people do not know.  Similarly, in Wicklow, I found someone who knew about European pots of money.  It turns out that money is available and we are applying for it.  However, it is certainly not something that is uppermost in the minds of those involved in community groups seeking funding.  Has any analysis been done on how good we are at getting access to the various pots, as opposed to the aggregate figure where we appear to be net beneficiaries?</p></speech>

He is from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Research is not included in the table because those who benefit are generally private beneficiaries.  Over the current framework it is approximately &euro;600 million.</p></speech>

Research funding, unlike the funding we have been discussing up to now is funding that is available to the European community on a competitive basis.  Groups of researchers and companies come together on collaborative projects and they apply for funding which is awarded on a competitive basis.</p><p>  In terms of Ireland&rsquo;s success in activating and applying for this money, we currently have a target of &euro;600 million from the current framework programme and we fully expect to achieve the target.  We are doing quite well.  We have already received awards totalling &euro;480 million from the current framework programme.  It is not the case that there is not good awareness in the community, both in academia and in business, we are doing better than the European average.  Research funding is something that is quite well known.  We would expect it to continue during the next programme.  The question related more to community group funding and smaller pots of money.</p></speech>

It would be fantastic if the witnesses could provide some analysis to the committee.  There might be an opportunity for there to be more awareness about some pots of European money to help us activate them.  Would you like me to wrap up, Chair?</p></speech>

I am interested in finding out if there are opportunities in that regard.  I just wonder, for example, about the discrepancy between the figures provided and the Deutsche research.  Perhaps the Deutsche research includes both the public and the private.

The EU budget is growing in real terms.  It might be shrinking as a percentage of GNI but it is still growing in real terms.  As with any bureaucracy around the world, a certain amount of waste can set in.  Has any analysis been done or are there ongoing projects within the institutions to drive down spending?  The area on which people like to focus is wages, although it is usually a small amount of spend.  Have the wages of officials in the European Union been benchmarked against member countries?  What level of wages are being paid?  Are there programmes such as the comprehensive review of expenditure that we have in this country to ensure that all member states are getting value for money out of the European Union?</p></speech>

Heading 5 of the MFF is administration.  I am being shown information from various sides but the answer is &#8220;Yes&#8221;.  This is not part of the MFF <i>per se.</i>  There is an amount for administration.  A number of member states, including Ireland, would like to see the same restraint in member states being mirrored in the administration budget of the institutions.  In the Commission proposal there was a 5% reduction in staffing levels in the institutions.  There is more information in terms of staff regulation which we can make available to the committee.  It is not part of the MFF discussion itself; it is the staff regulation discussion.  We can provide the information if Deputy Donnelly would like it.</p></speech>

The administrative budget, for example, is increasing by more than 10% in real spending terms.  I would not like a situation where a big chunk of the 10% was just going into higher salaries as opposed to setting up useful new pieces of the administration.

In that regard, the so-called security research, which includes large grants to armaments companies in the European Union to produce weapons of mass destruction, is provided for here.  I ask the witnesses to bring my concern about and total objection to that to the attention of the Government.  I would point out, and the witnesses might be able to clarify further, that two weeks ago my colleague Paul Murphy, MEP, in an exchange with Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, asked how Horizon 2020 would work or the current research funding.  Incredibly, in response she stated:<blockquote><br />I think it is important to realise that the areas in which research funding is provided is civilian in nature at all times.  That does not mean of course, however, that funding which is given aspects of security may not be used in any other ways, but we don't have control over that.</blockquote>My colleague pointed out how two Israeli arms manufacturers, for example, got research funding from the European Union.  I accept it is not the witnesses' business to comment or make a judgment on policy but it is mine and I am saying that as far as Horizon 2020 is concerned, I believe the view of a huge majority of the Irish people should be that there would be no further research into the creation of weapons of mass destruction, which is what this is all about.</p></speech>

The Irish Presidency has committed to "work closely with the European Defence Agency".  In terms of the Presidency of the EU, a neutral state, advocating this kind of stuff, I want my objections noted in that regard.  When we have 25 million people unemployed billions of euro in funding should go to infrastructural development for real social progress and to employ people rather than to armaments spending and all the obscenity that involves.</p><p>  I refer to the question of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund which was commented upon earlier.  In an explanatory memorandum to an earlier version of the Council regulation a document points out that while the European Union Solidarity Fund and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund have proven their utility, the maximum amount foreseen under the current financial framework has never been used.  There is a proposal to decrease that but in terms of the experience of many countries, and people in this country, when I was a member of the European Parliament I was involved in trying to assist the Dell workers in Limerick access these funds.  I was part of a delegation from one of the committees that spoke to the Dell workers in Limerick on that.  It was hugely bureaucratic and that was the reason the amount was not taken up.  Rather than cut because of that should the approach not be to eliminate the bureaucracy and make it much more quickly accessible to the workers who need it?  The experience of the workers in Dell is that many of them were in despair at the end of the process.  Do the witnesses have any comment on that?</p></speech>

What we are doing at the moment on the MFF is trying to protect the heading, the allocation for it, but an issue definitely arises about the actual terms of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the way we can access it.  It needs to be made accessible.  We have accessed it for workers in Ireland.  It has been very important here and we would try to maintain that access.  In the context of the MFF, we are trying to protect an allocation of funds to it in the first instance but I agree that in terms of the way the Globalisation Adjustment Fund works, we believe it should be clear and easy to access.  I would imagine that where that is being treated - it is not being treated as part of the MFF - we would take that view.</p></speech>

An explanatory memorandum states: "Article 21 of the CSF Regulation provides for rules on conditionality linked to the coordination of the Member States' economic policies, including the possible suspension of commitments and payments for programmes supported from the Funds covered by the Common Strategic Framework."  In other words, if the targets dictated from Europe on budget deficits, for example, are not met, the funds can be cut as a punishment or sanction.  Is that the officials' understanding?</p></speech>

The cohesion legislative package is one of those.  When the decision on macro-economic conditionality is made at the Council meeting next week, we must reflect it in our cohesion regulations, which apply to the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  We are trying to mitigate the chances of being sanctioned.  If a member state has a procedure taken against it in regard to macro-economic conditionality or its fiscal discipline, the Commission will request that member state to take effective action to address the problem.  It is only where the member state consistently fails to take that action that such a suspension could actually be invoked.  It would be a suspension of funding until such time as the member state could actually take action.  The provision already exists under current regulations in regard to the Cohesion Fund itself.  The suspension has only been threatened once, in the case of Hungary.</p><p>  We want to include language such as "proportionate", "equality of treatment" and "practical".  Only at the end of a long, drawn-out procedure should be an impact on the member state.  We believe the mechanism should apply only if the State wilfully ignored the Commission's recommendations on how it should address its problems.  Ireland, having followed a programme of assistance and having met all its targets in that regard, would not expect the facility to be used against it.</p></speech>

This matter did not feature in the detail during the debate on the fiscal treaty, for example.  There was a general discussion but the detail was never alluded to.  What are the costs that would be incurred if a country did not meet the targets dictated by Brussels in regard to the budget deficit, for example?  Are the sanctions fixed in regard to the funds?  Is the cut a percentage of funding, or is funding withheld?  How does it work?</p></speech>

They also take into account external factors that would contribute to the ability to meet the targets.  The sanctions do not pertain to fixed amounts.</p></speech>

She will also discuss the rights of prisoners in Northern Ireland and the reform process within prisons there.  I advise members that the Prisoner Ombudsman is fully independent of the Northern Ireland Prison Service and her task is to carry out investigations arising from prisoner complaints to her office.  The independence and impartiality of her office is paramount to its effective functioning.  As such, Ms McCabe is not in a position to comment on specific individual cases.  I ask members to bear that in mind in their questions.  I am also aware that the ombudsman has had some contacts with the Prison Service here in the South and I would welcome hearing her ideas on cross-Border co-operation and issues of shared concern for both jurisdictions.</p><p>  Before I call on Ms McCabe to make her presentation, I advise her and Mr. George Richardson, director of operations of the Northern Ireland Prisoner Ombudsman, that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease to make remarks on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence related directly to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I call on Ms McCabe to make her presentation.  The committee is very appreciative of the fact that she has given her time to attend.  From reading background information, I understand that Ms McCabe is involved in very sensitive work.  We appreciate that.  Her organisation is looking forward to having more statutory functions in the next year.  We look forward to her analysis in that regard.</p></speech>

I have, as asked, prepared an overview.  Having presented it, I will be very happy to answer detailed questions.  I thought it would be helpful and relevant to describe the role of the Prisoner Ombudsman and to consider certain issues regarding the context in which I do my job.  The contextual issues are very relevant to the question on which the committee has expressed an interest.  The office of the Northern Ireland Prisoner Ombudsman was established in February 2005 to help to manage recognised tensions in prisons by ensuring that prisoners with problems or concerns had an appropriate and effective way to deal with them.  It follows that in order to be effective, it is vital that there is full confidence in the independence and integrity of my office.  The ombudsman role is, therefore, fully independent of the prison service.  It is important to emphasise that the Prisoner Ombudsman is not a prisoner advocacy service.  Our function is to carry out independent, fair and impartial investigations and to make recommendations for change where appropriate.</p><p>  The office carries out two types of investigation, the first being the investigation of eligible prisoner complaints.  In order for a complaint to be eligible for consideration by the ombudsman, it must first have been considered through the prison service's internal complaints process.  The complaints we consider cover a wide range of areas, many with underpinning human rights obligations.  These can include,<i> inter alia</i>, alleged assaults, bullying and discrimination complaints, regime issues, the prisoner privilege scheme, the use of control and restraint processes, cell-sharing arrangements, the use of spars in safer cells, the conduct of adjudications and the application of punishments.  We are also involved in issues related to the investigation of serious incidents and prisoner transport.</p><p>  Over the last five years, we have taken a number of steps to ensure the office provides an accessible and effective service and to build confidence in our independence and the integrity of our investigations.  I can describe those steps in more detail if members are interested.  Last year, the office received 373 eligible complaints from across the prison estate, which level of demand has continued this year.</p></speech>

Ms McCabe referred to the Anne Owers report, the problem of bringing about change and the need for a cross-party approach to make real change.  Does the Prisoner Ombudsman believe it has been rigorous enough to implement the report and some of the associated issues?  Could more be done with regard to the report?  Major changes must take place, but I believe the process must be rigorous and driven hard to ensure the changes materialise.  Does the Prisoner Ombudsman believe this is the case at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.466" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Pauline McCabe" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013013100005#F00700"><p>I will take the first question first, relating to what is in place to contact the office.  The concern Deputy Feighan expressed is one that I shared when I took up office because of the requirement for prisoners who were contacting the Prisoner Ombudsman to write registering any complaint.  We have completely changed that arrangement.  Now in the case of contacting the Prisoner Ombudsman, prisoners may use the telephone on their landings to make a freefone telephone call to the office.  We receive the call in the office and take details of the complaint.  We have further put arrangements in place such that we immediately access the prison service internal complaints process in order that we can tell the prisoner there and then on the telephone whether the complaint is eligible.  If it is not eligible we can give the prisoner advice and support and encourage him to do whatever he needs to do to address the complaint internally for it to become eligible.  Then, having confirmed that it is eligible, we can take steps to give it to an investigator in order that an investigation can commence.</p><p>  If there is a prisoner for whom English is not his first language, we have an arrangement in place whereby it will be communicated to him in his own language.  Then he can simply ring us and give the name of his country and we will immediately put him in conversation with an interpreter and they can tell us immediately about the complaint they wish to register.  At that stage we will go into the system and inform them immediately whether it is eligible.  Future communications with such prisoners will be in their own languages and, if necessary, our staff will take out interpreters.</p><p>  There is one weakness in the system.  Before prisoners can bring a complaint to us they must take it through the internal complaints process.  That process was reviewed some years ago because it was widely recognised that it was not serving the intended purpose.  We welcome the changes that were made.  For example, the process was reduced from a three-step process to a two-step process.  There was a built-in provision to ensure that once a prisoner had made a complaint, someone had to discuss it with him.  Previously we found many examples of where a prisoner complained but no one discussed the complaint with him.  The main thing it did not achieve - we have constantly registered the fact that we believe it is undesirable - was to address the fact that they still require the internal complaints to be made in writing.  If they are struggling, we encourage prisoners to avail of the services of the Independent Monitoring Board, IMB, to assist them, where necessary.  There are some instances where a trusted member of staff would be able to help, but we would rather have a system whereby prisoners who cannot write can complain without having to do so.</p><p>  The second question related to how vigorously the Anne Owers report is being implemented.  Is it the way I would wish?  Absolutely not.  People have different views on the Patten report on policing but I sat on the Northern Ireland Policing Board.  When it was published, the Patten report offered an implementation plan.  It was comprehensive, fully joined up, all the necessary strands had been identified and interdependent activities had been recognised such that there was a proper sequencing of the things that needed to happen.</p><p>  Given the political situation, this was a little more complex because Dame Anne Owers produced her report and the political responses to it varied.  There was no unanimous view that people wanted to accept the report and implement it.  My interpretation is akin to that of the Minister for Justice in taking the work forward: rather than having a scenario where the Anne Owers report has been accepted, we acknowledge that this is not the case and we now move to see how we can best implement it.  To some extent there has been a necessity to feel our way.  It has been done in more of a step-by-step approach rather than a comprehensive acceptance.  There have been consequences of that.</p><p>  We make a point of meeting each of the political parties on a regular basis.  We welcome the fact that over time because of the dialogue and because of people becoming involved in the issues and understanding the possible benefits of alternative approaches, we have made progress in terms of the commitment to reform.  However, the problem with doing it in that way is that in terms of maximising the return on the investment we are making, the process has not been as clean as I would have liked.  We are making progress step by step rather than having unequivocal support and thus having the opportunity to get stuck in to making it happen.</p></speech>

There are no timeframes because of the step-by-step approach and there are consequences for prisoners within the system.  I do not believe that a step-by-step process is good enough, especially when there have been failures within the system.  Is it possible that pressure can be put on to ensure that the implementation process is time bound?</p></speech>

We approached the justice committee and the Minister for Justice.  We argued from the outset of the need for a joined-up implementation plan.  The matter was discussed at the justice committee several times but the fact is that it did not happen.  However, one welcome development has been the establishment of a change team.  It has not started at the time or from the place we would have wished, but given where we are now, it is trying to produce a comprehensive programme of work.  It is engaging with everyone who has a part to play.  It is starting to consider sequencing issues and to put timescales against activities.  Crucially, it is beginning to do proper costing.  One of the downsides of not having an implementation plan has been that in the absence of one, we cannot say that in a given timeframe this is what we expect it to look like, or that if we make a given investment now, then we will get a given outcome at the other end.  Without it, if we approach different departments with responsibility for health, education or development and so on, and urge them to commit to it, it is very difficult to get commitments.</p></speech>

A group of Senators and Deputies is very concerned with regard to the human rights of certain prisoners in Maghaberry Prison.  The group has made two visits to the facility.  I was involved in the most recent of these, which took place just before Christmas.  We met the authorities at the prison, the prisoners themselves and various groups.  We then met the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, Mr. David Ford, MLA, and several other MLAs at Stormont.  We have since made a request to meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, MP.</p><p>  I accept that Ms McCabe cannot discuss particular prisoners.  However, I am wondering about her involvement in this matter.  Serious concerns have arisen with regard to the fact that some people have been held, without charge, in Maghaberry Prison for some time.  There are also concerns about the dirty protest which took place at the prison over a period of almost two years.  A number of prisoners involved in that protest developed serious health problems.  How is it possible that someone from the prison was brought to a hospital to have a heart procedure and was then returned there while the dirty protest was ongoing?</p><p>  On strip searches, the authorities at Maghaberry informed us that a new machine is being trialled at other prisons.  When will such a machine be introduced at Maghaberry, where there was a serious problem in respect of strip searches?  In my opinion, such searches are an abuse of human rights.  During our visit, I raised the issue of one prisoner, who is now in hospital, in the context of her lack of access to fresh air.  I was informed that she could have been incarcerated in one of the other prisons but these would also have been unsuitable in the context of her health needs.  Some of the health needs of the prisoners are Maghaberry are just not being addressed.</p><p>  My final question relates to Ms McCabe's relationship with the parole commissioners and the Minister.  I have never come across a more obvious example of the ball being kicked from one authority to another because nobody seems to want to assume responsibility for these matters.  We are all concerned about the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace treaties, etc., but I do not believe anybody realises the significance of these human rights issues.  I stress the term "human rights issues" because I am not referring to the political views of the people in question.  What is happening could really undermine the great work that has been done in the past.  Perhaps Ms McCabe will outline her views on that matter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-31a.472" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Pauline McCabe" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013013100006#G00400"><p>I will begin by discussing human rights in general before dealing with the specifics.  When I was preparing my presentation, I tried to provide a long list of examples of the kind of areas in respect of which we consider complaints in order to try to demonstrate the extent to which human rights considerations are relevant to and underpin a great deal of our work.  That is both in terms of the issues we consider via complaints and also in the context of death-in-custody investigations, where issues relating to the right to life, the protection of individuals and vulnerability are very much at the heart of our work.  In the context of how we approach our work, it is absolutely at the centre of everything we do.</p><p>  On the specific points raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, in the past three years we have received a large number of complaints from prisoners in Roe House.  I mention the latter because the Deputy made particular reference to it.  We approach those complaints in the same way we approach all others.  We investigate each one in full.  Very often these are quite complex investigations because a great many factors come into play in determining what is happening, what should happen, what are the restrictions and - there are different perspectives in this regard - what is possible.  In each case we carry out a proper investigation and produce an evidence-based report.  We deal - beginning, middle and end of - in evidence and facts.  We then make recommendations, where we believe it is appropriate to do so, in the context of ways to address issues which arise.</p><p>  Where human rights and health care issues arise - we have considered several cases where matters relating to health care have been at least part of the complaint made - we make recommendations.  On foot of the recommendations we have made over the three years, a great deal of action has been taken.  In the past few weeks, in the aftermath of the conclusion of the most recent protest, we have continued to receive a significant number of complaints from republican prisoners.  This demonstrates that there is an absolute recognition of the completely independent and impartial way in which we do our job, analyse the evidence and - where we deem appropriate - make recommendations which are helpful and constructive.  There have been many instances where we have carried out investigations and come to the view that something which was happening was not appropriate.  In such circumstances, we resolved that, with a degree of creativity, there were better ways of addressing issues.  We have been influential, through our recommendations, in changing things.  There are other instances where we investigate and where we arrive at the view that, in all the circumstances, the Northern Ireland Prison Services is doing everything reasonably possible.  When we come across such cases, we highlight them.  That is my particular experience.</p><p>  In the context of people being held in isolation and as the Chairman explained, I cannot discuss individual cases.  However, this is a subject which concerns me greatly.  In the case of individual prisoners who have been held completely on their own in separate conditions, I have never received any specific complaints to investigate.  I would have contact from solicitors and family members and I make a point of ensuring that they know what they need to do if they wish to bring a complaint to me in order that I might carry out an independent investigation.</p><p>  I make it my business to keep abreast of what is happening in prisons because context is everything when I am examining complaints and making appropriate recommendations.  It would be my impression that, in very difficult circumstances, it is generally the case that the Northern Ireland Prison Service tries very hard to provide the best regime possible.  I have received complaints from other prisoners about the fact that the Northern Ireland Prison Service has made special efforts - on foot of concerns about isolation and people being held on their own - to ensure there is ample family contact for individuals.  The latter can cause great difficulties, particularly for women prisoners, who would dearly love to enjoy the same level of family contact and who feel aggrieved that the same facility is not accorded to them.</p><p>  When we carry out an investigation, we try to consider the complaint comprehensively and take on board all of the issues and challenges involved.  What we are always seeking to do is discover whether there is an appropriate and constructive recommendation which we can make and which might be helpful.  I have considered many complaints in respect of prisoners held in the care and supervision unit, CSU, for long periods.  I have clearly stated in my reports - I have also made recommendations in this regard - that the quality of regime we can offer prisoners incarcerated in the CSU presents serious challenges.  I am concerned about this matter and I am currently dealing with complaints from people held in the CSU.  I will be reconsidering the position with regard to what we are providing and making recommendations if I deem it appropriate to do so.</p><p>  There are circumstances which present real challenges for the Northern Ireland Prison Service, not least where there is massive overcrowding and where there is huge pressure on resources.  For example, there are a great many prisoners in Maghaberry who are sharing cells at present.  Even when there is a real wish to be constructive, all sorts of practical difficulties can arise.  There are occasions on which we also consider the extent of the wish to be constructive.  We survey everything in the round and try to ensure that we make evidence-based findings and recommendations.</p><p>  On strip searches or full-body searches, as we refer to them, the question the Deputy posed really needs to be addressed to the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  From a human rights perspective, we have always stated our belief that searching should be as non-intrusive as possible.  There is a major issue with drugs in Northern Ireland prisons.  We have reported a number of deaths in custody recently in which there is every chance that medication and drug abuse may have played a part.  It is clearly the case that, in terms of self-harm, drugs are an absolute scourge with which we really must deal.  Searches should be as non-invasive and dignified as possible, not least because we must also cater for the needs of prisoners with mental health problems and learning difficulties.  We have always advocated that every effort should be made to identify methodologies which will ensure that the Northern Ireland Prison Service can do its job in the most respectful way possible.</p></speech>

We have the Good Friday Agreement and we have had St. Andrews Agreement and the Hillsborough Agreement and the net result is that all other aspects of the criminal justice system have been reformed with the exception of the prison service.  Ms McCabe said in her report that her office is not yet on a statutory footing, that there is no implementation plan and that 90% of her recommendations are accepted.  I would like to refer to the 10% and the quality of those that are not accepted.  More than 70% of the prisoners have more than one mental health problem.  How does that affect their ability to even understand or know how to relate to Ms McCabe's office?</p><p>  I would like Ms McCabe to comment on what Maureen said about parole commissioners.  The case of Marian Price is under current review but it seems to be under review for a very long time.  She is being held in Belfast City Hospital in a secure wing in isolation.  She gets very little exercise and then it is after 12 o'clock at night.  Martin Corey is being held on the basis of closed evidence that nobody has any notion what it is about.  We would need, in the atmosphere of the Good Friday Agreement, to have that all flushed out.  I ask Ms McCabe to comment on that, particularly around the points of resistance in the system for the reform of the prison service.</p></speech>

The treatment of prisoners and their families is a measure of how civilised a society is and historically we know that what happened in prisons in Ireland certainly impacted on wider society.  There was mention of strip searching.  I have talked to prisoners who were totally isolated, kept in sterile areas and had no real contact with the public but yet they were strip searched on a regular basis.  I talked to some prisoners in the past who were in prison in England who were strip searched three, four or five times a days and they would have had no contact with the general public.  There was a view that strip searching was used to degrade and to break those prisoners.  The fact that strip searching is still being carried out in sterile areas of a jail does not add up.  It is uncivilised and degrading for a person to have to undergo that.  Modern technology can overcome the need for it but it is not being used throughout the prison system.  We know from our experience of going through airport security that physical barriers have been introduced where people are searched.  I cannot understood why strip searching is being used in the prisons and it is not only in the North that it is being used.</p><p>  Ms McCabe mentioned that this is related to there being a big drug problem but historically there would not have been a huge drug problem on republican wings, of which I was ever aware, yet strip searches are being carried out on those prison wings.  Does Ms McCabe's office have a view on the use of strip searches and their effectiveness?  What has been found from strip searching prisoners, particularly those on the loyalist and republican wings?  What has been found in recent years on foot of strip searches?  Is it known how many strip searches are carried out?  Are there statistics?</p><p>  Many of us want to bring about change.  Change has taken place in the courts, the police service, Ms McCabe's office, the probation service and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions but the last bastion when it comes to change seems to be the prison service.  The lack of such change has a huge impact not only on the prisoners but on their families who have to go to the prison to visit them.</p><p>  Ms McCabe mentioned overcrowding.  Is her office concerned about overcrowding, particularly in the republican and loyalist wings as she mentioned that cells are being shared?  Has Ms McCabe expressed a view on the difficulties that are possibly coming down the track in this regard?</p><p>  With regard to those prisoners who are isolated, as in the case of Marian Price who is totally isolated, her only exercise is walking down a corridor.  She has no access to an outdoor area or to the sun, rain or snow.  She is isolated because she is a special case because of her medical condition.  The fact that in this day and age we can still isolate people in this way, people who are seriously ill, says a lot about the society that allows that to happen.</p></speech>

I should say, for the purposes of clarification, that there are no republican prisoners sharing cells in case I misled the Mr. Doherty in any way because he made that comment.  It is in the integrated population that prisoners are sharing.</p></speech>

I was simply giving one of the perspectives expressed.  Deputy Crowe put forward the point of view that one of the reasons people are subject to full body searches in prison as a whole relates to the movement of drugs.  The point was made that republican prisoners say that they do not use drugs in prison, which is supported by the evidence.  All I was saying is that when we do our investigations and look at the various arguments that are put forward, one of the arguments put forward by the prison service, which I understand, is that if one accepts that one group should not be searched, then there could be many circumstances where one should extend the argument to other groups.</p></speech>

I listened to other members when they were asking questions and I would like them to listen to me asking mine.  In December we visited Maghaberry Prison.  Some of my colleagues in my party were aghast and asked me why I was doing that but because I had faith in the former Cabinet Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, he invited me to accompany him and I did so.  I was shocked and horrified by what I heard from the different groups we met.  One of the groups we met had just come off the dirty protest and they said that some of the prison officers were using sexual connotations.  I will not repeat what they told us but it was to the effect that now that they were off the dirty protest they will be into this.</p><p>  We also visited Marian Price.  It is beyond me why she is being held in that prison.  She is physically unable to move.  As Ms McCabe is aware, her sister Dolours died a few days ago.  Marian told us that when she was being sent to the hospital for X-rays she was double handcuffed.  Having met the woman I know she is not able to run away but the way she is being kept there is cruel.  This is the issue Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is concerned about, namely, people being held there because they had a record in the past.  If the Government in the North has an issue with them, it should be brought to due legal process.</p><p>  When I returned I advised my colleagues who had told me I should not go to visit the prison.  On 17 December my observations were vindicated by Chief Inspector Brendan McGuigan, who issued his report on Maghaberry Prison, and everything we had heard on our visit two weeks earlier was in his report.  It referred to violent bullying, intimidation, overcrowding and significant weaknesses in the system.  He criticised the system in Maghaberry Prison.</p><p>  In as brief a reply as possible I would like to know what Ms McCabe intends to do about that.  When I visited the prison I was stand-offish about the people I would meet because I am totally supportive of the peace process, but I was shocked by what the prisoners told us, and it was vindicated within a week in Mr. Brendan McGuigan's report.  I will not labour the point.  We have to get to the bottom of this to keep the peace process in place.  That is the reason I and my colleagues visited the prison.  As briefly as she can do so I ask Ms McCabe to outline what she intends to do about Mr. Brendan McGuigan's report on Maghaberry Prison.</p></speech>

She certainly knows her stuff.  Prisons are very difficult places to manage and control, if that is the right word, and all sorts of tensions arise between prisoners in addition to mental health issues and education issues.  That is a tough environment for anybody to work in and we must accept that.</p><p>  We talk about the four healthy prison tests of safety, respect, purposeful activity and resettlement.  Does Ms McCabe examine those or does she deal with specific individual complaints, and does she reference those complaints to those issues?  What are the two most common complaints she deals with?  What two actions would she regard as most important in improving the situation in the North's prisons?</p></speech>

I must respectfully point out that I do not run the prison service and therefore responding to the inspector's report is the job of those who do support the prison service.  What we try to do through our day-to-day work and our other efforts is encourage, support and drive in any way we can the need for a positive and constructive response to the inspector's report.</p><p>  In fairness, because we deal in evidence, it is important to point out that the inspector also reported some evidence of improvement at Maghaberry-----</p></speech>

I have explained this.  I have felt very frustrated, as have others, at the time it has taken to get the prison reform programme off the ground.  I have explained that some very important developments are now happening, but if they are to deliver the change required, other very important developments must happen with urgency and taken forward in a joined-up way.  The current efforts are very much targeted at doing that.  Anne Owens made the point that there is no point in cherry-picking.  She said what we need is root and branch reform and a joined-up approach to all of this process.</p><p>  In terms of the specifics the Senator raised when she spoke to the prisoners, I come back to the fact that by far my biggest client group would be the republican prisoners.  What I do each and every time, and sometimes I get multiple complaints about the same topic but sometimes I get individual ones, is carry out an investigation and, on the basis of facts and evidence, make the most helpful and constructive recommendations possible.  It is very important for me to investigate properly and gather the evidence regarding what the prison service is saying and what the republican prisoners are saying.  We deal in evidence and I find that, generally, in terms of moving forward, that is the most constructive approach to adopt.</p><p>  I have no doubt that when somebody comes into prison, comments are made, and in many instances we find there is substance to those comments, but I cannot comment in general because what I do when I get a complaint is carry out the kind of investigation I have described.  When I find things I believe are wrong, in breach of prison rules or in breach of human rights, I do not hesitate to go straight to the people who need to do something about addressing them.</p><p>  On the issue of Marian Price, I have said that I do not have a complaint and anyway I could not talk about an individual case.  I would respectfully point out, however, that we have to make a distinction in terms of those who believe there is a question around whether she should be in prison.  My interest as prison ombudsman is the way we are looking after and responding to the needs of whoever is in the prison.  That is the part of the equation with which I am concerned.  I believe the other questions are for others.</p></speech>

I receive complaints in which unequal outcomes are alleged.  When I receive them, I examine them very seriously and go to great lengths to obtain the necessary statistics and analyse them.  We recently dealt with several complaints across the spectrum and noted the various reasons for which people believe they may have been picked on.  They are related to search arrangements.  When I examined them very thoroughly, I found there were system flaws that meant the information on which the prison service has been relying is actually flawed.  Recommendations have now been made for an overhaul of the way the information is captured so the service will have a more accurate picture.</p><p>  In any organisation, it is in everyone's interest that there be a representative workforce.  In the case of policing, there are excellent officers who do a good job, but perceptions are as important as reality.  Having a representative workforce is the best way of ensuring everybody feels he is treated fairly and equally.  Clearly, this is not the starting point in the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  The service recognises fully the need to monitor very carefully what is happening in that respect.  That we have identified that the figures being produced were flawed means, I hope, that the information gathered henceforth will be more accurate.  The Equality Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission show a keen interest in this subject.</p></speech>

While it was a tragedy for the prison service, Mr. Black's family was the most devastated.  Terrible hurt has been caused among many families and there is no escaping that.  At a time when people are working so hard to try to move forward constructively and change the culture - I am not referring to the personal tragedy - the activity to which the Senator alluded has not helped in any way.  A great many prisoners from right across the spectrum who knew Officer Black spoke very highly of him.  Prisoners and the authorities were equally saddened by his death.  In a funny way, there was quite a lot of bonding as a result of what occurred because people were united in condemning the murder.</p></speech>

The rate frequently runs to approximately 95%.  In the case of death-in-custody investigations, the rate is usually 100%.  There is nothing particularly significant about the ones that are not accepted.  They may not be accepted by the service because it feels it may not be able to deliver on them for practical reasons.  From time to time, evidence pertaining to an individual complaint may suggest a decision was not appropriate, respectful or prison service compliant.  We may recommend that somebody should be compensated over a matter but the prison service, for various reasons, may refuse to accept that.  I do not automatically accept its view in that regard.  If, on examination, we really do feel the failure to implement one of our recommendations was quite unjust, we try quite hard to achieve change.  On occasion, and if necessary, we go to other people who may be more willing to recognise the justice of the recommendation and implement change.  We try to ensure the recommendations are relevant, deliverable, achievable and cost effective.  There will be times, albeit very occasionally, on which a decision might be regarded as disproportionate, for example.</p></speech>

A great many complaints I received at the time of the first republican prisoner protest in April 2010 related to the extent of lockdowns.  We were involved in work for an extensive period that predated all the recent protests.  Significant regime changes resulted from our recommendations.  Prior to the commencement of the additional protests, there had been some very substantial changes to the regime.  Any time I make a recommendation in Roe House, I always extend it to Bush House.  I talk to the prisoners in the latter so they will understand why we are making the recommendations.</p><p>  Cellular confinement is undesirable.  However, the complaints I have received on this over the years demonstrate it is necessary to examine individual circumstances.  Issues arise such as personal protection for individuals.  Some prisoners, for various reasons, actually want to be on their own and are very resistant to our best efforts to remove them from cellular confinement.  In each case, I must examine the evidence, interview all the people concerned and try to determine what constructive recommendations we can make in order to make progress.  I have made absolutely clear today that locking up people for long periods does no good whatsoever.</p></speech>

One has voluntary isolation primarily for the purpose of self-protection for whatever reason.  There also can be voluntary isolation for people who like to be in that situation.  Then there is solitary confinement as a means of punishment.  To judge from what the ombudsman has stated, she thinks involuntary isolation or solitary confinement is not right.  Has she made a recommendation to that effect?</p></speech>

Prison service rules provide that sometimes there is cellular confinement as a punishment.  There now are much stricter rules on how long people should be confined and on what facilities to which they will have access.  These rules have changed significantly over time in respect of what this actually means.  Members should remember that I am complaint-driven and in each case I get, I look at it, at the regime and the circumstances and I constantly make constructive recommendations on how the individual circumstances of the particular case can be addressed.  I could not possibly make a recommendation stating there should never be cellular confinement because as I noted, there will be circumstances in which that simply could not be delivered in the context of protecting an individual.</p></speech>

I also - significantly in my opinion - have influenced the fact that wherever possible, there are more constructive ways of punishing people than cellular confinements.  In a recently-published report, I made a point regarding circumstances in which people engage in serious bullying and cellular confinement is used as the punishment.  While I believe there must be consequences when people bully, one of the most likely outcomes in such circumstances is that the minute the person in question comes out of cellular confinement, he or she will be twice as motivated to go and bully the person who he or she initially was motivating and who now has resulted in him or her having a period of cellular confinement.  Consequently, I believe that in many circumstances, there are much better ways of dealing with bad behaviour and many of the reports and recommendations we have made over time have influenced that.  As to whether I have made a recommendation stating that cellular confinement should never be used as a punishment, no I have not.</p></speech>

Members should bear in mind while the position is improving all the time, in prisons in Northern Ireland we have had a situation in which people have been locked up for long periods - I believe you have experienced the same problem at times - when it has nothing to do with punishment but pertains to the absence of proper regimes, purposeful activity and everything else.  I refer to a situation in which it is a way of life that people are locked up for long periods and not something that is just used as a punishment.  The Deputy may have read my report on Allyn Baxter, which I published last year.  He was a young man who died in Hydebank Wood Prison and who, following committal, had been locked up for 23 hours a day.  I unequivocally explained exactly what were the consequences of those kinds of lock-downs.  We have made this a public issue and it now is at the heart of the prison reform programme and is utterly recognised in respect of policies and procedures for dealing with vulnerable prisoners.  However, we have a long way to go.</p></speech>

We appreciate the work in which she is involved in a constantly evolving environment, which hopefully is evolving in the right direction.  I have two questions.  The ombudsman referenced the importance of cross-community representation among prison officers, as it is conducive to a more positive environment.  How important is balanced cross-community representation in the recruitment of prison officers, if they are being recruited at present?  Second, having read the United Kingdom commission's proposal on a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom, I noted there were many references to prisoners' rights.  One of the outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement is a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  How important is a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland in respect of prisoners' rights and the work in which the ombudsman is involved?</p></speech>

I believe it is established good practice everywhere that it is in our interests to have a workforce that is representative of the people for whom they are responsible for whom they care and to whom they deliver a service.  We are in the middle of a major recruitment process in Northern Ireland to recruit new officers.  A severance programme is operational and officers are leaving the service, while other officers are being recruited and already have started to move out into prisons and to become part of the prison workforce.  The director general made a public statement not very long ago in which she expressed disappointment that the balance achieved, with regard to the people being appointed, is not what the service would have wished.  As for the predominance of appointments, there have been more male and more Protestant appointments than there have been Catholic or those designated as "other".  Obviously, when the Patten programme was rolled out, 50:50 recruitment was in place, which basically made sure that those who were recruited into the service, certainly with regard to the Catholic-Protestant ratio, were recruited in an equal measure.  However, within the prison service, the issues of gender, foreign nationals, disability and all those other areas of representation are absolutely as important.  Consequently, moving forward-----</p></speech>

I think the final appointment worked out at approximately 65:35.  Sorry, it was 65:25.  It would be necessary to carry out a detailed analysis of the proportion of those applying versus those appointed and so on.  On the positive side, I note that I have invested significant effort in running sessions for all the new officers coming in.  I go to the college and run sessions for all of them and take the opportunity to engage with them and talk about the way forward.  I must state the quality of people actually being recruited and the experience and attitudes they bring have been hugely encouraging.  We just need to make efforts in the future to encourage applicants who are more representative.  In fairness, with the wisdom of hindsight, perhaps not enough effort was put into encouraging applicants from right across the community.  In policing, I was on the board when civilian recruitment was being considered and even though we did not have a 50:50 ratio, we did a colossal amount of work to encourage under-represented groups to apply.  While this is easy with hindsight, perhaps people did not recognise there may have been a greater need to do this than was appreciated and that it will be quite important in the future.</p></speech>

However, I believe there will be opportunities in the future.  I can only reiterate that notwithstanding the representation issues, my experience of the people who were selected through the recruitment process that was applied is that the attitude they bring and their commitment to playing their part has been extremely encouraging.</p><p>  On the issue of the Bill of Rights, I am aware that people have very different views.  While I see a lot of merit in the Bill of Rights, not having it cannot be a reason for not doing absolutely everything we need to do.  Irrespective of that, it is absolutely within our gift to be able to sort out and to develop the kind of prison service we need in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>It would be helpful, of course. </p></speech>
