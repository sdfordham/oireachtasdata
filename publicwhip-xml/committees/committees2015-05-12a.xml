I thank the witnesses for appearing before the joint committee to brief members on the Department's six monthly report on developments in the European Union in the period from July to December 2014.  While Mr. O'Driscoll accompanied the Minister to a previous meeting of the joint committee, this is the first time he will address the committee in his role as Secretary General.  I extend my best wishes to him and his team in their role.</p> <p>  I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity outside the House by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea and Mr. Harty attended our meeting of 28 April last at which we discussed the issue of land eligibility.  A number of issues raised at the meeting were clarified subsequently in correspondence received from Dr. Kevin Smyth.  I also thank Dr. Smyth for the revised eligibility guide he submitted.  I invite Mr. O'Driscoll to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015051200002#H00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his good wishes on my appointment.  I will convey his comments to Dr. Kevin Smyth and his colleagues.</p> <p>  I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to address it on EU developments in the agriculture sector in the latter half of 2014.</p><p>CAP simplification was an issue that arose towards the end of that period and I will cover this also in my opening statement.</p><p> The committee has in front of it the six monthly report on EU developments for the period July to December 2014, which shows the number of dossiers progressed during the Italian Presidency.  Given the significant EU institutional changes in 2014, the European Parliament elections and the appointment of the new Commission, policy developments in the period in question were fewer than in other years.</p><p> Before I begin, I want to correct a typographical error on page 2 of the report, relating to the schools&rsquo; schemes.  The Commission is recorded in the report as seeking to ensure that aid rates for these schemes would be set exclusively by the Council.  In fact, it is the Council that is seeking this.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal provided for co-decision. </p><p> One of the most significant developments in the past six months of 2014 was the set of conclusions adopted by the European Council on climate change.  The Council acknowledged the low mitigation potential in the agriculture and land use sector.  It asked the Commission to consider how best to encourage the sustainable intensification of food production, while optimising the sector&rsquo;s contribution to greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration, including through afforestation.  The detailed policy on how to include land use and forestry in the 2030 framework will be agreed before 2020.  The inclusion of this text, largely drafted by Ireland, was highly significant for future policy on agriculture, forestry and climate change in the EU, particularly with regard to the 2030 emission reduction targets.  It was the first time that EU leaders acknowledged the specific challenges involved in ensuring coherence between the EU&rsquo;s food security and climate change objectives.  This text also broadly reflects the views expressed when agriculture Ministers previously discussed this matter, again at the prompting of Ireland.</p><p> The impact of the Russian ban on EU agriculture products was discussed at several Council meetings during the course of the Italian Presidency.  The dairy and fruit and vegetable sectors across the EU were most affected by the ban and the Commission introduced a number of market support measures to assist producers in these sectors, including an aid to private storage scheme that was extensively used by Irish operators.  A special compensation package was introduced for dairy producers in the Baltic states and Finland who were severely impacted by the ban. </p><p> The funding of these measures was an issue, with the Commission proposing the use of the agriculture crisis reserve fund.  The Commission subsequently withdrew its proposal following strong objections from a number of member states, including Ireland.  We took the view that EU farmers were disproportionately affected by a decision that was taken from a political and security policy perspective, and that, in these circumstances, expenditure should not be confined to EU agriculture budget lines only.</p><p> The EU Commission has continued to provide updates on the market situation consequential to the ban and information on the measures that it has taken to address the situation.  From an Irish perspective, our dairy and seafood sectors were most affected but with significant impacts also on our pigmeat sector.  Until the imposition of the ban, Russia had been seen as a priority market for growth of exports, with our agrifood exports having increased exponentially, by some 460%, in the years leading up to the ban.  </p><p> The next main topic dominating discussions during the Italian Presidency was the future of the dairy sector, in preparation for the abolition of milk quotas in 2015.  Ireland strongly supported the abolition of the milk quota regime and along with other member states continued to call on the Commission to introduce support measures to ensure a &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo;, to mitigate the impact of superlevy fines, in the run up to the expiry of milk quotas on 31 March 2015.  Unfortunately, agreement between member states could not be reached and Irish dairy producers are now faced with a superlevy bill of approximately &euro;69 million euro.  The Commission has introduced a facility which will enable farmers to pay the superlevy bill in instalments.  Department officials are currently finalising the implementation details and the Minister will make a further announcement on this in due course.</p><p> As to legislative dossiers, the organics dossier was comprehensively examined in 2014 during both the Greek and Italian Presidencies.  This is a proposal to revise the EU rules on organic production with a view to generating further growth in the EU organic sector and to reinforcing consumer confidence in the area.  This dossier has continued into 2015 under the Latvian Presidency.  It has re-examined the proposal at both political and technical level and has produced a substantially revised text covering areas such as the scope of the proposal, rules governing the conversion period, the presence of unauthorised substances in organic products, the co-existence of organic and conventional farming on the same holding, the import regime and controls.  The Latvian Presidency hoped to achieve a general approach at Council yesterday, that is, an agreement on the Council's position, and, while good progress was made, further meetings of the Council will be required to secure agreement, which they hope to achieve in June.</p><p> The Italian Presidency discussed a number of other legislative proposals during its tenure, including the four part animal and plant health package and the school fruit and milk scheme.  On the animal and health package, there was good progress on the animal health dossier, which updates and consolidates European Union law on animal health.  The Italian Presidency secured a general approach from Council on this dossier and we expect the successful conclusion of an agreement with the European Parliament by the end of May.  </p><p> Work is continuing under the Latvian Presidency on the plant health and official controls dossiers.  Again, the objective of these proposals is to modernise and consolidate the existing legislation in these areas.  The fourth part of the package, the plant reproductive material proposal, was withdrawn by the Commission for redrafting, following the European Parliament&rsquo;s rejection of it last year, and no further progress has been made on this proposal to date.</p><p> There was disagreement too within the Council on the proposal to merge the rules covering the school fruit and school milk schemes.  Further discussion on this dossier has been suspended pending the outcome of the Commission&rsquo;s evaluation of the state of play as part of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, simplification exercise.</p><p> The Council also discussed ways of strengthening EU policies for young farmers and the position regarding error rates in agriculture expenditure.  The Council adopted a series of conclusions concerning the latter, while Presidency conclusions were adopted regarding the former.</p><p> There were a number of developments in trade negotiations in the period covered by the report.  Some of these negotiations, including those with Japan, the United States and the MERCOSUR group of South American countries, are very important for EU and Irish agriculture and I would be happy to provide the committee with further information on the current state of play.  At present there is much attention on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations between the EU and US.  The ninth round of these negotiations took place last month and a tenth round is scheduled for July.  There are high-level commitments from both sides to conclude substantive negotiations by the end of 2015 but opinion is divided on whether this deadline will be met.</p><p> Turning to CAP simplification, the background is that, following his appointment last November, EU Commission President Juncker set simplification of the CAP as a priority for the incoming Agriculture Commissioner, with an instruction that, in the first year, he should concentrate on direct payments and greening, in particular, rural development, quality policy and the fruit and vegetables regime.  Thus, in January last Commissioner Hogan launched a screening exercise within the Commission of agricultural legislation to identify elements that could either be simplified or left to member states.  The Commission initiative is ongoing and was guided by three principles - first, maintaining the basic political decisions taken under CAP reform; second, no weakening of sound financial management or increase in error rates; and, third, prioritisation of areas of greatest concern to farmers and other beneficiaries.</p><p> The Commission then wrote to all member states inviting their suggestions for CAP simplification.  Over 500 pages of suggestions were submitted by member states and these are currently being examined by the Commission.</p><p> The Latvian Presidency has pursued this initiative actively and has scheduled a number of debates at the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers.  Yesterday, the Council adopted a series of conclusions, the main thrust of which are to identify the areas of the CAP most in need of simplification and to maintain pressure on the Commission to come up with simplification initiatives later this year to address these issues.</p><p> Turning to the content of the simplification, Ireland has contributed actively to the simplification initiative.  We have made a written submission to the Presidency and have participated actively in the debates at Council.  The main focus of Ireland&rsquo;s submission is to ensure stability, certainty and subsidiarity in the application of the rules in place.  This means ensuring that the Commission does not issue revised interpretations with retroactive effect or create new conditions and requirements by means of interpretative notes and implementing regulations, where no specific provisions already exist.  We have provided a number of examples of specific instances where improvements could be made.  These relate to interpretations taken by the Commission on equivalent greening measures, the definition of catch crops and the adjacency of landscape features and buffer strips to land parcels.  We have also identified a number of elements in the Commission delegated and implementing acts that should be simplified.  These relate largely to greening requirements and controls.  In particular, we have drawn attention to the disproportionate impact on smaller farmers of the formula for deductions and sanctions for over-declarations and to the complicated formula for reductions and penalties for breaches of greening requirements.</p><p> I would be happy to provide further detail to the committee, if the members wish.  I understand they have already have received a copy of our submission.</p><p>Our essential point is that the adoption of Commission acts, as well as delegated and implementing acts, was rushed, and the outcome is a very complicated set of rules which is a prime candidate for simplification.</p><p> We have also drawn attention to the need to streamline and simplify the approval process for rural development programmes.  This is an extremely cumbersome and complicated process which is very resource-intensive and can ultimately give rise to delays in the implementation of rural development programmes.  This is a key issue for us, which will, of course, also affect future amendments to programmes.</p><p> We will continue to interact with the Commission and with other member states to ensure that our proposals are followed up.  The Commission has engaged positively in the process to date, and yesterday put forward a number of initial suggestions, which we are examining.  A number of member states have called for a mid-term review by 2017 of the basic legislation on the CAP.  We are wary of such a review so soon into the implementation process, as we believe it would not be confined to simplification but would result in an unpicking of the CAP reform agreement reached in 2013, less than two years into its implementation.  Nevertheless, there will be continued pressure to sort out anomalies in this basic legislation, and this could lead eventually to more wide-ranging CAP reform.  </p><p> It should be remembered that the Commission had already made a commitment to the European Parliament in April of last year that it would have another look at the greening provisions after the first year of implementation.  Of course, the 2013 CAP reform agreement already provides for an evaluation of the ecological focus areas provisions by the end of March 2017.  Moreover, the current multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for the EU budget will expire in 2020, and the debate on the MFF for the next period will inevitably generate a discussion on the future of the CAP after 2020, either in late 2017 or in 2018.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015051200002#L00200"><p>My first question concerns climate, agriculture and the targets for reducing the carbon footprint.  From negotiations to date, how much is the Irish cattle herd at risk because of climate change proposals?  Is the Council of agriculture Ministers working to ensure that we continue to produce beef in the countries that can do it most carbon-efficiently and that there is a rebalancing of the carbon targets to take this into account?</p> <p>  Could Mr. O'Driscoll give us some measure of the impact of the Russian ban on EU agricultural products?  Has he any idea of the potential risk of agriculture being used in other international disputes?  Could the EU get retaliatory action from other important countries involved in foreign policy issues that we do not agree with?  If China was to do something we did not like, is there a risk that we could get into an agriculture war because of Tibet or something similar?  Has any risk analysis been done in developing all these new markets?  How much are we now at risk of these retaliatory wars, particularly with regard to countries such as China, whose human rights record is not exactly perfect, or the Middle East countries?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll discussed the milk quota and the superlevy.  Has he any idea how this is going to work?  Can we take it that there will be no interest charged to farmers?  Can he give us some detail on how this will work in layman's terms?  Maybe he could also outline the logic of the European Union imposing this superlevy when it knew that forever-and-a-day quotas were gone.  How is it that common sense did not prevail and that the countries who at least wanted the superlevy ameliorated this year made zero ground on the issue?  Deferring a debt does not reduce the debt; it will just be there as a debt on the balance sheet.</p><p> With regard to the agricultural trade negotiations, we are talking about the end of 2015.  The impression given, particularly by the Government, seems to be that in the TTIP negotiations, agriculture might be an unfortunate consequence of getting this much greater deal.  I do not understand the logic of saying that when we bring down the barriers, we will get extra trade because that means the consumer  is spending more money, unless we are taking the trade from other countries.  The normal logic of free trade is that everyone consumes more but, of course, that is not very good from an ecological point of view.  I am always a little puzzled that on the one hand, we are talking about climate change while on the other hand, we are saying we need consumers to buy more, even if they do not really need these things.</p><p> To focus on agriculture, how certain is the Department that it can defend small-scale European and Irish agriculture from the mega-scale, much less regulated American agriculture, and that the "industrial interest" will not trump the Irish agricultural interest in these TTIP negotiations?  It would seem that even within this country - we are not the biggest industrial country in the world - the industrial interest just wants to steamroll this through and there is a brushing aside of the agricultural interest.  I would be very interested in what might happen in that regard.</p><p> Unfortunately, I did not get the chance to print this document sent to us yesterday until today as Monday is always a busy day.  It refers to the simplification of CAP.  My God.  When the single farm payment came in, it was meant to be a simplification in the sense that the farmer would get the payment and there would be a disadvantaged area payment and a REP scheme and life would be simple forever.  Now a suckler cow farmer would want to be in six schemes to try to get money out of it.  Who is at fault?  It is the farm organisations, the Department and Europe.  We never seem to get it into our heads that if there is a finite pot, creating more schemes does not increase the pot; it just means one has to apply for more schemes to get the same money.</p><p> That is a universal rule people seem to ignore.  It is like creating and destroying matter.  The pot from Europe is finite.  We had a brilliant example of this in the last week.  This CAP, in particular, has an element to it which means an awful lot of the money will actually go to consultants, professionals and vets and not to farmers.  We saw that with the beef schemes, where &euro;500 was going to the planner and &euro;750 to the farmer.</p><p> With regard to the genomics scheme, the witnesses might explain to us how and why a payment per animal suddenly become a payment per hectare.  Why is it that, if one joins for six years, one cannot get out of it?  Why is it that, irrespective of anything, it has to involve four-star or five-star bulls?  Why is it this and why is it that?  An awful lot of farmers have looked at this and said: " It is six years of this and if anything goes wrong, I cannot reduce my herd or change anything."  We know a lot of farmers are older and they are being told to please keep away.  It is a classic example of how complicated we are making everything.</p><p> I think this is quite simple.  If the factories were consistently paying premium prices for premium cattle, the farmers would do whatever needed to be done in order to get the premium cattle at the premium prices and they would find their own way to do it.  They would not need all of these regulated schemes, with paperwork and penalties, to achieve it.</p><p>What is happening is that many of these schemes are based on a false market.  The Department cannot get the factories to deliver on the price so it tries to get the improvements even though the factories are paying a flat rate, because it thinks it would be a good idea if there were better cattle and it knows the factories are not willing to pay the premium price for the premium animals all the time.  However, we who are dealing with farmers have found out that all it does is fill up our clinics with all sorts of weird and wonderful situations where people are penalised.</p><p> With regard to the LPIS, twice in the last week farmers came to me with maps produced by the Department in the last year under the LPIS where there was no, or a very minor, penalty.  In both cases the Department has reviewed some of the land again on a Bing map and there are now 100% penalties.  Again, farmers find that they do not know what will arrive in the post from one day to another.  They think they are in the clear, they have the map and the map states what is the reference area, but suddenly they get another map.  I favour simplification, but the programme of simplification here does not appear to be farmer-centred.  It appears to be bureaucrat-centred and does not deal with the issues of simplification which the farmers I deal with require.  They are getting caught on the rules all of the time and a genuine error is mortally penalised.</p><p> I welcome the reference to examining the issue of small discrepancies in areas for small farmers.  I hope there is a quick fix on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015051200002#N00200"><p>I welcome Mr. O'Driscoll and his officials, and I congratulate him on his appointment as Secretary General.  He has always been very informative when he appeared before the committee with Mr. Moran on other occasions.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has dealt with many of the issues I intended to raise, one of which was the Russian ban.</p> <p>  The other matter is trade agreements.  The TTIP and South American agreement will affect us.  I note with regard to South America that no real movement on negotiations is envisaged for the first half of 2015.  What is the situation with the disease status of the herds in South America at present?  Must that be resolved before negotiations can take place?  Are the US, Japan, Australia and other countries negotiating trade agreements with the South American countries as well?</p> <p>  I must agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the genomics scheme.  The scheme and its concept will improve the herd, but there is too much red tape involved.  The requirement to sign up for six years is not feasible because people might have to drop out of the scheme due to circumstances.  There must be clarification.  The penalties are that one must pay back all of the money.  People might decide to change their farming practice; somebody could decide to go into tillage after two or three years.  It is unfair and the six year tie to the scheme must be examined.  We accept the requirement that one must use a five star bull.  However, after two or three years, when the progeny is being tested, the bull's status might drop to a three star bull, so suddenly the farmer is out of the scheme in that way.  Also, trying to source three and four star heifers could push prices up at the marts and perhaps make the scheme unviable because of the price people will have to pay for replacements.  Being obliged to have so many replacements in the herds will make the scheme unviable.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the superlevy and the &euro;69 million we are facing.  Will Mr. O'Driscoll clarify how many years the instalments will be paid?  He also mentioned interest rates.  Is an interest rate being charged on the superlevy bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015051200002#N00300"><p>I welcome and congratulate Mr. O'Driscoll and wish him the best of luck in the remainder of his career.  I will start with the simplification of the CAP.</p><p>I completely agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v in his analysis of the situation.  Simplification, in my view, means simplifying everything and making it less bureaucratic but this has not happened.  It has become even more bureaucratic over the past number of years.  Will the mid-term review put a plan in place for simplification to make it less bureaucratic, more farmer-friendly and also more official-friendly?  It has gone the opposite way.  What are the plans to make it more farmer-friendly as well as more consumer-friendly?</p><p> On the superlevy situation, we have highlighted the issue and asked questions about milk and the superlevy.  However, post quota, what is the current market outlook for dairy products?  This time last year there were fears about where we might be going in that situation.  What is the current situation?</p><p> I refer to the provision of fruit and milk to schools.  Is there scope to utilise increased milk production and milk supplies post quota? The Secretary General referred to the TTIP negotiations in his opening statement.  I am interested in the time scale for the negotiations.  Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned the end of the year as a possible date but he was not overly-optimistic about that date.  Is there an advantage from our point of view if negotiations dragged on a bit longer?  From a political point of view, the American elections will be held in 2016.  Would this have an effect on negotiations?  Is there an advantage to have the negotiations continue beyond that date?</p><p> Mr. O'Driscoll referred to issues concerning the rural development programme.  A number of sticking points arose.  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to elaborate.  I agree with Mr. O'Driscoll's analysis that 2017 is a very short time span before the new programme.  He is focused on where we need to be going in advance of the mid-term review.  The main idea of the mid-term review has to be to make the process as simple as possible and more consumer and farmer-friendly.  The same applies to the rural development programme.  What were the main sticking points in negotiations with the Commission?  Will there be a change of emphasis in that regard?  What is the plan for the future?</p></speech>

I refer to the Russian ban.  Can Mr. O'Driscoll give an outline as to the impact to date of the ban on the various Irish agricultural sectors and on the particular sectors affected?  It appears to me that the agricultural component of the TTIP negotiations appears to be played down to its detriment.  It appears to be regarded as small beer in the context of the Americans and everyone else.  The powerful industrial lobbies and advocates appear to be making progress and agriculture is being relegated somewhat.  That is my opinion as I look in from the outside.  It is important that there is not total capitulation or capitulation to the detriment of the agricultural sector.</p><p>The industrial element of the negotiations clearly offers important and positive advantages, but there must be a balancing act, with due cognisance given to the role of agriculture.</p><p> I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that CAP simplification is like a Benny Hill joke at this stage.  I was very supportive of the idea of decoupling.  In fact, I recall proposing it and being devoured by farming organisations.  That is going back a while.  The farming organisations did not like me for it but I took that as a badge of honour.  If they liked me, I probably would lose my seat.  The very essence of the notion of decoupling was that it would simplify the whole process by moving away from headage and all of that.  I am very disappointed with what we have ended up with.  We have seen all the consequences of the single farm payment system.  The remodelled scheme that has emerged from a bureaucratic gestation evaluation is the very antithesis of simplicity.</p><p> I am particularly concerned that there is too much focus on subjectivity.  I discovered all about that on 28 April when a delegation from the Department last appeared before the committee.  I have a background in agriculture and am not a total gobdaw.  I knew some of the witnesses' departmental colleagues back in the 1980s and am glad to see them now at the very top of the tree.  Michael Hanley, managing director of Lakeland Dairies, is a former colleague of mine.  Those guys are all doing a lot better than I am, thank God.  In that context, I am absolutely perplexed by what has been done.  It would try the patience of anybody, let alone test one's professional competence in trying to figure out the impact of such and such a thing, depending on coverage and everything else.  That level of subjectivity is a recipe for further penalisation down the line.  I know a bit about this from a courts perspective.  When one allows that type of subjectivity into a system, it creates a range of difficulties.  It is very important to have objectivity in order to prevent people from being punished.</p><p> The beef genome project is very important for the midlands and I am very supportive of the intention behind it.  Twelve or 15 years ago, only one in four of our cattle was capable of penetrating the very high end of markets in Europe.  I remember it well because I did a study of it.  It was a disaster because we had too much of a milk breed, Holstein crosses and everything else.  Coming from a beef area, I could see the disaster that was coming and could not understand how it was allowed to persist for so long.  We eventually changed tack and put some shape on it.  This system has put the final cap on it but, Lord save us and bless us, there is a great deal of confusion.  I have a brother working in this area who will have to employ another person if he is to ensure there are no slip-ups on this thing.  Senator O'Neill asked whether the six-year term is fixed and immutable.  Getting the breeding right is important; I have no hang-ups about that.  However, Senator O'Neill is in the game and he understands the impact of going from five-star back to three-star or whatever.</p><p> I am deeply concerned that things are hedged in bureaucracy and there is only one outcome, namely, bureaucratic evaluation down the road and penalties arising.  It is the consumer who suffers in that and, in this case, the consumer is the farmer.  The Department has sent out information about re-evaluations - the eye in the sky, as I call it - whereby ordinary farmers down the country are obliged to make submissions to the Department.</p><p>These can be submitted to Portlaoise for review.  How many of these reviews have been successful?  I appreciate Mr. O'Driscoll may not have the exact number but I would like a rough estimate or a percentage.  Is it 20%, 30% or 40%?  I understand significant progress is being made on the replies.  One farmer told me the reply did not tally with what he was looking at.  It is important people are given fair wind and are given an opportunity to reject what may well have come from the eye in the sky.  No matter how fine technology is there is nothing better than being on the ground.  A farmer knows every blade of grass and rock outcrop.  I am concerned that they get fair wind and an opportunity to deal with the review.  Retroactivity was mentioned.  From a constitutional perspective, laws should only act prospectively.  European law is great, with legitimate expectation and everything else, but it has allowed this measure to sneak in whereby the authorities can go back for as long as they like.  There does not even seem to be a statute of limitations.</p></speech>

There are restrictions, particularly on the number of hectares in respect of which farmers can apply to the scheme.  How were these received in Brussels, particularly where the restriction is applied to Natura lands?  It seems unreasonable that farmers who have faced the constraints of having to farm decimated lands under special protection areas, SPAs, or special areas of conservation, SACs, can only get GLAS payments in respect of the same number of hectares as farmers anywhere else in the country.  It seems to fly in the face of the purpose of much of the Common Agricultural Policy and requirements that farmers be compensated for farming Natura lands.  This decision has been made solely by Ireland, but was there much opposition to it at Commission level?</p></speech>

Many of the issues I want to raise have already been covered.  We have much work to do.  The genomics scheme has given us greatest pain in recent days, particularly since the forms came out.  Having to sign up for six years is a serious problem and the star system is another.  Who will draw up the carbon footprint for farms and how much will it cost?  When one considers all of the costs one wonders whether it is worthwhile going into the scheme.  I agree it is a positive scheme and we must all breed better stock, but the amount of red tape involved is putting off many farmers.  At a meeting in Leitrim last Thursday, which I did not attend, many farmers decided not to bother applying for it.  We have a good bit of work to do to sort out the problems.</p> <p>  With regard to young farmers applying for top-ups to their entitlements, will it be possible to pay the top-ups to 90 ha?  Provision was made for this but will the Department be able to live up to it?  Young farmers who have been farming since 2002 have no entitlements but provisions for them were tied in.  They have the necessary green certificates but are excluded because they were in farming before 2008.  What is the situation for them?</p></speech>

Last Friday week the committee dealt with the land use report.</p><p>It has been suggested that the food security and climate change objectives are potentially at loggerheads.  That was the precise motivation behind our report.  We hope the recommendations in our report will be helpful during the policy-framing stage.  It should be mentioned, following on from the superlevy and milk simplification issues, that some of the schemes seem to get less simple as time goes on.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has reiterated a point I made just before we started, which is that the more one tries to broaden a scheme to encompass as many people as possible, the more it seems that simplification goes out the window.  I invite Mr. O'Driscoll and his colleagues to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015051200002#R00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the joint committee for raising a range of issues.  I will take them as they came up.  Various points were made about the same issues.  The first issue to be raised was climate.  It is no secret to people in this room that for five or six years now, Ireland has been pursuing a fairly lonely road within the EU in drawing attention to the conflict between the EU's food security and climate change objectives.  We have also emphasised the need to evolve or develop a coherent policy covering climate change, agriculture and forestry.  That whole thing is known in EU-speak as agricultural land use, land use change and forestry.  The conclusions reached at last October's meeting of the European Council are enormously significant because the EU has taken that logic on board for the first time.</p> <p>  I repeat the point that we wrote the relevant paragraph.  I do not want to blow it into something it is not, as it is just one paragraph.  However, it is significant that it is one paragraph in the conclusions of the European Council - that is to say, the council of prime ministers - and therefore carries a great deal of weight and is binding on legislators as they go forward to develop the proposals for the implementation of the EU's 2030 target.  The EU has decided to pursue a target of a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030.  The detail of that has yet to be worked out.  A decision has to be made on whether we will have national targets.  If there are such targets, they will have to be worked out and decisions will have to be made on how they will apply in the various sectors.  It will be hugely important in those negotiations to have the conclusions that were reached last October there to guide us.  That is why we were so pleased about those conclusions.</p> <p>  The second important aspect of this issue, following on from the general point about reconciling agriculture and climate change, is that the inclusion of the sequestration value of afforestation in the system of accounting would have enormous significance for us.  It is not included at present.  Our agriculture sector emits between 19 and 20 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent each year.  Between now and 2030, our forestry sector will sequester approximately 4.85 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, or 25% of the emissions from agriculture, each year.  If that is accepted as a mitigation measure, we will be on course to achieve a 25% reduction in those terms.  That would be an enormous thing.  The way afforestation is referred to in the text of the conclusions of the Council points in the direction we want to go, although it is not in the bag.  I should say an attempt to unpick that was made at a meeting of the Environment Council in March, but we think we saw that attempt off.</p> <p>  I would not say, in response to a question asked by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that we have achieved everything we want in terms of getting the balanced approach to agricultural targets that we are seeking.  However, I think we have taken a large step in that direction.  That is where we are.  The important point is that we are going into the detailed negotiations armed with that achievement, which strongly underpins the importance of our afforestation programme.  If we get what we are seeking to achieve in terms of recognition of afforestation, it is very important that we continue fully with our afforestation programme.</p><p>As the committee knows, it is quite expensive.  We think it will cost about &euro;3 billion between 1990 and 2030, which is the relevant period.  I will come back to any of the points if members wish.  </p><p> On the issue of Russia, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked an interesting strategic question about the implications for other areas at other times.  It is very fair to say that we were taken by surprise by this.  In terms of Russia and the Irish dairy industry, various Irish companies, including the Irish Dairy Board, had very developed plans for significant expansion in Russia which were pushed sideways by an event that had nothing to do with the agriculture sector.  It is a fair point.  We have to be capable of dealing with, and be ready for, events that may arise from other sectors.  In terms of the impact on Ireland, the total agrifood trade to Russia in 2013 was &euro;235 million.  However, prior to the presidential decree in retaliation for EU sanctions, the Russians had already taken a series of measures banning various products.  They had undertaken, in January 2014, an EU-wide ban on pork due to African swine fever.  In May 2014, they undertook an audit in Ireland and temporary restrictions were placed on a range of plants in the beef, dairy powder, seafood and other sectors.  In June 2014, there was an EU-wide ban on beef trimming imports.  All of this was prior to the main ban.  </p><p> There has been a process of escalation.  When one asks about the impact of the ban, it depends on whether one takes all of those things into account.  The terms of the ban affect up to 42% of the trade that we undertook but most of that trade was already affected by the previous measures, to which I referred.  A equally important effect from an Irish perspective was the fact we had very significant growth opportunities and plans in Russia, which have been significantly derailed.  There is no doubt that is a problem.  </p><p> Measures were taken by the Commission, as I said, and Ireland took up some of them, in particular private storage aid.  We used it for 7,000 tonnes of cheese, 8,000 tonnes of butter and 2,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder during the worst of the impact.  One of the difficulties in the dairy sector is that for other reasons, dairy prices have been moving.  It is a little difficult to measure the specific impact of the Russian ban.</p><p> On the question of the superlevy, the intention is that payments will be made in instalments over a period of up to three years.  That is for what the provision allows.  The question of interest is a policy decision so I will leave that aside.  We will make announcements on it in due course.  I was asked about the logic and common sense of it by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and a number of other members.  We would agree completely and we repeatedly made the point that imposing superlevies in the last year of a quota regime makes absolutely no sense.  </p><p> The truth is that the previous Commission had options open to it, but the previous Commissioner said he would only act if there was a qualified majority in Council.  We made significant efforts to get that qualified majority but unfortunately a minority of member states would not play ball and we could not get that qualified majority.  That happens in a community of 28 member states, in particular when there is at least one large member state on the other side of the fence.</p><p>One must remember that some member states are not happy with the end of quotas, so they were not particularly inclined to make it easier.  That is really why it did not happen - they felt they could not explain it to their own people.</p><p> There were a number of questions on trade issues and TTIP.  I cannot really say whether there will be a deal in 2015.  There is very strong commitment on the EU side to doing a deal and there is also evident commitment on the American side.  One difficulty is that the Americans are very focused on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, on their other coast at the moment and until that has been agreed, one could ask whether they are fully focused on the TTIP negotiations.  Will agriculture be treated as an unfortunate consequence or side-event in these negotiations?  I do not think so.  Agriculture is very important for both sides in these negotiations.  It is a very big deal and promises very significant economic benefits.  All studies have shown that a good TTIP deal could deliver significant economic benefits to both Europe and the United States, and to Ireland specifically.  However, there are both offensive and defensive interests on both sides.  On the agriculture side, we have very significant offensive interests in dairy, for example.  We see significant possibilities for increasing our dairy food ingredients exports, for example, infant formula and so on, into America.  Other subsectors are also very positive about America.  One need only look at the export of Irish oats to America, which is an extraordinary growth story in recent years and which still seems to have a great deal of potential.  Irish oats have become the badge of quality in the US oats market and that is something that can be exploited.</p><p> The complication arises in the beef question.  If I had been asked this question three or four years ago, I would have said the benefits are on the dairy side while the costs to us would be on the beef side of the deal.  The calculation has become a little more complicated because beef prices in the United States have risen to very high levels and have now exceeded EU levels.  We now have access to the American beef market and are looking to widen that access to include beef for grinding, as they call it, which is mincing.  The prices for many of those cuts of beef are far higher in the US than in Europe.  The potential for Irish beef exports to the US is significant but at the moment, it is constrained by an overall quota of 64,000 tonnes, which applies across a range of countries.  In the context of a TTIP deal, one would probably get a larger quota for the EU itself.  It would widen the exports we could make to the US.  At the same time, we remain very defensive on the question of the export of high-value cuts of beef from the US to Europe.  That is an extremely sensitive market.  It is only about 6% or 7% of the total beef market and, therefore, relatively small shipments of those high-value cuts of beef from America could have a disproportionate effect.  In other words, we take a very balanced approach.  We see significant benefits for the agrifood sector but we also recognise that we have a major defensive issue.  I should also mention poultry in that space.</p><p> The question of small-scale producers versus large-scale producers is relevant in the poultry sector.  It is true that the US beef production system is based on very large-scale feedlot production and it is very different, therefore, from our system.  However, it comes down to prices, trade and supply and demand.  If we can compete in a market, we should compete in it.  There is no doubt that we can compete in the high-value food service market in the US and also for beef for grinding, at the very least.</p><p> Moving on to simplification of CAP, Deputies Penrose, &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Deering and several others expressed - I do not know if they used the word but I use the word - exasperation, and it is fully shared here.  As a person who has been involved with the CAP for a long time, I have been through quite a few pushes for simplification and I know that previous exercises have failed.  We must be more hopeful this time, partly because I believe the Commissioner is seriously committed to simplification and because there is no doubt that a large number of member states are at the end of their tether on this issue and are determined to get real simplification this time.  I think the same mood is in the European Parliament.  There is an alignment at the moment which makes real simplification more likely.  There would still be differences.</p><p> We highlighted in our opening statement the fact that there is a danger of this simplification exercise tipping over into CAP reform which is not a sensible outcome and creates more uncertainty for farmers.  It is a beguiling idea to go back to the basic text and try to simplify it.  What happens if one goes back to the basic text, however, is that one would kick off a whole new CAP reform.  We must be very careful in this area.  We are pointing more at Commission implementing acts and Commission guidelines.  We see a huge amount of the complication coming from Commission interpretation of the basic acts and, therefore, we see a significant possibility to get simplification in that area.  There is some support for that view although I have to say there are also others who want to open up the whole basic acts.  We will see where that discussion leads in the coming period.</p><p> At the Council yesterday, Commissioner Hogan announced a number of proposals, some of which are definitely helpful to us.  I took it as an indication of good faith.  He was showing that he was putting practical real proposals on the table but I am sure he will go much further.</p></speech>

There was no formal document.  On the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, as an example of a complex scheme, which is the way some members presented it, one has to sign up for six years.  This is not quite what we wanted.  It came from discussions with the Commission as a necessary part of the scheme.  To be honest, we can see why.  It is to ensure the scheme delivers, but it is also because it is pitched as an agri-environment scheme.  That is where it is being placed in the legal framework where the norm is multi-year schemes.  One has to use four or five-star bulls and there are many other conditions, all of which is true, but these are all things that deliver real benefits to the farmer.  There is nothing put into this scheme that is a waste of time, that should not be done or that will not deliver real benefits.  We have major challenges in our beef sector.  We have a serious problem with farm level profitability in beef and we have to move the sector on.  We also have a significant climate change challenge in beef.  Frankly, we saw an opportunity to address both issues simultaneously through a scientifically cutting edge scheme.  That is what we are doing.  It will deliver almost &euro;300 million to beef farmers but they will have to do a lot for it.  I do not deny that and I would not describe it as a simple scheme.</p> <p>  There was welcome for the indication that we are pushing for a more proportionate approach to small discrepancies for small farmers in the outposts.  That is something we will push very hard.  It makes absolute sense.  The current provision does not make sense.  We think we can stand up that proposal very well.</p> <p>  Deputy Deering referred to the school milk scheme.  The scale in terms of the amount of milk it would absorb is small.  The scheme operates in 1,061 schools serving 51,000 students.  Therefore, it delivers many benefits in social and health terms.</p><p>However, in terms of absorption of quantities of milk, it would not really be in that kind league.</p><p> Deputy Penrose referred to Russia.  I dealt with the scale of the impact on Ireland.  That is where I dealt with that.</p><p> It is interesting Deputy Penrose should say that he was an advocate of decoupling and saw it as a simplification opportunity.  I can claim to have been in the same boat.  I also would agree with him in expressing disappointment.  One of our regrets about CAP reform was the splitting of the payment.  Ireland advocated that we should not set up a separate greening payment.  That was our national position.  As holders of the Presidency, we eventually delivered one, but that was our job as holders of the Presidency.  Our national position was that there should not be a separate one.  We appealed to colleagues to look at a different route, asking that we talk about additional environmental conditionality, if they wanted to talk about that, but that we use the existing good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, and cross-compliance provisions as the basis for that.  Ireland and Austria advocated that and the other 26 countries did not step up to the plate.  Ever since, representatives from those countries have been coming to me saying that we were right, but it is a little late.  I have some sympathy with the argument that we have ended up splitting schemes a lot across the place.  Certainly, with the greening, there is a real level of truth in that regard.</p><p> There was a question about appeals.</p></speech>

The Department is 35% smaller than it was in 2005 and it is doing many more jobs.  That affects all of our offices and out-offices and our appeal system.  There is a backlog and we try to move it along.</p></speech>

I suppose the point that would irritate many farmers is, for example, that the Department gives a tight timescale to submit the application and documentation and if these are five minutes late, it is bye-bye.</p></speech>

I was not happy with the system that was set up.  I might as well be honest with Mr. O'Driscoll.  It is no use being dishonest in here.  My experience with it is as Mr. O'Driscoll says.  In fairness, one gets a good run.  However, one would have to fight hard to get a good run.  It is not mandatory that it be 14 days.  Surely, there is a flexibility allowing for it within seven days.  There must be that.</p> <p>  Why not have a special unit to deal with the reviews in the context of those who are being visited upon by the eye-in-the-sky detections?  Why not have a special section dealing with the reviews in that context?  Farmers are extremely stressed and worried as a result of this.  Most of the Deputies and Senators present say this involves thousands of euro that farmers may have to pay back.  That is the worry.  If one adds all of this to the milk money that has to be paid back and everything else, it gets farmers down.  Why not lessen that level of trauma, distress and anxiety for farmers?</p></speech>

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine writes to the farmer setting out that he or she has over-claimed for a parcel of land, stating the range of penalties that apply depending on the extent of the over-claim.  In other words, the farmer gets a lot of paper but very little information.</p> <p>  When the farmer gets the letter, unless he or she can pull out the original application and check the number of hectares and do the sums, he or she will not know the penalty.  The farmer will come to the clinic run by the public representative, but without the area aid application, the Deputy is at sea.</p> <p>  The public representative will table a parliamentary question asking what the penalty is and it is nearly impossible to find out from the Department what it is.  I am fairly good at reading the material that comes from the Civil Service but it is difficult enough to figure out what the Department is trying to tell the farmer and what the penalty is.  At the end of the day, the farmer wants to know why he is being hit and the extent of it.  In most cases, the Department does not tell him or her what he or she is being hit for, and the person must do the calculation.  While he Department has a computer, the farmer does not have one.</p></speech>

The first deals with the issue of 14 days and the second is the nature and extent of the penalty that will be imposed in pounds, shillings and pence, to use the old-fashioned terms.  My question was on the retrospective approach, given the new land eligibility rules.</p></speech>

We have had internal discussions on this and the area where there may be an issue is the application of the<i>pro rata</i>and its impact on some farmers.  The great majority of farmers who are affected by <i>pro rata </i>will benefit from it, but there could be some farmers whose area will reduce.  They will have been informed of their eligible area and now as a result of the<i>pro rata,</i>it may reduce somewhat.  Obviously in those cases, we will have to take a reasonable view.  We do not try to be unreasonable, presuming we can be reasonable within the terms of the regulation, which I think we can.  In that case, I take the Chairman's point.<br/><br/>In respect of the 14 days, while my understanding is that there is no limit on LPIS reviews, I will have it double-checked and will confirm it to the Deputy.<br/><br/>On the question of the over-claims and the amount of the penalty, these issues are complicated for the Department as well as the farmer.  We all find it really complicated.  I take the Deputy's fundamental point that the farmer wants to know something very simple and we should, as best we can, tell him as clearly as possible.  There is one aspect of the Department's communication that I have asked people to consider, that is, to use plain English.  Sometimes some of the letters that issue are complicated.  There is virtue in expressing them in more straightforward ways.  That is something we can do.  In all cases, it is not necessarily the case that we can provide the farmer with precisely what he needs to know, given the complexity of what is involved and information that may only be available to him at that point.</p><p>I am taking the essence of the point, which is the communication of as clear a message as possible to farmers as to the size and nature of penalties.  What I am saying is that this applies not only to penalties but also more widely to communications with individual farmers.</p></speech>

Most of those letters say the money must be paid back in seven days.  The reality to those of us who know is that farmers will always do a deal with the Department that the money is recouped out of future grants.  However, there are some very innocent people who take fright at a seven-day demand from the Department and they just go to the bank and get a cheque and send back the money.  Then they come to me and I say to them not to be worrying about it, that as long as they continue farming, any overpayment will be taken out of next year's disadvantaged area or area of natural constraint or whatever single farm payment, and that they will not have to come up with a big lump sum to repay the Department.  These letters are quite intimidating.  Why does the Department not say that, if the farmer enters into an agreement within a fixed period, the money will be taken out of future grants?  That is what the Department inevitably does in practice.</p></speech>

We do not do it in all cases.  We also have to show a degree of form with the EU and the Commission.  Usually what we are recovering are EU moneys.  We have to show we are doing that properly.  One of the areas for which we have been most criticised by the certifying body and auditors who act for the EU here is what they call the recovery of debts.  This is the kind of thing where they would regard that as a debt owing to the EU.  We have to be careful here.  Although the Deputy is right that we try to be reasonable whenever we can be, we also have to show clearly that we are making every effort to recover these funds.  Frankly, we would be in big trouble if we did not show that.</p></speech>

In the course of the approval of the rural development plan, there was a long discussion with the Commission on limits generally in GLAS - the &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000 limits.  It was quite a difficult and protracted discussion which ended up with the EU agreeing to an approach that is now encapsulated in the proposal.  The way the EU views it is that we are offering the farmer a &euro;5,000 or &euro;7,000 package rather than a limit as such.  In practical terms it comes to the same thing but the way they are seeing it is we put &euro;7,000 on the table and say a farmer can have it if he or she does certain things.  That includes Natura farmers and what they have to do.  The EU does not look at it as a limit on the number of hectares.  On that basis, it was able to accept it.</p></speech>

There may be practices that the farmer has not pursued in the past that he would not be allowed to pursue in the future, and forestry is an example that is often quoted, because, by definition, the farmer has not done it in the past.  We need to be clear on what we are talking about here.</p> <p>  The issue perhaps arises in regard to some of the bird designations.  For example, the hen harrier designations can be over very large areas of land, as we know.  Therefore, we have committed to looking at the possibilities.  Nonetheless, we have not made any commitment on this other than to say that, when we have experience of operating GLAS, we will look at what cases exist where there are very large areas affected by hen harrier designation and so on that might be deemed not to be sufficiently covered by the &euro;7,000.  However, I do not want to promise anything we cannot deliver.</p> <p>  The GLAS programme was negotiated in great detail with the Commission and has been agreed with the Commission.  There are a number of things we will look at in the future.  It is possible to make amendments to the rural development programme.  As we go forward, what typically happens is that we find that some measures in a rural development programme underperform while others over-perform, and one wants to reallocate money and look at new priorities that emerge.  This would be among the types of issue we would look at in the future.</p></speech>

In regard to the Burren-type schemes, my understanding is that this time around, under the principle that one cannot get paid twice for the same thing, a farmer cannot get payments under GLAS for the hen harrier scheme and a Burren-type scheme because it is considered to be paying the person twice for the same thing.</p><p>I am sure Deputy McNamara can correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of what happened the last time is that farmers in the Burren were able to get REPS and the Burren scheme on top of it and nobody really queried the overlap of the two schemes.  I understand that on this occasion, this is strongly prohibited under EU regulations.  If one's GLAS area already incorporates or encapsulates hen harriers, pearl mussels or whatever, how will that operate?  Will one be allowed to amend one's plan in such circumstances?</p><p> Maybe I am wrong, but I understand that the environmental advantage of genomics is that it involves bulls of a better quality that produce beef more efficiently with a better conversion rate, etc.  I do not know whether the beef is better to eat.  I understand the argument in favour of the environmental approach is that more beef is produced from less grass, and with fewer carbon emissions at the end of it.  Has the Department quantified how much of a reduction in carbon or methane there will be if this programme is successful?  Will there be a reduction of 5%, 10% or 30% as a result of this scheme?  I presume something has been worked out with the European Union to measure the carbon benefit of this genomic scheme.</p></speech>

I cannot give him an exact figure for the impact of the scheme.  The statement we have made in this respect is regarded at EU level as very significant.  We have said we think we can achieve the Food Harvest 2020 targets in this country while maintaining our emissions at approximately the same level as 2005.  We will achieve that largely through measures such as beef genomics.  We are trying to urge other measures through the carbon navigator, including activities such as lengthening the grazing season, improving cow fertility and slaughtering at an earlier age.  The quality of the animal is crucial to that.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right in his characterisation of this when he says it is about converting grass into beef more efficiently and therefore being able to slaughter the animal at an earlier stage.  That is exactly what it is about.  The happy coincidence in this regard is that there is an absolute correlation here between economic efficiency and environmental efficiency.  That is why we see this as a major thing to pursue.  The committee will be well aware of the criticism we get from some environmental groups in this country and elsewhere regarding the emissions from our population of beef cattle.  We have to show we are doing the absolute best we can on that.  At the same time, our beef industry has the problem of profitability at farm level.  We can kill two birds with one stone by doing what we are doing.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the question of double funding.  We can never double fund, as such.  The change made as part of the new CAP is that the requirement not to double fund has been included in several places all over the regulations.  I remember well that this was done at the insistence of the European Parliament.  It insisted during the regulations that we include this in each of the regulations even though it was already contained in the overarching financial regulation and therefore was not needed.</p><p>They insisted that we include it in every regulation.  It is now much more explicit, but a ban on double funding has always been in place.  The original Burren project was the BurrenLife project, which was a bit different.  The current Burren project will be under the programme.  It is caught by the provision.</p></speech>

I wish to qualify what is being said.  I refer to those doing something under a basic GLAS scheme who happen to be in a designated hen harrier zone while the area next to them is not.  Measures have to be taken into account for those in such designated zones which are additional and, by the nature of the restriction, one can be paid for.  Such farmers are being paid for the restriction in that sense.  That is the differential for those in GLAS.</p> <p>  The argument has been made that in cases in which a farmer is in a designated restricted area, particularly a hen harrier zone, that is beside an unrestricted area, both farmers should be allowed to enter GLAS, and such farmers might be able to get &euro;2,000 extra.  The nature of the restriction means things can take place that may lead to the locally led agri-environment scheme being applicable.</p></speech>

The double funding rules prevent double funding for what is deemed to be the same thing.  If one can prove that it is additional and so on, it is a different context.</p></speech>

If they are already receiving &euro;7,000 under GLAS for hen harrier designations, will they receive more money?  Will they be told they are receiving money for hen harriers and therefore cannot be given more?  How is additionality measured?  It is a very simple question.</p></speech>

I cannot answer those questions.  They are hypothetical.  There is a danger of something being lost.  </p> <p>  The &euro;7,000 GLAS provision is very generous and applies to a large number of hen harrier farmers who are currently not being paid at all.  There are hundreds of farmers in the hen harrier programme run by the other Department.  Thousands of farmers will receive &euro;7,000 each under this programme.  That needs to be put in the balance.  If there are people in very large areas, that is a different question, and I have answered it as best I can.  I cannot deal with the details of locally led schemes which do not yet exist.</p></speech>

I refer to Directive 65/432/EC on inter-community trade in bovines and swine.  The Department is concerned about it because a lot of our beef is traded.  Department policy is to prevent cattle from staying in lairage or in marts overnight where possible.  It is a good policy, but sometimes such things are unavoidable because of the nature of the cattle trade in Ireland.  It seems to be that the directive, as consolidated, clearly envisages cattle staying for up to three or four days.</p><p>I am not proposing that that should be entertained, although it seems to be envisaged by EU law in what are called assembly areas and marts.  The definitions in the directives do not seem to differentiate between the two.  Will the Department look into that and give me a written response?  It is basically a situation in which there are smaller marts in peripheral areas of Ireland and there are buyers who come down from Meath or wherever.  They are not really interested in going to a mart in Connemara or west Clare to buy four cattle, so they go to Ennis, Loughrea or one of the bigger marts and they can buy 50 the next day.  Their preference would be to pick 54 up, because they are not going to send down a lorry to buy four.  It is driving smaller marts out of business, or is at least threatening their business.</p><p> The difficulty in obtaining licences for boats to carry live exports out of Ireland has long been a bugbear of mine.  I have had meetings with officials in the Department who talk about the importance of animal welfare, particularly for our reputation.  The animal welfare lobby is powerful, wherever it is funded from.  There are suspicions that it is funded from within the beef business, but they are only suspicions.</p></speech>

I was told proudly by departmental officials that they were looking to Ireland as the standard to be achieved by other states, yet when I asked whether Ireland is in favour of agreeing these uniform standards, I was told we were not at all, because we might have to accept boats that are licensed in Greece, Spain or other major maritime nations picking up cattle.  That would make it difficult for those beef processors, who might then be operating in a less restricted market and might have to pay more for the premium product they are buying.  Why does Ireland not want to move towards uniform standards in shipping across Europe and, most importantly, why will it not accept boats licensed in other member states to come and collect cattle in Ireland?  Is it solely to protect beef processors so that they can continue to drive down the prices that Irish farmers get?</p></speech>

How did we fare compared to the other 28?  In the overall scheme of things, was the EU under or over quota?  How many of the 28 states were under or over the quota?</p></speech>

If I were a farmer with a lot of designated land and if that was the easy way of getting my &euro;7,000 without having to have low-input pastures and meadows, the walls and God knows what else, measures for hen harriers and so on would be out the window.  When the locally led agri-environment scheme comes in, will the farmer be able to look at all the choices he could have made if he had known the locally led agri-environment scheme would be there and what its terms would be?  Will he be able to go back and say he wants to change his plan and now wants to put in stone walls, low-input pasture, meadows, bat boxes and God knows what else and make up the &euro;7,000 that way?</p><p>Will he be able to take out the measure he was availing of, which was the lazy man's measure of just having a designated SPA, re-jig his plan and then claim the SPA or hen harrier payment under the new scheme?  Will people be allowed to do that?  It is very important that they be allowed to.  It is unfair to farmers that they were meant to have foreseen the rules of a programme that had not yet been published - they were not published at the same time.  Therefore, will there be an allowance for the amendment of the plans in order that they can re-jig all the measures in order to avail of both schemes?  In that way, they will not be breaking any EU regulation, but they will maximise their cash.</p><p> I do not agree with Mr. O'Driscoll about mountain land.  I refer particularly to what happened to these farmers with regard to the single farm payment, whereby they were offered &euro;250 but it was all taken back off them, and they were left with a mountain that they could not use for forestry, wind turbines or anything else.  In Deputy Deering's country, where there is a great deal of milk and so on, farmers would be laughing at &euro;7,000 being regarded as big money.  They would say it was only petty cash compared to a single farm payment of &euro;70,000, &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000, and &euro;7,000 is only the change they would give to the gas&uacute;r.</p><p> I am surprised that fisheries was not mentioned in the presentation; it was included in the documentation but not in the presentation.</p><p> In regard to the rural development programme, planners are complaining that a new rule was introduced last week whereby 16.5 points have to be achieved under tier 3 to enter GLAS, so they had to revisit all the plans and re-jig all the measures to try to arrive at the 16.5 points.  I do not know whether 16.5 is a high or a low target, but apparently it has caused quite some consternation.  If that is a condition, why was it not in place at the beginning and how has it become a condition at this late stage?  I understand that the closing date is Friday week.  I have not yet heard from the Minister about an extension to the closing date, which no doubt will happen in the next week or ten days, but as of now I understand it is Friday week.  I think planners have had a bellyful of it.  They are under awful pressure from their clients, and I understand that some, including Teagasc, have told 2,000 farmers that they cannot do it on time - and that was before the 16.5 target.</p></speech>

In regard to boats for live exports, in relatively recent times a number of boats have been approved for live exports and a number of others are under examination.  We have answered parliamentary questions on this a number of times recently.  If harmonised standards were introduced in the way the Deputy has described, we would certainly engage in that debate.  We have a particular exposure and a unique one.  This is very relevant here.  At Council after Council there is an attempt to raise the issue of an eight-hour limit on the transport of animals by a group of member states, including some very significant and influential member states.  Ireland is uniquely exposed on that.  One of the main defences we raise is the standards of our boats and the standards of veterinary supervision of those boats.  That is a very important issue to us.  We regularly say that we apply standards above the EU minimum.  It is a strong defensive point that we made on this issue.  This particular issue is one that annoys me quite a bit, because some of these countries actually implement systems of confinement-based beef production.</p><p>Frankly, it is a bit rich that they do this but they do it regularly.  It is an issue where we are uniquely exposed because of our location and the size of our beef sector.  We need to be defensive of it.

A question was asked by Deputy Deering about the number of countries over quota and how that fed into the decision not to do anything about the soft landing.  My colleague, Ms Cannon, who has done a quick tot, says there are 12 countries over quota.  It would be some number like that.  Offhand, I cannot remember the size of the blocking minority that prevented the measures being taken.  It was definitely a minority of the 28 member states.  The great majority of the 28, even those which did not have a direct interest, were willing to go along with it.  The ones which blocked it did so, frankly, because of political sensitivities in their own member states.  These were countries that would have significant farmer groups or others who are against quota abolition and where they felt there would be political repercussions if their Ministers agreed to what was seen as a measure to ease the abolition.  That was the issue.</p></speech>

If there is an overall quota, was the EU over or under quota?</p></speech>

We made the point that some of the measures we were looking for, such as adjusting the fat coefficient, are technical but their effect is to allow one to produce more milk.  Adjusting the fat coefficient would have allowed us, for example, to produce 2% more milk.  We made the point that applying that across the countries that were likely to use it would not have led to an excess of the EU quota.  We had very good arguments.  There is no doubt who won the argument on logic and with the majority of member states.  Unfortunately, the rules are that one needs a qualified majority.  As it happens, the Commission could have chosen to make a proposal in its own right on the fat correction but the then Commissioner stated he would not make that proposal unless he saw a qualified majority asking for it.</p><p>We could not get that, so he would not make the proposal.</p><p> I was asked if we would allow amendments to GLAS if locally led schemes have overlapping provisions.  I cannot answer these questions about the locally led schemes.  I think there would be some difficulty from a Commission point of view.  I am not impugning the logic but I think we would have a difficulty.  In terms of how the locally led schemes operate, we have had to take them out of the rural development programme, RDP, and run a process outside it.  When we select the winners from that process, we put them into the RDP.  This is what we have agreed with the Commission.  That means it will be done through an amendment of the RDP, which obviously creates certain possibilities that surrounding measures could also be amended, but I do not want to promise something we cannot deliver.  </p><p> In regard to tier 3, I understand they are looking for a &euro;1,700 payment under those measures.  Some of the commentary in the media on GLAS has been extraordinary because this scheme has been extraordinarily successful so far in that we have had 28,000 applicants, some 20,000 with measures.  The system has worked very well.  I know members would not think that if they have read the media coverage and some of the public comments, which have been quite self-serving.  It is clear that advisers who prepared well for this and have engaged properly with it have loaded lots of clients and are using the system well.  Of course, with a new system, one will get glitches.  However, one of the major difficulties is not  IT issues but that it is new to people.  The advisers are having to deal with something new and they have had to go on the learning curve as well.  Some of them are improving their clients' applications to increase the amount of money they will be able to get.  The Minister has urged farmers who are in tier 3 to look at what would be required to become tier 2 farmers and to consider whether they could make that leap.  The Minister has made that point on a number of occasions.  We are anxious to facilitate people and not to block them in any way.</p></speech>

The report refers to a number of items that were under preparation.  It refers to the omnibus regulation in 2014, essentially the process through which the existing legislative framework for fisheries was brought into line with the new provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy.  In the second half of 2014, they were working on the omnibus regulation and that is what it refers to.</p> <p>  The section on the Latvian Presidency talks about the landing obligations regulation.  This is the process through which the discards ban is being implemented.  As members may know, this is being implemented initially through a voluntary regional process.  We take part in the north western waters fisheries group and negotiations are ongoing at present, mainly in respect of demersal fisheries, to develop the detailed rules and regulations around the discards ban.  If the group can reach agreement and if it passes muster with the Commission, the Commission will include that in a delegated Act regulation that it will make.  If we cannot reach agreement in the north western waters fisheries group, the Commission will act of its own right in proposing a delegated Act.  The intention is that the discards ban will commence by 1 January 2016.</p><p>The aim of the north west fisheries group is to get agreement in the group by the end of May.  A huge amount of effort is being put in by my colleagues on the fisheries side at present.</p></speech>

The Department has asked farmers to consider how they can move from tier 3 to tier 2.  Farmers with bird breeding grounds on their lands are tier 1.  As I live near Lough Derg, I know there are a lot of areas around it, and also in east Clare lakelands and across Clare, that are bird habitats.  The habitats have been noted as such by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It is proposed to make some of the habitats natural heritage areas, NHAs, which are not included in the scheme.  I have been told by a representative of the National Parks and Wildlife Service that it was told by the Department that the Department was uninterested and did not want to hear about any more bird nesting habitats.  A certain number of habitats have been named, designated and included, but a whole lot of other areas, which clearly are and can be verifiably demonstrated by the NPWS through reports by rangers, etc., to be nesting areas, are not included in the scheme.  As suggested in the media, a new scheme will open in the autumn.  If so, will the Department accept new information on nesting and bird habitats?  This would enable farmers to move from tier 3 to tier 2 and even from tier 3 to tier 1 status.</p></speech>

The design of the scheme reflects the outcome of the consultation.  The birds included in tier 1 are included because the best advice available to us was that these were the birds for which action was needed most urgently.  That aspect of the GLAS scheme has been widely welcomed by people who are interested in biodiversity, and they were positively disposed to same.</p> <p>  As I have said already, we have embarked on a programme that will last until 2020.  As we go on through the process, amendments will be made to the Red Data Book, and I can say so with certainty.  I do not know what the amendments will be but, as always, there will be amendments to the book.  Therefore, schemes may be further improved as we go on.  I cannot say whether in the future some of-----</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned a possible new scheme in the autumn.  There will be a new tranche of applications made to the existing GLAS scheme in the autumn, as announced by the Minister, but it will be the same scheme.</p> <p>  To be clear, a farmer can step from tier 3 to tier 2 by embracing a number of different elements, including by using minimum tillage, growing catch crops, availing of low-emission slurry spreading and providing wild bird cover.  These measures are available to a significant number of farmers, but not every farmer.  The Minister has asked that farmers in tier 3 who could do one of those things consider pursuing the matter and see if it makes sense.  If it does, then it would promote them to tier 2.</p></speech>

The NPWS is quite happy to verify that habitats are nesting grounds for birds that are already included in the birds directive because they are an endangered species, yet some have not been included, I presume inadvertently.  There have been a raft of proposals to zone these areas as national heritage areas because they are habitats for these birds, which I presume was done by the NPWS using objective criteria.  It just did not dream this up.  If the service has cited the birds in these areas since, will the Department consider including the areas as part of the new applications that will be made in the autumn?  These areas should be able to attract tier 1 status because preserving such habitats is its primary objective.</p></speech>

I cited the example of proposed NHAs, but there are other parcels of land beyond that which were never proposed as NHAs but which NPWS personnel can verify are important areas for the very birds that were named by Mr. O'Driscoll but are not included in the mapping.  The current approach is very much a case of "Computer says no".  Although BirdWatch Ireland or the NPWS, which are, after all, the bodies that should have expertise in this field, can say that they have observed geese or swans in a particular field and it is an important habitat for them, this does not appear to be included in the Department's mapping exercise.  Can they be included for new applications?  I am not talking about extending it to new species or doing anything else.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.185" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015051200002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting the Centre for Cross Border Studies to this meeting.  In addressing the theme of the all-island economy, the Centre for Cross Border Studies is informed by its core mission of supporting and promoting cross-Border co-operation on the island of Ireland as a means towards greater social and territorial cohesion.  Greater cohesion will reduce socio-economic disparities between regions of the island, North and South, particularly where the Border may represent a challenge to developing co-ordinated strategies and implementing joint interventions aimed at areas of disadvantage and their communities.</p> <p>  In line with the Centre for Cross Border Studies' approach to cross-Border co-operation, the development of an all-island economy should adhere to the principles of integrated cross-Border co-operation.  This entails the development of policies and interventions with effects across four pillars: the social, economic and environmental pillars and the co-operation pillar itself.  Policies and interventions designed to have effects on only one of these pillars are normally unsustainable and more likely to have negative effects on the other pillars.  Economic concerns, therefore, are not and cannot be divorced from other societal concerns and economic development, including the development of an all-island economy, must be placed within a wider well-being framework.  In our understanding of the economy and the ways in which we look to develop it, we must view economic productivity in a holistic manner.  This means regarding the public, voluntary and community sectors as economic drivers or enablers and not simply as sources of expenditure that drain the income derived from what are considered to be the primary or only producers of wealth in the economy.</p> <p>  If the further development of an all-island economy is to be pursued, it must become a platform for increased social and territorial cohesion rather than a mechanism to maintain or even exacerbate existing socio-economic disparities in either or both jurisdictions.  If we are to achieve a genuinely effective all-island economy of benefit to all citizens, it will not be simply a matter of more intensive co-ordination between two economies but rather between several geographical areas with very different levels of economic performance and socio-economic disadvantage.  While these divergences may represent a challenge to its development, perhaps an insurmountable one if existing disparities are ignored, the creation of an all-island economy could do much to redress geographical imbalances in economic performance and more general well-being.</p> <p>  Along with a range of stakeholders and partners that constitute the Border development corridor steering committee, the Centre for Cross Border Studies believes the establishment of a Border development corridor is an essential cornerstone of any all-island economy.  The Border development corridor constitutes an invaluable opportunity to bring a strategic focus capable of revitalising the economic fortunes of the populations in the immediate region, as well as of those in the North and South of the island.  Research undertaken by and on behalf of the Centre for Cross Border Studies provides an evidence base for the establishment of a Border development corridor and has informed proposals relating to the socio-economic revitalisation of the Border region.  These focus on seven main themes: greater priority and urgency in advancing critical infrastructure projects, particularly roads and broadband; expansion by IDA Ireland and Invest NI of the existing foreign direct investment, FDI, base and giving more determined priority to locating new FDI in the Border region; focused support for the needs of small and medium businesses, SMEs, with export potential across the Border development corridor; strengthening the local food economy; recognising and working collectively to harness the opportunities presented by the natural, built, cultural and physical environment of the Border development corridor; advancing the region as a champion of the green economy and renewables agenda; and embracing the goodwill of the diaspora and engaging with the proposed national diaspora centre.</p><p>However, in order for there to be the required degree of co-operation between both jurisdictions to bring about a Border development corridor and an effective all-island economy, we need ambitious leadership at all levels.  Such leadership and strategic thinking will need to counter arguments that potential investments will be lost if policy makers attempt to promote regions of the island, North and South, seen as underperforming economically, particularly in terms of their levels of innovation.</p><p> In the absence of the policy imperative for cross-Border co-operation that was contained within the common chapter, the establishment of an effective and regionally balanced all-island economy will depend on policy makers on both sides of the Border proactively &ldquo;proofing&rdquo; relevant economic strategies for opportunities for cross-Border and all-island co-operation.  Leadership will then be needed to provide the necessary resource framework when such opportunities are identified in order to fully exploit their potential.</p><p> A possible and serious obstacle to the development of both a Border development corridor and an effective all-island economy is the UK&rsquo;s possible exit from the European Union.  It is the view of the Centre for Cross Border Studies, therefore, that leadership is also required in order to avoid the possibility of a UK exit from the European Union that would reinforce Northern Ireland&rsquo;s peripherality and create more significant imbalances and obstacles in the creation of an all-island economy.</p></speech>

The committee has a submission that I presented to the committee.  I will refer to some of the points rather than go through them in detail.  I recall that on 3 November 2014 in Stormont some members of this committee joined with members of the Northern Ireland committee on this subject, which I thought was a fruitful and supportive day.</p> <p>  As Dr. Anthony Soares has said, the issue of the Border development corridor arose out of an analysis of that area and the economic prospects facing the narrower counties alongside the Border, North and South, and their predicament and the diagnosis that they ran the risk of being economically stranded unless some particular actions were taken to counter it.  While I am 100% supportive of the all-island economy, the basic thesis is that in itself will not trickle down sufficiently and deal with the issues alongside the narrower Border unless some specific actions are taken.  That narrower Border area has additional acute problems because of its peripheral nature in relation to both jurisdictions and because of the legacy of the conflict.  It suffers regularly from the distortion of taxes, North and South, which have a disproportionate effect.  For example, we have a carbon tax on solid fuel which amounts to about &euro;2.40 per standard bag of coal.  There is no such tax in Northern Ireland and, therefore, for business adjoining that narrow Border area, there is a distortion of trade which has a serious effect.</p> <p>  In the past fortnight, the CSO has published statistics on income per county.  Those statistics indicate that out of eight regions in Ireland, the Border region has the lowest amount of disposable income per head at the princely figure of &euro;16,981.  It has the largest deviation from the State average and that has actually got worse since the previous year.  That bottom line deviation is extremely serious.  Within that income, 35%, more than a third of disposable income comes from social welfare transfers.  We have an economy on the Southern side that has the lowest income of any region and within that the highest proportion dependent on social welfare transfers.  In page one of our submission we mention that the idea of a draft solidarity charter was to focus on a number of high level issues where jurisdictions and local authorities and business, North and South of the Border, could find common ground.   Dr. Anthony Soares mentioned them.  I will pick out one or two examples which illustrate the need for something radical.</p><p> On page 2 of the presentation, we refer to the infrastructure and the danger of a three-speed economy across this island where there is the growth of the conurbation along the eastern coast of Dublin and Belfast, which has half of the population of the country and which is growing rapidly, the city regions with the counties surrounding the main cities, and the Border region which fits into neither of those.  The outstanding requirement of facilitating economic development in the Border areas in the north west has been identified for years as the N2-A5 road between Dublin and Derry, and the links into Donegal.  It was a high priority a number of years ago.  We cannot even generate &euro;1.5 million on the Southern side to progress the planning of that part of the road from Clontibret to the Border.  That is a fairly serious statement of lack of interest in facilitating economic development in the Border area and the north west.</p><p> Broadband is a significant issue.  Every little business, such as a tourist business, needs broadband and Wi-Fi.  The mobile phone systems have significant dropouts in the Border area where there are two different systems and, generally, they suffer along that area from under provision which directly inhibits the growth of small businesses.</p><p> On foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland has produced its new strategy, Winning: Foreign Direct Investment.  It has a target of increasing, by 30% to 40%, the number of projects in the Border region between now and 2021, and there are moves to development regional enterprise action plans.  It is really important that the commitment in those plans to FDI in the Border region, even though it is only one part of the equation, is sustained.</p><p> In the interest of time, I will move on to tourism and recreation on the next page of the presentation.  Tourism and recreation has significant potential in the Border area.  On the Southern side, we now have the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  If one were to symbolise the lack of joined-up thinking at a political level, it would be that Ireland's Ancient East stops at Carlingford.  We have the Mourne Mountains and Carlingford Lough, and the F&aacute;ilte Ireland mandate stops precisely at Carlingford and the lake there.  It makes no sense at all.  Actually, it is offensive.  A tourist is neutral as to jurisdictions.  We need to sort that out.</p></speech>

Our regional legislative mandate is essentially to encourage cross-Border trade and business development.</p> <p>  Putting the firm at the centre is our practical and operational perspective of an island economy.  It is one in which that firm can access whatever resources or opportunities it needs to grow, no matter where they reside on the island.  We are an all-island body, not simply a cross-Border body.  In that regard, we support businesses from every county across this island.</p> <p>  All our interventions are evidence based.  Our all-island research will show that it is innovative and exporting companies that are more likely to create jobs.  These, therefore, are the two areas in which we are helping businesses to avail of cross-Border opportunities.  Our research also shows, for example, that 70% of exporters from this island took their first step in exporting by trading into the other jurisdiction on the island and, not surprisingly, our supports are focused on these two pillars of innovation and exports.</p> <p>  In trade, which is exports, we have programmes, such as Acumen, that help businesses develop the market through giving them the capabilities that they lack in the other jurisdiction.  We also, under the trade banner, are helping businesses access the massive public procurement market on both sides of the island.</p> <p>  Among the innovation programmes, we have Fusion which links businesses to research institutes by putting a graduate into a company.</p><p>We are also helping both Governments to promote participation in what was the Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research, FP7, but is now Horizon 2020 and we are having a considerable degree of success in that regard.  It makes sense for two member states which share a small island to co-operate.  </p><p> Demand for our programmes is very high.  In 2014, more than 470 inquiries were made for 64 places on a Fusion programme.  In that same period, there were 430 inquiries for 112 places on the Acumen programme and the same applies for other programmes.  We had only 81 places on our Elevate programme but 544 inquiries were made for it.  Demand for these opportunities and programmes is very high.</p><p> Since our inception more than 15 years ago, we have demonstrated the value of economic co-operation across the island.  More than 25,000 SMEs have benefited from our information and advice service, and 6,000 SMEs have been directly supported through our programmes.  These companies have generated close to &euro;1 billion worth of trade and business development value.  We estimate that more than 3,000 jobs have been created over the past six years through our interventions but the figure is probably higher because in the early years, we were not measuring the number of jobs created.  Our target audience is primarily the small indigenous-based companies.  We have consistently over-achieved and over-delivered on our key performance indicators.  There are some statistics in the documentation we provided.  In the corporate planning period 2011 to 2013, we helped more than 220 small businesses take that on the export ladder and helped more than 200 small businesses take that  on the innovation ladder through brokering opportunities on a cross-Border basis.  </p><p> What we have achieved has been against a background of severe budgetary cuts, with our budget being cut every year since 2008.  In fact, the budget has been cut by 30% since 2008.  We recognise that the economic climate is volatile and yet we have continued to respond quickly and in a flexible manner to changing circumstances.  We see emerging opportunities at which we are targeting our scarce resources in the increasing North-South applications to Horizon 2020.  We are assisting SMEs on an all-island basis to access finance for growth.  We are also exploiting public tendering opportunities, particularly for SMEs on an all-island basis.  We are looking at current research on the potential to develop all-island clusters or sectoral ecosystems.</p><p> At a more strategic level, InterTradeIreland has also participated in a study for the OECD on collaborating across borders.  This study provided lessons and made recommendations on good practice for cross-Border co-operation, including the need to devote more efforts to strategy development and policy intelligence when strategies and policies are being devised in the jurisdiction and not as an afterthought.  It also recommended that we mainstream the cross-Border element in national and regional strategies and policy instruments or, at the very least, align programme rules so that businesses can easily participate on programmes on a cross-Border basis and also to make greater use of opportunities created by the Border and publicise success.</p></speech>

I will spend the brief time I have talking about the impact of the economic fundamentals in relation to Irish reunification and the unification of the economy.  It is quite often portrayed that people advocating Irish reunification do so from some sort of romantic rather than sober-headed perspective.  I would argue the contrary that the continued division of the island, particularly economically, is based on romantic ideals and is not attuned to the economic needs of the population of the whole island.</p><p> My starting point is the starting point of economics, the division of labour, which is the fundamental driving force of economic prosperity going back to Adam Smith.  Within that, a key element is the size of the home market.  The size of the home market in both cases is limited by separate jurisdictions.  If we take the relationship between the Northern economy and this economy in terms of relative size and using purchasing power parity estimates from the OECD, we find the Northern economy is about 25% of this economy.  Leaving other practical issues aside, the simple reunification of the island economically would provide a 25% increase in the home market for businesses and all public and private sector enterprises operating in this jurisdiction.  Given the difficult economic circumstances pertaining on both sides of the Border, it is not insignificant.  The history of the economy in the Republic of Ireland is such that the separation of the Northern economy from Britain would lead to the Northern economy growing more rapidly than this economy.  The reason is that it would be in a position to catch up with living standards and productivity here.</p><p> My second point relates to the relationship between the two economies as they are composed.  An appendix at the back of the paper I produced identifies some of the key components of the two economies relative to overall.  To compare on a like-for-like basis, I have used gross value added as the proxy for GDP as there is no GDP estimate for the North.  We see significant similarities, such as the role of agriculture, which is almost exactly the same.  There are significant potential synergies and productive new elements of competition that could be introduced.  It might surprise people that the output of the agriculture sector is as low as it is in both economies.  Food processing is inordinately high and it might be to the advantage of small farmers in both jurisdictions to have a greater weight to countervail the dominant food processing companies, which are close to monopolistic.</p><p> Taking the two economies as a whole, we might regard the economy here as having a dynamic private sector and the Northern economy as having a highly efficient public sector and clear synergy between the two.  There are two caveats to the assessment, the first being that very little of the private sector, in its dominant sectors, is indigenous.  The growth of a home market would aid it.  In the Northern economy, there is a somewhat greater degree of indigenous industry.  The public sector in the Northern economy is quite efficient, with one important exception.  The comparative sizes of the civil service and defence sectors account for 5% of output here and 10% of output in the North.  That relates to another important debate about the so-called size of the subvention the North receives from Westminster.</p><p>It relates to the outsized civil service and defence sectors.  In the absence of that, and in a unified, and, one would hope, peaceful, economy, that would be wholly unnecessary, and such output could go to productive investments.</p><p> There are also specific sectors, which I only touched on in the paper, where definite synergies can be identified, such as aerospace.  In the South, there is a highly developed sector related to financial, engineering, advisory and legal work regarding aerospace and in the North there is a productive aerospace sector, so there is a clear synergy.  There is a similar situation with medical supplies.  An indigenous industry exists here which is highly advanced and internationally competitive, and the NHS or a public health service - whichever one prefers to call it - is an efficient buyer of health services, so clear synergies exist.</p><p> My last point is that this is not abstract in the sense that it is something that is unfeasible.  This is something that there is a tendency towards naturally.  The tendency arises mainly from the private sector.  For example, the ESB is now the main energy provider on the island - all of it.  As a result of the financial crisis, NAMA, which is a public sector body in the South, became a very large property owner in the North.  One can see that a former public sector monopoly for letter delivery, the Royal Mail, is now close to a private sector monopoly for letter delivery.  I speculate that the Royal Mail, in the private sector, will not want to keep its outposts in the North and, therefore, there is a clear synergy.  These things happen naturally, but it is policy that gets in the way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor Patterson" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015051200002#J00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to speak.  With respect to the subject of today's discussion, there are significant barriers that affect pan-island trade and generate profit-diminishing transaction costs.  They also encourage an illegal trade which seeks to exploit the fiscal differentials, with resultant reputational damage and loss of revenues, especially in the Border region.</p> <p>  Given the extent of the aforementioned trade distorting barriers, my view is that there needs to be an intergovernmental action plan to achieve a real uplift in pan-island trade and shared development outcomes.  As part of that strategy, the transport network surely has to feature as a major priority, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that links between Northern Ireland and the Republic are of such a standard that trade-related travel would no longer be punitively expensive or slow and the scheduling of services would help business collaboration.</p> <p>  The future economic development of most of the island - the areas that are not in the hinterland of Dublin and Belfast - depends on the extent and success of indigenous business growth.  A key predictor of indigenous business success is the extent to which those businesses engage in collaboration and networking.  Where there are cultural constraints on the propensity to network, or jurisdictional limits on the territory across which it can happen, less business collaboration will take place, with the implication that indigenous businesses will be less successful than they would otherwise be in a more open trading environment.  Businesses will only thrive if the ecosystem within which they operate is supportive.</p> <p>  I am an economic development practitioner who has worked in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Border counties in this State and various EU jurisdictions.  Therefore, my perspective is that the model which is most likely to yield the greatest returns is one based on the principle of subsidiarity, which is to bring the conception and delivery of policy as close as possible to the end beneficiaries.  In my experience, the greater the distance between their design and management and their intended impact, the less successful publicly funded interventions are likely to be.  In the context of promoting more trade and economic co-operation across the island, this means more involvement of stakeholders at county and district council levels in the making and implementation of policy.  Such a framework would allow finely calibrated locally sensitive solutions to be quickly put in place.   However, this proposition is not at the expense of but complements a macro-political and macroeconomic strategic framework.</p> <p>  Given that an intergovernmental structure to promote all-island trade already exists, through InterTradeIreland, and that governance arrangements are already in place, a signal of intent would involve two things: first, to empower that institution with serious budget and substantive powers; and second, to mandate Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland to collaborate with it much more actively, with the extent of that collaboration regularly reviewed.</p><p> At the sub-regional level, I and other colleagues in my area of Newry, Mourne and Down, along with our partners in County Louth, have been working in an innovation alliance to look at ways in which we can utilise our limited resources better and collaborate more effectively to promote greater economic collaboration, trade and growth in the region.  We recognise that as partners we are all assets and that by pooling our efforts we can encourage more cross-Border business collaboration.  This cross-Border innovation alliance is part of a much more ambitious collaborative effort led by the local authorities in the region which have signed up to a memorandum of understanding.  The commitment of central government policy and budgeting is needed to support this effort.  The focus of the new regional action plan for jobs on the importance of cross-Border collaboration can offer a real prospect to achieve this.  A similar shift is required in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

It is a pity we do not have more time to discuss some of these issues, but I thank the witnesses for coming here individually to give the presentations.  I believe this is one of the most important issues for our committee to discuss and it is disappointing that aside from the Cathaoirleach, there are no Government Deputies here to listen to the presentations.  The importance of this is immense, as has been articulated by the witnesses.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  Dr. Anthony Soares spoke about the integration of the two economies and the planning involved.  I am anxious to get a quantitative understanding of that.  Between one and ten, how disintegrated are the planning processes currently with regard to the economies, North and South?  Some of the evidence has been that there have been backward steps in respect of the all-Ireland economy.  Is the policy of an all-Ireland economy being pursued in the witnesses' view?</p> <p>  The next question is more open and relates to the Border corridor.  Are we talking about all of the Border or a specific element of it?  How deep is the level of integration being discussed?  Are we talking about co-operation as regards planning, development and enterprise, or are we talking about creating a space perhaps where there is different taxation, excise and other costs and engagements with the Governments on equalisation there?</p> <p>  On the disjointed element of the Border, Mr. Padraic White mentioned the poverty and the fact that income in the Border region is far lower.  Could he say that the disjointed Border economy is a direct cause of poverty?  The figures he mentioned appear to show that.  Is a difficulty with finding the &euro;1.5 million an example of a deprioritisation of that Border infrastructure?  On the issue with regard to Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way, where was Tourism Ireland in that process?  If we do not plan in a joint fashion, the natural result is a disjointed plan.  Tourism Ireland is one of the few bodies tasked with the development of an economic issue on a cross-Border basis.  Should it not have a central role in those developments?</p> <p>  Regarding the InterTradeIreland issue, Dr. Conor Patterson spoke about the opportunities that exist.  Again, would one indigenous enterprise organisation on the island of Ireland not deliver a more integrated enterprise policy, North and South?</p><p>Is a breakdown available on the development and staffing of InterTradeIreland?  Has any other enterprise agency, North or South, experienced a 30% cut in its income?  Why are there 64 places, 112 places and 81 places when the demand is far higher?  Would the logic be, given that engagement with enterprise has a positive effect on income and jobs, that we seek to meet that demand?  I was interested in Mr. Michael Burke's point of view as an economist.  TTIP between Europe and the United States is a significant issue which is being discussed.  The Government has been very happy to quantify the potential benefits to the Irish economy, with 5,000 jobs here and this level of growth there.  Is it possible to quantify the benefits to the economy as a result of the raising of the barriers to trade created by the Border?  Is it possible to seek to identify the cost of the Border to the economy as a whole and to every individual pocket in the State?  Mr. Burke referred to the GDP figures.  I ask him to elaborate on the GDP figures.  Pound for pound, what would be the best reforms that could be initiated by the Government?</p></speech>

I chair an <i>ad hoc</i>group of people from North and South who are interested.  It relates to the counties immediately adjoining the Border area and, therefore, it is narrower than an all-island economy.  The Southern side is made up of Donegal, Sligo, Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and Louth.  Within that we identified at least seven strategic areas where there is a common interest which should override jurisdictional and other issues.  This has been endorsed in any discussion we have had with the cross-Border networks.  There is a strong willingness to work on that.<br/><br/>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked about income figures and whether there is a direct correlation with the disjointed nature of the Border.  Many aspects come together in this regard.  For example, there is a weak economic structure, a weak urban structure, a weak communication network and the resultant peripheral aspect in both jurisdictions.  The most recent figures confirm absolutely in my view that the trend is negative and that it is a symptom of the failure to develop the economies in an optimum way on each side of the Border.  That brings me to the Deputy's final point about tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland developed the projects of Ancient Ireland and the Wild Atlantic Way.  The mandate of F&aacute;ilte Ireland stops at the Border.  Tourism Ireland promotes the whole island but basically, in so far as I can make out, never the twain shall meet.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is constrained by the fact that its political mandate stops at the Border, even though on the ground, for example, in Newry, Mourne and Down, and Louth, there is a major commitment to develop the whole Newry, Mourne, Carlingford, Cooley peninsula.  The Narrow Water bridge was a symbol of that commitment and the local commitment but that is almost in spite of the official system.</p></speech>

In the context of cross-Border co-operation, would it be useful to have specific zones with particular characteristics, such as Letterkenny-Derry, Dundalk-Newry and Armagh-Monaghan, which could be strategically used to equalise the damaging effects of the Border?</p></speech>

The draft charter includes innovative ideas for developing new high-tech industries of the future that involve collaboration between the two third level sectors, which would involve institutes of technology and so on.  There would be a natural tendency to build those around Derry, Letterkenny, Dundalk and Monaghan.  As Mr. Gough mentioned, there is a concept of creating clusters of like-minded industries, whether in furniture, fabrication or whatever.  All those potentials are there but the dialogue is not really encouraged to commence, partly because the relevant state agencies on either side of the Border, namely, Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland, have no mandate to collaborate on these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.208" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015051200002#M00300"><p>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked me to give marks out of ten in terms of the level of integration between economic policy in the two jurisdictions.  I will preface my answer by pointing out that I am a former academic who was known for not giving the highest marks ever.  Our approach is to see the glass as half full rather than half empty.  We are ambitious in our work and would like to see more happening.  In our longer written submission we refer to some of the positive developments we have seen, including InterTradeIreland's recent launch of the Elevate programme.  These are good things which give us some hope.</p> <p>  In terms of economic policy and the levels of integration, it is a question of identifying areas where co-operation makes sense and will bring a benefit to both jurisdictions and to citizens of the island.  In order to identify those types of opportunities, one must proof policies and seek out potentials.  If one does not look for opportunities, one will not identify them.  In addition, if only one side is looking for opportunities and the other is not, there will not be a common view of where opportunities might lie.  It is a question of facilitating co-operation in addressing issues like socio-economic disadvantage but also identifying opportunities to exploit potentials that are currently not being availed of because of the Border and the two jurisdictions managing their economic policies separately.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to opportunities at local government level.  Councils certainly are doing a lot in terms of cross-Border co-operation.  A difficulty arises at local government level, however, in that community development looks at one part and economic development is hived off as a separate part, with the two only being joined together at the end.  That approach will lead to missed opportunities.  We must bring the two together, community and economic development, at local authority level.  As I said, there is a lot going on at this level.  I agree with Dr. Patterson that we need an emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity such that where there at people at the right level who are capable of addressing problems and opportunities for cross-Border collaboration, then it should be done at that level.  At the same time, the two jurisdictions need to provide a larger framework for co-operation by local authorities.</p></speech>

The problem is the lack of budget and authority.  I look back to the period in the immediate aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement when there was institutional innovation and the principles built into it.  Perhaps one of the unspoken successes of the peace process was the commitment to subsidiarity and local partnerships holding real budgetary responsibility and being able to innovate policy and interventions.  At local level, the north west is very different from the mid-Border region, which is different again from the east Border region.  The local players and stakeholders know what is needed in each area.  They just need to be empowered by several Government institutions working alongside them.  They are not seeking to displace them.  In my experience, the memorandum of understanding between Newry and Mourne District Council, Down District Council, and Louth County Council, signed in Brussels in 2010, lacked budgetary teeth and the regulatory powers to institute anything significant.  The ambition and will are there but the power is lacking.</p></speech>

The presentation document I have provided includes a table.  The North's economic output is approximately &pound;30 billion per annum, while the economic output of Ireland is approximately &euro;180 billion.  If they are converted to a common currency, the Northern economy is approximately one quarter of the size of this economy.  I would expect both to rise significantly with unification, simply from the process of unification.  The Border region provides a very good example of this.  It is as if we have a railway going nowhere.  We have a series of what should be natural links between the two economies, because they should be one economy, but they are stunted and have atrophied because there is a stopping point.  The point on tourism was very well made, but in my view it applies across the board.</p> <p>  The quantification of the benefits of unification is a somewhat tricky calculation.  My view is that, at a minimum, based on growth in the home market and the size of the market in the North, which is 25% of what it is here, at least half of the benefits would apply to living standards for all of the population of this economy.</p><p>That is not a fixed sum in the sense that the Northern Ireland economy would not be static or even grow at the same rate as this economy.  It would grow faster for a considerable period as it caught up and, therefore, at a minimum, living standards would increase by approximately 12.5% simply through the process of reunification.</p><p> In terms of reforms, the obvious one to suggest would be to get rid of the Border.  In the absence of that, the obvious no cost reform is for the governments and the agencies to be instructed to collaborate with each other to improve the living standards of people across the entire island, that is, to stop whatever it is that prevents them from working together such as turf wars or a dislike of the cut of people's jib and so on and to get on and do the job they are tasked with in terms of improving living standards.  People are not asked to do things like Tourism Ireland for the fun of it.  They are supposed to be there to produce an increase in tourism across the island of Ireland.</p><p> With regard to the longer-term picture, all the benefits increase massively with investment.  That should be plain.  The enormous increase in living standards that has taken place in this jurisdiction relative to both the North and Britain, the former power here, was a long process but it accelerated with the arrival of European investment in the 1980s and 1990s.  The level of investment accelerates the growth of an economy.  I would suggest all the types of obvious infrastructure development that one would expect.  The three keys areas include major investment in rail transport across the island.  I would invest significantly in broadband, which has been mentioned and I would invest heavily in a unified education system because these three actions would allow the unified economy to grow rapidly.</p></speech>

One of them referred to the elephant in the room, which since last Friday morning, has been on the loose and on the rampage and that is the in-out EU referendum in the UK.  Any discussion about an all-island economy, therefore, has to take that into account.  The referendum will happen within the next 18 to 24 months.  What are the delegation's views on the potential impact of Britain's exit from the EU on an all-island economy?  If the representatives were on the negotiating team with Brussels seeking various concessions to sell the notion of Europe, what concessions should be sought that would assist the development of the economy in the North?</p></speech>

Apparently, I am now to understand that Scots are foreigners.  I do not believe that Britain will leave the EU for the very good reasons that the overwhelming majority of big business does not want that to happen and the overall majority of big business in the US does not want it to happen because of the close links that exist, which is an important factor.  However, after last Thursday's events, I would never say "never" to anything and it could happen.  That would be a divisive change in the relationship of both economies to the rest of the world.  The key factor is the EU is the biggest market in the world and Britain would cut itself off from it.  The Northern Ireland economy has been a forgotten annexe of a slow growing British economy on a relative basis for a long time.  Cutting itself off from Europe would deepen those trends significantly and accelerate them.</p><p>Therefore, it might become obvious to many in the North, where, perhaps, it is not already the case, that, in economic terms, the future does not lie with Britain.</p></speech>

Mr. Gough also highlighted the fact that one of the things InterTradeIreland has been very successful in doing is enabling cross-Border co-operation between businesses and research institutes in the context of drawing down Horizon 2020 funds.  These are European funds which lead to innovation.  Northern Ireland, in particular, has been assisted by the allocation of European funds.</p> <p>  One of the themes to be addressed at this meeting is that relating to job creation and the possibility of staff exchanges, North and South.  The European Union has funded a very successful project run by the Centre for Cross Border Studies, which is the Border People project.  If we are discussing the creation of an all-island economy and co-operation, North and South, then the mobility of citizens between the two jurisdictions in order that they might work, study, live and retire in either is a factor.  Such citizens need information and the Border People project currently provides it.  It is a very practical project and has been funded by INTERREG.  Research undertaken in 2010 indicates that at that time there were an estimated 23,000 cross-Border workers.  We know that this is an underestimate because it was only those 23,000 who identified themselves as cross-Border workers.  There are many more individuals out there who might not perhaps be forthcoming in terms of identifying themselves as being such workers as a result of the lack of information regarding their general rights, their duties in the context of where they should pay taxes and their rights when it comes to retirement.</p> <p>  We have received support from the European Union in respect of this very practical project, which has been assisting many citizens and providing free advice.  However, as is frequently the case in circumstances of this nature, the European funding for the project has come to an end.  We have tried to identify alternative funding so that the project might continue in the absence of INTERREG funding.  In that context, we have sought the support of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through its reconciliation fund.  Unfortunately, we do not believe we will obtain all the funding necessary to support all the activities relating to the project.</p> <p>  Situations of this type arise frequently.  In other words, we receive European money to fund very positive projects that help in terms of economic development, particularly cross-Border co-operation, but once that money runs out, there is no desire on the part of the authorities in the two jurisdictions to step in and say "Yes, this is a valid project, it needs to be supported and we will both provide that support".  It seems to be the case that if one jurisdiction does not become involved, the other will not do so.  Both tend to wait to see who will step in first and by the time a decision is made, the relevant project is already dead and the expertise relating to it is lost.  It is very difficult to get such projects up and running again.</p> <p>  The threat of a UK withdrawal from the EU is serious.  Such an exit would place the possibility of creating an effective all-island economy in serious doubt.</p></speech>

Let us consider the implications ahead of any referendum.  In that context, &pound;1 billion in EU funding has been allocated in respect of agriculture and fishing in Northern Ireland.  In addition, Structural Funds have also been allocated.  A total of 60% of SMEs in the North trade into the jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland.  We must also consider the effect on the peace process and the fact that the Government in this jurisdiction and its counterpart in the UK are co-guarantors of that process.  The Irish Republic would lose a key ally at the EU negotiating table if Britain were to withdraw.  There is also the fact that Britain is a key trading partner for the Republic.</p><p>I refer to the cost of managing a land border, what ultimately could be an international frontier.  The history of my own area is not just one of economic liberalisation post the peace process.  That began in the early 1990s with the removal of customs barriers between North and South and the fact that trade could move freely up and down the A1-N1.  In my view, this is the biggest geopolitical risk to this island.  It speaks volumes that the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, UKIP and the Traditional Unionist Voice, TUV, party all support an in-out referendum.  Moreover, the TUV supports the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union despite what in my view are the catastrophic implications economically for the North of Ireland and the fact that from a Unionist perspective, I would have thought it would be likely to accelerate the break-up of the Union.</p></speech>

The first obvious point to make is that we have an all-island economy.  It is not something we want to happen; there is an all-island economy.  Much of it happens organically because businesses and entrepreneurs recognise the value of the all-island economy if they can create jobs, grow their businesses and so on and if they can take advantage of markets on either side of the Border, they will do that.Moreover, it often is despite the political institutions, but it is because businesses themselves perceive the value in an all-island economy that we have one.  The question is how to nurture, build and grow it, which obviously requires plans, strategies and policies.  I have a number of questions in that regard, including the first and obvious one.  The previous speaker spoke about the elephant in the room that is the possibility of an in-out referendum on the future of the North and Britain in the European Union.  There also is the elephant in the room whereby there is, I will not state a hostility but certainly a fear, from some partners in the Assembly of any talk of a unified economy or an all-island economy and a resistance to it for obvious political reasons.  It can be pitched to them to a greater extent that it actually is in their interests that the all-island economy grows in respect of jobs and so on and we continue unashamedly to make that argument.  I was taken by the presentation made by Mr. Michael Burke that it makes sense economically, socially and so on.Consequently, this obvious elephant in the room also must be considered.</p><p>My questions primarily concern institutions because if one wishes to go beyond the organic, obviously the institutions must be fit for purpose to develop proper plans and strategies.  If one considers the Good Friday Agreement and its outworkings including North-South bodies, the North-South Ministerial Council and so on, how effective or how ineffective are they in driving and developing the all-island economy?  I am sure much good work is being done, even such as when this joint committee travels north to meet its counterparts.  The health committee often travels north and <i>vice versa</i>and good work is being done at a cross-Border level by many committees of both jurisdictions.  While this obviously is good, how robust are the institutions North and South, in particular in the North, in respect of driving on the all-Ireland economy?</p><p>In a follow-on regarding the in-out referendum on the European Union, some of the parties have proposed, with the support of some businesses, that were there to be a referendum and were it to take place in 18 months or two years' time, there should be a separate vote in the North.  In other words, whatever way the people in the North voted, such as if they were to vote &quot;Yes&quot; to stay in the European Union, then that should be respected.  How would that work or is that something to which the witnesses have given thought in terms of their own organisations?  The second element is one now may be looking at more fiscal powers for the North.  It was a commitment that was given by David Cameron after the election because of similar commitments now being given to Scotland.  Consequently, what pitch would the witnesses make?  What fiscal powers does the North need?  I note Mr. Padraic White also touched on this in terms of a distortion of taxes.  If one is looking at harmonisation of taxes, which would make sense and which would benefit an all-Ireland economy, what ones would the witnesses consider and what would they advocate should be the priority at that level?</p><p> The final question I have relates to another reality.  It might be unpopular to say it at times, but we are told that the public sector in the North is too big and the private sector is too small.  I agree that the private sector is too small.  The question is how we can grow the private sector in the North.  If we had a more unified economy, would that in itself deal with that reality?  Perhaps that is a question for Mr. Michael Burke.  That links in with the fiscal policies, because if we grow the private sector and we have more fiscal powers, that would give the Assembly and the devolved politicians the resources to meet the needs.  Mr. Burke touched on the social, economic, environmental and co-operative priorities.  That can only be done with resources.  If we had more capacity to do it within the Assembly, it would benefit the situation greatly.  How beneficial would the growth of the all-island economy be to the growth of the private sector in the North?</p></speech>

Senator Cullinane asked how effective are the North-South ministerial bodies.  Having been engaged in different arenas, my sense is that the political momentum both North and South has declined.  I take the example of the N2-A5.  At one stage that road was a major political priority and the Government was prepared to commit &euro;400 million of our money to the northern section of it but now it hardly figures.  I do not detect any political momentum in regard to it.  Unfortunately, that is a fact of life at the moment, which is regrettable.</p> <p>  In terms of fiscal powers for the North, the one on which the business sector and the Governments have been campaigning is the right to lower the corporation tax rate to 12.5%, which is the rate in the Republic.  I personally am a strong advocate for an all-island economy.  In a way, one of the real tests of that is whether one is prepared to support a 12.5% rate of corporation tax on both parts of this island, and I am.</p> <p>  I am also a strong advocate of co-operation between the agencies, North and South, in foreign direct investment in the interests of the whole economy.  However, it is an area on which people speak with forked tongues.  It is the last area that is effectively untouched by North-South co-operation because in both jurisdictions there is a highly protective attitude towards it, in addition to a lot of undeclared attitudes.  I have always been unequivocal on the need for much greater co-operation between the investment agencies on both sides, in particular in the interests of some of the Border areas.  That is my position on the matter.</p> <p>  In the private sector, the work with InterTradeIreland on the SME sector in the North and in the Republic is helping the evolution of the private sector.  In a way, there is no magic bullet.  One has foreign direct investment, which comes in with its intellectual know-how and its markets.  There is no short cut to growing one's indigenous companies.  It is painful.  Much work is being done.  Mr. Aidan Gough referred to schemes which are part of the process.  We miss the co-operation, in particular in the Border areas, between Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland where collaborative work across the Border looking at clusters of like-minded industries with a positive attitude to collaboration in an area of weak urban structure could achieve a lot.</p> <p>  Parts of the ecosystem for emerging SMEs are being put in place in the North.  I am involved in the Bank of Ireland kernel capital growth fund, which invests between &pound;250,000 and up to &pound;2 million in emerging companies in Northern Ireland.  We have invested in six emerging companies in the past year.  They are the classic emerging companies that Northern Ireland needs that are not dependent on the local market, which are essentially global companies.</p></speech>

He referred specifically to the North-South Ministerial Council.</p><p>I would say the effectiveness of the institutions generally depends on the energy and ambition of the policy makers or, in some cases, political actors who inhabit those institutions.  Great work has been done by the North-South Ministerial Council specifically, for example, in the area of cross-Border and all-island co-operation on health.  In the enterprise area, a great deal of work is being done through InterTradeIreland, which is at the centre when these sectoral meetings take place.  There has been a great deal of talk about how successful the two jurisdictions have been in working together to draw down EU funds.  I would say the secretariat of the North-South Ministerial Council is very effective and supportive.  It does great work.  I have to acknowledge that it has been a great supporter and partner of the Border People project, which does very practical things to enable people to take up employment on either side of the Border.  It is very effective in that case.</p></speech>

The public sector is already quite efficient, by the standards of other regions in these islands.  The only way to achieve greater efficiency is by achieving economies of scale and we cannot do that.  We need to have two health departments, two education departments and so on.  The same structures are having to be made twice in one small population area.</p> <p>  I worry a little about fiscal devolution.  I have some experience of Aberdeen, a city that is broadly comparable with Belfast.  Could we tell people living in Aberdeen and six counties around it to sail off into the North Sea, be independent and pay for it?  I think the Tories would love the North of Ireland to go wholesale for fiscal devolution because they would no longer have to cross-subsidise from the south east of England.  I would like to know whatever happened to Northern Ireland being a failed economic entity in that analysis.  In a region with a legacy of socio-economic problems that are products of partition, notwithstanding the great improvements that have been made since the Good Friday Agreement, how can there be fiscal devolution in the absence of an all-island framework?  My response to the proposition is that fiscal devolution can only take place within an all-island framework.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.233" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Burke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015051200002#S00300"><p>I will comment to the two issues that were addressed to me in part.  It was suggested that the private sector in the Northern Ireland economy is underdeveloped.  I agree with Dr. Patterson that the public sector in the North is, with one very important exception, pretty efficient.  I have already mentioned the important exception, which is the outsized level of the civil service and defence system there.  It is twice the size of the equivalent system here as a proportion of GDP.  I think that is a function of the political circumstances in which it operates.  One would expect that would not be the case in a unified Ireland.</p> <p>  The private sector is underdeveloped.  I would like to speak about one of the key problems in the history of the state.  At the outset, the private sector there had a real role in the world.  At that time, it was part of the British Empire, which was an enormous market, and it had a very specific industrial and shipping role within that.  The British Empire has gone and there is no new role for the Northern economy.  Successive Governments have attempted to overcome that by offering inducements to the private sector to invest.  I suggest that the word "DeLorean" should be on the headstone of that policy.  It really does not work.  Public sector investment is required.  Public sector investment does not work unless there is private sector investment as well.  One cannot have public sector investment on its own.  There is no reason on earth for the private sector to carry on investing in a tiny economy like that.  The only way it would make sense would be if it were part of a larger unified economy with access to the European Union.  It does not make sense to pursue the other policy I have mentioned.  We have tried it and it has failed.</p><p> That relates to the issue of harmonisation of taxes and the devolution of fiscal powers in the North.  There is an awful lot more heat than light generated by this discussion.  It seems to me that the terms "harmonisation of taxes" and "devolution of fiscal powers" boils down to 12.5%, as if there are no taxes other than corporate taxes and that taxes have no purpose other than the tax rate, which is completely untrue.  </p><p> I refer to corporation tax.  Britain has a system whereby one can carry forward and carry back losses for, I understand, five years.  That is unique in advanced industrialised economies.  It is about what is taxed, rather than the rate at which it is taxed.  The devolution of fiscal powers should be about what will be taxed, not simply the rate of tax.  In all the jurisdictions we are discussing, the contribution of corporation tax is abysmally low across all fronts.  Corporations do not pay much tax in any jurisdiction.  </p><p> We should think about the whole gamut of taxes and their devolution, which I very much support in regard to the North, what we use them for, what we are taxing and what we are trying to achieve with taxation.  I agree with Dr. Patterson.  All of this makes sense only in a unified Irish economy because the required investment will not be achieved in a tiny economy like that in the North.</p></speech>

Senator Cullinane touched on the point I was going to make when he referred to the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union.  It would have such a major impact on us that it is very difficult for us to talk about the rest of the issues when that elephant in the room is hanging over us.  It is perhaps only two years away and, hopefully, we will get through that.  I will cover some questions.</p> <p>  I was impressed by Mr. Burke discussing agriculture versus food processing.  The future is in food processing, which is more important than agriculture.  There should be two different Ministers, one to cover agriculture and another for food processing.  If a food processor states the best ingredients it can source for a product are not Irish made but will come from elsewhere and it will create jobs, that cannot be done if the same Ministry deals with food and agriculture.  It is not a popular thing to say but it seems that is one of the areas we can address.</p> <p>  Mr. White's contribution was interesting, in particular the importance of the Dublin-Derry road.  What do we have to do to get that off the ground?  What went wrong?  He said he does not know what went wrong, other than the fact the money we had allocated was not provided in the end.  We do not hear a word about the project.  It is an area about which we have to do something.  </p> <p>  I refer to InterTradeIreland.  What would Mr. Gough like to see happen?  Is there anything we, the Northern Government or the British Government can do that will address what he wants?  Could one button be pressed to achieve that?  It seems that it is something we have to achieve.</p> <p>  From the point of view of Dr. Soares, what are the barriers to the Border development corridor?  What is slowing down the process and stopping it from getting as far as it should?  </p> <p>  I remember shopping for a wedding present with somebody from Limerick.  When I suggested we buy Irish linen made in County Antrim, she asked, "Should we not support our own?".  It seems the further one goes from the Border, the more partitionist one becomes.  My father came from County Down and my mother from County Armagh.  It never dawned on me not to regard County Antrim as part of my country but some people from Kerry and Cork do not seem to do so.  What do we have to do, from the customer point of view, to get customers to be loyal to an all-Ireland economy rather than just being loyal to the part of Ireland they think they pay their taxes in and, therefore, recognise?</p></speech>

That was very common when I was young, but it is less common now.  Social separatism has developed over the past 40 years.  People follow institutional change, and given that policy and systems are back-to-back, with regard to currency and so on, it is not surprising that people in the North look north and people in the South look south.  It is inevitable.  The only way we will achieve change is through more locally led intervention supported by central government.  It is the local people most affected by partition who know where change can be made in the most cost-effective manner.</p></speech>

At an economic level, that is dealt with by branding.  It is true that food processing adds more value to the production process than agriculture, but we cannot simply gear everything towards food processing and not concern ourselves with the agriculture sector.  Apart from anything else, there will be major social deprivation as a result, which would destroy far more jobs and livelihoods than a world-beating food-processing sector would create, because a world-beating food-processing sector in Ireland would rely very much on capital investment and not on labour.  The way to overcome that is to turn what is already a very productive food-processing sector into a world-beating one through the branding of Irish products.  That does not happen on anything like the scale it should.  I am old enough to remember, as are others here, how Kerrygold launched the career of Tony O'Reilly.  That happened because a very good-quality product was turned into a global brand.  People in all parts of this island would be very happy to buy Irish linen, or whatever, if they, like everyone else, saw it as the best in the world.  To do that on an all-island basis requires an all-island economy, but that is what we should aim for.</p></speech>

The Dublin-Derry road has two parts, one of which is the N2 from here to Monaghan.  After the St. Andrews Agreement and all the excitement about peace, that route was regarded as being of major significance to the whole Border area, opening up the north-west economy and helping to create an all-island economy.  It is an eloquent testimony to the lack of public or political interest that we cannot find the &euro;1.5 million to give to Monaghan County Council to advance the planning on our part of it.  On the northern side, the planning permission was quashed, and it is now making its way in a leisurely manner through the new planning process.  On both sides, one sees a lack of any real political urgency or engagement.  It speaks most eloquently to the lack of interest in this subject.</p> <p>  Regarding the Border development corridor, we have a draft solidarity charter.  If it is going to work, it must be built on the platform of support from local authorities, North and South, in the Border area.</p><p>Given that there are new local authorities in the North, their interest in it remains to be seen as they bed down.  Dr. Anthony Soares and I were invited by the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, to a meeting of its management group which was attended by councillors from North and South in February 2015.  We discussed it fully and it was unanimously endorsed by the councillors on both sides.  As Dr. Conor Patterson said earlier, at local authority level people want to co-operate.  It is almost as if they are trying to do it in a vacuum.  I believe the will is there, but it remains to be seen. </p><p> I will make one final comment on the Senator's anecdote in respect of the wedding gift and so forth.  Members might recall after the Good Friday Agreement the excitement in the South about visiting Northern Ireland.  Hundreds and thousands of people from the South who had never been to Belfast visited the area and people were beginning to rediscover Northern Ireland.  In my opinion, because of the lack of public and political engagement and the lack of a continuous espousal of an all-island economy, we retreated into our insularity and our separatism.  It offends me personally when I hear representatives of the farmers' organisations imply that milk from Northern Ireland that is in our supermarkets should somehow not be regarded as Irish.  I find that offensive and totally opposed to any sense we have of common solidarity as an all-island economy.</p></speech>

The impetus has to be there from the local authorities, and local government reform on the Northern side has slowed things down slightly.  On the issue of a higher policy level in terms of the two jurisdictions coming from both sides, I will give the committee an example of what was perhaps a missed opportunity which would have given an impetus to the Border development corridor.  The European Commission designed not different programmes or a different set of funds but something called integrated territorial investment.  The Commission recommended to both the Irish and UK Governments - this would affect specifically Northern Ireland - that they draw pots of money from whatever fund, the European Social Fund or the European Territorial Co-operation Fund, and put them together to strategically address one particular territory that they agree needs development.  Both Governments could draw down all sorts of funds and combine them with their own central funds to strategically address something in the territory.  We promoted this idea that integrated territorial mechanism was a tool that should have been used in this new EU funding period, but that potential tool was not used.  That was a missed opportunity which would have given impetus to the Border development corridor.</p></speech>

Like Senator Feargal Quinn, I was doing business in the North for the first time in 1992 and 1993 when I was buying wool in Nationalist and Unionist areas.  When I asked Unionist farmers how they felt dealing with a company from the South, I was fascinated when they said - typical of any businessman - that they were loyal to the Crown but more loyal to the half-crown.  From that I found that if business could be done to break barriers it was easy to achieve much success.</p> <p>  A question I have not yet heard discussed is that of currency differentiation.  Four years ago, many people travelled to the North to do their shopping, but that has stopped, due in part to the currency differentiation.  At the time the UK economy was devaluing sterling against the euro.  Now the reverse is happening, with the euro being devalued against the two major currencies.</p><p>From an all-island perspective, how should we address this situation?  Should we have one currency for the whole island or a fixed rate?  When the euro was being brought in, for a period of time there was a fixed rate between the various currencies.  We may talk about tax harmonisation but unless something is in place, there will be violent fluctuations, such as those between the two currencies over the past year.  It leads to difficulties for individuals and small companies, in particular, to trade cross-Border.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-12a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Burke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015051200002#W00300"><p>My background is in currencies and forecasting analysis.  The reality is there will be no fix between sterling and the euro.  It would not be possible and it is not in the interests of the wider EU or Britain to do it simply because of the costs it imposes on the economy here, which is particularly, but not solely, felt in the Border region.  That sort of proves the point that for one very large currency area and one significantly lesser currency area, the Northern economy is irrelevant.  I say this in all honesty.  For someone who lives in London, the Northern economy is never mentioned.  No one cares about the Northern economy.  One might argue that here people care insufficiently but at least there is some discussion.  It is hardly ever mentioned in England.  It would not be mentioned in the context of setting of currency or interest rate policy.  It is never a consideration.  <br/><br/>That being said, the point is very well made that the currency fluctuations between the two cause considerable disruption and dislocation.  It makes it impossible to do long-term planning and investment.  It even has the dislocating effect where one year, shops on one side of the Border do well while those on the other side go to the wall and then <i>vice versa</i>because of currency movements.  This is a factor in this sort of desolation or hole around the Border area which is where lesser economic activity takes place.<br/><br/>In the history of this State, there was a very decisive moment, which I remember well because I was working in the currency markets at the time, when sterling devalued and was ejected from the exchange rate mechanism, ERM, in 1992.  The punt had been linked to sterling ever since the foundation of this State in one way or another and the very intelligent decision was made to devalue but stay inside the ERM.  It was following that decision, FDI flooded into Ireland.  That was helped along with European investment.  The reason for that was that Ireland still had access to this considerable market, which is now 500 million strong in terms of population.  If we take the European economy as a whole, it is the largest economy in the world.<br/><br/>For a unified Irish economy, there is really only one decision.  One could not possibly go back to having sterling.  That would be to partly undo all the achievements of the past 90 odd years.  The other possibility is a new punt.  That presents its own severe difficulties, with a tiny economy and also cutting itself off in a way that Britain would be doing.  An alternative is to have the euro, for all its ills, for the whole-island economy.  To me, that is the only sensible solution.</p></speech>

We like to be on the pulse of small business so that we can form our supports to meet the challenges and opportunities they are facing.</p><p>One of the ways we do that is through our business monitor, which is a quarterly survey of businesses across the island.  In our survey we routinely ask our clients about the main challenges facing them as a small business.  Since we started the survey, the exchange rate has never been a major issue for businesses.  Businesses can work around it.  Those in the Border area have a depth of experience and operate largely as a dual currency area.  Volatility, however, can be a factor.  We have noticed in our latest survey, the results of which have not yet been released, that only 6% of businesses say the exchange rate is a factor, which has trebled from the 2% who considered it a factor previously.  We are keeping an eye on this.  The issue seems to be volatility.</p></speech>

If the United Kingdom were to leave the European Union, the currency would be more stuck.  The Governments on both sides of the Border have control over taxes and levies which do affect and can influence and distort trade.  I mentioned that we unilaterally imposed a carbon tax on solid fuel.  This does not apply in the North of Ireland.  It has led to a distortion of trade and a major impact in the Border area, not to speak of the environmental effects.</p> <p>  Probably one of the few areas where there has been co-operation is in relation to excise duties on alcohol.  My perception is that because of the horrendous effects of low alcohol pricing and binge buying, North and South, there is, whether explicit or otherwise, some kind of understanding and an awareness in both jurisdictions   If we are serious about minimising distortions, the Executive in Northern Ireland, which has jurisdiction over taxes of various kinds, and our Government should at least consult with each other on the effect of tax on trade flows and on business.  I do not believe that has been happening in any conscious way up to now.  That is something within their own jurisdiction.</p></speech>

We are looking at North-South flows in terms of products, clients, and employees in the agrifood sector in four counties and we are looking at micro businesses, farmers, retailers, restaurants and some hotels.  On the issue of currency differentials, very few of them mentioned this as a problem.  In fact, in response to the question on whether the currency differential is a problem, they have said that it is not.  In fact, they mentioned that some of the businesses they deal with are so used to the currency differentials that they invoice them in the appropriate currency that will minimise the disruption to the buyer.  Farmers were the one exception and they mentioned the currency more frequently, although it still was not something they brought up as a major issue.</p> <p>  On the question of whether smaller businesses were looking for buyers on the other side of the Border, I can give an example of a business with an export licence which was asked if it exported to the other side of the Border and its response was, "No, we do not go looking for them and they do not come looking for us".  They had some very good reasons for their business as they were happy with the market they had and they did not really wish to expand to the other side of the Border.  They thought trading with the other side of the Border would complicate matters as they would have to deal with two sets of regulations and, therefore, they would rather stay within the one jurisdiction.  Every now and again there was the case that the grass was greener on the other side, that things were done better and that business was better on the other side, but one would hear the same response if one questioned people on the other side of the Border.  People in the South think the North has it better.  If one is in the North, the southern business sector has it better.  The currency differentials did not come up as a major issue.</p></speech>

There is passive political resistance in the South to issues such as harmonisation.</p> <p>  With regard to currency differences, I can understand why businesses in the North did not previously identify currency as a major problem.  Historically, the currency differential has been beneficial until the present but it must act as a brake on investment.  If I was looking for a retail investment on the Border, given the retail benefits that have swung to the South, it must act as a brake.</p> <p>  Are there international comparators for the objectives we share with regard to an economy being further integrated?  What steps can be taken?  It might not be specifically obvious right now.</p></speech>

Many countries have been unified sometimes after a period of colonialism.  While I do not know of one, there may be the odd one or two where the situation has not been improved by unification.  In general, the simple act of unification is an economic boon for the reasons I advanced earlier.</p> <p>  In the more recent period in Europe, particularly in eastern Europe, we have seen countries break up.  Arguably, some of them were yoked together bureaucratically but, in general, the economic picture in eastern Europe has not been bright, although there are exceptions.  Part of the argument about the division of labour is that it takes place both in the home market and the international market.  The more collaboration and co-operation we can achieve, the greater the scope for the division of labour, which is the primary factor driving prosperity.  With any US car, only 35% of it is made in the US, with the rest made in many other countries around the world.  There is a general tendency for trade to be internationalised.  Having barriers between natural economic units like the two jurisdictions on this island makes no sense in that general environment.</p></speech>
