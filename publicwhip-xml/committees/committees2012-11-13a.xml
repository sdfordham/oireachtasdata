    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Comer" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012111300003#C00300"><p>I thank the committee, and my organisation welcomes the opportunity to engage with elected politicians and make them aware of our views on issues that are important to farmers.  We are thankful for the privilege.  There is much ongoing debate relating to the CAP.</p> <p>Much will be decided in the coming six-12 months.  We have made our views on policies well known and have met a number of the political representatives present today on an individual basis.  However, it would be worthwhile to go over the important aspects.</p><p> Everyone is in agreement that we need the best result in the budget.  Our organisation wants the multi-annual financial framework to be put in place as soon as possible.  If financial crises occur in other member states, it will not be to farmers&rsquo; advantage to have the budget continuously in doubt.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to agree the framework.  This relates to pillars 1 and 2.  We must keep an eye on objective criteria and the way in which pillar 2 is funded.  It is essential that Ireland&rsquo;s portion of the pillar 2 budget be agreed simultaneously under the multi-annual framework.  Perhaps we will have a wider debate on this issue.</p><p> We have picked out the main points of the October 2011 proposals on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, that will affect us as farmers &ndash; flattening or convergence, as it is known, the base year and greening.  In the Irish context, convergence or flattening would have a negative impact on active farmers.  We wish to flag this issue clearly today.  If every hectare of land in Ireland has the same payment attached to it, there will be no incentive for a farmer to remain active and all of the financial power will be placed in the hands of the armchair farmer instead of the active farmer.  We support the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s position.  With his departmental officials, he has a fair grasp of the impact of shifting funds from one set of farmers to another.</p><p> We would support proportional approximation, but it should be graduated.  A critical wording should be incorporated in the regulation, namely, &ldquo;a gradual move towards&rdquo;.  This would not require one to arrive at an outcome within a specific timeframe.  Even the proponents of different approaches to disseminating the funds agree that a gradual move is essential, particularly given the system&rsquo;s use of reference years.</p><p> We must accept that the historical situation is gone.  The Commissioner does not like the word &ldquo;historical&rdquo; and wants to move onwards.  However, the people with historical entitlements or their sons or daughters remain active on their farms.  There are anomalies, but as much as 85% of them are still active.  Some 9% or 10% are in receipt of large payments but are doing little, but one should not throw the baby out with the bath water.  One should be cognisant of supporting the active farmer.</p><p> A useful definition of &ldquo;active farmer&rdquo; at member state level is essential.  An active farmer should have a meaningful stocking density.  In the interests of fairness, we would not be opposed to the inclusion of an off-farm income element, although the Government might claim that it would be difficult to regulate.</p><p> Turning to the graduated approximation, up to the first &euro;30,000 the maximum linear cut could be 5%.  At over &euro;30,000, the cut could be 10.  This would have a large effect on lower single farm payments.  A small payment would increase by up to 30%.</p><p> Although I am from the west, I represent all farmers.  The best way to represent west of Ireland farmers or those who believe that they have less productive land would be to incorporate into pillar 2 a meaningful rural environment protection scheme, REPs, no further cuts and an enhancement of the disadvantaged areas scheme payments.  This is the way to channel funds to land that does not have the same productive capacity.  Investments have taken place but in the average or typical sized farm operated by a full-time farmer.  Cognisance must be taken of that fact.  A full-time farmer, operating a labour unit, receives a reasonable single farm payment so what, in the name of God, is the justification for making him insolvent?  It is the production basis for this country.  Why would funds be shifted away from him, even modest payments of up to &euro;30,000?  What is the point of doing that?</p><p> Many politicians have told the organisation that the potential impact and speculation about using the base year has gone.  I strongly disagree.  People continue to speculate, particularly on the dairy farmer element.  The land surrounding a milking platform is critical and if anything interferes with it then a farmer cannot milk cows or replace it with land located five miles away.  People say that the damage has been done with regard to the reference year.  The problem is that I do not believe that the reference year will be 2014.  I think that it will go beyond that.  </p><p> If everything works as best that it can and the multi-annual financial framework is agreed at the end of the month, before Christmas or at the end of December, we get the EU Presidency in January and the Minister gets agreement on everything, then we need regulation and to build legislation around it.  Even if all of the civil servants in Europe work flat out I do not think they will get the work done in time for 2014.  That means that the base year will role on again.  If, like the indications made in the past few days, they run into difficulty then it could be 2015.  Therefore, speculation will continue and it is a disaster for the dairy farmer because there are issues with the land around milking platforms.</p><p> The IFA has an issue with the third element of the CAP which is greening.  There are 18 statutory management requirements for cross-compliance and that bar is sufficiently high enough to justify a single farm payment.  We must bear in mind that the Commissioner has emphasised that it is his best card for securing the overall budget and it is the best way to sell it to the taxpayers of Europe who fund the CAP and EU budgets.  Keeping in mind that greening is coming, the IFA would like to know more of the details.  It is proposed that 30% of lands will be under the headline of "greening".  If that is the case then the IFA want it to incorporated into proportional approximation.  Otherwise, in year one, 30% of land would be flattened which would be too fast and too soon and would distort many businesses.  We would like to know the details of the greening plan.  There is a proposal to have five hectares for crop rotation which would be a disaster for dairy farmers as a lot of dairy farmers grow maize.   The limit is too restrictive.  I know it has been proposed to increase the amount but it is not a Commission proposal.  Many issues must be watched.  We want to ensure that the greening element does not disallow the need for a proper rural environment protection scheme in pillar 2.</p><p> With regard to pillar 1, price supports are important to our industry.  The safety net for milk has been decreased to 20 cent per litre which is too low.  Every milk producer across Europe would be gone out of business with such a rate. The scientific bodies in Teagasc have told us that the cost of production is 28c per litre this year.  </p><p>  Under the CAP proposals the IFA has not seen anything to identify or address the largest problem that will face our industry.  The Minister has noble aspirations for us, such as an increase of 50% in production by 2020.  We have not seen anything in any policy about volatility.  It is incumbent on national and European politicians to address the elephant in the room which is volatility.  That has the capacity to bring the dairy industry to where the pig industry is now.  When I was growing up every household has its own pigs, perhaps as many as 20 sows, but now there are fewer than 300 pig farmers.  They are struggling financially and scale has not solved their problems.  Volatility is the single greatest risk factor for the dairy sector, particularly for investment. </p> <p>We are working with our European milk board colleagues in promoting the idea of an independent monitoring agency.  It needs to be independent of but supported by the Commission in order to get it up and running.  It has been tried at national level in several member states and has not worked.  It would have a two-fold effect - first, it would address volatility and second, it would take away the power from the multinationals.  It is frightening to note that 23 multinationals control up to 90% of the retail food chain process.  An independent monitoring agency would clearly identify the cost of production of milk and other products, what the processor takes out of it and what the retailer gets.  It would identify where production is going before it actually happens, so an agency would have the capacity to predict production levels in eight to ten months time.  We might be able to incorporate a system that would allow for expansion or contraction, if required.</p><p> It is of vital importance that we get funding from pillar 2.  While we welcome the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, it is the poor relation of REPS.  It is not fit for purpose.  A good vibrant, robust well-funded REPS scheme will identify and address many of the issues we raise.  The disadvantaged area payments were cut from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million.  It must be reinstated and there must be certainty in the upcoming budget that no further cuts will be made to the REPS and the disadvantaged areas budgets.  Under the Common Agricultural Policy proposals, we would like an orderly transfer of family farms. with provisions for installation and early retirement.</p><p> We have set out in detail our requirements in our pre-budget submission.  I will list the headings.  Land consolidation is absolutely critical.  We acknowledge the improvement in the stamp duty provisions in the last budget with the reduction from 6% to 2%.  We feel further adjustments could be made in the next budget that would make a significant impact.  We would like to see the young trained farmers' stamp duty relief, which is due to run out at the end of this year, addressed.</p><p> We have major issues with capital gains tax on land consolidation.  The capital gains tax is now at 30%.  If one wants to sell a parcel of land five or six miles away and buy ten or 12 acres around the home farm, the costs are enormous.  It is off-putting.  I think for the good of the economy, given we are charged with taking the economy from the financial abyss, we would like the problem we have identified to be recognised in real terms in the budget and give roll-over relief for land consolidation.  I think it would be of huge benefit to individual farmers and achieve significant benefit for the national good.  We make a strong case that transfer of the family farm should be done on a tax free basis.  My colleagues can answer detailed questions on the taxation elements of the pre-budget submission.</p><p> We do not want to see cuts in the funding of the schemes during 2013.  The targeted agricultural modernisation agricultural scheme, TAMS, covers the dairy equipment scheme and is funded by four tranches of &euro;4.25 million each year.  We would like to see the payments front loaded.  There is no logical reason that the money which will come on stream on a tranches basis is not paid to the farmers who want to do work.  I know there is a requirement under EU legislation, but it does not specifically state that the tranches must be equal.  It only states that there must be moneys available at the end of the scheme as well as at the beginning.  I think the scheme could be front loaded to meet the demand that is there and leave a smaller portion of the fund for later on.</p><p> I think everyone is aware of the view of the capital assets implementation group.  We say that land is merely the tools of the trade by which farmers earn an income.  To incorporate the value of the land into the equation of income on which the capacity of a parent to send a child to third level education is adjudicated would be unfair, unjust and unworkable.  I am prepared to answer any questions on our position.</p><p> An issue that is close to my heart, because I have looked for the logic to it on numerous occasions, and with the permission of the Chairman, I will refer to it at this meeting, relates to the conveyancing conflicts group.  The Incorporated Law Society brought in a statutory instrument that will become the law of the land on 1 January 2013, whereby it is a legal requirement that a solicitor cannot act for both parties as happened heretofore.  This will impact on all property transactions, but on farm transfer it will have a serious negative effect in terms of costs.  What typically happens in a land transfer is that one person gets some of the land, another son might get a site and a daughter something else.  A family with five children could end up with a bus load of solicitors to go ahead with the transaction.  It was introduced under the guise of protecting the elderly and to prevent elderly abuse.  We never got figures as to the number of people who were abused, or where it featured in the statistics and if this statutory instrument will resolve it.  My view is that it will not.  At another level, how did we gift the capacity to enact laws to the Incorporated Law Society when we have 166 elected representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and 60 Senators in the Upper House without it ever getting to the floor of the Houses of the Oireachtas?  If it had been debated in the Oireachtas, the Law Society's position may be vindicated, but at least we would be more educated about it.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012111300005#E00300"><p>I will deal with the topics in reverse order, I agree with the concerns of the ICMSA on conveyancing.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister but I did not get much joy.  I believe this issue should be discussed.</p><p>  At this time of the year everybody comes in with the shopping list.  At this stage it is normally way too late but I suggest the committee should look at the issue of the tax ramifications of land consolidation.  This is a very important issue for dairy farmers.  We need to develop a policy, and argue it out well in advance of a budget.  I can guarantee that little will be added to what is already in the budget.  As a committee we should set out early next year to consider our policies on these proposals and examine all the implications in order to ensure that barriers to the development of farming, such as land consolidation and the tax regime and so on are looked at.  We should not wait until the last minute when it is too late to influence Government.</p><p>  The delegation from the ICMSA obviously did not read the expenditure report issued by the Government last year, in which it was stated there would be a 6% cut in agriculture next year.  I see from the ICMSA shopping list that more money and not less is required.  It is a very handy ploy because no matter what happens, it is on a winner.  We too can play the same game when talking to the Minister, but one does not influence the game that way.  I think the 6% cut is probably disproportionate, I recognise there will be a cut, as there is less money.  The first thing to do is to try to make as many savings as we can from administration.  We can try to handle the money a bit better and ensure there is no carry forward of unspent cash, which disappears into the ether leaving just a liability.</p> <p>I still believe the Minister will not be expanding the scheme when all of that is done.  We have an awkward decision to make.  The Minister has an even more awkward decision to make.  Should we recommend the retention of the suckler cow scheme, for example?  If we do, where will the money come from?  I do not think extra money will come from the Exchequer.  I would like to know where the association's priorities lie.  If cuts are needed, do the representatives of the association have any thoughts on how they should be made?  It is their prerogative not to answer that question if they like.  I reiterate that those who do not answer such questions when they know the realities cannot really complain when Ministers make decisions they do not like.</p><p> I was interested to hear what the witnesses had to say about the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is interesting to examine the derogation figures for people involved in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The people in the mountains have had the fewest rejections.  In fact, there are more rejections in severely disadvantaged areas than in the mountains.  Proportionately, there are as many rejections, if not more, in the less favoured areas.  That seems to indicate something about all this talk about armchair farmers.  I do not know where such farmers are to be found, but they are not in the mountains.  All of these farmers had to make a case to prove they were farming their land to the capacity of that land.  It seems to me that there are two handy ways to be an armchair farmer, to be blunt.  If one has a huge single payment, one can lease out the land and the single payment, making sure to build a good return from the single payment - 80%, say - into the single payment lease, and do nothing.  When I go around the country, it seems to me that the farmers who take that approach have the good land rather than the bad land.  The other way to make a whole heap of money from a large single payment is to contract out the sowing, fertilising and harvesting of one's tillage lands.  A farmer who does that will continue to get the single payment.</p><p> I am very worried.  We are talking about active farmers.  When I examined the European definition of an "active farmer", I noted that small part-time farmers on marginal land are specifically included as being active farmers.  I get the impression from the farm organisations that they are trying to edge out such farmers in some way.  If a different definition is used, it will quite rightly exclude corporate entities like conglomerates and airports.  I agree that they should be excluded.  I do not see why they are getting State money to farm.  When I studied the 2008 single farm payments, I noted that the biggest payments were going to certain well-known corporate entities.  They were not all connected to the farming industry.  If the association has a definition of an "active farmer" other than the definition proposed by the EU, which specifically includes the people with small farms on marginal land, I would be interested to hear about it.</p><p> I would like to mention an issue that is coming more and more to the fore.  The association has shown us this proposal.  The farming organisations seem to favour the proposal from the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  They have justified payments of &euro;150,000 or &euro;200,000 to farmers under the single payment scheme.  The same people complain about Deputies getting &euro;80,000 for working seven days a week.  It seems to me that the argument being made is that those in receipt of single payments of &euro;150,000 or &euro;200,000 are losing money by farming when such payments are taken out of the calculation.  I cannot justify the payment by the State of farm incomes of &euro;200,000 from the public coffers.  If we have come to the stage that the more intensive a farmer is, the more money he or she is losing - when the single payment is taken out and put aside - I suggest that farming has become a nonsense.  That seems to be the proposition that is constantly being put to me by highly intensive farmers.  If we do not rectify that issue, the whole game is crazy.</p><p> If one could earn the &euro;200,000 that one is being given just by keeping a minimum amount of stock on the land, all one has to do is get one's minimum payment and not worry about stocking levels.  Why would one continue to invest and invest in order to lose more and more money?  If that is what is really happening, it does not make any sense.  I would love to see the farm accounts of some of these people.  If it is the case that the more intensively one farms and the more land one buys, the more money one loses, it just does not make any sense.  I know people are very generous, but I am not sure they are that generous.  I have to believe the intensive farmer is actually making money before the single payment is taken into account.  If he is not, it is a nonsense for him to get more and more intensive.  I believe in the principle of equity that is applied to other grants.  Therefore, there is a very good case to put a cap on the single payment, just as people want to put a cap on public service wages, etc.  We could allow farmers to make as much money as they want beyond the cap as long as they make it from farming.  That would reduce the number of very profitable armchair farmers who get the payments but do not really have to do an awful lot.  They get somebody else to do all the work.</p><p> If we were to impose a cap on the payments received by the 2% of farmers who get 12% of payments - we could also apply it to the guys who are stacking, but I will come back to that in a minute - we could give every farmer an extra &euro;30 on the first 20 hectares of land.  That would represent an extra &euro;600 for a farmer with 20 hectares or more.  It would help the genuine middle-ranking farmers in the country, but not the 2% of guys at the top who should be able to make their money anyway, especially as &euro;50,000 is a good start.  I know this is being vehemently opposed, but I reiterate that it would be better for 98% of farmers and worse for 2% of farmers.</p><p> It has been suggested that an increase in payments at the bottom end of it would result in farmers with acres and acres of bad land suddenly getting a fortune because they all have huge farms.  When one assesses the farm size statistics, one finds that those who receive the lowest payments per hectare are also those with the smallest farms.  As the money per hectare increases, so does the average farm size, with the exception of the people at the very top who get over &euro;500,000 a hectare.  I am not talking about those who get the biggest payment, but about those who get the biggest payment per hectare.  They actually tend to have smaller farm sizes than people in the next three categories, which indicates to me that people who get over &euro;500 a hectare are stacking.  In other words, they had land leased in the reference year but they do not have it leased any more.  They are stacking the payments.  There is no logic in the way these payments gradually increase along with average farm size until one reaches the highest level.  The obvious explanation is that they were not really making &euro;500 a hectare in entitlements from their land in 2001 or 2002 or whenever.  They were actually making it from double that amount of land and stacking the entitlements.  That explains why those with smaller farm sizes get higher grants.</p><p> We have been told that people in the west get all of the disadvantaged area payments.  I am as interested in Wexford farmers as anyone else.  We are being told we cannot touch people who get single farm payments of &euro;50,000, or set a limit that does not allow them to get &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000.  The limit for a farmer who is depending on the disadvantaged area is &euro;3,400.  That is the maximum he can get, even if he owns the mountains of Donegal and the hills of Dublin.</p> <p>The maximum area under REPS was approximately 100 acres or 40 hectares and the maximum payment was &euro;11,800.  I do not believe it will ever go near this again because the type of costings built in previously could not be justified under the greening process.  Even if a new REPS were introduced I could not see it giving anybody more than a maximum amount of &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000. </p><p> The pillar 2 budget is now negotiated in a multi-annual framework and is very vulnerable to Government cutbacks.  Figures that will surprise some people are as follows: 17% of disadvantaged area scheme payments are made in Leinster and every county in Leinster is included; 26% of payments are made in Munster and every county is included; 17% of payments are made in Ulster, which includes Cavan and Monaghan; and 36% of payments are made in Connacht.  There is not a county in Ireland from Dublin to Galway and from Donegal to Wexford which does not have farmers who receive disadvantaged area scheme payments.  A myth is perpetuated that it is a west coast payment, but half of payments are not made there no matter how one defines the west coast.  Does the west coast comprise Kerry where there is some great land, Clare, Connacht and Donegal?  Does it comprise Connacht and Donegal?  We should be honest that disadvantaged area scheme payments are made throughout the State to farmers on certain types of land and all counties, including Wexford and Kilkenny, get their fair share of payments relative to the land.  It is a very small payment anyway compared with a decent single payment.</p><p> Unfortunately I must attend another meeting.  I do not know which saint was able to be in two places at the same time but I am no saint so I cannot pull off that trick.  Why should low-income farmers who are struggling and working hard on bad land, many of them full time, be asked to tell the Commissioner they do not need the money in favour of people receiving single payments of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000, &euro;150,000, &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000?  I do not understand this.  My honest opinion is that when it is put clearly on the table, as it was in Leitrim, farmers do not understand it either.  The same will apply in Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Meath because the vast majority of farmers in these counties do not receive large single payments or high rates per hectare.  The vast majority of farmers in every county do not receive high rates per hectare or large payments.  My agenda is not a west of Ireland agenda.  It is an agenda for the struggling masses as against the very well-paid elite of Irish farming.</p></speech>

We have held a number of briefings with them and what is most important is to get the budget in place, which I hope will be done by the end of the year.  Listening to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v it sounds like we will have a hell of a battle distributing it when it comes to it.  How many farmers receive more than &euro;150,000 for &euro;250,000?  I do not have the figures with me but the average payment is much lower.  I agree with the Minister on keeping farming in Ireland and using a percentage taken off the top to increase payments to farmers on the bottom of the scale in the west of Ireland as it would mean a great deal to them.  Perhaps if it was increased a little it would suit smaller farmers better, but I support the Minister on his view and he has support throughout Europe on the issue.  We will examine the figures to see how many farmers are in the large payment bracket but I do not believe too many farmers receive payments of more than &euro;150,000 or &euro;250,000.</p><p>  It is very important to support active farmers.  We should get a definition of the "armchair farmer".  Young farmers will be looked after in the proposals and we welcome this as it is very important.  Perhaps those farmers who are not so young and have been farming and working hard on the land trying to earn an income since 2002 but have not received a single farm payment should be looked after as well as young farmers.  They should receive a single farm payment.</p><p>  We must sort out the problem in the commonages.  We spoke about this earlier and we will have a meeting on it.  If the commonages are not sorted out many farmers will be penalised for the sins of their neighbours.  It will create a hell of a battle in hill areas.  One group of farmers will want to work the commonages while another group will just put sheep on them and not care about anybody.  This will create war on the commonages and something must be done.  It must be sorted out.  Farmers cannot be penalised for another farmer taking the law into his or her own hands and over-grazing on commonages.</p><p>  An environmental scheme is very important and we should have something better than AEOS to replace REPS.  Perhaps it will not be as good as REPS, but a good scheme should be put in place to help farmers who look after the environment.  Suckler cow and sheep schemes are funded under pillar 2, as is the disadvantaged areas scheme.  We will all work to try to achieve these.</p><p>  The points made about solicitors working for families was quite right.  Introducing a bus load of solicitors does nothing for transferring farm assets.  One solicitor is quite adequate, once what needs to be done is laid down quite clearly.</p></speech>

I ask the Chairman for latitude, because normally when witnesses are present the Chairman does not allow us to debate, but as a Member of the Seanad I do not get much opportunity to debate with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I would like to respond to his comments.  Approximately 500 farmers in the country receive a single farm payment of more than &euro;100,000.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated we would create a group of armchair farmers.  Those who receive the single farm payment do so because they farm intensively, have been working and will not stop doing so.  I do not accept his point.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v feels some of the farming organisations are trying to push out part-time farmers and I do not accept this point either.</p> <p>Farming organisations are working in the best interests of all farmers, be they part-time, full-time, intensive or extensive.</p><p> I welcome the points on solicitors, land consolidation and capital gains, and we will take up those matters.  If our country is to progress Food Harvest 2020, land must be consolidated.  People should not pay capital gains tax for swapping fields and so on.</p><p> I would welcome Mr. Comer's comments on another matter, although he may not want to put them on the public record.  Two weeks ago, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made proposals on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the single farm payment.  What is the ICMSA's opinion on those proposals?</p><p> My next point is not a pre-budget one, but post-Common Agricultural Policy.  It relates to 2015 and the disappearance of quotas.  Glanbia is taking an important vote today and I wish it the best.  It will help the future of agriculture in Ireland.  Some sides are proposing caution whereas others are proposing that we should go for it and start producing milk in vast quantities.  The ICMSA has many members.  Farmers, land and stocking rates differ, but most people involved in the milk sector are committed to increasing milk production.  The danger is that we could land people in financial difficulties if the market collapsed after they made their investments.  Has the ICMSA held meetings with its members on the post-2015 situation and discussed, for example, what increased percentage of capital investment they should make in stock, buildings or land?  Should it be 10%, 20% or just 1%?  Has the ICMSA conducted a study in this regard?</p><p> I apologise for my rant, but this is the only forum where I am able to discuss matters with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>

I have covered much of this area in my introduction, in which I recognised that there would be anomalies.  However, 85% to 87% of those who were active in the historical years are still active.  Some 1,640 people are in receipt of more than &euro;50,000 per annum and only a few hundred receive more than &euro;100,000.  That number is insignificant compared with the overall package.  It looks wrong and the aesthetics are not great, but there are 110,000 farmers.</p><p>  I was asked about payments.  Across the 27 member states, the average single farm payment is &euro;4,000.  In Ireland, it is &euro;9,000.  Proportionate approximation was applied at member state level because the Germans, French, Austrians and others did not want to shift the budgets too dramatically.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's suggestion of giving people a lift of &euro;30 on the first ten or 15 hectares sounds lovely, but the reality is that most of those involved might not be full-time farmers and might have sizeable off-farm incomes.  For example, they could be garda&iacute;, teachers, solicitors, doctors, etc.  The money will go to them.</p><p>  Our organisation is trying to protect the one constant, that is, the family farm unit, a labour unit that produces enough to make a living with the incorporation of the single farm payment.  It is as simple as that.  The amount involved usually hovers between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000, depending on one's borrowings.  I hate characterising farmers, but someone who has 1,000 acres of hill and 50 sheep could theoretically be called active.  However, he or she has plenty of time to generate other income.  Such farmers are not solely dependent on farming and have developed other ways to live.  I do not want to segregate farmers, but giving &euro;30 on the first ten hectares would be disastrous.  It would create more anomalies than it would solve.</p><p>  Senior departmental officials have crunched the numbers.  We support the position taken by the Department to lessen the impact of the change in funding.  A gradual convergence is fine.  By 2020, the vista across food production in Europe will be different than it is now and there will be many plans to shift the emphasis back onto coupled payments.</p><p>  Senator Comiskey mentioned young farmers.  We support his comments.  The issue of commonages must be sorted.  The notion of collective responsibility is lunacy.  I do not know how anyone could have come up with it outside of a communist society.  If four farmers who have sheep on a hill are dependent on one another, it is a recipe for disaster and must be rectified.  A commonsensical approach must be taken.</p><p>  The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, was also mentioned.  A whole-farm approach is the best in that regard.  Under the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, each item of expenditure is receipted and only parts of a farm are involved.  To be successful, a scheme must take a whole-farm basis.</p><p>  The suckler cow scheme has been prioritised and is funded from the Exchequer, but we are not in favour of coupling payments in the next CAP budget.  There is no justification for recoupling those moneys.  With one hand a linear cut of 5%, 10% or so on would be applied to everyone and, with the other, it would be given back again, only with terms and condition attached, including the requirement to keep the cow.  Beef prices are high because of the law of supply and demand.  Numbers have decreased and prices have increased.  If payments are coupled, farmers will need to keep their animals, which will lead to a decrease in prices.  Recoupling in respect of a small percentage now would be detrimental for farmers.  The situation might be different if everything was recoupled, but our organisation is against recoupling just 5% or 10%.</p><p>  Senator Comiskey referred to land conveyancing.  We have serious issues in this regard, but they are not specific to farmers.  Every citizen is affected, as all property transfers are involved.  The only element that is excluded is the physical transaction of cash.  One will even be required to have two solicitors to conduct the transfer of a share in a council house.  Heretofore, it was always advisable to have a second solicitor, but that is different from being required to set up a new account with a second solicitor and duplicating the searches.  What sticks in my craw is the fact that the Law Society implemented this statutory instrument and its members are getting the business.  I want to make the Houses aware that this expensive and impractical approach will not solve the problem.</p><p>  I believe I have covered everything, but members might remind me if I have left anything out.  Post-2015 was mentioned.</p> <p>We have lots of ideas on that, which Mr. McCormack will outline.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012111300009#J00200"><p>Senator O'Neill is correct that today is an important day for Glanbia supplier shareholders because of the awaited clarification around the intended processes and facilities post-2015 from a processor perspective.  It is anticipated there will be a significant increase in 2015, probably never to be matched, of in the region of 15% or 20%.  I know having attended branch AGMs last year and this year that the train of thought in this regard differs.  The climatic conditions that prevailed during 2012 have brought a sense of realism to farmers.  We are encouraging individual farmers to get to grips in terms of expansion costs because, contrary to what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said earlier, a farmer on wet soil who meets difficult times as regards price volatility and a challenging climatic year and who has increased stocking density and milk output could find himself or herself doing more and creating a bigger hole.  We are advising our members of the need to consider costs and capabilities because in 2011 the cost of production varied between 14 and 25 cents a litre, depending on efficiencies and soil types of the individual farmer.  It is paramount that they know where they stand before they step forward because they need to be in a position of profitability in order to expand at a sustainable rate.</p></speech>

Prices in 2009, at the time the test in terms of trying to prove milk could be produced at a certain level was applied, were really depressed.  Thankfully, market prices have increased since then.  While it was hoped the result would set an example and that the land used was good, I do not believe the test, in terms of what was hoped would be achieved in relation to the cost of production, was realistic.  I note Mr. McCormack's statement that the organisation is urging caution on the part of its members post-2015.  However, that scenario must be set against what Mr. Comer had to say in regard to the suckler cow welfare scheme, the cost of which is currently met by the Exchequer.  </p><p>  As I stated earlier, I believe part of Pillar 2 should be a couple of payments to support the suckler cow payments.  I am not suggesting that every situation will be black and white post-2012 because it is not possible to milk cows on all lands because of some of them are not suitable or large enough to support milk production.  My concern is that land close to that of an intensive or active dairy farmer, which becomes available for lease, sale or rent for 11 months will be designated as suitable only for milk production, resulting in tillage, suckler cow, beef, sheep or pig farmers not being able to rent that land.  I have previously stated in public and to the Minister that I believe that some of the money obtained during the next CAP negotiations should be used to support other parts of agriculture besides dairy farming.  It should be used to support the suckler cow or sheep scheme and so on.  I am not suggesting that the dairy sector should not get support.  Currently, our herds are 50% dairy and 50% beef.  During the past six to eight years we have built up, through quality assurance, traceability and so on a reputation worldwide in relation to our beef.   We are second to none in terms of quality of production and traceability in respect of products exported from Ireland.  I would hate if post-2015 the 50:50 ratio would be changed to 60:40, 65:35 or 70:30, which would make it unviable for even meat factories to continue here.  I know that, unless everything is set before inception, beef will be produced from the dairy herd.  However, that will not do anything for us in terms of sale to the market.  Previously, beef from our dairy herds was exported to Third World countries such as Lybia, Egypt and Russia.  The consumers with the most money are those in Europe, including France, Italy, Spain and Germany.  They want quality.  Since the introduction over three years ago of traceability and so on there has been a significant increase in the price of product, which may be down to scarcity.  We do not want countries such as Argentina or Brazil, which do not provide assurance in terms of quality, meeting beef needs in Europe.  We must be in a position to support the needs of Europe.   </p><p>  It was stated earlier that support for the suckler cow scheme should be discontinued.  I believe it must be supported through Pillar 2 post the next CAP negotiations.</p></speech>

We are under pressure in terms of the budget and from other schemes, including the young farmer scheme, the international reserve, etc., all of which are good initiatives in their own right.  The money for all these schemes must come from somewhere.  We are concerned that the current Commission proposals on coupling could result in a 5% reduction in payment to dairy, tillage, sheep or suckler farmers.</p><p>  Our objective is not to look after the people who receive payments above &euro;100,000.

We have members in the 26 counties.  We have looked at the various options available under the single farm payment scheme.  On balance, while it is not perfect, we believe the Minister's proposal on convergence is the best way to go to try to protect these payments.  The single farm payment is hugely important to our members.  Without the single farm payment in 2009 our members would have faced a catastrophic situation.  Our key objective is the protection of single farm payments.  If the payment is reduced in the budget, we will be under pressure.  A change to the level of distribution will also cause us problems.  Our objective is to protect the people who are actively farming the land.</p><p>  The issue of armchair farmers was mentioned.  We have come across situations both last year and this year of landowners who, having rented land to farmers for up to 20 years, are now taking that land back in order for them to draw down entitlements themselves.  We believe this is widespread.</p></speech>

Many schemes were mentioned during this debate.  In Mr. Comer's view, what, in terms of the forthcoming budget, are the priority issues?  In the event of, say, the suckler scheme being given priority, from where could savings be achieved in order to supplement it?</p></speech>

We believe that the cuts to the agriculture sector have been disproportionate, in particular in 2011 when the cuts were 14% versus 5% to 6%.  I believe the ICBF that the suckler cow scheme is important to them in terms of data collection.  One wonders if people would supply the required data to the ICBF if they had no incentive, in terms of the suckler cow scheme, to do so.  In terms of prioritising cuts, there is no cost to many of the proposals made in our pre-budget submission.</p> <p>These are elements that would not have a huge cost.  There should be a concentrated effort by the Department of Finance to facilitate mechanisms by which land consolidation can take place in this country.  Apart from volatility, one of the single biggest constraints is fragmentation of the Irish land structure.  Anything facilitating an orderly consolidation of the land base is a priority.  The rural environmental protection scheme, REPS 4, has taken a 19% cut and there was a cut of &euro;19 million last year.  No other cuts could be justified in that respect.</p><p> The importance of the disadvantaged areas scheme is critical, as it is the least complicated way of getting money to farmers who farm on areas of natural constraint.  It does not have the complications of other schemes and a cut in it would have detrimental effects.  I am not sure I have the political skills to answer the question without committing myself to anything but I have done my best.</p></speech>

Teagasc has indicated there will be a 30% cut in income this year and we think that might be a conservative figure.  Given the terrible weather farmers have experienced since before May, increased costs in the system will be evident until next May.  The first six months of next year will be very expensive for farmers because of increased costs in the system.  We are seeing on a daily basis in the office evidence of increased pressure on farmers, as people are contacting us about financial issues.  We strongly feel that these schemes must be maintained in 2013 as farmers are feeling major financial pressures.</p></speech>

Are the witnesses opposed, in principle, to any cap in the amount of payment that any individual can get?  If they are, that is fine, but if they are not, perhaps they could indicate a suitable cap?  There have been suggestions from Commissioner Cioloş and the European Parliament, which basically stipulates that there can be a payment of between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per hectare.  That is a dramatic cap.  The Minister also has a proposal.  An interesting mind game concerns where we are likely to end up and how likely it is that the Minister's proposal will get through the European Parliament.  I am not sure it will.</p><p>  An issue could arise if we do not get the answer we want but rather an indication that no payment will be less than &euro;200 per hectare.  There are not many hill farmers with 1,000 acres but they would make a huge gain because there would be no cap.  By having a cap, one would avoid an unintended consequence arising because the advocacy groups do not control the negotiations; there are 27 countries involved in the process.  I notice there is much concentration among member governments but the European Parliament is in the game.  It is interesting to note what its rapporteur put forward, which is, if I may term it, Cioloş mark 2, plus or minus 20%.  When all these people get together and start compromising, things happen that may not be expected.  I am interested to hear the views on such a cap.</p><p>  People often raise the question of whether farmers work full time.  We know the vast majority of farmers do not work full time, although dairy farmers are the exceptions.  They are not necessarily the people with the biggest single payment, as it is not the way the payment is made.  For example, people in the beef industry did relatively well in single payments; if they were well organised they would get the first and second tranches, as well as the slaughter premium in reference years.  The idea that the highly paid farmers - either taken on a per hectare basis or in total - are dairy farmers is a nonsense.  I do not know how many dairy farmers are in the country, although the witnesses probably know this.</p></speech>

It is interesting that 90% of these get a payment of less than &euro;25,000, and there must be many dairy farmers in the group.  Considering the amount paid per hectare, the majority seem to be under the famous &euro;274.  If we cap the really big operators, who do not need the single payment if they are making any money from farming, we would hit what is termed the "armchair farmers".  Capping the amount per hectare means that every farmer - including every dairy farmer except any near the 2,000 top payees - would gain.  If we assumed there are 400 or 500 dairy farmers in the top group, the other 17,500 dairy farmers would gain &euro;600 if they had 20 hectares, which most dairy farmers would have at least.  It may happen, by chance, that money may end up with a farmer on poor land, such as that in Senator Comiskey's area.  That would not come from the middle ranked farmer or the very prosperous farmer, instead it would come from the farmers who either stack entitlements or have a very large payment.</p><p>  It is interesting to consider farm size.  The more one digs into figures, the more we can see that some people are earning disproportionate amounts.  It is amazing that everybody accepted the capping principle with REPS and the disadvantaged area scheme.  If capping is good for one scheme, it should be good for the other.  If it is not, capping should not operate anywhere.  It is fair to say that the people who oppose capping the single payment would be the first to complain if there was no cap on the other two payments.  An entire farm must be farmed in an environmentally friendly way if the farmer is part of that scheme.</p><p>  Those with the smallest payments have the smallest farms.  On average, it is not true to say that those with poor land have much poor land; those with poor land have small payments and those with small payments have the smallest farms, with an average of 32.7 hectares.  If there are some enormous operators in this group, there must be many farmers under the average.  At payments between &euro;150 to &euro;250 per hectare, the average size farm is slightly bigger at 33 hectares.  At payments between &euro;250 and &euro;500 per hectare, the average farm size is 39 hectares.  For the farmer receiving between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 per hectare, the average size is 44.9 hectares.  That gives the lie to the idea of the few farmers who own all the mountain.  Senator Comiskey could bear out that idea.  With most mountains, there could be 50 or 200 farmers who have to walk on 1,000 acres to get to their sheep.</p><p>  At the point where payments are greater than &euro;1,000 per hectare, there is a collapse in average farm size to 34 hectares.  Anybody in this case with &euro;1,000 or more per hectare would have stacked payments.  That is the only rational explanation, and these are the real armchair farmers.  They are getting money for half the farming.  I am interested to know if the witnesses are in favour of a cap on payments.  Are they in favour of a cap on the disadvantaged area scheme?  Are they in favour of cap on acreage and total payment for REPS?</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is talking about armchair farmers but I think anyone with a payment under &euro;100,000, even if it is &euro;99,000, has worked hard to build up the payment.

While Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was absent from the room, Mr. Comer mentioned that between 85% and 90% in receipt of larger payments are active farmers.  Some 245 farmers have payments over &euro;100,000.  The flawed argument should not be made that we have produced all these armchair farmers.  We have nearly 90,000 active farmers in the country who receive below the average of &euro;9,000.  At least 50,000 farmers in this country have a payment under &euro;30,000.  Only 245 farmers receive a payment over &euro;100,000 and one or two receive enormous payments, which is not right.  They are corporate bodies.  I do not accept the argument that we will produce a legacy of armchair farmers.  The majority of farmers are active and want to stay active.  The single farm payments they have built up through a legacy of being active and intensive must be protected by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It cannot suddenly be dissolved.  How will we achieve Harvest 2020 targets if we dissolve single farm payments?</p></speech>

The only farmers I know forced to chase 1,000 acres for 50 sheep have been forcefully destocked by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They are not allowed to have 200 or 400 sheep and there is as much chasing in 50 ewes across the mountain in a commonage of 1,000 acres as there is in 400 ewes.  One must still gather them up and separate them from the neighbours' sheep.  The idea is that many hill farmers willingly and knowingly have low numbers of stock.</p><p>  The Minister should watch for the following point in his payment regime.  Europe is very ecologically minded at the moment and, because the sheep have been taken from farmers forcibly, many young farmers will not chase through the mountains for the sheep.  There will be an ecological disaster of land abandonment.  When that happens, Europe will fine Ireland severely in agriculture payments and ecological fines for not maintaining the mountains in good farming order.  In that circumstance, the lowland farmer could be paying the penalty for not making it viable for the hill farmer to get out on the hill and maintain the sheep.  If members think land abandonment is not a reality, they should go to Scotland.  It is a significant problem there because they are not allowed to keep the number of stock they believe make it viable to go up the hill.  The idea does not stand up.</p><p>  I never said the biggest farmers were the armchair farmers, I said the evidence appears to be that where the leasing of a farm with a big single payments is happening, it is not in the hill areas.  Mr. John Enright accepted the analysis.  The analysis after the derogation in the hill areas this year bears out my point.  It is happening in the lowlands.  There are a certain number of armchair farmers in the country and nothing will stop them.  It is not something connected to low payments; it is connected more to the intensive leasing that takes place in the land and letting of land in the 11 months system on more fertile parts of the country.  That is where the armchair farming exists but I do not know how to stop it.  We could examine the rules.  The idea that increasing the single farm payment to farmers on bad land would make them all armchair farmers is nonsense.</p><p>  To go back to the statistics, there are more than 2,000 farmers in receipt of more than &euro;50,000.  This represents approximately 2% of all farmers and they receive a payment that amounts to 12% of payments even though they have the best farms.  Like other schemes, I suggest these farmers are doing very well and we are talking about a seven year slide-off.  At the beginning of the debate, as agriculture spokesperson, I said this must be done on a slide-off basis because it cannot be handled like the farmers with REPS, where they were told overnight the payment would go.  I did not agree with what happened with REPS.  There should be a cap, which will help the other 90% of farmers.  I am amazed at the fight being put up for the 2% at the expense of the 90%.  Good on Senator O'Neill, he can explain it to the farmers and I will explain my side to farmers.  In all the counties in Ireland, the highest average single payment is in Kilkenny, at &euro;16,000.  If there is a standard deviation around the mean even in Kilkenny there must be few, if any, farmers receiving over &euro;50,000, it will show that some 90% of farmers will be under the ceiling to which I referred.</p></speech>

Adding the two, one comes up to 1,890 out of registered herd numbers of 120.  It is a very small proportion.  I readily acknowledge to the committee there are anomalies but I assure members that any other scheme would also have anomalies.  Beef farmers, who were lucky enough to get the first, the second premium and the slaughter premium, are an example.  There are anomalies with beef finishers because those involved in heifers got nothing at all as it applied only to male animals.  There are major anomalies.</p><p>  The direct question to our organisation was whether we are opposed, in principle, to a cap.  We are not opposed in principle and it could be very useful.  A cap is provided for in the proposals of Commissioner Cioloş from October 2012.  It begins at &euro;150,000 and is graduated to a maximum of &euro;300,000.</p> <p>One might drill it down to a meaningful cap.</p><p> On the question as to whether member states will be able to use discretion to place a cap on some of the payments under the Common Agricultural Policy, it would be folly for a farm organisation to start to pick figures on where it would like to see a cap but not be in position to implement it.  We have a duty to represent all our members as best we can and not to have one set of farmers going against the other.  We are not opposed to the principle of placing a cap, we would welcome it.  I do not believe that discretion will be given to member states to place a cap on the Common Agricultural Policy.</p><p> We did discuss Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's proposal to give everybody a &euro;30 per hectare uplift.  In my view and that of ICMSA that will create more anomalies than it will solve.  We all know that a farmer who has a low stocking density and a large farm has the scope to have off-farm income and to have a job.  Perhaps if he has a partner, that person has scope for a job.  So the payment will end up going to doctors, solicitors, lawyers, teachers and everyone who has a few hectares of land.  They work off-farm and have a good income.  They will get this uplift from the money being taken from the full-time farmer, who is required to work full-time by virtue of being the labour unit on the farm.  He has no scope for off-farm income.  Farmers, as a collective group have &euro;6 billion in borrowings.  The percentage of those farmers who are active and involved in the real productive sector are those who have borrowed that money.  If one distorts the one constant they have, a single farm payment of between &euro;15,000 to &euro;30,000, it will neither do the farmers who have invested in productive farming nor the national economy a service.</p></speech>

That &euro;600 to which I referred would come from the elite farmers.  All of the farmers who have the high borrowing, except the 2% elite, would get extra money.  It would pay a fair amount of interest in a year.  If one puts a cap on the payment to the top 2% and redistribute that money in some ways to the struggling 98% of farmers who would benefit from this help.  None of the money would be coming from the farmers to which Mr. Comer refers, the single labour unit farmers.</p></speech>

I asked the Department how far &euro;50,000 would go on a payment of &euro;500 per hectare.  It would give a &euro;50 million saving and gives &euro;40 million saving in the other aspect.  I have asked further questions to elicit more information but basically if one wanted one could opt for a Cioloş mark 11 or a Minister's mark 11.  I do not believe the Minister's proposal is correct because it does not do enough to level it up towards those in the middle, the farmers the ICMSA should be concerned about, the ordinary dairy producer with between 40 to 100 cows, who are the backbone of the ICMSA and not the farmers with 800 to 900 cows.  I believe in retaining the structure of Irish farming, as farming based on the family farm and not major corporate farms.  I would be very open to the valuable ideas put forward by the ICMSA.  If the IFA gets its way, it wants a coupled payment and a payment for young farmers and so on.</p><p>  I am open to the idea that all of these payments are funded by the Common Agricultural Policy.  Mr. Comer states that one cannot cap payments, but one can average out payments.  For example, the proposal put forward by the European Parliament rapporteur was basically a cap and a floor.  I believe there is a total underestimation of the role of the European Parliament.  Mr. Comer spoke of a minimum payment of &euro;200 and a maximum of &euro;300.  If one takes &euro;250 as being the real average rather than &euro;274, then he is effectively putting a cap on it.  There is a good case to be made as to how one will fund the add-ons.  I would be very interested in Mr. Comer's ideas on that.</p></speech>

They lost the land they consolidated but a year or two years later they got other land.  While their payment per hectare might seem high, they have land without entitlements as well, which would make it lower.  It  must be taken into account that farmers could have genuinely lost land under the present system and it may take a couple of year to get it back.  That needs to be taken into account, in that they have so-called clear land with no entitlements on it, due to no fault of their own, only that the lease date was up.</p></speech>

We appreciate their attendance here today.</p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>I</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I now invite Mr. Trethowan to commence his presentation, followed by Mr. Farrell.  Members will then put their questions.</p></speech>

We believe we have ensured that SMEs in Ireland have access to credit from the pillar banks, which was our mandate from the Minister when the office was established.  I have sent a background briefing to the committee on the work of the office.</p><p>  Over the past two and a half years, we have assisted approximately 200 businesses with credit appeals, and we have been able to help approximately 55% of those businesses to get access to credit.  For the remainder, for which we agreed with the banks' decisions not to lend, we have tried to suggest alternatives to bank lending, such as the First Step Microenterprise Network, which has now become the microenterprise loan fund.  In other cases we have suggested asset sales to help improve the balance sheets of the businesses.  We have always tried our best to assist.  The office has made observations on both the supply and the demand side.  We have pointed out where banks can do better and where small businesses can do better.  We have also tried to comment on the condition in which some small businesses have found themselves after such a long period of poor domestic demand.</p><p>  In addition, I was given the task of monitoring the banks' loan sanctioning targets - &euro;3.5 billion per year for each of the two banks.  Each month the banks report their figures to me, and once they have been collated they are forwarded to the Department of Finance.  We meet the banks formally on a quarterly basis to discuss progress on the targets and try to improve the quality of reporting.</p><p>  That was a brief overview.  I will be more than happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I will talk briefly about the SME sector to provide some context.  Some 99.8% of businesses in Ireland are small and medium-sized enterprises.  Therefore, the sector is a cornerstone of the economy.  It is worth noting that more than half of SMEs - which employ 900,000 people - were established in the past ten years and are very new in terms of operating experience.  Employment is concentrated in the domestically focused sector, which we are aware has taken serious hit.  Some of the areas hit are distribution and retail, accommodation, food, tourism and construction, which is on the floor.  This is quite different from the typical SME profile across the European Union.</p><p>  The next slide deals with SME use of bank credit.  It is useful to highlight the difference between ourselves and our European peers.  Looking at how SMEs use bank credit in the form of term finance, we can see that Irish SMEs are about mid-table compared with other European countries.  When it comes to the use of overdraft facilities, however, we are top of the table.  It can be seen that there is a big reliance on overdraft facilities among Irish SMEs.  Six out of ten businesses say they have used overdraft facilities in the past six months, far more than in any other country.  Generally, Irish SMEs' use of bank credit is significantly higher than in other countries.</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan was fair in mentioning the issues that face banks in terms of improving their performance, and those that face SMEs.  The main challenge for SMEs is weak demand in the domestic sector.  People starting a business in 2007 would probably have based their business model on 25% growth in the economy between then and 2012.  Instead, the economy has shrunk by 25%.  That is a cataclysmic drop in domestic demand, which is bound to have a severe impact on SMEs that are primarily focused on activity in the domestic economy.  Few of them are exposed to export or external demand.</p><p>  Another problem is that many SMEs are under-capitalised and, as their primary problem is capital, they have had to drain either owner capital or other sources.  Banks are not primary suppliers of capital.  A further problem is that microenterprises face particular challenges.  Help is on the way in that respect and we will talk later about the establishment of the micro-finance fund.  These companies tend to be younger and smaller in profile and they find it harder to make a pitch in terms of meeting the requirements when presenting business plans to access credit.</p><p>  The big challenge for banks, on which they continue to work, is to ensure they have productive engagement with customers.  This means that customers with sustainable businesses need to approach the banks.  It is a myth that banks are not lending and it is a myth that if a business approaches a bank and is turned down, that is a blot on its copybook.  It is not, as will be verified by Mr. Trethowan.  Another challenge for the banks is to increase our understanding of growth sectors.  Many new sectors are emerging in the Irish economy in the software, life sciences and green technology areas and significant work is being done by banks to improve their skills and understanding in those sectors so they can lend to these businesses.</p><p>  A problem I referred to at the outset is that of rebalancing the debt-equity ratio and finding ways to get more capital into banks.  John Moran, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, spoke about this recently at a conference, referring to the need to find models to bring more equity into SMEs.</p> <p>If we look at the nature of credit demand we see that the principal requirement for credit for small and medium-sized enterprises is for renewal or renegotiation of existing credit facilities and not for new credit facilities.  That is very understandable.  In fact, it would be illogical if it were otherwise, given the level of reduction in demand in the domestic economy, which is effectively the driver of activity in these businesses.</p><p> There has been considerable debate about what constitutes new lending and whether renewal of existing facilities matters at all or is value-adding.  I contend, as does the Credit Review Office, that the renewal of credit facilities is very important for existing businesses.  I have two case studies to illustrate that point.  These are drawn from real-life experiences but suitably anonymised.  Take a company that has an existing loan of &euro;2 million, upon which repayment is due at the end of the month.  It cannot make that repayment in time.  The company is effectively in breach of its covenant and the bank can either call in that loan or refinance it with new contractual obligations.  If the bank calls in the loan because of inability to pay, it will lead to the business folding with the loss, in this case, of 30 jobs.  The bank decides to refinance the loan for a longer period of time and puts a new contract in place, which means the business can continue to trade and the 30 jobs are secured.  That is not simply a paper transaction by a bank.  That is a conscious decision by a bank to stand back, examine a business which is unable to fulfil its original contractual obligations and make a commitment to refinance that business.  That is critical because if such decisions were not being made, the unemployment problem in this country would be much worse than it is at present.</p><p> The second case study involves a company which has an overdraft of &euro;100,000 and a loan of &euro;1 million.  The company cannot make the loan repayments and the overdraft is at its absolute limit.  Again, the bank is faced with the choice of calling in the credit facilities or restructuring the loan as interest-only.  In this particular case the bank sat down with the customer, restructured the loan facility on a new, two-year, interest-only basis and, as a result, the monthly repayment is substantially reduced.  That is freeing up cashflow in the business and, in turn, reducing the pressure on the overdraft facility, allowing that issue to be addressed over time, given that the business is sustainable in the longer term.  The business and economic impact of the renewal, restructuring and renegotiation of credit facilities is every bit as concrete and valuable as new credit facilities.  It is as important for an existing business that needs it as new investment is to a new company starting up.</p><p> On the issue of SME use of bank credit, members will know the figures, which were covered by Mr. Trethowan.  I will not go into detail on them again but we have data on the amount of money that has been extended to SMEs in the past year, the amount that is outstanding and the amount available through overdraft facilities, which is in excess of &euro;2.5 billion.</p><p> It is important to examine the use of bank credit.  Mr. Trethowan spoke about the number of cases examined by the Credit Review Office this year, and it must be acknowledged that the office fulfils an essential role.  In the first nine months of 2012, however, banks approved more than 80,000 applications for credit for SMEs.  That works out at 2,000 credit applications from SMEs being approved by the banks each week.  That is a substantial amount of activity by any measure.  Less than 50% of the approved overdraft limits that are in place are actually drawn down.  In other words, there is a further &euro;2.5 billion in overdraft facilities that have been approved but are not used by customers.</p><p> Mr. Trethowan also spoke about challenges for businesses, and one of the biggest of these is good planning and financial management.  Approximately 53% of SMEs were established in the past decade, so they are young, inexperienced businesses.  Some of them have not gathered the kind of experience they need in these current times in terms of meeting the requirement to put together a proper business plan in the format required by banks.  We are working with businesses and accountants to try to close that gap.</p><p> Those who put money into a business, be they investors, banks or Government agencies, need to know how the money will be used, the potential of the business to succeed and the prospects of them getting a return for their investment.  That requires a very robust business plan and, in some cases, one of the difficulties in sanctioning loans is that the business plan falls short.  In some of the cases reviewed by the Credit Review Office, the subsequent approval is based on additional information supplied by the business.  The most recent Department of Finance Mazars survey showed that many small businesses need to do more to show their business is a good proposition either for an investor or for financial support.  Management experience is also very important and is a key indicator of whether a business will be able to pay back its debts.</p><p> As I have said, each SME is different.  Indeed, the Central Bank recently highlighted the importance of treating each SME on its own merits and examining them on an individual basis.  Measures such as liquidity and current ratios, the level of trade debtors and profitability are quantitative factors, but qualitative factors are also very important, such as how much experience the management has at running the business.  The default rate falls as a firm's size increases, measured by turnover, and rises as loan size increases, which is a measure of risk.  Particular attention must be paid to the financial health of small firms or microenterprises and borrowers who have large exposures.  There is a very high level of distress across the lending already in place for SMEs, and that must be a factor in making decisions about advancing further credit to individual businesses.</p><p> The Irish Banking Federation employs 16 people.  We have a limited, but important role to play and we try to be solution orientated.  We work very closely with those in the Credit Review Office and others in the stakeholder landscape.  We have done a number of specific things, on our own initiative, to address some of the issues raised by Mr. Trethowan in successive reports and which we have identified ourselves in discussions with other stakeholders and our member banks.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Felix O'Regan, to elaborate because he was centrally involved.</p></speech>

We have tried to ascertain whether there are information or resource gaps, identified by ourselves, the Credit Review Office or other stakeholders, which can be addressed.  In that regard we worked with Chambers Ireland and developed a new website, <i><i>www.smallbusinessfinance.ie</i></i>, which has already had 26,000 page reviews.  It is increasingly seen as a one-stop shop for information for all small developing businesses, not just about getting finance but also about all the other supports that are available.  It has been fully endorsed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Finance.  Most recently, the new Microfinance Ireland initiative has adopted and promoted it throughout the network of county enterprise boards.  Small businesses are being directed to our website for further information.</p><p>  We have worked with accountants to develop a business plan guide.  One issue we encountered and which was flagged by the Credit Review Office and others was that businesses had difficulties with the variations in documentary requirements of different banks.  When they went to one bank seeking credit, they were asked for certain things to be included in their business plan, while another lender would tweak this.  We worked with all of the banks and with accountants to come up with a blueprint for a standard business plan for SMEs applying for credit to any lending institution.  We have developed that guidance which is now being used throughout the country by accountants, in conjunction with small business clients.</p><p>  We also worked with the Credit Review Office to develop a standard credit application form.  Again, in the past there were slight differences between one institution and another.  This was very much an initiative of the Credit Review Office but we sought to fine tune that and to drive it out, not just to the pillar banks but also to other lenders in the market.</p> <p> We are also working with the Government and I have referred to several of the initiatives.  We support Microfinance Ireland as an initiative and there is also funding from the banking sector to complement the Exchequer funding.  The first loan applications from Microfinance Ireland have been received.  I sit on the board.  Following the two board meetings that have been held, we have much confidence about the degree to which we believe businesses in localities working through the county enterprise boards can be helped from a start-up or developing phase.  The Social Finance Foundation was the precursor to Microfinance Ireland.  A total of &euro;25 million in equity capital was made available from the banking sector in 2007.  Slide 13 shows what the Social Finance Foundation has been doing during the past four or five years.  Community enterprise projects, small enterprises and local projects have been supported.  One can see within that initiative how approximately one quarter of the funding has gone to microenterprises.  In truth much of that will probably be taken over by Microfinance Ireland in future.  However, a total of &euro;10 million has gone into the microfinance sector as a result of bank low-cost funding.  These are the initiatives.  I would be pleased to take any questions later on.</p></speech>

We are approving more than 2,000 applications for credit each week.  The member banks and ourselves are working with customers to give them the best chance of accessing finance.  Where we see deficiencies and where issues are pointed out to us, we work with all best intent to try to close out those issues or to improve the situation.  It is not all about new lending.  Renewing or renegotiating credit and working capital finance are what many businesses need.  Banks are working to meet that need.  Getting finance to businesses depends on addressing a range of issues.  It is not only about bank debt.  Access to capital and equity, the experience of the business owners and their ability to manage the business in question are also relevant.</p><p>  It is critical to have a positive environment for credit availability because that will help to drive demand and support growth and job creation.  If we continue to maintain that banks are not open for business or not extending credit, it will become a self-fulfilling prophesy.  It will become the reality.  Our job and that of the Credit Review Office is to ensure we get the message out loud and clear to business operators that if they have a sustainable business and they approach their bank, they will get access to credit.  If business operators are aggrieved about a decision, they have the backstop of the Credit Review Office which will independently assess an application and determine whether the decision should be upheld or refused.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012111300005#D00300"><p>I thank both organisations for coming in today and for their ongoing help in our day-to-day existence.  Having said that, the presentations are altogether at variance with what we are dealing with.  In page 2 of his presentation outlining his observations of the banking market, Mr. Trethowan stated that the centralisation of credit decision making taking place, coupled with the reduction of many rural branches and the continuing churning of front-end staff, has led to many SMEs feeling isolated and remote from the banks.  That is a rather diplomatic way of putting it.  I have questions for both organisations and I will turn over and back.</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan also stated in the two previous reports that he has encouraged banks to do more to support enterprise-type lending.  His view is that a low-risk appetite and overly tight lending policies have gone too far to ensure that new lending and future loans do not cause a repeat of the recent past.  He also stated that excessive prudence may risk banks not fully supporting an economic upturn when SMEs require access to more working capital to invest.  Will Mr. Trethowan expand on that, please?  Will Mr. Farrell respond to those two comments from the Credit Review Office?</p><p>  The survey referred to the level of credit for SMEs as 37%.  However, the Central Bank published Irish SME credit supply and demand: a comparison across surveys and countries.  This was a presentation of research by Sarah Holton and Fergal McCann.  It stated that Ireland has the second highest rate of discouraged borrowers in the eurozone.  These are defined as firms that do not apply for a loan despite requiring credit.  We all know that.  We know people are not submitting applications and that they are advised by the relationship manager in their bank not to bother because it will not happen.  What measurement does the Credit Review Office have of that?  Is there any system in the Credit Review Office to review what the Central Bank says about discouraged borrowers?  Will Mr. Farrell and Mr. O'Regan comment on that finding?  Where in the system are we tracking these customers and their need for credit?  It appears they are not coming into the system.</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan remarked that some sanctioned term loans take some time to be drawn down.  Will he outline some more of his knowledge in this regard?  Part of the reason they take some time to be drawn down is the fact that more hurdles than in the Grand National are put in front of businesses before they can complete a loan or complete a revision of a loan.  I know of cases lasting seven, eight or nine months from the time a loan was initiated and they are still on desks.  We hear of this every day from the business organisations and businesses.  Is there any sense among the deputations of introducing some time limit such that if information is not supplied then the loan is deemed dead, everyone moves on and it is not treated as an outgoing application?</p><p>  Mr. Farrell referred to Ireland's credit trends in the context of the eurozone.  Will he provide the United Kingdom figures as well?  Many organisations like to provide a comparison of Ireland in the eurozone.  We share a currency with those countries but not much else.  Our way of doing business bears greater similarity to Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom rather that the rest of the eurozone.  Is there any chance of the Irish Banking Federation providing those figures as well?</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan's first point related to the alienation of businesses from the banking system.  I refer to Bank of Ireland's so-called bank of the future policy.  "Bank of the future" is Bank of Ireland's phrase.  Initially, the idea is to target small businesses, including retail and hospitality businesses, with a turnover of &euro;20,000 or more.  The bank is assigning days that these enterprises are allowed to lodge.  On other days they are not welcome to lodge money, including coins and cash.  They bring cash or coins to the bank via four suggested security organisations, those we see around the town, a service for which the businesses must pay.  On other days they are informed that they cannot lodge money.  They incur the cost of bringing money to the bank.  For example, if a business operator normally lodges on a Monday and he is instructed to lodge on Tuesdays, he misses the day that money normally hits the bank account and the day when he has the ability to deal with the takings from the weekend straight away.  If there was one example of Mr. Trethowan's initial comment about the alienation from the banking system, that is it.  These banks are closing branches and cutting the number of desks available for cash and coin transactions.  One cannot lodge coins through a machine.</p><p>  All the business organisations have been before the committee.  Chambers Ireland will be before the committee presently.  Its view is of a system completely disconnected from the reality of businesses.  The Irish Banking Federation can produce all the figures it wishes but it is rather like a college lecturer.  The theory is great and I have no doubt it is happening.  Mr. Farrell referred to 80,000 credit applications, but what was the total number that applied?  What was the overall amount?  There are people here from every part of the country.  There is no sense of reaching out to local branches, in particular on the part of the two pillar banks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Trethowan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012111300005#D00400"><p>There are many points to cover but I will do my best to cover them.  The Credit Review Office deals solely with credit, not banking services, but I can comment on access to credit through the bank networks.  One of my key concerns is that we are down to three active banks which are making loans to SMEs in the market.</p> <p>Some of those are now contracting their physical presence also.  </p><p> The traditional model of relationship banking has gone, which is much regretted by the business sector.  I chaired a focus group at an SME event for Europe in Croke Park two weeks ago, after which I wrote to Mr. Pat Farrell and the three bank CEOs to give them feedback.  That is where I picked up the direct sense of remoteness from the banks.</p><p> Senator Feargal Quinn speaks as a bank customer.  It would be great if some of the bank directors and executives began to listen to what their customers are saying.  They do feel remote.  I got the sense that neither the banker nor the customer is enjoying the experience of interfacing about credit decisions.  I have written to the three banks and to Mr. Farrell to let them have that feedback.</p><p> I agree with what Mr. Farrell says about risk appetite.  A reasonably well-run and well-capitalised business that puts a good case to the bank will have a loan sanctioned.  In the reports we get from the banks, the monthly sanction levels are very high on the formal applications they deal with.  However - and this is where the Credit Review Office comes into play - on a risk continuum from no risk at 0% to total loss at 100%, customers in the first 60% are being serviced by their banks.  They may have a clunky interface and a long process but they are getting their money.  The Credit Review Office has been active in the area between 60% and 85% risk, where the loans are more challenging and do not fall within current bank lending policies.  Even where we can show that cash is being generated to repay debts, if they do not tick the boxes on current solvency, gearing - which is the stake of the borrower - and security, the loans are being declined.  It is in such cases, in 55% of the loans we see, that we are managing to recommend that the banks make the loans.  We are not asking banks to lend money that will not be repaid.  Enough of that has happened already.  There is, however, an over-rigorous application of lending policy in some cases.    </p><p> Following the forum held in Croke Park two weeks ago, we are getting more and more reports of systemic serial requests for information when a loan is being made, which stretches out the period of the loan.  The code of practice for SME lending and section 2(10) of the Act that set up the review office suggest a time limit of 15 working days for making credit available.  These serial requests are stopping and starting the clock the whole time.  In one of the meetings with SMEs I attended up the country I heard this described as "the slow no".  I have written again to the banks to point out that these systemic information requests are irritating borrowers.</p><p> The good work done by Mr. Farrell and Mr. O'Regan with the chartered accountants to embed the common application form, the common business plan format and the common cashflow analysis will be helpful.  We need to take this forward now and work with the accountancy bodies and the county enterprise boards to ensure they understand that this is out there and how to use it.  We hope to help improve the capacity of businesses to borrow by getting this embedded more widely in the community.  It is still a work in progress.  </p><p> The Central Bank figures on demand are taken from a wide European survey with a relatively small number of SMEs.  The Credit Review Office asked that we survey the demand in the Irish market among SMEs.  That was previously done by Mazars; it is now being done by RedC.</p></speech>

It has a statistically valid population and asks a range of questions that complement each other to provide a report on the Irish market.  While it could be argued that the European numbers are valid because they are taken from across the EU, they are fitting into a situation in which Ireland has had the biggest dip in GDP, except, probably, for Greece. The Mazars survey is consistent and provides me with a picture of Irish business.</p><p>  I think I have covered most of the points raised.

The banks reporting their monthly statistics on percentage sanction to the review office include only written formal applications.  We have had a couple of reports in the last week about each of the two banks.  A couple of people have come to the review office to say they went in and asked and were told not to bother.  We have referred those reports to the banks.  The staff in the two branches concerned are to be retrained to avoid that.  I understand that in at least one of the banks, even informal requests are now being logged and sent to head office.</p><p>  One cannot know what is said verbally by each of several thousand bank staff across the country on a daily basis.  I remind small businesses that they have a right to apply for a loan.  I urge them to do so but to make sure before they go in that they are well prepared and can argue their case.  A request must be made formally and in writing.  If it does not go into the bank system it will not be measured.  If a loan is rejected and the applicant feels strongly about that, there is a bank appeal system and the Credit Review Office is there to help as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Farrell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012111300006#E00600"><p>I will try to cover all the questions asked.  If I miss something I hope members will come back to me.</p><p>  I am seeking, in a respectful way, to present facts.  These are facts that are corroborated by third parties.  They are not hypothetical but are based on real experience and data collected on what is happening in the SME sector. </p><p>  The Credit Review Office consistently reports that somewhere between 80% and 85% of credit applications are approved.  Thus, if 80,000 loans are approved, there must have been approximately 100,000 applications. </p><p>  Reference was made to the turnaround time.  I recently saw the figure of 60% cited as the percentage of loan applications approved within 15 working days.  That figure should be 100%, although I know banks are working to bring down the approval time so there is a much faster turnaround time.  I suspect some of this delay is caused by the issue Mr. Trethowan referred to: a business making an application does not always arrive with the correct information.</p><p>  The issue of discouraged loans is a perennial one.  If we want to get a handle on the level of refusals, businesses must make formal applications.  Meeting a bank manager in the golf club, outside the church or in the corner shop and having a "how are you fixed?" type of conversation does not constitute an application.  A bank cannot make an evaluation based on that kind of casual encounter.  Members know that if a constituent comes to them with a case they need to gather all the salient facts before they can make a judgment.  A formal application must be made, tedious as it may be.  Businesses are run by entrepreneurs, who are extraordinarily resilient individuals.  They would not survive in business otherwise.  They have to be equally resilient in making sure they put in a formal application.  If that formal application is put together in a robust way with all the salient facts, demonstrates the sustainability of the business and provides all the required information, it stands an excellent chance of success.</p> <p>If it does not get credit, the Credit Review Office will make an independent evaluation and issue a judgment.  In some cases the complaint is upheld and in other cases it is not upheld.  I wish to reiterate that people should make a formal application for credit; if one does not ask, one will not know. </p><p> The matter of branch infrastructure is a case of cause and effect.  We have to stand back for a moment and consider what is happening in the Irish banking sector.  As a result of correct decisions which have been made externally, the balance sheets of the Irish banks have been significantly reduced.  This is an absolute requirement of the restructuring of the Irish banking system.  The banks are also required to significantly reduce their costs.  For instance, the chief executive of one of the banks attended another committee meeting last week at which he cited a figure of 27,000 staff in the bank at the height of the economic boom and the figure is now 12,000, more than a halving of the number of staff.  That level of restructuring by means of a reduction of overheads and infrastructure is bound to have an impact.  That does not mean that the systems go to pieces at the other end but it poses significant challenges in a transition period.  This is the situation which banks have to manage at the moment.  At the committee meeting last week, both chief executives made the point that they are restructuring their operations in order to put more of a focus on decision-making at the front line.  However, there are reasons for their decision to centralise some credit decisions such as quality and review considerations.  It is not easy to get this right.</p><p> I endorse what was said about Senator Quinn.  We invited Senator Quinn to speak at last year's banking conference.  We all have lots to learn from people like Senator Quinn on how to interact with the customer and satisfy customers' needs.  Banks are on this journey.  We know that in the period of the boom, banks were very focused on asset-backed lending and very exposed to construction and property lending.  The needs of the real economy today are centred in the small and medium enterprises sector and in the export sector.  These are the needs that banks must serve.  New skills need to be acquired rapidly so that banks can best serve the needs of the emerging parts of the economy.  Our colleagues in the Institute of Bankers in Ireland have introduced education and training initiatives to which Mr. Trethowan referred in his report.  These are directed specifically at improving the skills and capabilities of banking staff to lend to small and medium enterprises and to the new and emerging sectors of the economy.</p><p> The banks are not ignoring the United Kingdom market.  Ireland is in the eurozone.  The vast majority of SME exports are to continental Europe, much more so than to the UK.  I do not have information about the UK market but I will endeavour to get it and to supply it to the Deputy.  I am sure most people read the UK newspapers from time to time which describe the very same challenges and issues that obtain in the UK market with regard to access to credit and the distress for small and medium enterprises.  I do not think there is a fundamental difference in the two markets.</p></speech>

Credit was being lashed into the economy prior to 2008 and the mirror image is happening now.  This is the result of European and Government policy.  There is a pressure on banks to deleverage from markets.  Banks need to reduce their costs and exposure.</p><p>  ISME represents small business and its figures are startling.  A total of 45% of SMEs looking for loans have been refused credit; 25% of SMEs did not make a loan application because they were discouraged from doing so by the bank; 72% of firms stated that bailed out banks are making it more difficult to access finance.  Those statistics are for the period up to last September 2012; they are live figures.  What is the current level of credit in the market?  A total of &euro;2.6 billion credit is outstanding to SMEs.  How does that compare to the situation ten years ago?  </p><p>  There is confusion about the Government's objectives with regard to facilitation of new credit.  Would it be better for banks to separate refinancing credit from new credit and to have separate targets for the banks?  Politicians are under pressure from small business to ensure credit is available for them.  We are told the banks are facilitating this lending but much of the finance is directed to refinancing rather than being issued as new credit.  </p><p>  The cost of borrowing is a barrier to accessing finance.  It is more expensive to access finance in Ireland than in other European countries.  The micro-enterprise facility charges more for finance than the banks.  I ask Mr. Farrell for his view on this point.  Small indigenous businesses with non-performing legacy loans were advised to put money into property and not to put all their eggs in one basket.  Spicers in Navan and Olhausen in Dublin, are examples of businesses that were functioning.  Is it possible for the banking industry to separate those loans from the functioning business in order to safeguard jobs?  Can these loans be written down?  How do banks accommodate small viable businesses ?  How are customers of the former Anglo Irish Bank or Bank of Scotland (Ireland) faring when applying for credit rating with banks?  How can they ensure access to credit from the banks?</p></speech>

I recently attended the gathering of the Small Firms Association which has ten times more members than ISME, if I am not mistaken.  It is a very representative association.  The president of the association, Ian Martin, cited four barriers to business.  Availability of credit was the fourth barrier.  The top item was the inability to get payment from other creditors over a reasonable period of time.  Other issues included the cost of doing business and the issue of regulation which is a somewhat hardy annual for all businesses.</p><p>  On the question of the customers of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) and other banks, part of the new lending by banks has been to refinance former customers of those banks who exited from the market.  </p> <p>That is a conscious act on the part of another bank - to take a brand new business and extend loans to it to replace the loans that were hitherto in place from the other bank.  It is not a casual job but involves seriously valuing the businesses.  If these companies were not refinanced they would find themselves going out of business.</p><p> On the question of the level of credit ten years ago and now, I do not have that figure.  We will see if we can get that.</p></speech>

I must make the point that most people who were in business around 2007, when preparing their three- or five-year plans, projected that the economy would have grown by about 25% up to now, but instead it has shrunk by 25%.  That is a catastrophic reduction in the economic output of the domestic economy.  Something has to give.  If one builds one's business on servicing that level of capacity, one must seriously reduce one's business or it may transpire that one no longer has a viable business.  That is a hard but indisputable fact, and it needs to be borne in mind.</p><p>  On the issue of non-performing loans, the Deputy is correct.  In many cases, one of the big problems - two chief executives of the banks who appeared before another committee recently referred to this, and Mr. Trethowan is also aware of it - is that the underlying business is still profitable and sound but people got involved in property speculation and investment during the Celtic tiger era and they are now trying to service those investments from the business, which is putting a huge strain on the business.  One of the challenges for banks is to work with customers to examine the core business and the activity within it to ascertain the needs in this regard while, separately, examining the property issue and how it can be dealt with or structured.  Mr. Trethowan may have more to say on that.  I  am not sure whether I covered all of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Felix O'Regan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012111300008#G00400"><p>I will add one point which may be helpful.  The Deputy referred to ISME.  We have had surveys from the Small Firms Association in the past, Chambers Ireland has done some work, and we have done our own work.  In their wisdom, the two key Departments - the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Finance - brought all of the stakeholders, including the bodies represented, around the table about 18 months ago and said that we had to get to the bottom of this to obtain a real picture of what was happening in lending and that the Government would commission a piece of work in this regard, and that is how we got the Mazars study.  All of the stakeholders agreed that this would be the definitive piece of research that informed policy and practice as we moved forward.  ISME was at that table, as were the SFA and ourselves.  That is the reason we consistently point to the Mazars study, warts and all - in which the warts, from our point of view, are deficiencies.  We must all subscribe to one definitive piece of work.  The figures produced by Mazars are nowhere near the sort of figures ISME continues to produce.  I believe I am correct in saying that Mr. Trethowan and his colleagues in the Credit Review Office have also had issues with the ISME research.  We are all trying to subscribe to and support the same definitive piece of work.</p><p>  To return to a point Deputy Calleary raised regarding discouraged borrowers, one result from the research that was particularly worrying was that 45% of businesses said their opinions about whether banks were lending were formed on the basis of media reports or statements from what they heard outside, rather than their own experience.  Obviously there are businesses that base their opinions on their experiences, but nearly half of the respondents said their views were driven by media reports.  The challenge for us is to cut through that and try to get a more positive message across that what is involved is, as Mr. O'Farrell said, the formulation of a formal credit application and then going through the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Trethowan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012111300008#G00500"><p>I will deal with the questions from the top of the list, and the first question I have listed is the one on the size of the loan book.  I have been monitoring the loan books for the past two and half years, since April 2010, and I can comment on the general direction of lending.  It has been downwards.  Each half-year we ask the banks to do what is called a funds flow statement, which shows the starting balance of their loan books and the end balance at the end of the period, and it shows how much lending has been done, how many repayments have been received, what interest has been charged and what has been written off.  It tracks all the movements in the book.  Irish businesses are currently paying down debt much more quickly than the demand for lending is putting new money into the market.  There is a clear reason for the decline in the loan books during the past two and half years.  I cannot speak for the past ten years but I am sure someone will find those numbers for the Deputy.</p><p>  On the ISME survey, all of the trade bodies and trade groups - ISME, Chambers Ireland, the SFA, the IFA and the hoteliers - have a vital role to play in the market.  They keep the pressure on from the demand side and keep everyone honest.  I have a different view on the ISME survey.  My problem with it is that ISME surveys all of its members.  It sent out 8,000-odd surveys and reported on the number it received back, which was about 800.  The people who tend to reply to such surveys are people who have issues - people who have been on the wrong side of staff satisfaction surveys and so on - so the survey is skewed towards the negative.  That is my issue with the survey.  It does not reflect the number of people who were asked to respond; it only reflects those who responded, which skews it towards the negative side.</p><p>  On the separation of new and restructured loans, that is one of the fundamental things we do in the Credit Review Office.  We do it in some of the 55% of cases in which we can help to get credit for businesses.  We do it for farms and also for small businesses.  Farmers were encouraged in poorer times to engage in secondary enterprises and many of them went into building as a secondary enterprise, including farm buildings, for which there were grants available.  In such cases, we often find that the farm is viable but the farmer has not collected the trade debt on the building.  By separating the farm from the secondary enterprise, we are able to show that the business is viable as a farm and that we need to park the other debt and see, first, if the farm business can survive through this period and, second, if it can make some contribution towards paying off the debt.  It is the same for small businesses.</p><p>  There was a question about legacy loans.  I would say that applies in half of the cases we see.  We always ask for a statement of assets from the main promoter of the business, whether it be the sole owner or the principal director.  Invariably, when we ask for a statement of assets, we are given a list of buy-to-let properties.  We have a table which shows the value they were bought at, their current value, how much was borrowed against the properties, how much is due to be repaid and what rentals there are.  Those were the reserves of the business during the Celtic tiger years, and instead of being released as a liquid source of cash, they are now fixed assets.  They either break even or go underwater, and instead of providing cash for the business the servicing costs of the loans are pulling the business back.  Therefore, they need to be parked and the core business needs to be examined.</p><p>  Anglo Irish Bank is precluded from making new loans and Bank of Scotland (Ireland) has declared it is leaving Ireland.  We get some applications in which the business is currently insolvent because of large property debts with, let us say, Bank of Scotland (Ireland).  Certus is doing forgiveness of debts and the application we get would be to finance a deal to refinance the Bank of Scotland (Ireland) debt.  It might be a tenth of what was borrowed.  For a business with a balance sheet that shows it is insolvent with a level of debt on one side, if the debt is written down to a tenth of the amount, it is transformational for the business.  It gives it a future.  We are encouraging the active banks - the pillar banks and Ulster Bank - to refinance such loans.</p> <p>In most cases we manage to get that done, but there is a reluctance on the part of all the banks to take on someone else's debt.  That is an issue also.</p><p> On the cost of lending and the micro-enterprise fund, the cost of lending reflects the price banks are having to pay for the funds.  Until the collapse of Lehman Brothers banks were merrily funding themselves on the money markets at reasonably cheap prices but that disappeared and has remained broken since 2008.  If members read the newspapers they will see the advertisements for deposits, and they are well over 3%.  That is what banks are paying currently for retail money.  They must take that, absorb their own costs and then lend it out again.  </p><p> The cost of funds is what it is because that is the market.  In the applications and the appeals we see we always ask how much the bank is proposing to charge.  Given the level of risk we see in some of the applications it is not unreasonable.  The micro-enterprise fund is charging the premium because the level of risk it is taking is much higher than in traditional bank lending.  I have to be fair to both the supply side and the demand side in my job and I must face reality.  That is the position on the cost of funds.  The market is dictating that rate.  AIB is showing the cost of funds as a funding premium.  That is an abnormal situation and hopefully in time, if markets return to normal, it will take that premium back up again.</p></speech>

Is that regularly happening with regard to businesses with other debts?  The reduction of the loan book may not be definitive but nonetheless it would that indicate that it is a fair indication of ISME's experience because the trend is going in that direction.</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan mentioned in his report that a tipping point is happening of businesses surviving on directors' loans, and that is drying up.  What significant effect will that have on business and their experience?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Trethowan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012111300009#H00300"><p>On the parking of the debts, it is not happening in a widespread way but when it was last here the troika asked for the temporary forbearance to move into more long-term restructuring.  Currently, people have been turning over the forbearance waiting for better times to come but the troika has said it wants to see a business in that position, which is struggling, restructured over five to seven years with a proper programme.  That will mean that those legacy debts will have to be addressed one way or another.</p><p>  It is not the job of the Credit Review Office to talk about debt forgiveness.  We try to make a deal without recommending that the bank write down debt but the reality is that some level of forgiveness by all of the banks will have to be required on the way forward to deal with just the legacy debts.</p><p>  On the reduction, the global economy is awash with cash with businesses paying down debt, and not just in Ireland.  It is not an Irish phenomenon; it is a situation across the world.  There is approximately &euro;15 trillion in cash on businesses' balance sheets across the world.  Businesses are not borrowing; they are repaying.</p><p>  On directors' loans, again, one of the features we see in many appeals is that when we get to the capital account there is a big chunk in it with the directors' loans.  It may be that there is some capacity remaining out there but we are probably in year 5 of these challenging times for domestic demand, turnover and profitability.  The capability of directors to continue to fund businesses from their own resources may be getting strained.</p><p>  The other aspect that would worry me is the trade debts in some business balance sheets.  As bank lending has been tight for some businesses they have borrowed from their suppliers and suppliers have been willing to lend because they want to increase their turnover, but once a trade debt is taken onto someone's books they become the banker for that other business.  If they go down, they have a bad debt on their books.  It is not unknown for us to see a good business brought down just by bad trade debts and therefore it is something about which to be cautious.</p></speech>

Businesses are paying down debt faster than they are borrowing.  The fact that the overall book moves downwards slightly does not necessarily mean that less money is being lent but that people are paying down debt faster than they are borrowing.</p></speech>

Mr. Trethowan said that to date the Credit Review Office has received 281 applications for formal appeals on which 175 opinions have been issued and the process completed, and of those 55% have been upheld.  What happened between the time somebody was refused credit, his or her going to the Credit Review Office, it going back to the bank, and the bank changing its mind?</p><p>  I have had two experiences in recent years.  I have been judging the Business &amp;amp; Finance Entrepreneur of the Year for the past three years, the most recent of which we finished yesterday.  I was also involved in a television programme called "Retail Therapy" which involved meeting small businesses.  I found that those businesses that were bright and with it, and I am thinking of the Entrepreneur of the Year, had no problem getting loans because they were professional in the manner in which they went about doing that.  I have met other companies which had two views on that.  One was that having read what is in the newspapers they knew they had no chance of getting a loan and therefore they did not look for one.  The other was that they had put in an application that was poorly worded, badly advised and lacking in professionalism.  I would not give them a loan on that basis.  However, I found that if I gave them some advice or got somebody to give them advice the entire situation changes.  Is that what has happened?  I believe the bank has a strong case to make when it says people are coming in to them ill-prepared or that people are not coming in to them because they have read in the newspapers that they have no chance of getting money.  Is that the experience of the Credit Review Office as well?  It appears that if there has been a 55% change of attitude something has changed from the time the bank said "No" to the time it said "Yes.</p></speech>

The one question we ask on any application is whether the bank will lose money.  If the answer to that is that they do not think so we will support it.  That is the only policy we have, and that is where many of the loan applications are failing because they cannot tick all the boxes.</p><p>  As I explained to the Deputy earlier, we disaggregate the problem from the core business and see if the core business is viable.  We are also keen to know the number of jobs that are at risk each time and if there are jobs at risk we will do everything we can to try to save that business.</p><p>  We have a small team of about eight, including Ms Catherine Collins and myself.  Five of us are very experienced bankers.  Ms Collins is an experienced public sector analyst.  My bankers are not order takers the way that has developed in our branch, business centres and banks where people take down details and send them to someone in Dublin for a credit decision.  We talk to the customer.  From time to time when we put in an application the bank will come back to us and say it did not know that because the person never told it.  We have experienced lenders who will talk to them and when information starts to come out it makes the deal doable.</p> <p>When we submit an opinion, it follows a standard and very recognisable format.  We examine the strategic background of the business in question, its location, what it does and the experience of the promoters, both in business and in what they do.  We consider the amount of existing lending and the statement of assets.  We determine whether there are buy-to-let properties and the serviceability.  We also determine the viability of the proposal from the borrower's perspective.  We ask whether it will credibly generate the cash to repay the loan.  The banks know what is coming each time and it depends on how it will look.  It is through examining all these factors that we can change a decision by a bank.</p><p> I am sure the banks do not like our decisions in some cases.  As with all loans, some will be bad; a feature of lending money is that one does not get it all back.  I am sure that when loans go wrong, banks will point the finger and say John Trethowan told us to lend it.</p><p> I have been critical about the banks in my last couple of reports in respect of enterprise risk-taking.  I am sure that, at times, the banks wished my office did not exist.  However, that is part of the job.  Banks should never be too comfortable with the Credit Review Office.  They have always co-operated with us.  They have had real problems with two of our opinions.  We listened to their views and had to accept them.  In one case, the deal in question was still viable but it turned out there were many planning-permission problems associated with the property for which finance was sought.  Therefore, the bank's reason for not advancing the money was understandable.  We accepted its view.</p></speech>

There seems to be an absence of professional advice on putting together cash flow statements and filling out applications.  That is a fairly common theme.</p><p>  When Mr. Trethowan was first here two and a half years ago, we suggested his office or one with similar capacity should be involved at an earlier stage.</p></speech>

We will have to consider expanding our team because the demand is rising.  However, local accountants could be more proactive in giving advice to businesses.  The financial accounts we see are being produced on spreadsheets.  It would not require much extra effort to generate some key ratios and have a cup of coffee with the borrower to outline the debt level associated with the business.  There is also a role for the county enterprise boards and the LEOs, as they will come to be known, in respect of business mentoring and advice.  The Credit Review Office does not necessarily have to be involved as there are other bodies with capacity.</p></speech>

Significant work was done on it with all the relevant accountancy bodies.  A sustainable business that submits a credit application using the template stands an excellent chance of obtaining credit because it captures all the relevant dimensions and covers all the information needed.  To date, there has been no standard template.  An application of 20 pages might have been no better than an application with one page because it might not have contained answers to the right questions.  The document we have produced outlines the questions one needs to answer and the information that needs to be supplied.  Members may find it useful because they encounter people in their constituency work who are contemplating making an application or who may be in the middle of making one.  They will also know people in the accountancy profession.  The profession has agreed to use the template more often than not as the standard template for submitting applications.</p></speech>

Did Mr. Trethowan expect more when his office started off?  At what point after an applicant is refused credit can he or she approach the Credit Review Office?  Do banks advise those who are refused credit of the existence of the Credit Review Office?</p><p>  Is the Credit Review Office concerned that banks will be quicker to refuse businesses seeking loans smaller than &euro;25,000 in the knowledge that there is in place a micro-finance fund, which constitutes an opt-out or alternative?</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan stated the troika has asked the banks to move beyond short-term forbearance to a more structured plan.  Is there evidence of a shift in policy in this regard?</p><p>  Consider the table summarising the statistics on banks' formal internal appeals.  Will Mr. Trethowan explain it?  I understand 6% of Bank of Ireland appeals were overturned and that 31% of AIB appeals were overturned.  What does this say about the two banks?  Why was there such a difference?</p><p>  Many members have said the views they hear on the ground are different from those we hear from the Irish Banking Federation.  At the start of this year I met two local bank managers from one of the pillar banks.  They told me they are open for business and encouraged me to send clients to them.  I stated I had heard anecdotally that the bank was reluctant to lend and the managers accepted there was reluctance in 2011 and that the bank was anxious about or scared of being too generous in giving out loans.  Since then, one would have expected to have seen an increase in lending.   Is the bankers&rsquo; statement that they are more open for business backed up in the figures?</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan referred to the parking of other debt.  We have been told many businesses that are doing well invested in property, both foreign and Irish, during what were supposedly the good times.  Obviously, the property prices have collapsed.  Is business debt separated from property debt?  Is there separation as might be evident in respect of building-related debts incurred by farmers who worked in the building industry?  Has this been recognised?</p></speech>

The stream probably has been increasing.  At present, we are receiving more applications than we did at the beginning.  To some extent, the numbers are not very relevant in that if any of the 80,000 applications referred to is declined, the bank is obliged in the first instance to advise the applicant of its internal appeals process and of the process of the Credit Review Office.  When the banks decline an application, they do not know who will approach the Credit Review Office.  This has upped the game of the banks in the past two years in that they must meet a standard against which they know they could be measured if my office were to receive an appeal.</p><p>  One reason people may not approach us is that they may be so weary on being refused by their banks that they do not want to go through another process.</p> <p>We have refined our Credit Review Office process from April 2010.  Ms Catherine Collins has worked hard to make it as simple as possible and we have further work to do to try to cut down any administrative overhead.  In fact, we now are getting to the stage at which people will simply approach us stating they wish to appeal and we will do most of the work for them thereafter.  We must engage them and work with them to find out about their business, but we try to make that as painless as possible.</p><p> As for the troika's suggestion regarding restructuring, it only came out with it at its last visit approximately three or four weeks ago and it will take a while for that to work through.  Members should bear in mind what I said about trade debts.  There will be some businesses which do not make it through this process and all the people they have as creditors will be obliged to take losses on their trade books.  A message I impart to businesses every time I speak to them is to watch their own trade books because that will be their Achilles heel.  On the question of internal bank appeals, members really must ask the banks.  We report this each quarter, and I can see that AIB is overturning a lot more of its own decisions while Bank of Ireland is overturning very few.  It may be the view of Bank of Ireland that it its happy with its credit process from the outset but again, that is a question for the banks.  I cannot comment on that.  On our actual appeals and those which were overturned, there is not much difference between the two banks, and consequently I cannot draw any conclusions from the internal appeals.</p><p> On the demand for loans, one must also consider the economy and its present state in comparison with the position in 2007.  We have an economy that shrank by 25%.  Businesses have downscaled accordingly and the size of the business, the number of employees, the working capital requirements and stock holdings all have come down to reflect this.  If a business has not copped on to the situation, it has basically gone out of business.  There is also a lack of demand for new investment.  People are not building new showrooms or new shops because, at present, they cannot see a return on the investment or how to service the debt.  Consequently, there are pretty identifiable reasons demand for credit is lower now than would have been the case in 2007.  For me, the challenge will come as the economy picks up and people start to become more optimistic and want to trade at higher levels, which will require more working capital and may require the investment of money.  At that stage, when such people approach the banks, we will be looking to the banks to make sure they do not stifle any recovery that is happening.  Certainly, the Credit Review Office will be needed most whenever the demand for credit actually rises.</p></speech>

I will revert to one point the Deputy made about microfinance.  The increased rate of refusals suggested by the Deputy will not happen for the following reason, if no other.  Banks are supplying most of the finance for the Microfinance Ireland fund.  While there is a certain amount of risk-sharing with regard to the equity that is being invested in respect of the guarantee for the loans, effectively the lion's share of the financing will come through the banking sector.  Effectively, the banks will be the primary source of finance for the Microfinance Ireland fund, as they have been for the Social Finance Foundation over the past number of years.  However, I believe what Microfinance Ireland is doing constitutes an extremely important initiative on the Government's part because many of these businesses comprise one, two or three people and are fairly low in respect of formal business management or planning skills.  That is not anyone's fault; it is simply a function of the type of business they operate.  Therefore, their proposition to a bank to obtain money is more challenging than would be the case with regard to meeting the traditional criteria.  Moreover, this was where the highest rate of decline was detected, because these are riskier enterprises.  Effectively, a model has been developed to try to change that dynamic and hopefully - there is no reason to believe otherwise - the establishment of that structure, for which banks will supply quite a lot of finance, will help to address that issue.  It is a particular challenge that has been identified in both the Mazars report and Mr. Trethowan's reports.</p></speech>

We have been using that for two and a half years for smaller loans that have come through.  Many of these loans involve people who are starting up for the first time with new enterprises with little or no capital.  These people basically are going it alone.  They may be coming out of unemployment and are having a go themselves.  However, banks never supplied seed capital for start-ups, especially for small-scale lending, and consequently this scheme is tailored for them.  We put a lot of people through to the First Step programme prior to this and we already have started using the microenterprise fund for some of the smaller ones, in conjunction with the county enterprise boards, to make sure that such small businesses are mentored from the outset as well.</p></speech>

As I have approximately eight questions, I will go through them as quickly as possible.  First, I wish to make a suggestion in respect of the report from the Irish Banking Federation.  On page 4, in respect of the percentage of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, using banking credit, it might be a good idea to consider debtor days when considering bank overdraft facilities across the rest of Europe as opposed to here, because I suspect we are very poor in managing our debtors.  As Mr. Trethowan has already indicated, I believe that would be a worthwhile exercise.  How do the witnesses envisage the loan guarantee scheme helping?  As it has been established that demand is weak, the witnesses should indicate their views on what the banks are doing to stimulate demand.  Is the pricing of interest rates a disincentive?  What are the banks doing differently today in comparison with what they were doing 18 months ago when the Mazars report was drawn up?  How are banks approaching the task of gaining a real understanding of their customers' requirements and how they can be supported where security clearly is an issue, where credit rating is an issue or where there are core and non-core issues extant?  To paraphrase Fiona Muldoon of the Central Bank, there is a lot of activity but no real outcomes.  Banks may be putting loans on different interest rates or on shorter terms but they are not really dealing with the core issues.  I do not believe that waiting for property prices to increase will solve the problem any time soon.  This is a real issue.</p><p>  In my experience of helping clients to get loans, there is a huge mix, with people putting together very good business plans and getting loans, as well as people who are putting together very poor ones.  It is clear there is a major issue in respect of soft supports nationwide.  Everyone present is familiar with my views on this issue and on the concept of establishing a stronger mentoring force whereby businesses can receive help.  I have spoken to the banks about it and they agree.  However, it is important to have such a force because at present there is much activity in that space but there really is no place for some of it.  While the banks were talking about entering that space, I do not think it is a space into which they should go.  There should be a single establishment that does this and does so really well.  I seek the witnesses' views in this regard.</p></speech>

I will read a quote from four years ago: "The banking sector will not be found wanting in providing increased support for its business customers in these very challenging times."  It has taken four years to come full circle from the position then to the fact that small businesses were not getting any support at all.</p><p>  I have a couple of questions, although many of the questions have been dealt with previously.  First, I refer to the age profile of the people who approach the Credit Review Office with regard to young entrepreneurs and young people who approach it seeking finance.  I acknowledge it is extremely difficult and Mr. Trethowan has mentioned that most of the businesses with which he is dealing now have been set up in the past ten years.  I note entrepreneurial courses may now be found within schools and third level institutions for young people starting out.</p> <p>Are we going to see the banks increase lending to these young people starting out in business?  A high percentage of businesses succeed but that should not be the case as there should be a fair percentage of failures too.  In America, they often say one learns more from the first failure of a business which helps in future enterprises.  What is the banks&rsquo; reaction to someone trying to get back into business after failing in a previous venture?</p><p> Another problem I have with the banks concerns their capacity to understand business.  Many experienced bank employees who were used to dealing with small businesses have left.  Can the banks still understand loan applications from small businesses, particularly now as lending operations seem to have become more centralised?  Mr. David Duffy told the committee he wanted to get the branches to make the decisions on the loans themselves.  Is it because many branches do not have the capacity to make these decisions that the system has become more centralised?</p></speech>

He has done a very good PR job for the banks and was faultless in his presentation showing everything is perfect with them.  I am delighted to meet Mr. John Trethowan in person.  He was the fair-haired boy for a while when he agreed with the banks.  When he disagreed with them, he became a <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>.  I heard one of the bank bosses claim various new companies were successful when Mr. Trethowan pointed out they had already gone out of business.</p><p>  Bank lending overall has contracted due to the weak demand in the economy.  However, yesterday, Lars Frisell, chief economist of the Central Bank, at a European conference, gave a more fundamental reason.  He claimed Ireland's banks face great economic uncertainty and pressure to deleverage which stifles their ability or willingness to supply the economy with credit at reasonable costs.  Mr. Trethowan has upheld 55% of the appeals made to his office.  Have the banks subsequently agreed to provide the funding?</p><p>  Mr. Trethowan referred to relationship banking and the centralisation of decision-making on credit applications, the reduction in rural branches and the continuing change of front-of-house staff leading to many small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, feeling isolated and remote from their banks.  Any of us involved in a SME know that it is all about the character, calibre and capability of the promoter whether the business survives or not.  I do not agree with Senator Quinn that the banks are being upfront about their loans.  I do not believe anyone seriously in business today would make a presentation to a bank that would not stand up to scrutiny, particularly with the wide availability of computer programmes and so forth for such exercises.</p><p>  Regarding the &euro;3.5 billion lending targets for the two pillar banks, Mr. Trethowan stated new lending is a vital component of economic growth and is an area in which the Credit Review Office is encouraging banks to be more accommodating.  What are the components of this &euro;3.5 billion lending?  Why are the banks not more transparent about it?  There is a case for including restructured loans in the targets.  The same cannot be said for annual overdraft limits which are part of the annual process of cash flow management.  Are annual renewals of overdraft limits and invoice discounting included in this &euro;3.5 billion target?</p><p>  As an opposition spokesperson in the Seanad on jobs, enterprise and innovation, I have harangued the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about the lack of money available for SMEs.  I believe he is listening to the banks rather than to the SMEs.  While a bank may approve a loan, it may effectively stifle it being drawn down by imposing tough conditions such as personal guarantees.  What is the Credit Review Office's experience of this matter?</p><p>  I am delighted Mr. Trethowan, who is from the North, is head of this office.  If we had a united Ireland, the people in the North could be running the show down here as they are so efficient.  Mr. Pat Farrell is a master of the seamless presentation of the bank's position.</p></speech>

Three years ago, there was much talk about retraining bank staff to deal with SME business plans, cash flows and so forth.  Where are the plans with this?  When a SME is refused credit by a bank, it is not always clear why and is often just a one-line rejection.  If more was done on explaining why, it could assist in the re-application process.  I accept some of them need to put more effort into applications but more information could help them.</p></speech>

Do the banks get every one of these right?  No.  There are some people who are approved who should not have been and their loans will become bad ones.  The banks are probably refusing people who may not have made a good case in the first place but if they go through the Credit Review Office they may get credit after all.  Is the system 100% perfect?  Of course it is not.  We are working mightily hard to make sure we get all the applications right but it must be remembered we are all human and it is a fallible decision-making process.</p><p>  I take the point about debtor days.  Mr. Trethowan already alluded to it that the amount of credit by stealth that is taken from business to business is high.  We have a culture of it and it has not gotten much better since the downturn.</p><p>  The banks have been trying to play their part in preparing business plans for accountants of SMEs.  If every SME accountant used our template, it would help drive up the quality of applications and get the decision right the first time rather than having to be submitted again or through the Credit Review Office.  I would like to be out of business too.</p><p>  This is a journey.  I am not trying to pretend that everything is rosy in the garden.</p> <p>I accept the comment from Senator White, which one would have to wear lightly, as would anybody who works in the banking sector.  There is still a considerable amount of work to do.</p><p> In terms of business failures, one of the important aspects is the reform of the bankruptcy laws which we have supported.  One of the problems for business, to which Deputy Lawlor referred, is that in this country there is a culture that it is not okay to fail and there is a stigma attaching to failing in business.  Perhaps one of the reasons for this is the bankruptcy laws, which effectively mean that one is cast out for 12 years from one's business activity.  That will be changed quite quickly to a much shorter discharge period.  One will see some restructuring of business activity going through that process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Farrell" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012111300013#M00300"><p>It is something of a hypothetical case.  There are many prominently involved in business in this country who have failed, who are still in business and who have started new enterprises, and that speaks for itself.  It is not about the fact that somebody has been in business and has failed.  One looks at each business proposition as it comes before one.  Sometimes people are all the better for having failed because it is the experience they gain from failure that is perhaps more important than the experience they gain from success.  Failure is not an issue.  Some of the questions were specific to Mr. Trethowan.</p><p>  Young entrepreneurs are a specific area that should be targeted.  Some of the banks - I stand open to correction - may have funds or resources dedicated to nurturing young entrepreneurs.  Businesses age and their owners age with them.  One needs to be able to bring a new cohort of young entrepreneurs on track who will start up new enterprises, give new energy and refresh existing enterprises, and bring new ideas and new thoughts.  There is a significant cohort of young people who have brilliant business ideas but, as Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins stated, they need mentoring and support.  The banks are actively putting resources into that area at present.  It may be there is merit in looking at co-ordinating mentoring activities better.  There is probably more than enough mentoring activity around.  It is to direct it in the appropriate manner.  Young entrepreneurs must be nurtured by banks because the customers of the banks will eventually age and retire, and they must replace them with new customers.  It is self-evident that one must encourage young entrepreneurs.</p></speech>

We had two applications waiting and once the scheme went active, we had those back into the system.  With the loan guarantee scheme, like the microenterprise fund and the Credit Review Office, there is no silver bullet that solves all our problems.  What the Government and the previous Government together have done is put together a toolbox of various measures which are there to help small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>  In answer to Senator White, I come down from the North with sterling in one pocket and euros in the other.  That is the only difference I make between the two jurisdictions.  In the North, they would love to have the supports we have for SMEs here.  I have spoken to them.  They look down here with envy at how we are supporting the SME sector.</p></speech>

On the change since two and a half years ago when we started, certainly the banks were in disarray and they are now at least stabilised.  Both banks have got their feet on the ground again whereas when I came here at the start, they were trying to find the bottom.</p><p>  I was asked whether the banks understand customer requirements in waiting for the property upturn.  They have been trying to push the forbearance on a rolling basis.  The troika has signalled that it wants to stop that.  Working to the end game for restructuring businesses, in a constructive manner one hopes, as that is the key to the matter, will require the businesses to work with the banks as well.  This is not a one-way street.  We have seen some instances where the information was being dealt out like poker from the business to the bank and the business would only give what the bank asked for.</p><p>  On support for SMEs' capabilities, one of the measures the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 has been looking for is a one-stop shop.  There are many good supports out there but one must hunt around for them.  It would be helpful if there was one place to which one could go.  I would hope that the local enterprise offices, LEOs, whenever they get started, will be empowered to be the one-stop shop for everyone.</p></speech>

For example, Enterprise Ireland has female entrepreneurship high up on the agenda and it has much work going in trying to promote start-ups from women.</p><p>  The start-up situation is not somewhere that bank finance would always play.  One needs capital and equity for businesses in a start-up situation and that is where the county enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland and other such supporters, and the microfinance fund would play quite strongly.</p></speech>

On the percentage of people who have failed and deserve a second chance, we see applications coming through from those who both have failed but who also have made a mistake because they were under so much pressure and probably have not been sleeping and so on.  The bank would state the applicant made a particular mistake and it would not deal with him or her anymore.  When we ask how long the applicant has banked with the bank and it replies that it is 20 years, we say there is one mistake involved and ask whether we can sort it out.  We have managed to resolve a few cases like that.</p><p>  On those who have failed, there is what in America they call the J-curve where one goes down a bit but one knows one has learnt from it and one can come back up.  One hopes many of our businesses people will have learned many lessons over recent years and will be better for it on the way forward.</p><p>  On the capacity to understand businesses, the banks could do more to understand their customers' businesses.  I honestly believe that.  The model of the order taken at the front end and someone doing the underwriting in Dublin is remote.  I do not know whether the capacity is available now for businesses to get a temporary loan, perhaps for a week, to cover a payment in the way they always used to do.</p><p>  On security for loans, the loan guarantee scheme will help.  If that becomes a stumbling block, that is when the loan guarantee scheme can come back into play.</p></speech>

We are working to ensure there will be a system of referral from the banking system into MFI, the idea being that cases that do not meet standard conventional bank lending criteria from the microfinance area would be referred to MFI.  It is important the banks do not send those applicants away but that they refer them to the local county enterprise boards and then to the MFI process.</p> <p>Even if they do not get MFI funding at that stage, they are still free to appeal their original bank application to the Credit Review Office.</p></speech>

Our submission represents the views of the entire chamber network.  It is the result of extensive consultation with representatives of the business community throughout Ireland.  Our members include established indigenous and multinational companies as well as small and medium-sized enterprises taking their first steps in business.  All of them recognise the role governments can play in producing the right conditions for job creation and retention.</p><p>  When this Government came to power, we noted the importance it attached to job creation.  Policies that support existing positions and help to create new employment will be a cornerstone of any future economic recovery.  Throughout 2012 we observed the progress made in this area and commented on the action plan for jobs and the three progress reports made to date.  Our general view is that while the action plan is strong on aspiration, we urgently need to deliver more rapidly.  While high profile jobs announcements are very welcome and we congratulate the Government on successes in this area, the numbers on the live register remain alarming.</p><p>  The policies pursued must create sustainable employment at a cost that is capable of being borne by businesses.  We believe this can be achieved through a number of policy areas.  There must be no increase in the cost of employment, wage setting mechanisms must not be excessively rigid, local government reform must help local economies, there must be a range of practical supports for SMEs and entrepreneurs, Ireland's infrastructure must be strengthened, and any changes in taxation must be sympathetic to the needs of the business community.</p><p>  Our members believe that the most important factor affecting job creation is the cost of employment.  If the Government is serious about helping businesses to create jobs, they must not increase these costs.  An example members may not think about is that the profitability of companies which cover health insurance costs for their staff is affected by ongoing levy increases, which have increased from &euro;160 for each adult covered in 2009 to &euro;285 in 2012.  With further increases scheduled, this has a real impact on the ability of these companies to retain existing staff and create new employment.  We believe there must not be any increase in the employer's share of PRSI and additional costs of sick leave must not be transferred to employers.  The Minister for Social Protection has suggested that such moves would be justified as they merely bring Ireland into line with international norms.  We reject that claim, however.  A number of major OECD countries have similar sick leave regimes as in Ireland.  Furthermore, employers bear the brunt of the cost of sick leave through their contributions to the Social Insurance Fund.  The extraordinary rise in health insurance costs also adds to companies' cost burdens and is a matter of concern.  These costs would not only harm existing indigenous companies but also have a harmful impact on foreign direct investment.  Companies considering investments in Ireland will not like to see the cost of employment rising.  The Minister's logic is flawed because the outcome of these policies would run counter to the Government's stated aims on job creation.</p><p>  This August saw the enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act.  A number of changes were welcomed by Chambers Ireland and the wider business community.  In particular, the reduction of Sunday premium rates of pay could prove vital in guaranteeing the survival of many small businesses in the retail and service sector.  For job creation to be sustainable, conditions of employment must be flexible.  Artificially inflated wage levels actually threaten jobs.  Many EU countries are seeing the benefit of flexicurity in employment because flexible terms and conditions actually produce more secure and stable outcomes for employers and workers.  Future legislation must be clear, simple and easily understood and implemented to ease the regulatory burden and make it easier for employers to comply with the current cornucopia of legislation in this area, which itself is a disincentive to employment creation.  Approximately 35 Acts apply to employment.  We reiterate our call for a fully consolidated single Act in this area.</p><p>  Considerable attention has been given this year to the reform of local government.  While the local government reform action plan mainly focused on the restructuring of local authorities, if the Government is intent on putting people first it needs to ensure local authorities work with local companies to assist in the task of job creation.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, which replace the county enterprise boards, should have clearly defined roles and functions and must not duplicate the services already offered by private companies.</p> <p>Instead they should fill the gaps between existing services to ensure businesses are supported.</p><p> Furthermore, representatives of the local business community ought to be included on these bodies.  For instance, given the experience of and local knowledge accumulated by chambers of commerce, representatives of such bodies could be an invaluable addition to any LEO.  The Government must emphasise the importance of local tendering.  Public sector organisations should be encouraged to tender from local firms and consortia.  Specifically, Department of Finance circular 10/10 giving  guidance on SME participation in tenders should be fully enforced.</p><p> I refer to supports for SMEs and entrepreneurs.  This is another key area affecting job creation and availability and we have a number of proposals.  First, the cashflow of SMEs can be improved by implementing the EU directive to allow them to utilise a cash accounting system for a greater cap.  While the Revenue Commissioners have implemented a cash accounting scheme, allowing companies to account for VAT on sale on the basis of payments received rather than tax invoices issued, it requires that annual turnover of the business must not exceed &euro;1 million.  This threshold is low by international comparison, being approximately two thirds of the thresholds that apply under similar schemes in the UK and Australia.  Where a VAT registered trader has an annual turnover exceeding &euro;1 million, it can only apply the cash accounting scheme where its supplies goods or services almost exclusively to unregistered persons.  This limits its application in practice to retailers and others businesses that sell to consumers and it does not assist the large number of SMEs with a turnover of marginally in excess of &euro;1 million that carry out mainly business-to-business sales.  We fully support recommendations regarding the extension of the scheme to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;2.5 million.  The full year cost of this proposal is zero, as there is no reduction in VAT paid.  It is simply a deferral while a number of companies adjust from one system to the other.</p><p> Businesses must be encouraged to use the services on offer from the microfinance fund and credit guarantee scheme.  A perception persists that many businesses will be rejected when they apply for credit and we must challenge this.  Businesses must be encouraged to apply to the banks, appeal through the CRO and use the credit schemes as a final resort.  We have called for a credit guarantee scheme since 2009 and we are disappointed by the number of applications being made to the CRO but the fact that so few are going to the office tells us something about demand levels in small businesses.  Our sense on the ground is that this is as much a demand issue as a supply issue.  The schemes are a vital component in improving confidence and the key is to encourage companies to apply to their banks because there are still companies that are afraid to go in and ask.  If any of these schemes give them a good reason to go in and ask, it is up to the bank then to keep them there.  The key issue for us is that when the recovery starts in earnest, we need to make sure banks have plenty of money to lend as well.</p><p> The Government should take measures to reduce the level of black market activity in the economy.  Legitimate businesses, which create numerous jobs, suffer as a consequence of these activities.  We believe hundreds of millions of euro are at stake.</p><p> Entrepreneurs should be rewarded for their risk tacking activity through the introduction of entrepreneurs' relief.  This would reduce the effective capital gains tax rate from 30% to 10% for qualifying disposals.  This should apply to gains made on the disposal of entrepreneurial businesses by individuals following the sale of all or part of a business.  We are looking for measures that will help entrepreneurs to start businesses and create jobs.  The seed capital scheme should be simplified and promoted to encourage more people to start their own businesses and grow job opportunities in the future.</p><p> Infrastructure is another area that allows business to grow and develop and, subsequently, leads to job creation.  The Government must invest in the development and maintenance of primary, secondary and tertiary roads across Ireland.  One example of a project that could greatly assist Ireland's business community is to upgrade Newlands Cross to complete the upgrade to the N7, which began in the 1960s.  Electronic infrastructure is also essential.  Given Ireland's dispersed population, it is essential that all businesses benefit from a fast, efficient and reliable broadband service.  The national broadband plan must be fully implemented.</p><p> As we approach the budget, taxation is not far from most people's thoughts.  From a business perspective, corporation tax must remain at 12.5%.  This will give businesses, internally and externally, the confidence to grow and develop, creating sustainable employment while allowing them to reinvest in their businesses.  The new local tax ought to lead to an appropriately targeted reduction in rates and other charges paid for by local businesses.  This again would give those in the business community increased confidence and security to enable them to expand.  In recent years, the hospitality sector has benefitted from a 9% VAT rate.  This should have a rolling two-year guarantee to enable businesses to guarantee advertised prices and accept bookings well in advance.   Typically, that system works on a one to two year timeframe for bookings and a guaranteed rate would be valuable.  This would safeguard many jobs in this vulnerable sector.</p><p> The solutions presented here seem straightforward and that is because we believe they are.  A number of Ministers have repeated the mantra that while governments do not directly create jobs, they help produce the right conditions for job creation.  To do that, practical measures must be introduced to support indigenous companies and encourage increased FDI.  If the jobs action plan 2012 was strong on aspiration, any new document must deliver quantifiable results.  I thank the committee for its  interest in our position and for its attention today.  We are willing to address any questions the members might have.</p></speech>

The lack of awareness about the scheme is still a big issue.  The other issue we keep hearing from our membership around the network relates to how one qualifies and where one goes to get the thumbs up.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has talked about simplification efforts and he says it is on his agenda when he talks to the business community.  We continually encounter businesses in start-up mode that are not aware of it.  This is about profiling and promoting the scheme and being sure about what the timelines for approval and what sectors qualify under it.</p></speech>

We are hearing repeatedly that businesses do not realise these schemes are available.  Many of us do not have time to go through the paperwork.  How do we target them?  If additional tax was to be imposed, we would know about it straight away.  Providing a cash payment for creating a job is probably the simplest way to do this rather than giving tax back to cover the initial costs of employing somebody.  What are the view of Chambers Ireland on that?</p></speech>

Surely, every business in the country must know the office is there, yet few people apply.  One cannot fail to hear the CRO advertising and, therefore, there is a dilemma.  The Revenue has the best mailing list in the country for businesses.  Perhaps the Revenue could advertise in its messages the legislation that is key.  We have mentioned this the odd time previously and I acknowledge there are data protection issues.  Some of the entrepreneurial initiatives we are looking at, for example, very much try to make people who have recently been made redundant to think about reinvesting their pot of cash.</p> <p>Perhaps the information sent by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation about redundancy claims could be accompanied by a snapshot of key items.  Government mailing lists are probably the best on the market.  Membership organisations such as ours depend on members signing up, being entitled to receive e-mails from us, etc.</p></speech>

Just as 1,000 staff have been transferred from the HSE into the Department of Social Protection to profile new workers, questions should be included on the menu of solutions.  Has a seed capital scheme been considered?  How much tax has a person paid in the past X number of years?  I would be surprised if the officials with whom people must sign a contract to meet are aware of the potential for these ideas to be included on the menu of solutions that they should be embracing.</p></speech>

That more people do not use this process is baffling.  Access to the business incentive scheme has been made easier.  Accountants are setting up funds and using clients' money to invest in three or four of them, which was not the case previously.  Rather, an accountant would raise money for a client.  There seems to be activity in that space.  The seed capital scheme is great but only one client used it in my time as an accountant.</p></speech>

We have dropped from tenth to 15th place in the list of the world's best places to do business.  Singapore is No. 1 and our tenth placing was not bad, but we have slipped to 15th in the past year.  We should make an effort in this regard.</p><p>  The other measure lies in trying to set up a new business.  Singapore is good in this respect, but New Zealand is even better.  One can set up a new business in one day through one procedure.  In Ireland, one can only set up a new business in ten days through four procedures.  The cost in New Zealand is less than &euro;100.  In Ireland, it is approximately &euro;140.  This is not a significant difference, but a real effort to remove red tape and delays would be welcome.

We in Fianna F&aacute;il were in office for most of the recession but we must stay on our toes and reduce the numbers unemployed.  Unemployment is a scourge.  There is a brain drain.</p><p>  I was disappointed to learn that county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, were being merged with local authorities.  If adequate leadership is provided, however, it could be good.  Mr. Trethowan referred to viewing local authorities as one-stop-shops, in that people knew where they could get information on available schemes, etc.  It could work and I am coming around to the idea.  If the Enterprise Ireland contacts who deal with local management are missionaries and visionaries for employment creation, it could work.  If they are bureaucrats, it will not.  I will be optimistic.</p><p>  Last week, I attended a Fianna F&aacute;il breakfast in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Deputy Michael McGrath, our finance spokesperson, addressed it.  Many business people from the area also attended.  They pleaded that the budget not add further costs to companies.  Will the Government increase the cost of employment?  It is a serious issue.</p><p>  Mr. Talbot and his colleagues should keep up the good work.  It is excellent.</p></speech>

We are trying to make it as attractive as possible to grow and build businesses.  We do not tend to get into personal tax rates around this and so on.  It is important that entrepreneurs who, having left a PAYE job, invest in a business and take on the worry of paying salaries every month and so on, are rewarded for doing so.  There can be a grudge factor in Ireland about people who do well.  If people are not encouraged to get into business and create jobs that presents as a crisis for us.  The argument again is whether it is a good time to penalise people who are in the job creation space.</p></speech>

It is hoped this process will feed into the Action Plan for Jobs in 2013, which will probably be launched in February.  I accept that much of the first action plan focused on basics.  However, we had to get the basics right.  It is hoped the next plan will move on from that and will be a lot more imaginative in terms of job creation.  We need everyone to feed into the study process, the results of which will be included in the plan.  The role of the joint committee will be to monitor implementation of the plan.  Much of what is proposed in the current plan is basic and should, perhaps, have been done years ago.  However, it is important it is done now so as to ensure we get the foundations right.

The foreign direct investment sector is doing a good job but until the domestic economy recovers there will not be massive job creation.  We need to be mindful of this in terms of the impacts we are having.  This is the reason we continually espouse the concerns about tax increases as opposed to cost containment measures.  The sick pay bill in the HSE last year was &euro;250 million.  A cost saving measure in that area would do a lot less damage to the economy than would other types of initiatives.</p></speech>

Our main business today is the student grant application system.  The meeting has been convened at short notice to address problems and delays that have arisen in the new system.  I understand many frustrating delays are being experienced by students applying to the new body, Student Universal Support Ireland, known as SUSI.  It appears the SUSI system has problems in coping with the volume of applications received.  As a result, some students and their families are suffering without any indication being given of how long it will be before the students receive their grants.  I thank the City of Dublin VEC officials for attending.  We all remember the crisis in dealing with the backlog of medical card applications.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children adopted a very proactive approach to solving that problem.  This committee is attempting to do something similar.  We have invited representatives of City of Dublin VEC to seek answers and outline what actions can be taken immediately to address the backlog of applications.  To that end, I welcome Ms Jacinta Stewart, chief executive officer of City of Dublin VEC; Mr. Tom Prizeman, unit manager of SUSI; and Ms Kay Cullinane, principal officer in the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to this committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>  I now invite Ms Stewart to make her presentation.</p></speech>

SUSI wants to award grants to students.  I will make a short presentation on current issues and the efforts we are making to deal with them.</p><p>  SUSI opened the new grant application scheme on Monday, 11 June 2012, with a closing date of 31 August.  Students applying for a new grant filled in an on line application form.  At the closing date of 31 August, 56,935 applications had been received.  We have, however, continued to receive applications beyond the closing date.  Over 9,000 applications have been received since.  Currently, the rate is approximately 200 a week.  </p><p>  SUSI includes a stringent means test to discover if a student is eligible for a grant.  Following the on-line application, each applicant was sent a pack by post, with a personalised check list, requesting a set of documents.  The SUSI figures as of 12 November are as follows: 20,350 applications are now complete at award stage; 25,310 are being processed; while documentation is awaited from 20,500 students.  </p><p>  I will describe how the system works.  Students complete an on-line application form and then each applicant is sent a pack by post containing a personalised check list and requesting a set of documents.  There are two parts to the process.  The first is to review the pack and ensure is it complete and the documentation is returned to SUSI.  The second is to assess the completed application.  In order to ensure the pack is complete, SUSI has provided a support service which has, to date, dealt with 175,000 telephone calls and 35,000 e-mails.  </p><p>  In the early stages of the process students who had applied early submitted complete packs.  As we moved towards the closing date of 31 August, it was noticeable that a number of the packs from later applicants were incomplete.  By incomplete I mean, for example, a failure to sign the declaration form or the final course acceptance form; submitting income details for the wrong year; only submitting supporting documents for part of the year; students under the age of 23 years failing to supply parent information.  </p><p>  We had been assessing packs at the rate of 800 a day, which figure then increased to 1,300.  By the end of next week it will be 1,900 a day.  These are the numbers of submitted documents being assessed.  At the assessment stage of the process, we are assessing 750 packs a day but want to move to 1,150 a day.  The system is working, but we need it to work faster.  We have taken a number of measures to make the process work faster.  We have scaled up the staffing of the support desk, in line with the volume of calls received.  At support and review stage, staff numbers have been increased from 39 to 79.  We have assigned more staff to the assessment unit.  At assessment and payment stage, the number of staff has been increased from 55 to 96, with ten further staff due to start next Monday.  We have increased text and e-mail communications to encourage those whose responses are awaited to contact us and provide the correct documentation.  We are making reminder telephone calls to students to request that they submit their final course acceptance form.  We have posted the ten top reasons for incomplete documentation packs.  These include reminders to supply the long form birth certificate and a copy of a passport must be certified by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a Commissioner for Oaths.  We have a representative on <i>boards.ie</i> to address issues raised by applicants through this forum.</p><p>  SUSI has taken the following measures to speed up the process for the next academic year: we have agreed with the CAO that students may opt in to allow it to pass course details to SUSI.  We are working with the Revenue Commissioners to explore methods of data sharing, particularly P21 details.  These discussions are at an advanced stage.  We are in early stage discussions with the Department of Social Protection to explore the issue of access to social welfare payment data.  We will continue to expand the SUSI information campaign which, to date, has included working with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, the Union of Students of Ireland and the citizens information service centres to enable them to assist students in the process.</p> <p>We will continue and expand the SUSI information campaign which to date has included working with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, the Union of Students of Ireland and the Citizens Information Service centres to enable them to assist students with the process.  We have also developed a tutorial for schools.   We will put in place a tracking system for the next academic year in order that students can monitor exactly at what stage their applications are in the process.</p><p> To get a student grant, students and their families go through a very complex process involving a stringent means test that has 15 different financial indicators.  Students must also provide proofs, for example, details of their nationality, proof they are resident in this country, proof of independence if they are not living at home and proof of previous education.  We need to get the message out that a student when applying for a grant must supply all the documents requested in one go.  The measures already taken will ensure the system will work further.  This is not simply a grant, it is a means-tested grant.  It is a complex process.  We want to help the students get through the process and to get the documents back to us as soon as possible in order that we can access their grant application.  We want to pay the students as soon as possible.  The system is working and we will make it work faster.  All the measures we have listed will be taken and implemented by next year and that will make a huge difference to the future student grant experience.</p></speech>

It is at crisis stage in that 46,000 students have not been told yet whether they will be awarded a grant and only a small percentage of those would have been paid.  How many students have been paid their grant at this stage?  I do not have to tell Ms Stewart or her team the trouble and hardship this is causing for students across the country.  Ms Stewart outlined that SUSI has dealt with 175,000 telephone calls in the recent period.  She and her team more than anyone else will be aware of the stresses students and their families are under from not being able to get their grants yet.</p><p>  Unfortunately, a new system has been set up replacing the job of work that was previously done by 66 authorities, 33 VECs and 33 county councils, and this work has now been given to one national organisation to do centrally.  My party and I do not have a problem with the centralisation of this system, however, we have a very serious problem with how the Minister has gone about doing it in conjunction with SUSI and about delivering it.  Unfortunately, many students now face Christmas still not knowing whether they will be awarded a grant and based on the evidence before us many of those students will not be paid their grant until into the new year.  </p><p>  Ms Stewart outlined that 20,000 applications are complete at award stage and she might break that down.  She also outlined that 25,000 are being processed.  Previous answers given by the Minister indicated that those being processed are just starting to be checked to see if information is missing.  Also, in replies to questions tabled by myself and other Deputies, we have been told that the expectation is that 40% of those packs will be returned to students as incomplete.  Those students who have not yet been told their documentation is incomplete have to wait to hear from that from SUSI and then send the information back to SUSI and we are only five weeks from Christmas.  SUSI is awaiting documentation packs back from 20,000 students.  I know from dealing with students that in many cases they have sent in the information but it has been lost and they have been told by SUSI that it has been lost.  Despite sending in the full information the first time they were asked for it, they have been asked to send the complete packs back in again because their information has not been found or SUSI did not keep a proper record of it.  That is a very serious issue and I am sure other Deputies will have similar accounts.    </p><p>  Ms Stewart mentioned that SUSI had been processing packs at the rate of 800 a day and that this has increased to 1,300 a day.  I would question that because the figure we were given for the number of applications processed two weeks ago was 18,000 and the figure Ms Stewart has given us today is 20,350.  That means that only an additional 2,350 were processed in a period of two weeks.  I do not see how the rate she gave us can be the case.</p><p>  She might outline the way the number of staff was increased from when SUSI was set up in June to now.  She told us that at the support and review stage the number of staff has increased 39 to 79.</p></speech>

Any responses we have had from the Minister on this have indicated that SUSI has a staff of 65 and that it would be increased to 85.  The Minister does not seem to know how many staff are working in SUSI.  I heard him say on a radio programme this morning that he does not fully understand why the grants process is where it is at.  How much engagement has Ms Stewart had with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in recent weeks?  Has he met her or how many times has he been in touch with her to check how this process is moving along and what exactly is happening?</p></speech>

Ms Stewart said twice during her presentation that the system is working.  That is simply not true and that is not only my opinion.  I have received tens of e-mails from students over the weekend who would also be of the view that the system is not working.  Some of the issues students have raised with us include a student who is attending college 155 km from their residence yet only receives an adjacent grant rather than a non-adjacent grant.  That is not the only instance of that issue that has been raised with us.  Some students who have had their grants processed are now appealing those decisions because they believe the grant that was awarded was not the correct grant.  Can Ms Stewart indicate the number of appeals that have been submitted to date?</p><p>  When SUSI first raised the issue of the backlog with the Department what was its response?  Did Ms Stewart ask for additional resources to be put in place to deal with the backlog and, if so, what was the response?  Did SUSI get all the additional resources sought and, if not, was there a reason it did not get them?  Is Ms Stewart satisfied with the numbers working in SUSI?  As Deputy McConalogue said, there is a difference between the numbers Ms Stewart has given us and the numbers the Minister has stated in the past number of days.  Ms Stewart is talking about 96 and 79 staff which is nearly 180 staff and we are being told that the number has increased to 85.  I would like to know which figure is correct.  Are the figures Ms Stewart gave us correct or is the Minister mistaken about the number who are working in SUSI?  </p><p>  Can Ms Stewart give us some background to what happens to the packs when they are sent off?  Is it true they are sent to an outside company which compiles them, uploads them on to a computer file from which they are then sent back to SUSI?  The information we have is that the SUSI office is a paperless one, that no documentation goes to SUSI and that it goes to an outside agency, and that is where the documentation is being lost.  I have received an e-mail from an individual indicating that when their original documents were sent back they included documentation belonging to a different student, a birth certificate of another student, which that student then returned to SUSI.  I would certainly disagree with Ms Stewart's statement that the system is working.  </p> <p>It is clear that the system is not working.  I want to know what the City of Dublin VEC and the Department have done to try to ensure that every application currently awaiting processing will be dealt with in time.  The indication is that the backlog will be addressed before Christmas.  I would also like information on the number of appeals that have been made on decisions taken to date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012111300004#C00200"><p>Like Deputy O'Brien I was surprised by the statement that the system is working when it demonstrably is not.  I do not wish to be smart about it but I expected an acknowledgement or apology to the students and families who are enduring monumental hardship as a result of the flaws in the system.  It is not a matter of dispute.  The impression being given was that somehow this was the fault of the students who were not capable of filling out forms.  I know from my dealings with local authority grants over a long period that it can be the case that forms are incorrectly filled out but we all received much correspondence from people who seem perfectly competent and who stated that they did send in all their documentation.  I refer to people who were able to get their leaving certificate and get into college and parents who have done it before and can read and fill out a form.  They said they did send documents and that the delay in the process was at the SUSI end.</p><p>  What investigations have been made?  There seems to be a litany of missing documentation.  Is there a flaw in the system in that regard?  How is the issue of missing documents being addressed?  One issue that emerged from the correspondence is that four or five months after an application was made an applicant would be asked for a final course acceptance form.  I presume that is an additional document but people did not know about it.  Prior to submitting applications people specifically inquired as to whether all the documentation was present and they were told that everything was in order, but later in the day further documentation was sought.  What is the correct system?</p><p>  We acknowledge that it is a new system but it has not come out of the blue.  It was years in the making.  We know approximately how many people will seek grants.  It is not the case that some strange phenomenon emerged in the course of the year.  Those issues should have been anticipated.  It seems to me that a complicated process was adopted.  Why is the City of Dublin VEC only going to Revenue now?  The grant is means-tested.  It is public money and the public has a right to know it is going to deserving cases, but much of the information that is being sought is with Revenue anyway.  We heard a story about a person from Waterford dropping out of college because of what he was put through in terms of looking for a profit and loss statement for his parents who have a small farm income even though the tax authorities and the tax assessment would have provided the information.  He had to employ an accountant to do ridiculous profit and loss statements.  That just seems completely unnecessary.</p><p>  A number of people who endured the hardship got the grant only to find that it was wrong.  I received five or six e-mails from people on the matter and I presume far more than that were affected.  Those applications are now back in the pile of applications that still has not been processed.  How many people have submitted appeals and what is the appeals process?  There appears to be some confusion.  If someone is clearly getting the non-adjacent level but the mileage is obviously on the wrong rate, I presume that is an error that could be corrected that does not require a major appeal.  What is the attitude of the witnesses to that?</p><p>  I have a problem with what has been said about the plans for dealing with the backlog.  A total of 29 working days remain between now and Christmas, including today.  Even if we were to accept the figure of dealing with 750 applications per day that would give a total of 21,000 perfect applications.  If we go on the upgraded estimate of a target of 1,100 applications per day, one would reach a total of 30,000.  It is an impossible aim.  Based on the plans that are currently in place the majority of cases will not be processed prior to Christmas.  I would like a response in that regard, in addition to the number of staff involved because I am unclear about it.</p></speech>

It is my first time as a recently appointed member of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to meet members of the City of Dublin VEC.  I admire so many initiatives provided by the VEC, not least adult education and post-leaving certificate courses.</p><p>  I too very much welcome the decision of the Minister for Education and Skills to centralise the process, which in theory is something to be acknowledged.  However, concern and anxiety have been expressed about the fact that the system is not working.  I would like clarification to be provided on some of the figures that were mentioned.  If I am not mistaken the chief executive referred to 56,000 applications.  I thought the figure was 66,000.  My understanding is that 9,000 applications were refused.  Is that a different 9,000 to those that were received since the closing date or does it refer to another 9,000 applications?</p><p>  Much anxiety and uncertainty has been caused where applications have not been processed or documentation has been mislaid but there are consequences for students who, for example, cannot get accommodation or access to equipment, laboratories or libraries.</p><p>  I very much welcome the announcement of the increase in staffing from 55 to 96, which will be of great assistance.  What was the process that led to the outsourcing and how was the contract awarded?  Was the decision based on the provider&rsquo;s capacity to deliver, cost or other criteria?</p></speech>

The large majority of them are being checked for the second or third time.  They were returned because the checklist did not come in complete more than once, which will mean that it will be possible to do the check more quickly on this occasion as we will simply be checking for the one or two pieces of documentation that are still outstanding and those applications will move up to us more quickly than applications requiring initial assessment.</p><p>  A total of 5,600 packs are with us at the moment having gone through a complete document validation and they are ready for us to assess and move them on to final award or refusal stage.  In addition, we have 5,250 new applications.  We received approximately 10,000 applications after the closing date and 5,000 of those remain to be provisionally assessed.  That accounts for the packs on-hand.</p><p>  A total of 20,500 packs are still awaiting supporting documentation; 14,500 of those applicants have not yet responded to us with any documentation and another 6,000 are back with the students because they were submitted to us incomplete.  We have requested the students to send in the additional information.</p><p>  I will answer Deputy Keating&rsquo;s question on the applications that are completed and at award stage.  The 9,500 applications that were refused is the total number of applications refused to date since the scheme opened.  Awards or awards pending subject to final course details have been made in 11,000 cases.</p></speech>

That is why it is not part of the initial completed documentation requirement.  Currently, because of the time period we are in, we ask students for the documentation plus the final course acceptance.  I will ask Mr. Prizeman to talk about the staffing.</p></speech>

That figure breaks down to 57 core staff, and the balance would be temporary staff brought in at peak times.  That refers only to the staff assessing the documentation packs and paying students.  There is a different staff quota for the contact centre and the document packs.  The documents come in and we check the document packs, therefore, that is 27 whole-time equivalents.  The picture for a full year is actually 92 whole-time equivalents but there are peaks of staff at different times.  There are peaks in August, September and October.  As of next week there will be 175 staff in total, which is 96 in the head office of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, and 79 in the contact centre and the document centre.  It is a ramping up of staff.  There were three people in the contact centre when it opened in February to give students the data about grants.  As the months pass that number increases with the peaks of applications.  We now have 175 people in total dealing with grants.  As the peaks subside, that level will drop again.  It will go up and down depending on peaks but overall the figure is 92 whole-time equivalents in terms of everybody doing the applications.  That includes the contact centre, the document management centre and the assessment unit.</p></speech>

It was a European tender under a process called competitive dialogue.  That is a process whereby a tender is put out across Europe and companies are invited to express their interest in providing the service requested, namely, the contact centre and document management.  We received a number of expressions of interest.  They were evaluated and five were invited to proceed to the next stage in the competitive dialogue process.  That involves meeting with the companies to discuss the issues around the process to allow them get a sense of what is required in terms of the service we wish them to provide.  It was a lengthy process.  A number of different specialists and consultants were brought in to help deliberate on the process.  We would have evaluated across costs, quality, previous experience, and capacity of the company to provide the service.  That would have been evaluated and the final contract awarded.</p></speech>

We are doing a weekly payment run and the process is that when a student is awarded, the college must be informed and confirm that the student has started.  A weekly file goes out to each college.  Currently, there is approximately 250, and they confirm that the student is registered in the college.  A person cannot get paid until that is done.  Also, the student must enter his or her bank details on-line.  For data protection reasons we do not ask for the bank details from the student up-front until we know the person will be awarded.  When students are awarded the grant they enter their bank details on-line, the college confirms that they are registered, and the payment is made.  Currently, we are doing a weekly payment for that.</p></speech>

I attended a students' union meeting last night in Athlone at which a great deal of anger was vented.</p> <p>The SUSI system is a bureaucratic nightmare and is at the heart of the delay.   Why were the experienced personnel in the local authorities and VECs not called in to deal with this crisis?  They had been administering applications for a number of years and could have offered assistance in this area. </p><p> The only solution is to set up a one-stop shop in every third level college to deal with the crisis.  Students are finding it impossible to make ends meet and are in arrears with their rent and book fees.  A considerable number of students are dropping out of college because of the delay.  In a progressive or civilised society, we cannot continue to allow this to happen.  It is shameful and wrong.  The body set up to deal with the grants was not ready to deal with the avalanche of applications.</p><p> A certain student told me her application had been sanctioned for payment on 14 October, yet no money has gone into her account.  I checked this with her this morning.  It is not good enough.  Another student who applied in August was told everything was okay when she rang up.  She rang again in September but the officials wanted further information stipulating whether her father had a private pension.  The girl said he had not got one.  She was told she had to put this in writing and revert to SUSI.  She rang several times since then, without any success.  Why should this be happening to students?  They would love to get on with their studies rather than deal with their grant applications.</p></speech>

I will not reiterate what was said.  My constituency office finds it very hard to get through to SUSI.  Is there a special number that Members can ring?  They cannot get through at present.</p><p>  My eldest child started college in Maynooth this year.  Many students who have no grants yet cannot enter the library and use many of the amenities on the campus.  One must have a card but if one does not have a grant, one cannot obtain one.  Next year, no cash whatsoever will be exchanged on the campus and only cards will be used.  Therefore, we must get our house in order.  This is very serious.  We must examine the longer-term implications.</p><p>  Consider the case of the son of a lady who came to my constituency office yesterday.  Somebody rang the lady last Friday to state somebody down the country has the same PPS number as her son, thus delaying the processing of his grant application.  We checked this and discovered it was totally untrue.  Are excuses being made to stem the tide?  When we discovered there was no duplicated PPS number and that the young man was genuine, we could not get through to SUSI.  Are major excuses being made to try to curtail the backlog?</p></speech>

To echo what Deputy O'Brien said, the statement that worried me most this morning was that the system is working.  It clearly is not.  Does the delegation not accept this?  Does it acknowledge the considerable distress and hardship experienced by applicants?  As Deputy Daly and others said, SUSI should apologise to the applicants.  If the delegation acknowledges that the system is not working, there will be some hope of having it fixed.  Until then, there will be none.</p><p>  If documents are not being lost, why are applicants asked repeatedly for documentation they have already submitted?  I do not refer to the seeking of further information.  There are many examples of what I describe in my constituency and I am sure the other Members have examples also.</p><p>  What is the nature of the telephone system?  What is the average time for which one must wait when one telephones about an application?  Am I correct in stating one person might have had to wait for 26 minutes only to be given a very unclear message, the only audible part of which relayed him back to the online system and referred to SUSI's e-mail address?  What does SUSI intend to do about staffing?  What is the current staffing level?  What new staff will be put in place and what is the timeframe be for the arrangements?</p><p>  Considering that the system is largely online, it is absolutely unbelievable that people cannot scan documentation and e-mail it to SUSI.  We tried to do so through our office but were told to put the documentation in the post.  It is like a pub not selling drink.  If SUSI cannot accept scanned documentation in the same way that Departments and other online application facilities do, it is unbelievable, especially in this day and age.  I would like answers to these questions and I would like the delegation to consider acknowledging that the system is not working.</p></speech>

I will be brief because many of the points I wanted to raise have already been made.  Moving from 66 awarding bodies to one was always going to be problematic.  It was always the case that there would be teething problems.  Nobody has a difficulty with that but most members did not expect so many problems.  Members throughout the country are inundated with representations from exasperated applicants.</p><p>  What message does the delegation have for those students who are considering dropping out?  I received a communication from a gentleman who told me he has already dropped out of his course because of the delay in processing his application.  What message can SUSI give directly to students or the third level colleges on the issue of dropping out?  I do not want it on my conscience, nor do the delegates want it on theirs, that somebody's educational potential will be limited because of a glitch in the SUSI system.  Nobody wants to stand over that.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we must go through a process, and that is proving difficult.  However, I do not want any student to drop out or any student who is entitled to a grant not to receive it.  I cannot say that more sincerely than I am actually saying it.</p><p>  We have a process in place.  Deputy Bannon raised the issue of local information.  The staff in the citizen information centres were trained and we worked with local guidance counsellors in the schools to ensure that, in so far as it was possible, we were providing the relevant information.  Of course, I believe we could do this better.  We have learned a considerable amount from this.  We produced a video on YouTube to bring people through the process.  We underestimated the complexity of the kinds of details required.</p><p>  Consider the question on the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  All sorts of legal issues arise with regard to data protection.  With regard to the CAO, it would take 18 months for us to be able to gain access to the documentation, and for the student to give permission for his or her information to be released.  We must be really careful to honour the arrangement in place and to ensure we are not releasing information that we should not release and that we do not receive information that should not be released to us.  However, we do want to award grants and are doing the best we can at this stage to ensure that.</p><p>  We have already talked about how we increased the number of staff working on the backlog.  In the initial stages, there was a return rate of 56%.  There are still a number of people in the system in respect of whom documentation was sent back on a number of occasions because it was incomplete.</p> <p>The amount of money involved in this is &euro;350 million, which is what grants cost in this country.  We must get the documentation right for next year.  Again, I cannot emphasise this enough and I will give members a practical example.  One issue we have pertains to P60 and P21 forms.  People give us a P60 form but when one examines the P21 form, it transpires there is other income and we have to go back for that.  We must go back for information like that all the time.  I visited Abtran and went through the process from beginning to end.  It is written on the flap of one envelope, "Please ensure you have signed the declaration".  On opening the first one, the declaration was not signed.  We must be much better at getting the message out but I do not want any student to leave college or to be in a position in which he or she is obliged to do so.</p></speech>

We take a record of each telephone call we get and of the response we have given.  In Abtran, each telephone call is recorded.  One issue raised by Deputy Griffin that I missed, for which I apologise, pertains to someone waiting for 26 minutes.  We are conscious that there are peak times, such as, for example, 12.45 p.m. to 1 p.m.  There is a system in place in Abtran whereby on telephoning, one is informed that if one leaves one's telephone number, a representative will come back to one and consequently, one is not obliged to wait in a queue for a long time.</p></speech>

I can revert to the Deputy, in order, after everyone has had his or her chance.  I now call Senator Moloney.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012111300007#F06200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  While I acknowledge they are coming under fire, that is the job to which they signed up, like the rest of us present, and the questions must be asked.  I must take issue with the witnesses with regard to the loss of documents and the statement that SUSI has received one complaint.  A number of people approached me stating they had submitted all their documents but that two full months after so doing, they received a letter requesting precisely the same items they had sent in previously.  The person concerned had actually registered her pack, as had a number of her friends, and they approached me together with their registered letter slips.  I spent an entire morning tracking those registered letters, only to find they went to Dublin and were redirected to Abtran in Cork.  The last place I could find a record of them was in the sorting office in Cork.  I was then obliged to approach the postmaster to track them to this company Abtran, where they were signed for by an individual.  Obviously, one cannot give names at this meeting.  I rang SUSI, which, I am sorry to be obliged to say, was most unhelpful.  First, its representatives would not speak to me.  I deal with housing grants, medical cards, agricultural grants and social welfare payments, and every office I contact will speak to me as a public representative, with the exception of SUSI.  Its representative stated he could not speak to me, whereupon I asked to speak to his supervisor.  Eventually, after arguing on the telephone - as Ms Stewart has stated, the conversation is recorded and she should go back and listen to it - I got to speak to a supervisor, whom I also will not name, as members are not allowed to use names.  The supervisor also was most unhelpful and kept telling me to tell the student to send in the application again.</p><p>  This is not good enough in the case of people who have sent in all their documentation, have registered them to ensure they got there and who have them signed for by an individual.  Those documents got to SUSI, which lost them and there are no two ways about it.  This simply is not good enough.  I acknowledge the application form suggests the applicants should photocopy everything, but human nature being the way it is, many people put original documents into an envelope without having photocopied them.  They are now running around trying to find P21 forms again  Incidentally, P60 forms cannot be reissued as they can only be issued once.  Consequently, people are in an awful state.</p><p>  I have a few other points to make.  As for the self-employed people who sent in their self-assessments and their notice of assessment from the tax office, this is not good enough for SUSI.  It now seeks a letter from their accountants stating they are self-employed.  I cannot understand this as it is quite evident that they are self-employed, yet this is not good enough.  Moreover, I have encountered cases of students who are pulling out of college.  While I acknowledge Ms Stewart will state the authority does not wish them to do that - of course it does not - SUSI should try to hurry up the process for such individuals because they will pull out.</p></speech>

I have to hand the e-mails I received over the weekend.  I did not need them because I have enough from the constituency in which I live without receiving others from throughout the country, as I am sure did everyone else.  In one e-mail, a lady wrote to state SUSI does not come under the remit of the Ombudsman.  Is this true?  If not, I seek the reason.  Someone mentioned a person who was obliged to hang on the telephone for 26 minutes.  Most students use mobile phones and if one is obliged to wait on a mobile phone for 26 minutes, I can guarantee most such students would be out of credit by that time.</p></speech>

It is disappointing, however, we do not have any Department officials or the Minister here which is a matter the committee should consider.  The questions about students&rsquo; access to services, sitting examinations at Christmas and submitting projects can only be answered by the Minister.  It is not the job of SUSI to answer these questions.  I have had telephone calls and e-mails about students dropping out because they cannot submit projects due this week.  The committee needs to call in the Department, the Higher Education Authority and the institutes of technology to sort out how this is causing distress to students as it appears it will continue for several weeks.</p><p>  In theory the centralised system is good and City of Dublin VEC is the right organisation to run it as it has a good track record in this area.  My concern is that from the very start it was not given the resources it needed to properly process these claims.  This is evident from the fact staffing levels have changed several times since this started.  Ms Stewart informed the committee how many extra staff she has been given.  How many did she ask for?  How many staff does SUSI need to ensure every application is decided on by Christmas?  As Deputy Clare Daly pointed out, on SUSI&rsquo;s best estimate there will still be thousands of students who will not have a grant by Christmas.  It is important the committee is given the information it needs to put pressure on a cross-party basis on the Department to ensure SUSI is given the staff it needs to sort out this mess.</p><p>  The delegation pointed out that there is only one formal complaint of lost documents.  I have had several complaints to my office about documents being lost in the system.  Is this an issue with quality checking with the external provider?  I appreciate quality analysis was part of the original tender.  What quality monitoring process is in place now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1013" speakername="Brendan  Ryan" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012111300008#G00200"><p>I thank Ms Stewart for her presentation.  The delays in the grant application process are not new.  However, SUSI was put in place to sort out these delays.  In a short period of its existence, the agency is already in crisis management mode which is totally unacceptable.  I am not going to focus on what is being done to sort out the problems.  I believe Ms Stewart will sort them out as she has outlined what she is trying to do in that regard.</p><p>  Instead, I want to focus on the preparations for the major task City of Dublin VEC took on.  It clearly wanted it and pitched for the tender.  How did it prepare for it?  It clearly underestimated the task involved and put insufficient resources behind it.  Was a project planning team put in place?  If so, were the right people on the team?  Were widely used project-planning principles followed?  In my view, there was a complete failure on the part of City of Dublin VEC to plan properly for this task it took on.  It had experience in this area already and would have known the pattern and behaviour of student applications, so there is no excuse.  Does the City of Dublin VEC understand what went wrong and how it failed to plan properly for this task?</p></speech>

That pack goes back to a PO box for Abtran in Cork.  The post is sent to a secure postal room and is then scanned.  Currently, it is being scanned every day.  In early September, there was a delay of three days before it was scanned because of the volume of documents.  Every piece of documentation that comes in is scanned.</p><p>  It then goes into a merging queue.  The scanner picks up the application number which is then merged with the person&rsquo;s application.  When we investigated claims of lost documents, we checked it with Abtran to discover the documents were scanned but the system did not know they were for that three-day period until they were merged into the system.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.385" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Prizeman" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012111300008#G00600"><p>We can look at the separate case the Senator raised.  However, there has been only one case so far in which the documents have not been tracked which could be because they were not delivered in the first place.  We are investigating that one case.</p><p>  I do not believe documentation is being lost.  It is being scanned and merged with the application.  For example, take the case of a student being asked for 15-piece documentation.  When it is scanned in, it is then merged and an assessor checks to see the 15-piece documentation is all there.  If some of the requested supporting documents are not there, a letter is generated to the student requesting them.  A student may think it was submitted but it may not have been.  I guarantee every piece of documentation received is scanned into the system.  We have sent out 20,000 requests for full and complete packs.  Back in September, when the packs were beginning to be returned, up to 56% of them were not complete.  One could see on the system a tick for, say, two items requested and how two other requested items were not ticked.  We would then recheck it to see if the items were missed in the scanning or not included.</p><p>  In the first week when the packs started to come in, they were running at 100% accuracy.  After the CAO offers on 15 September, the majority of packs started coming in and it got worse.  Sending in incomplete applications may have been just students wanting to get something back to SUSI.  It is probably our fault that the message sent out to students and their parents that the packs have to be complete was not strong enough.  We need to get the message out clearly next year that all documentation needs to come back in one go to speed up the process.</p> <p> We will look at any case the committee is concerned about, track it down and see the exact position.</p></speech>

The requirement for documentation to be signed by an accountant or solicitor has been pointed out as a problem for those who might not have an accountant or solicitor because they are on low incomes.  They may be self-employed but may not have any money coming in.</p><p>  Senator Power asked about the use of facilities.  She also raised the matter of resources.</p></speech>

In the main, if someone is self-employed we seek a notice of assessment and a copy of the accounts that he or she lodged in order to obtain that notice of assessment.  That is the standard documentation for which we ask.  As Mr. Prizeman stated, if there are questions about an individual case we would be happy to look into it.  However, the normal documentation requested of the self-employed consists of the notice of assessment and the accounts submitted.</p></speech>

We looked at a number of models of centralised systems.  This is one of the developments that is taking place with regard to grants.  In particular, we examined the Scottish awards system.  We spoke to and consulted with bodies such as the Union of Students in Ireland, Institutes of Technology Ireland, the universities, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  As the committee will be aware, we have much experience over a long period of awarding grants in Dublin city.  We had an online system in place in Dublin city for the past two years - a practice run, if you like.  We also had a group working on that who were planning and putting a structure in place.  We went into a great deal of detail.  We produced training manuals.  We produced detailed documentation on Abtran.  We have a service level agreement with it which specifies what we expect to happen at various stages of the process.  We had expectations of how the documentation would come in at various stages, what would happen at each stage and how it would be dealt with.</p></speech>

Around 11,000 or 12,000 application packs did not come back last year, and we are finding the same this year.  It is historical.  Every year a certain percentage of applications do not come back.  At present, there are between 13,000 and 15,000 applications that will probably never come back into the system and, historically, never have come back.  The online system probably made it a little easier for students to apply.  The process of online application might take 15 minutes.  We will find that approximately 15,000 applicants will not come back into the process.  After applying online, they receive their packs, they realise their incomes are over the limit and they do not take it any further.  Historically, there is a percentage of applicants who never complete their applications.</p></speech>

Of the 66,000 applications, what is the expected total number of awards?  We need to know the total in order to know the percentage of the total that will be made by 21 December.</p><p>  Almost half of all applications processed have been refused.  In response to a Topical Issue in the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government stated that she expected 35,000 of the 66,000 applicants to be successful.  If that is the case, it means that 30,000 will be unsuccessful.  There is a big issue in this regard.  If many of those who have applied are simply waiting to be told they will not get a grant, that means they will have to come up with the money to pay their student registration fees themselves.  Many of them have persevered while awaiting the grant and they will be waiting a long time to get a negative answer, quite possibly leaving their futures in college in jeopardy.</p><p>  On a final point, the witnesses might clarify whether the Ombudsman's remit covers SUSI.</p></speech>

There are students who are now getting letters from their colleges asking for late fees because they have not been able to pay the charges.  There are students who are being denied access to libraries.  We have an e-mail from one student who, because he or she was denied access to a laboratory, was unable to hand in a project on time and is being penalised.</p><p>  Mr. Prizeman's statement that documentation has not been lost simply does not correspond with what we are hearing from students.  It is incredible that only one complaint has been issued.  I do not accept that figure.  SUSI gave a guarantee that every piece of documentation is scanned when it is received by the company in Cork.  How does SUSI know that is the case?  What checks has it put in place to ensure this happens?</p> <p>SUSI is relying on the assurance of an outside agency that the documents are not being lost.  What procedures has it put in place to ensure that is the case?  The information we have received at this meeting does not tally with the information we have received from hundreds of students.  Somebody is making a mistake and SUSI may have been misinformed by the company that is scanning the documents.</p><p> Students who live 150 km from their colleges are receiving the wrong grants.  Can we be given figures for the number of cases that have gone to review rather than appeal?  I am particularly interested in cases relating to adjacency and non-adjacency.</p><p> I again ask the witnesses to acknowledge that the system is not working.  That will not do anything to help those students who are still waiting but at least we would have an admission of the problem by SUSI.</p></speech>

How many personnel did Ms Stewart request from the Department to clear the backlog?  Have additional personnel and resources been put in place?  I do not want an answer on the increased numbers.  I want to know if SUSI asked for a specific number of personnel to clear the backlog by December and, if so, whether the request was granted.</p></speech>

It is argued that 30,000 applications can be processed by 31 December.  This leaves a large number of students in their current predicament.  It is not good enough.  What does SUSI need to clear the backlog more quickly?</p><p>  Other speakers have referred to Deputies' having access to telephone helplines for medical cards and social welfare.  Would it be useful to establish a one-stop shop in colleges to deal with issues with applications?  It should not be up to Deputies to deal with the problems arising.  The colleges should be able to work with SUSI so that a student can walk in and get help.  A student from my area was told to send in his file and acceptance form on 24 September, and he did so only to be told his application was still at review stage.  There appears to be a breakdown between what students are told and what is happening.  If we do not see improvements quickly we will see some very angry students on the streets.</p></speech>

I am not being smart when I say that the huge human cost has not been adequately acknowledged.  Ms Stewart has acknowledged that the proposed solution will not alleviate the problem for at least 10,000 students.  We will have a problem leaving this meeting, although it is nothing compared to the students who cannot sit their exams, go to the library or pay rent.  We need some form of emergency action.</p><p>  The proofs demanded from people are like a bureaucratic fetish.  Is there any way in which we can simplify the procedure?  If, for example, somebody can provide a tax assessment, why does he or she need to draw up a profit and loss statement to prove he or she did not earn money on a little bit of land?  It should not be necessary if the information is already available from the Revenue Commissioners.  It is not good enough to acknowledge that people will be left hanging.</p><p>  If staffing is the answer, I ask Ms Stewart to quantify her resource requirement.  Perhaps we will need to meet the Minister for Education and Skills or officials from his Department to discuss emergency measures, because it clear that the colleges will have to be dealt with so that the students who are being treated as second-class citizens through no fault of their own can be allowed to continue their education while this mess is being sorted.</p></speech>

I understand that SUSI has not yet put a system in place, which is a big gap.  Will Ms Stewart consider putting such a system in place so that student union welfare officers can assist students?  Will she ensure that more information is given out over helplines?  The usual reply I receive to inquiries is that SUSI has issued a response to the student concerned, which is not particularly helpful because I am then required to get back in touch with the student to identify the gaps.  If SUSI is going to deal with public representatives it must be able to provide an adequate amount of information.</p></speech>

I raised this issue in the D&aacute;il last month and I am glad to see that some of the issues have been addressed.  I understand the appeals system has been outsourced to somebody in Cork.  How many records have been lost?  When I contacted SUSI in regard to one student who had appealed, there was no record of his appeal.  The student had proof of postage but he had to resend his details.</p><p>  Are late applications a major problem?  Some students may not have been offered courses until the beginning of September, which means their applications will be arriving late.  Can anything be done to help SUSI to deliver this service?  Finally, what will it do differently next year?</p></speech>

What percentage of people are not proceeding with their applications?  I take it that 99% applied online.  SUSI has an e-mail address for all of them.  It is a simple matter to send them an e-mail asking them whether they intend to proceed with their application.  If they say "No", they can be ruled out and SUSI can start work on the others.</p><p>  Since students are not fully registered in college, as well as all the problems pointed out, there is a knock-on effect.  If one is applying for social welfare payments, one needs the application stamped by the college to say one is registered to get a social welfare payment.

Does a letter issue to students that they can show college administrators confirming they have made a grant application in order that they can use the facilities?</p><p>  When people make tax returns online, only digital copies are available, yet the students are asked for original documents from Revenue.  Will Ms Stewart clarify the position on that?</p><p>  I refer to the Deputy Griffin's question about applications being processed by Christmas.  Will applications be outstanding at that stage?  Ms Stewart said earlier that she believed that of the applications received, 15,000 will not proceed because the applicants have probably realised they are not eligible when they were asked for documentation.  How many applications will remain to be assessed after Christmas?  Did SUSI consult VECs and local authorities around the country about potential pitfalls?  I acknowledge CDVEC did this.</p></speech>

Historically, 35,000 new applications were awarded every year.  While we have 66,000 applicants, 35,000 will receive a new award this year.  Based on the current trend, another 13,000 will be refused and as the chief executive officer pointed out, approximately 15,000 do not complete the grant application.  We will still be looking at possibly 5,000 applications after Christmas.  The majority will be applications we received after the closing date, which was approximately 10,000.  We have provisionally assessed 5,000 of those and have moved them through the system and we will work on the remaining 5,000 as we move towards the end of the year and the start of the new year.</p></speech>

In 2010, the grants online system went live for 11 awarding authorities.  At that stage, the student got a rough guide of what documentation was required and we found that, because we had used e-mail, the student did not return the documentation.  Historically, many parents deal with the applications on behalf of students and, therefore, the decision was made that it would make the system straightforward to send out a pack to the student through which they would be asked for the documentation required and told in the appendix where to get it.  It is a three to five-year project and we hope to get rid of much of the documentation by year five but it will take time to do that.  We looked at the idea of students scanning in the documentation and it is something that will potentially happen in year two or three but a great deal depends on the quality of the photocopies coming in.  Part of the job that has to be done is to darken or lighten the photocopies to make them legible.  It is a good idea for the students to be able to send in their documentation by e-mail or a format like that but there are drawbacks relating to quality.  It was looked at and it is being looked at.</p></speech>

The students and our main office are then informed by Cork VEC about the outcome of the appeal.</p></speech>

There is a real question mark over whether the closing date should be hard.  As we stated, approximately 10,000 applications were received after the closing date.  Deputy Griffin asked whether we can reduce the amount of documentation required and we can do so in a number of ways.  One way would be for students to give us permission when they are applying through the CAO to obtain the information once they are accepted onto a course.  At present, people are going to social welfare offices to obtain their social welfare documentation and then sending it to us.  It would make far more sense to have a direct link between us and the Department of Social Protection.  It would also make a huge difference if we could develop links with Revenue's online service.  It would take much of the paper out of the system and make it clearer.</p></speech>

Many people in local authorities and VECs have dealt with applications over the years and have local knowledge and expertise.  Is there a reason such people could not be placed in third level institutions to deal with stressed students?  These students could meet someone face to face who could then deal with their case.  At present people are telephoning and e-mailing.

To bring this back to my first point, if people with local knowledge were involved they would be more aware of people and would know to ask for originals.  If one asks for a photocopy of a tax clearance certificate there is no way it is 100% verifiable.  I am in the insurance business and one does not rely on photocopies and faxed documentation.  A major scam involves people using false no claims bonuses from around the world.  The issue of photocopies must be addressed.</p></speech>

From my experience I know this is a very difficult time for them because I used to be an education spokesperson and I was a lecturer in colleges.  Since last Thursday I have had 134 contacts from students.  It is the worst crisis I have seen with regard to student grants.  It reminds me of the mess when medical card applications were first centralised.</p><p>  Has the problem in administration been pinned down?  What action has been taken to rectify it?  Has contact been made with the universities and colleges?  When students contact me they tell me they were told weeks ago that the money was on the way but it has not come.  What action has been taken to intervene to save their places in college?  Some of these students do not know whether they are coming or going and it is affecting their learning.  It also puts pressure on their parents.  Some of these kids are just hanging on and we must remember they are only 18 or 19.</p><p>  This is not the first time this has happened as we have had backlogs previously and, for example, if NUI, Galway received confirmation from the student grant office the students' places would be held and they would be allowed into the library.  Have these interventions been made?  Why were students told the money was on its way when it has not yet arrived?  Is the application method web-based whereby if not all of the information is received the application cannot be processed?</p> <p>If all of the information is not being submitted, the application cannot be processed.  One third of applications are incomplete.  It is not as simple as booking a Ryanair ticket, as one needs a great deal of supporting documentation, but a method of fool-proofing the web-based process at the beginning could expedite matters.</p></speech>

Once that is done and the college confirms the student's registration, the payment will be made from the following week onwards.  We are currently paying on a weekly basis.  A process is in place - bank details must be entered and a college must confirm that a student is in attendance.  It is the last step in the puzzle.</p></speech>

This has been done since 11 June and forms part of the first assessment.  The system has been improved so that the majority of people who are going to be refused are refused up front.  They do not need to be asked to send documentation.  A question was asked about the 10,000 applicants refused.  It will be to a lesser extent from this point on, as those who are still in the system will more than likely be paid, although this depends on their courses being approved and not being at the same academic level.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee for the invitation to discuss the Estimates for my Department for 2013.  The Government&rsquo;s expenditure reform programme has provided for enhanced engagement by committees on expenditure issues and, as part of this process, I am keen to hear members' views and proposals on the difficult choices which must be made in the context of budget 2013.</p><p>  I have arranged for briefing material to be made available to the joint committee, which I hope will assist members in their deliberations.  It sets out the structure of the Department&rsquo;s Vote, both current and capital, reductions in expenditure that have had to be implemented in recent years, and the financial parameters in which we must operate in the period ahead.  I look forward to members' engagement and hearing their ideas as to how my Department should achieve its expenditure ceilings in 2013 as well as 2014 when further savings have to be made.</p><p>  In recent years, the Department has developed and maintained a strategic focus on contributing to economic recovery and employment and assisting those in need of support through the various programmes for which it has responsibility.  This has been done in the context of a sharp reduction in resources following the financial crisis that began in 2008.  Total funding for the Department&rsquo;s programmes has been reduced by slightly less than 50%, from nearly &euro;2.7 billion in 2009 to &euro;1.36 billion this year.  In tandem with reduced programme expenditure, staff numbers have declined substantially, as have the day-to-day costs of running the Department.</p><p>  Notwithstanding these reductions, the funding available to my Department remains significant and a key priority is to maximise efficiency and secure the best value from the resources available to us.  The Department continues to be the second largest capital spending Department, having spent &euro;861 million in 2012, a figure which does not take account of &euro;34 million carried forward from 2011.  Within our capital programme, expenditure on housing and water services predominates.  The Leader and EU-related programmes are also vital to achieving rural development and enhancing cross-Border co-operation, respectively.</p><p>  The current spending provision for 2012 amounts to &euro;467 million.  Achieving reductions in current expenditure is highly challenging given the non-discretionary nature of much of it.  As a result, there are major areas where unavoidable commitments arise.  These comprise the rental accommodation scheme, for which &euro;135 million has been committed, local authority housing leasing costs on existing units, for which &euro;20 million has been committed, the capital loans and subsidy scheme loan charges of &euro;71 million, departmental pay of &euro;50 million and agency pay and pensions of &euro;31 million.  These current items amount in total to &euro;307 million, with the remaining &euro;160 million of the &euro;467 million used primarily for the local and community development programme, which accounts for &euro;55 million, and accommodation for homeless people, which accounts for &euro;50 million. These two programmes are of particular importance in countering and dealing with social disadvantage.</p><p>  Capital expenditure has declined from &euro;1 billion in 2011 to an estimated &euro;861 million this year, with the bulk of the savings falling on the housing and water services programmes.</p> <p>Savings are being realised on the current side of the Vote by replacing the Exchequer contribution to the local government fund with the revenue from the household charge.  There are also other savings of the order &euro;34 million in voted current expenditure in 2012.  In addition to the Vote, the environment fund is also an important but relatively modest means of financing current spending related to environmental requirements, while the local government fund delivers vital resources to local authorities.</p><p> Turning to the years ahead, the Government, in the comprehensive review of expenditure and capital review processes in 2011, published spending ceilings for all Departments.  In the case of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, these provided that capital expenditure will fall from &euro;861 million this year to &euro;760 million in 2013.  Current expenditure will fall from &euro;467 million to &euro;416 million. The spending limits were set at &euro;558 million capital and &euro;383 million current for 2014.</p><p> In terms of planning capital programmes, the investment framework provided envelopes for investment in housing and water services in the period 2012 to 2016.  This investment amounts to in excess of &euro;3 billion in respect of the combined programmes.  The Department has a broad and diverse agenda that presents particular challenges in identifying areas for savings on the scale that is needed given the State's extraordinarily difficult financial position.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will speak about the spending pressures in the housing area.</p><p> It is vital also that we have a modern, adequately resourced water services sector which provides the critical infrastructure needed to support economic recovery, employment creation and environmental protection.  As part of this, we need to press ahead with strategic water and waste water schemes in the greater Dublin area and with the water conservation programme, responding to critical investment needs during the period of transition to Irish Water.  As the committee is aware, the programme for Government commits to a fundamental shift in the way water services are organised and funded in Ireland.  The establishment of Irish Water to take over responsibility for the delivery of water services from local authorities will require resources at an early stage to help deliver on the commitment.</p><p> Provision needs to be made for the Leader rural development programme, which achieves important economic and social objectives and facilitates take-up of EU funding.  The PEACE and INTERREG programmes, part-funded by the Department, remain key measures to promote a better future on the island of Ireland.</p><p> On capital spending, Ireland has been dealing with a substantial legacy in relation to unlicensed local authority landfills and illegal dumping sites, and significant work remains to be completed.  Given the existing European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland and to avert a referral of the case back to the court for the imposition of potentially very significant fines, it has been necessary to agree a comprehensive programme of measures that must be implemented to satisfy the terms of the judgment.  Progress in delivering on our commitments in this regard is being closely monitored by the legal services of the European Commission.</p><p> On the current side, we have unavoidable resource requirements in respect of Ireland's upcoming Presidency of the European Union.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated that additional funding will be provided as required to meet third party costs associated with the Mahon tribunal.</p><p> I hope I have a given the committee a clear outline of the challenges in 2013 and beyond and touched on the wide variety of issues which must inform consideration of Estimates as far as my Department is concerned.</p><p>I have kept my remarks brief in order that we can have a full debate on the issues across the Department's programmes.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will complement what I have said by going into more detail in her area of responsibility in housing and planning.</p></speech>

I will concentrate particularly on the housing programme.</p><p>  The significant challenges faced in the housing area within the current budgetary climate are clear to all.  Therefore, in allocating the resources likely to be available to me in 2013, I intend to continue to focus the necessary adjustments on areas where there is scope to maintain output through more flexible approaches and to continue to direct the available capital resources substantially towards the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors.</p><p>  In terms of the delivery of social housing,<b></b>the Government's housing policy statement clearly identifies that the main focus in terms of supports provided by the Government will be on meeting the most acute needs - the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources.  Meeting social housing need in the coming years will, therefore, have to involve a continuation of the transition from traditional construction and acquisition towards more flexible options such as the rental accommodation scheme and the leasing initiative.  We must tailor these supports according to the market conditions and the financial parameters in which we are working.</p><p>  The local authority capital allocation programme has been reduced to &euro;112 million in 2012.  This funding provides for the continuation of existing housing construction and acquisitions programmes, a small number of payments under the land aggregation scheme, and funding of the public safety initiative for unfinished housing developments.</p><p>  It must be recognised that, while there are existing public financial constraints, there also remains a need for local authority housing. To this end, I announced a programme of local authority house purchases and new construction starts last July.  Construction will start this year on a number of well-advanced projects, with the balance being advanced next year for completion by 2014.  I need to caution that the programme had to take account of the current financial circumstances of the country and was, therefore, a limited one.  However, we will work to ensure that the best value possible will be obtained from the funding which will be available in terms of unit cost and the number of units to be delivered.</p><p>  I am acutely aware that the issue of mortgage arrears<b></b>is one of the most pressing economic and social challenges facing the Government and the nation.  A mortgage-to-rent scheme was launched on a pilot basis and extended nationally earlier this year, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  It is just one element of the range of solutions on which the Government has been working.</p><p>  The capital assistance scheme is the main source of new housing provision for the most vulnerable, disadvantaged households and those with specific needs.  The 2012 allocation for the capital assistance scheme should support the provision, by approved housing bodies, of accommodation for households with special categories of need.</p><p>  The social housing improvement works programme spans a range of crucial Exchequer and local authority funded programmes and initiatives designed to maintain and improve the local authority housing stock of approximately 125,000 units.  My Department supports an ambitious programme of regeneration projects which seek to address the causes of disadvantage in some of the country's most disadvantaged communities through a programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  In addition, funding is also provided to estate-wide remedial-type works<b></b>and necessary adaptations and extensions to properties to meet the needs of tenants with a disability.  The ongoing importance of these programmes cannot be underestimated, not just from a social policy perspective but also in terms of the job creation and economic renewal that are delivered as part of any regeneration programme.</p><p>  The energy efficiency programme of retrofitting and improvement works across the local authority housing stock is a further example of how social interventions can also help meet economic and employment objectives. This is a highly labour intensive programme and the funding provided will facilitate the upgrading of units as well as supporting and maintaining jobs.  The improvement works programme is specifically targeting vacant dwellings and, in particular, stock that has remained vacant for a significant length of time.  Returning vacant stock to productive use is essential in order that high quality, energy efficient homes can be provided, especially in light of the current pressures on local authority housing waiting lists.  Similarly, the suite of housing adaptation grants very effectively delivers across a number of priority areas, with households benefiting from investment from the Exchequer and from local authorities' own resources.</p><p>  A commitment was given in the programme for Government to review and update the current homeless<b></b>strategy and to introduce a so-called housing-led approach to accommodating homeless people so as to offer them suitable, long-term housing in the first instance and radically reduce the use of hostel accommodation and the associated costs for the Exchequer.  Work on the review is almost complete and I intend to launch a homelessness policy statement in the coming weeks.  The statement will indicate the steps the Government intends to take and also what housing authorities and other stakeholders need to do to accelerate progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.  The statement will advocate a housing-led approach.  This is about the rapid provision of secure housing, with support as needed, to ensure sustainable tenancies.</p><p>  I have set out the broad parameters within which the 2013 Estimate in respect of housing will be framed.  I welcome the members' views on the key issues and challenges outlined.</p></speech>

I do not need to go into the detail on the differences.  As the scheme will require significant additional administration, is it intended to facilitate local authorities in that regard and, if so, has it been quantified?  I would like to know how that can be done with a reduced budget next year for dealing with homelessness because it is not obvious that the available funds will allow for anything more to be done.</p> <p> I am a little concerned about the language the Minister of State used when she stated "the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors" because that is an expanding sector.  Is there something in that language that we should understand to be different from the current position?</p></speech>

We have brought two memos to Government.  The full roll-out of it will not happen next year.  We intend to begin with a pilot phase sometime next year.  It is obviously a major change to which the Government is committed.  It involves the transfer of a large number of recipients of rent supplement to the local authorities and Deputy Catherine Murphy correctly points out that it is a big change which involves a good deal of work.</p><p>  On the financial side of it, the intention is that it will be Exchequer neutral.  In effect, it is transferring a group of recipients from one Department to another.  In terms of how it will work, there are a number of purposes.  One is that the entire cohort of those who are in need of housing support will be under the one system and there will not be one lot in one Department and the rest under the local government system.  It will be coherent and it will be easier for those involved in the system.  We also want to ensure that we can do it in a coherent way.  We want to get rid of the poverty traps that are there at present of which public representatives around this table will be well aware where recipients are afraid of losing their rent supplement if they get even part-time work.  The intention is that when it is fully implemented there will be a sliding rent scale - something similar to the differential rent system under local authorities - so that recipients will not suddenly lose their rent supplement but that they will pay in accordance with their ability to pay.</p><p>  We will introduce a pilot phase next year.  We are in ongoing discussions and there will be a further memo to Cabinet in the fairly near future.  The intention is to eliminate poverty traps and to make the system more coherent.  It will involve a payment system for those currently on rent supplement who will move to the new system that will be more appropriate in terms of a gradual increase in the amount they pay if they are able to secure employment.  No doubt it will be a better system for those involved.  However, it is a big move.  That is why, initially, we need to conduct a pilot to start off the scheme.  Bringing in the entire group in one go would be difficult for the local authorities.</p></speech>

For what it is worth, the Department would not be able to afford it because rent assistance is way out of sync with even what is being paid on the rental accommodation scheme.  However, I would like to see Kildare or a similar area being used as the pilot because that would provide a robust test given that there are particular problems such as that rents are significantly higher than the rent assistance being provided.</p></speech>

It is difficult enough to make suggestions in the absence of a full budget being available at this early stage, but I have a few questions.</p><p>  The capital expenditure on housing will fall from &euro;189 million this year to &euro;92 million in the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.  Is this amount sufficient to tackle social housing waiting lists?  Is it almost whittling away at local authorities' functions in this area by virtue of housing associations, private finance or deals with NAMA becoming sufficient to meet the challenge of social housing needs across the country?</p><p>  The Exchequer initiated a contribution at least at the start of this year of &euro;175 million to the Local Government Fund and it was replaced by a &euro;160 million contribution from the household charge.  Some &euro;110 million was collected, leaving a &euro;65 million shortfall.  Local authorities were bearing the brunt of that cut, during the course of the year and in the third quarter and fourth quarter, despite the Estimates that they had agreed earlier in the year.  The Minister has been reducing the contribution to local authorities with low household charge payments.  Will that trend continue in the context of the proposal on property tax next year?</p><p>  It has been quoted that &euro;500 million per annum will be derived from the property tax.  How much of that will go to the Local Government Fund, how much of it will be retained by the Department and how much, by a process of elimination, will go back to the Central Fund?</p><p>  How much must the Minister commit towards Irish Water next year?  There has not yet been confirmation as to the cost, for example, of metering.  When the committee met Bord G&aacute;is last week on this issue, the cost from its perspective was estimated to be &euro;450 million whereas Deputy Stanley mentioned that a report of which he had sight stated it could cost &euro;1.2 billion.  The existing cost of local authorities for maintenance of water services, based on the research that I have done, appears to be approximately &euro;600 million per annum.  There is that figure, the figure for metering which I ask the Minister to clarify and the charge to be imposed, and then one must measure that against the Minister's statement that he will have to supplement Irish Water in the coming years before it becomes self-sufficient.  At what level will the Minister supplement Irish Water?</p><p>  I have two questions on EU related programmes.  I presume a large element of such programmes are co-funded by the European Union and it would be in all our interests that they would be retained and enhanced where possible.  Can the Minister give a commitment that such will be the case in the forthcoming years?</p><p>  What co-operation has there been with the Minister's counterpart in agriculture on the CAP proposals?  Specifically, I refer to environmental issues and to the funding that may be available within that envelope of CAP.  Will such funding be retained and controlled by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or its agencies for disbursement to the relevant sectors of society?  For example, I am conscious of SACs throughout the country where REP schemes, which were to be put in place, have not been put in place.  It is my information that there is a fair-sized sum that will be available under CAP within the envelope of environment that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, could garner for the public who need this and have not had comfort in this area <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

In 2012, the Local Government Fund gave us approximately &euro;1.12 billion which was made up of the motor tax and various other receipts.  We had to take out the &euro;160 million Exchequer contribution for 2012 in the Estimates and introduce the household charge.  When it came to the third quarter of the year where people were not performing to the extent that they should and where people were advocating that they should not pay, obviously, counties were going to suffer a little in the provision of those services if the money was not coming in.</p> <p>We estimated there would be a deficit of about &euro;45 million by the end of the year.  The Department absorbed &euro;30 million, with &euro;15 million to be absorbed by the local authorities.  The Department absorbed a significant portion of the deficit which had to be found elsewhere by means of savings.</p><p> A total of &euro;830 million of savings has been achieved in the local government system since 2008.  Unfortunately, much of this saving was brought about by a reduction in staff numbers.  Local authorities are under-staffed and there is a shortage of outdoor staff.  I am very conscious that they will find it difficult to address this situation in 2013 because we have a financial ceiling imposed by the agreement with the troika.  I am not in a position to answer the questions about property tax because I have not brought proposals to Government as yet.  It will be part of the budgetary considerations.  Questions about the amount to be levied, the amount to be included in the local government fund, are matters to be teased out between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Finance, between now and the budget.  </p><p> A provision of &euro;10 million is provided to set up the structure for the establishment of Irish Water in 2013.  Legislation to set up Irish Water on an interim basis will be brought forward pending the full implementation in 2013.  The cost of metering will be paid out of a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It will not be included in the Department's Estimates as metering will be rolled out over a number of years.  </p><p> We have made some progress on the EU-related programmes-----</p></speech>

We have made progress on EU-related programmes.  I know the Deputy has an interest in the progress of the rural development programme.  We front-loaded money into the rural development programmes in the Estimates for 2013 on the basis that we can get a refund of 85% rather than a refund of 55% from the European Union.  We are getting more bang for our buck.  That is working well.  It is one of the few areas where we have money and we encourage Leader groups and communities to advance their projects.  Axis has more applications than money at the moment.</p><p>  My Department has a very good relationship with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I refer to recent announcements about the environment which take into account the bad weather conditions which affect the farming community.  We have approval to extend the slurry spreading season because animals have been housed for a large part of the summer and we did not want to cause an animal welfare issue.  We are very conscious that when putting robust systems in place it is essential to avoid causing a nitrates problem.  The negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy will include the rural development element.  As part of what is called the greening of the CAP, I hope there will be additional funding for the environmental provisions which will be administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through the AEOS, agri-environmental options scheme.</p><p>  The special areas of conservation, SAC, are a matter for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan.  This relates to funding for the turf-cutting season and there are many more restrictions other than the 53 SACs.  The question of providing alternative opportunities for people to cut for domestic purposes on different bogs is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Some progress has been made.  I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Conor Skehan who has played a leading role in bringing people together.  I hope this will be continued by Mr. S&eacute;amus Boland who has assumed the position of chairman of the Peatlands Council. </p></speech>

Unfortunately, because of the state of the country, we only have what is in hand.  The capital budget contained &euro;1.8 million in 2009; &euro;1.4 in 2010; just over &euro;1 million in 2011; &euro;895,000 in 2012 and a further reduction for next year.  We have to provide housing within that budget.  We are concentrating on housing for the most vulnerable people and regeneration is part of that policy.  I refer to other methods such as the leasing initiative for providing housing.  We also encourage the not-for-profit voluntary sector as a means of assisting with housing.  They have access to funding from donations or private capital.  We welcome any suggestions from any members of the committee and that is the purpose of our attendance at this meeting.</p></speech>

My point is about the property tax.  In some ways our discussion is surreal.  We are discussing the framing of the budget for 2013 but we have no figure for the first half of the year.  We can only assume that the tax will continue to be &euro;100 per house for eligible households.  A collection rate of 100% will garner &euro;80 million as opposed to &euro;160 million for the full year.  We have been informed that the new house tax will begin on 1 July - it has been referred to as a property tax.  We are discussing this tax but we have no indication of what the rate of the tax will be.  The troika and Ministers have said it is expected to bring in &euro;1 billion a year.  I ask the Minister to give some indication of what his Department hopes to realise from the new house tax - property tax - from 1 July to the end of December 2013.  We are discussing the budgetary process.  However, if we do not know what money is available and where it is coming from it is very difficult to have a realistic discussion.</p></speech>

If we had the figure for the second half of the year that would be useful.  It would seem that the tax will continue at &euro;100 per household up to 1 July.</p><p>  The Minister said in his opening statement that savings are being realised on current expenditure by replacing the Exchequer contributions to the local government fund with revenue from the household charge.  He stated there are also savings to the order of &euro;34 million in the voted current expenditure in 2012.  I ask him to explain where the saving of &euro;34 million was achieved.  </p><p>  I refer to the establishment of Irish Water.  Representatives of Bord G&aacute;is attended the committee last week.  I am surprised at the mention of the figure of &euro;10 million.  If the Minister will pardon the pun, it will be a drop in the ocean compared to the figures we discussed last week.  The figure of &euro;10 million seems to be very low.  The Bord G&aacute;is representatives said this would require ongoing substantial funding and subsidy from the Exchequer - from the taxpayer - as well as whatever charges are levied at the meter.  </p> <p>Will the Minister clarify what that &euro;10 million will cover?  Such an amount will not-----</p></speech>

Will he indicate whether that amount will be sufficient?</p><p>  Will the Minister comment on metering costs?  The money in this regard is being taken from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and while it will facilitate the putting in place of meters, it will not stop the leaks in the system.  Many people are curious with regard to the overall cost in this regard.  Figures ranging from &euro;300 million to &euro;1.2 billion have been referred to at meetings of this committee and in the D&aacute;il in the context of the cost relating to the introduction of metering.  The representatives from Bord G&aacute;is were extremely complimentary regarding the expertise that has been built up by local authorities.  I am of the same opinion and the Minister is aware of that because he has heard me comment on this matter on many occasions.  The representatives of the professional staff of local authorities have claimed that it could cost in excess of &euro;1.2 billion to install meters and to carry out the substantial ancillary works that will be required.  Will the Minister comment on this matter?</p><p>  What will be the level of subsidy from the Exchequer to Irish Water?  Will this be a continuation of the &euro;10 million to which I referred earlier or will it be ten times that amount?  Will the Minister provide a rough estimate of the actual figure in this regard?  I accept that he is in the process of putting all of this together and we will not argue about &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million one way or the other.  However, there are huge variations in the figures emanating from different sources and these do not stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>  Has the Department considered the situation which is emerging across local authorities in respect of outdoor staff?  It might not be too apparent from the Custom House but, as regards the position on the ground, the time is approaching when city and county councils throughout the country will not have sufficient outdoor staff to allow them to deal with emergencies.  These staff already carry out certain functions at a very low cost.  The concern in this regard is that private contractors are going to have to be brought in at a higher cost.  Have the Minister and his officials examined the position in this regard, particularly in the context of the large number of retirements that are occurring?  The age profile of many outdoor staff is at the upper end of the scale and many of them are over 50 years of age.  Has the Department considered this matter and, if so, what plans does are in place to deal with it?</p></speech>

Ours is the only organisation in the public service that has hit its ceilings in 2012.  Local authorities deserve great credit for this.  I do not believe we have declined a request from any local authority - within its ceilings - in the context of prioritising outdoor staff.  It is a matter for local authorities to decide on their priorities.  If they make requests in respect of replacing staff, they will certainly receive a positive response from the Department with regard to staff who work outdoors.  We are conscious of the fact that a large number of people will be retiring.  I know Deputy Stanley might not think so but I am aware of the position on the ground.</p></speech>

The Commission for Energy Regulation is going to be the regulator for water and &euro;2 million has been allocated in this regard.  A further &euro;2.75 million has been set aside for administrative and set-up costs.  These amounts are part of the establishment costs associated with Irish Water.  The loan Bord G&aacute;is will be obtaining from the National Pensions Reserve Fund will go towards the metering programme.</p><p>  Local authorities will continue to play major role in the provision of water and wastewater services.  IMPACT has already signed up to the arrangements in this regard, while SIPTU has yet to do so.  We have established a conciliation and consultative process, which is chaired by Mr. Kevin Foley.  The latter is meeting the unions involved on a regular basis in order to ensure that there will be no misunderstandings in respect of the rolling out of this programme.  I assure the Deputy that we will, in every possible way, be retaining the knowledge and expertise that exists in local authorities at present in respect of water and wastewater services.</p><p>  In the context of the property tax, we are learning from the experience in Northern Ireland where such a tax has already been implemented.</p></speech>

We do not want many of those because they cost me a fair bit in the past, politically and in every other way.  I would not want that to happen again.  We are dealing with water leaks and in the next three years we will spend a great deal more money in this regard.</p><p>  The IMF indicated that it wanted &euro;1.5 billion to be collected in property tax.

There are some such savings in respect of payments under international agreements from the environment fund for the EPA and the RPII.  We have reduced provisions for leasing.  As result of better value for money available in the market, we have achieved efficiencies on the reconfiguration of the delivery of housing services to the value of &euro;7 million.  On the administrative side and arising from the reduction in staffing numbers to which I referred earlier in the context of the employment control framework, we made savings of &euro;4 million.  We reduced the costs associated with the operation of the Mahon tribunal by &euro;2.5 million.  We also made savings in respect of dormant accounts and the RAPID and PEACE programmes of &euro;3.5 million.  In the communities and rural development section, there was a requirement for a reduction of &euro;8 million in the current year in respect of the local and community development programme.  That might be added on next year.  It is part of a rolling programme to the conclusion of the programme period at the end of 2013.  Those are the areas in which we made the necessary savings of &euro;34 million.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that 300,000 fewer tonnes of waste will be going to landfill.  Is the Minister seeking to make up the shortfall between the &euro;6.8 million referred to in the comprehensive review of expenditure and his estimate of &euro;52 million in respect of this matter?  On the figures provided in respect of revenue from the plastic bag levy and the fall-off in the number of audits taking place, is it the Minister's view that the number of such audits needs to be increased?</p><p>  Up to 31 December 2011, the Housing Finance Agency had advanced approximately &euro;500 million to local authorities in the form of loans.  There appears to have been change regarding how those loans are dealt with.  Previously, the interest relating to them was rolled up.  As of this year, &euro;179 million worth of these loans has been transferred to a 25-year annuity loan.  However, there is no indication of how the remainder will be dealt with.  In addition, there have been no payments to local authorities.  Will the Minister outline the position on loan book and the costs incurred by local authorities?</p> <p>I did not note in any of the Minister's estimates a figure for property tax, which we do not expect to be implemented until 1 July.  Another revenue steam is the &euro;100 household charge.  There seems to be a gap in the figures of up to a quarter of the funding required.  Will the Minister outline in terms of the Estimates how a funding gap of a quarter of the funds required will be addressed?  There will be no income from either of those sources in April, May or June.  How does the Minister propose that bridge that gap?</p></speech>

We have seen what has happened in Northern Ireland, where huge mistakes were made.  The representatives, when pressed, said that in the short term perhaps staff at local authority level throughout the country could do what was required.  I believe, as I am sure do other members, that they are the appropriate people to identify the issues, as they have been working with this system for many years.  What arrangements or firm commitments have been given to the Department and Irish Water that these people's jobs will be secure in the future?  I have been told that many of these people are concerned about the security of their jobs after 2018.  The commitment given to us in this respect was only for the short term.  Some of these people are young and have large commitments to meet.  It is vital that we get clarification from the Department and Irish Water on a firm commitment regarding the security of these people's jobs.</p><p>  I have a few questions for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan.  Under the capital allocation programme, the Minister of State referred to funding for unfinished housing estates throughout the country, referring to those under NAMA and various others.  What amount of funding is available for this work for 2013?  Unfinished housing estates are a major issue throughout the country.  It is vital that adequate funding be available to ensure that most of these estates can be completed.  This would assist in reducing the number on the housing waiting lists.  I do not know the Minister of State's objective regarding the use of these houses.  I note there has been a reduction in the capital allocation programme to &euro;112 million in 2012 and that funding under the programme provides for acquisition programmes and a number of schemes which are to be started during 2013.  I believe there are adequate numbers of houses in many areas of the country to accommodate many people's housing needs.  Another major issue is retrofitting and improvement works on local authority houses.  Does the Minister of State have information on the carrying out of this work next year?  A complaint I have received on numerous occasions is that local authority houses are left for far too long from the time they are vacated until the next tenant takes up residence.  That happens because funding is not available for such work.  It is vital that this be addressed.  It would provide a saving in terms of generating work on the retrofitting of houses and it would ensure people get into their homes as quickly as possible.</p><p>  What is the budget for regeneration programmes for 2013?  The Minster of State might indicate what areas will benefit from regeneration projects for next year.</p></speech>

We are working closely with Mr. Kevin Foley, who is facilitating transitional arrangements over a six-year period, and while many things can change in six years, I want to keep the knowledge and expertise we have built up at local level for the benefit of a more enhanced and ambitious capital programme for water and waste water services for the future.  Promotional opportunities as well as new opportunities will be available at local level for many people in the future.  It is important to note the increased investment we are seeking from private sources to enhance the public capital programme, which people do not take into account.</p></speech>

On the unfinished housing estates, &euro;5 million was allocated nationally this year in regard to public safety issues, and this has not all been drawn down yet.  I chair an ongoing committee on unfinished estates and we have required the local authorities to have site resolution plans for the estates in their various areas.  NAMA attends those meetings as well.  Some of the estates are under NAMA while others are not, and NAMA is carrying out the same kind of programmes as the local authorities.</p><p>  In terms of acquiring housing, we are also dealing with NAMA with regard to the acquisition of properties for social housing.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, and myself have met NAMA on a few occasions and we intend to meet it again before the end of the year in order to speed up the process.  The Deputy may remember that it originally identified approximately 2,000 properties that would be suitable.  The latest figure I have is that 133 of those are over the line and about 400 more are under negotiation.  There was a time lag in terms of bringing those NAMA properties over the line because this process involved the original owners, the receivers and the lending institutions - there was a series of hoops to jump through.  NAMA has set up a special purpose vehicle which we hope will speed up this process and we hope to transfer them more quickly in the future.  The meetings we have had with NAMA have been productive in that regard.</p><p>  Programmes are available to local authorities to address the issue of housing voids in terms of energy efficiency and improvement works; these are targeted particularly at vacant dwellings.  The Deputy may be aware that local authorities have a sum of money available per house from our Department to improve the status of empty houses.  We want to work with the local authorities to bring any housing voids back into use because there is no point in having empty houses if we can use them for families who need to be housed.</p> <p>With regard to regeneration, approximately &euro;80 million has been allocated for next year.  We have not finalised the figures yet so I cannot be definite.  In so far as is possible, we want to protect the regeneration budget.  Ballymun must be finished in the next few years.  Limerick is the next biggest regeneration project and, as the Deputy is aware, there are also projects in Sligo, Cork and Tralee.  Then there are what were to be the PPP projects in Dublin that will now have to be funded in a different way because PPP is no longer viable.  We are protecting the budget and we will have a significant amount of money for regeneration next year.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister and Minister of State for their overview which sets the scale of the challenge that faces them.  I have a couple of questions about the housing area.  The first point to which the Minister referred is that of the transfer of the rent allowance to local authorities.  Does the Minister agree that we have major problems in store unless local authorities have additional staff, albeit from their own resources, to work in the housing departments who are trained to deal with this activity?  We must accept that not all local authorities have given housing the priority it deserves in the past.  If they had, we would not have the scale of housing problems we have today.</p><p>  Reference was also made to RAS and long-term leasing as being the emergency initiative to deal with the growing waiting lists.  That is fair enough under the circumstances but what is the long-term vision on RAS and long-term leasing?  I am minded of what is happening now with shared ownership loans.  There was a time when we encouraged people to move away from the old annuity loans into shared ownership.  We now find that people at an advanced stage in local authority shared ownership loans are carrying a very substantial burden.  A small shift in the housing market will cause significant difficulties as far as RAS and long-term leasing is concerned.</p><p>  In regard to vacant dwellings, in recent years if one met people involved in local government they would tell one about the number of vacant units in their respective areas.  Only recently did I discover why that is happening.  I suggest that it is because of the improvement works programme because the houses have to be vacant for a period of six months before they can attract funding.  What is happening is that local authorities are leaving houses vacant for six months and they are falling into greater disrepair and they are then drawing money from the Department, which should be drawn the minute the vacancy arises.  Will the Minister revisit the issue?</p><p>  In terms of the scheme of works for the elderly and housing adaptation grants, there seems to be a fear in the Department that someone who is not entitled to them will get those grants.  They are of invaluable use to the elderly, disabled people and those who are vulnerable across the country.  If the Minister is worried about the grants, rather than cutting back on them would he consider doing something similar to what is being done in respect of the fair deal scheme, namely, registering a charge against the property for a period should the property be disposed of and should one be afraid of people profiteering?</p><p>  Approximately 25,000 units are managed or owned by the voluntary housing sector.  It is doing a good job but I do not believe it should be allowed to build empires.  People who live in the mainstream family, non-specialised housing units who have come off local authority waiting lists and have had houses provided for them that are 100% capital funded by the Department in the same way that local authorities have been funded should be able to buy their houses.  Will the Minister introduce a tenant purchase scheme for the voluntary sector and ring-fence the funding for the provision of other social housing?</p></speech>

The direction in which we are going with housing is a big disappointment.  I question the economics of it because we are moving away from the delivery of social housing.  I do not just mean building social housing but acquiring it in various areas at current prices which would be far more attractive than the costs involved in building houses.  One could get housing now at a very good price.</p><p>  The waiting list for social housing is approximately 98,000.  It is increasing at a dramatic rate.  We also have more than 100,000 people on rental subsidy and RAS.  Some of those people are receiving rental subsidy for up to ten years.  We are spending approximately-----</p></speech>

As outlined by the Minister, we are spending approximately &euro;635 million.  A total of &euro;135 million is spent on RAS.  How much have we saved on it compared to the rental subsidy scheme in the past year?  Is it planned to cut rental subsidy further?  Landlords are refusing to co-operate and we are creating a new category of homeless person.  Those people need accommodation.  Currently, we rely on the rental subsidy and the RAS.  Does it not make more sense to build more local authority units, as that would create more money for them?  Less funding will be required for local authorities if they get revenue from renting properties.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l for the constructive suggestions he made which we will examine.  He referred to grants and the possibility of a fair deal-type approach to them.  There is merit in such an approach.  He also inquired about a tenant purchase scheme for the voluntary sector.  We will introduce an incremental purchase scheme in the near future.  I agree that is an issue we must examine, in particular where 100% public capital funding has been provided.</p><p>  On the transfer of rent supplement, the housing agency will provide training for local authorities.  We are trying to devise the best possible system of payment which does not involve local authorities having to chase individuals for rent supplement.  We are working on that.</p><p>  The Deputy also inquired about my long-term vision on RAS and leasing.</p> <p>Our vision is that we will be able to go back to building more local authority type housing but for the moment we do not have the money and therefore we must use these measures to provide opportunities for people to have homes.</p><p> That comes back to the issue raised by Deputy Ellis.  It is all very well to say that we should be buying houses and building houses but we would only cater for a fraction of the number of people who need housing in the current economic climate.</p></speech>

NAMA is required to give a return to the taxpayer under its legislation and therefore we have to pay for those units.</p><p>  On the issue of the cap on rent subsidy raised by Deputy Murphy and others, currently that is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.  We are working towards that responsibility coming under local authorities but for the moment it is an issue for the Department of Social Protection.  </p><p>  I understand that shared ownership raised by Deputy &Oacute; Feargh&aacute;il is an issue, and it is a particular issue in some counties.  Many members of the committee have brought that to my attention and we are examining it in terms of the burden it places on people on shared ownership.  We do not have easy answers to it because if the burden is taken from the person living in the house it is put onto the local authority.  It is not an easy one to solve but we are considering what we can do about that problem.</p></speech>

An issue arises in my constituency and in some of the neighbouring constituencies whereby under the differential rent scheme many people's rents have increased above what it would cost them to rent a private house in our area.  It is difficult for people to accept that they are paying more to the council than what they would pay in the private market.  What does the Minister intend to do about that?  Also, in addition to having to pay higher rents people are being made feel that these are not their houses-----</p></speech>

The flawed needs and resources model was used to create a base line for the needs of people.  Has a base line been determined by the Department on what local authorities require?  Clearly, issues such as non-discretionary pay would have to be included in that.</p><p>  Second, last year the Minister advertised to the effect that people who paid the &euro;100 charge would be paying for the upkeep of their libraries, grass cutting and so on but in reality it was to replace the money withdrawn from the local authorities to allow them pay wages and so on.  It was damaging to give the impression that the money would be used for some additional purpose.</p><p>  Third, staffing in the public service has been cut back over several years and the Minister said it has reached its level for 2015.  There is an intention to further reduce staffing in the public service, and that is to be done in a more targeted way.

I was in the Chair in the D&aacute;il.  I have a few queries on housing in the Estimates.  The Minister spoke about the programme in the Estimates for next year.  Has he examined sheltered housing because the schemes that have been provided were very successful, particularly the one in Tuam?  I ask that the Minister examine the schemes in other counties.</p><p>  I support Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l's call regarding voluntary housing where houses could be purchased by the voluntary sector.  On sheltered housing, it is not just a question of the housing non-governmental organisations.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for example, has submitted proposals.</p><p>  My main query is on the tenant purchase scheme referred to in the Minister's reply.  We are all familiar with the 30% deduction in the current scheme, and the Minister mentioned a new scheme.  I read about that in the <i>Irish Mail</i> at the weekend.  I believe it was the only paper to carry the story.  If legislation is to be brought in I would expect it to be brought in soon because the 30% deduction is only available for another short period; I understand it may only be months for people who have applied and were sanctioned.  If it is the case that the people cannot make the deadline, will the Minister ensure they will get a better deal under the new scheme?  When will the legislation be introduced?  I understand people who got the 30% deduction also got a reduction which they would have got if they had built the houses themselves.</p> <p>It is a pretty good deal but there are only months remaining.  The legislation is very important if a new scheme is to be introduced.  I hope the Minister of State will give us some details.</p></speech>

We are targeting the most vulnerable, in particular.  There is still some funding, albeit limited, in the CAS.  We have signed an agreement with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, with regard to people coming out of institutions.  There is &euro;1 million to be transferred specifically to our Department for people coming out of institutions.  That will address the problems of some of those to whom the Deputy is referring.</p><p>  The 1995 tenant purchase scheme is coming to an end at the end of this year.

There is considerable workforce planning in local authorities at present to determine where a need  arises.  I suspect there will not be further redundancies among outdoor staff because more are needed to ensure there is a proper operational structure from local authorities.

I invite the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.692" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012111300011#K02800"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the report with the committee and to provide an update to it on the progress being made on the implementation of the report's recommendations.  Many homeowners affected by pyrite have been waiting for a considerable period and without success to date for a resolution.  The purchase of a home is likely to be the largest investment most people make in their lives.  One has a justifiable expectation that one's home will be a place of enjoyment for oneself and one's family for many years.  If serious problems arise, they should be dealt with promptly and efficiently by those considered responsible, be they materials suppliers, builders, developers, guarantee companies or insurance companies.  For homeowners affected by pyrite, living in their homes has not turned out to be the enjoyable experience they had hoped for.  In many cases, they rightly feel let down by those parties whom they believed would provide effective solutions in the event of problems.  Cognisant of the long period that many homeowners have been waiting for a solution and the lack of engagement by responsible parties in providing such solutions, I established the pyrite panel in September 2011, with the remit of exploring options for a solution to the problem of pyrite in private housing.  The comprehensive report that the panel submitted to me in late June 2012 contains 24 interrelated recommendations and provides me and the stakeholders with the framework for a resolution to the pyrite problem.</p><p>  I acknowledge the excellent work undertaken by the pyrite panel on producing a carefully researched and balanced report, which I understand has been generally well received.  The recommendations fall into two broad categories, the first of which deals with current pyrite problems and the suggested immediate and comprehensive solutions.  The second aims to ensure that the risk of similar problems will be minimised.  A number of the recommendations in the report pointed to the need for constructive engagement by stakeholders in providing solutions for homeowners and to the important role of the State in driving this engagement.  The panel expressed its disappointment that stakeholders had not, up to that point, engaged with homeowners in seeking a resolution to the pyrite problem.  I agree with the view expressed by the panel that while the State is not responsible for the pyrite problem, it has a pivotal role in assisting and co-ordinating the provision of the necessary infrastructure that will provide the remediation of pyrite-damaged dwellings where no other option is available to homeowners.</p><p>  When I published the report in July, I indicated that my preferred approach to dealing with the problem was for the stakeholders to work with me in finding solutions for affected homeowners.  This included, in particular, sourcing the necessary funds to meet the cost of remediation works.  However, I also made it clear at the time, and have reiterated on a number of occasions, that in the absence of buy-in from the stakeholders, I would impose a solution along the lines recommended in the report in regard to the establishment of a resolution board funded by a mandatory levy on the construction-quarrying sector and the related insurance sector.</p><p>  Following the receipt of the pyrite report I met the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, the Irish Banking Federation and the Irish insurance Federation in early July.  I outlined to them the key role I believe they should play in providing a resolution for homeowners.  I encouraged them to engage with one another with a view to developing a collective response and I set a deadline, the end of September, for the submission of their proposals.  All the stakeholders came back to me by the deadline with individual responses.  While all of them outlined, in varying levels of detail, how they envisaged the pirate problem being resolved and, in some cases, how they might participate in a resolution process, they did not submit any definitive proposals at the time that individually or collectively would see stakeholders providing a voluntary solution for homeowners.  While I was disappointed that the responses were not more positive, there were nevertheless some positive elements in the detailed responses.  The offer to participation actively and engage in any structure that might be established to make progress on the pyrite issue was welcome.  Conscious of the time for which homeowners have been awaiting a solution to the pirate problem, I asked my Department to finalise arrangements and terms of reference to permit the establishment of the proposed resolution board, as recommended by the pyrite panel.  My preference is that all of the main stakeholders should engage with the proposed resolution board.</p><p>  Building on the positive elements of the stakeholders' earlier responses and other positive soundings received, I again wrote to the organisations, on 31 October, enclosing the terms of reference for the proposed resolution board.  I asked them to give further urgent consideration to their positions and to respond not later than 9 November.  I have received responses from all the stakeholders.  In addition, the Department met a number of the organisations over the past two weeks and further meetings are scheduled for this week.  This continuing engagement is worthwhile and I would not continue with it if I believed otherwise.  Everyone is now engaged for the first time with my officials with a view to achieving an agreed solution.  However, if the discussions fail or prove unsuccessful in the coming days, I will proceed immediately to seek the permission of the Government to impose the levy.  I intend that final decisions in regard to the proposed resolution board and its funding be made in the coming days.</p> <p>I repeat I am conscious of the time that has been spent in bringing this matter to a successful and speedy conclusion.  However, many homeowners have been obliged to endure living with the consequences of this problem for far too long and I am determined that there will be no unnecessary delays on my part in putting in place the structure and funding to provide for a resolution.</p><p> The focus of the pyrite debate is on providing solutions for homeowners who have no options open to them to get their homes remediated.  However, it is important to acknowledge that a sizeable number of dwellings have been and continue to be remediated under various remediation processes.  In a number of instances, responsible builders are directly undertaking remediation works.  Moreover, remediation work is also being undertaken under structural defects insurance and other types of insurance, as well as on foot of arbitration and mediation processes.  I welcome this progress and believe it is the route that should have been embraced long before now by other responsible stakeholders.  In the preparation of this report, the panel consulted widely and met more than 40 groups from a broad range of backgrounds including homeowners, industry, academia, professional bodies, banks, insurance providers, local authorities and individuals who have a particular expertise in dealing with pyrite.  It has also received a number of submissions from various groups, which I understand the panel also considered.</p><p> I now wish to address a number of issues in the pyrite report which have been the subject of some debate, including the perceived lack of adequate regulations on or knowledge of pyrite prior to 2007 and the number of suspected dwellings affected by pyrite, as well as the methodology recommended for the categorisation of dwellings to prioritise remediation works.  The pyrite panel compared the guidance on hardcore materials in the building regulations in Ireland with those in the United Kingdom and Canada and concluded that the Irish building regulations compared favourably with those of the aforementioned two countries and that the guidance was reflective of the knowledge and experience in Ireland at that time.  Some people have made the point that while the regulations may have been comparable with other jurisdictions, the lack of enforcement by building control authorities was a major contributory factor in the pyrite problem.  The panel concluded that on balance, it would not have been reasonable to expect the unprecedented issue of pyrite in hardcore to be identified by building control officers during normal inspections.  The extent of knowledge of pyrite in Ireland prior to 2007 has been raised by a number of people, who have suggested there was knowledge of the problem of pyrite since the 1970s, and a number of academic papers have been quoted to support this view.  However, having considered the matter and consulted with various professional groups, the panel concluded there was only a limited knowledge of pyrite prior to 2007 and there was only passing reference to it in third-level engineering courses here in Ireland.  Pyrite problems in Canada, which came to public attention there in the late 1990s, are often quoted as a reason there should have been awareness of the pyrite problem in Ireland.  However, the Canadian problem only came to light here consequent to the manifestation of pyrite problems in Ireland.  Damage to a hospital in Cardiff in the 1970s was also alluded to in discussions.  However, this damage was a result of ground heaving.  The natural bedrock had high concentrations of pyrite and once exposed, the pyrite began to oxidise and the associated expansion caused cracking and uplift of the hospital built thereon.  In that case, the pyrite problems arose from pyrite in the bedrock itself and not in the infill, as is the case in Ireland.</p><p> The pyrite panel undertook a desktop study in conjunction with stakeholder consultation to establish facts in respect of the potential exposure to pyritic problems.  The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives.  Moreover, it was cross-referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.  The estimated number of dwellings that may be affected by pyrite is significantly lower than the speculative figures in the public domain.  No substantive basis of which I am aware has been put forward for the figures of 60,000 to 70,000 dwellings, which have been quoted by various sources as having been affected.  The estimate of 74 estates with 12,250 ground-floor dwellings arrived at by the pyrite panel is supported by a robust methodology that has been set out clearly in the report.  These figures represent the position as of March 2012 and based on the methodology used by the panel to arrive at the figures and taking account of the rate of presentation to date in Ireland, I am confident they represent a fairly good and accurate picture of potential future exposure.  The figure of approximately 850 dwellings which the pyrite panel concluded are in need of immediate remediation is an indicative figure only.  The panel used the information it had collected to give an estimate of the possible distribution of ground-floor dwellings across the three classifications of red, amber and green.  However, it should be noted that the inclusion of a dwelling among the 850 I mentioned does not necessarily mean the dwelling has been confirmed as having reactive pyrite in the hardcore or as having pyritic heave, or both, and its inclusion will have no bearing on access to remediation.</p><p> I am aware there is some concern about the methodology recommended by the pyrite panel for the categorisation of dwellings to determine priorities for remediation works.  However, I believe it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting damage to be remediated solely on the basis that there is pyrite in the hardcore.  This position is supported in the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Charleton in the case of James Elliott Construction Limited <i>v.</i>Irish Asphalt Limited, which now is under appeal to the Supreme Court.  The remediation of dwellings is an expensive and disruptive process and I agree with the panel that it would be unreasonable to remediate dwellings if they are not exhibiting pyrite-related damage.  However, the recommendation is made on the basis of a system being in place to repair such dwellings if and when they exhibit such damage in the future.  I wish to assure affected homeowners that the waiting they have been obliged to endure for far too long is coming to an end.  I have made substantial progress in recent days in respect of the financial institutions in particular and am determined that the structures and funding to provide for the remediation of pyrite-damaged dwellings will be put in place as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

While I may still be so obliged, there has been substantial engagement by all stakeholders in recent days.  We received a highly positive response and indication from the financial institutions as late as today, which leads me to believe there is now a window of opportunity - if the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond and the insurance sector will avail of it - to deal with this problem which, through no fault of the homeowners, has been caused by the building sector.  It is up to the latter to make sure they are in a position to meet the requirements for remediation of these houses.  I would prefer a voluntary solution because I can set it up much more quickly through the pyrite resolution board, but if we must go down the road of forcing people to pay the necessary levy, we will do so. We will come to a conclusion, one way or the other, on this particular road in the next ten days or two weeks.</p></speech>

We have gone over time because the Deputy took ten minutes in the first section of this meeting.  Every other questioner was told to take the appropriate amount of time and to be fair to the other members, some of whom have been present since 2.15 p.m.  I ask the Deputy just to ask the questions, as he has asked six.  I am only trying to be fair to other elected members.  Is that fair enough?</p></speech>

The Minister stated there has been progress on the part of the financial institutions.  He also stated there has not been similar progress with other stakeholders.  I doubt that and I agree with the Minister, because I have received correspondence from other stakeholders seeking to meet me on this issue.</p> <p>That in itself tells me that they are not prepared to enter into an agreement before discussing it with anyone else.  The Minister told the D&aacute;il that he would give them ten days to respond initially, so how long more will he give them?  When will the Minister come forward with a proposal or an imposition?</p></speech>

They are considering proposals that I have brought to their attention today arising from my engagement with the financial institutions.  The State does not have money to deal with this problem in the same way as we would have had in the good days.  That is no use to the unfortunate people who are directly affected by pyrite.  However, I am trying to provide the fund to do something for people for the first time.  I cannot have an open-ended system or else we will not get the money from the financial institution.  We have to provide the funds in some way - from the insurance, financial and construction sectors - in order to deal with this problem once and for all on behalf of the consumer.</p><p>  I am telling the committee today - I thought it would be good news but maybe not for some people - that we have made progress with the financial institutions.  They are now voluntarily prepared to participate in funding a scheme.  The construction sector has not yet said so, but it will be considering those proposals over the next 24 hours.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that it is their issue but the Minister has the power to put that levy scheme together.  A stick needs to be waved at this stage because if I were in one of the 850 houses that are falling down I would want to know how the scheme will be funded, what the remediation process will be, how testing will be carried out, how the project will be managed, when the work will commence, whether a structural guarantee will be given, how multi-unit developments will be dealt with and, if fire safety and other issues are identified, how they will be dealt with.  There are immediate concerns and other aspects that can be dealt with in time, although not too much time, in view of the Statute of Limitations.  There is an expectation now, however, and I believe that in many cases these agencies have not stepped up to the mark.  We are not in a position to force them to do so, but the Minister is.  We need to know if the Minister is working on this levy scheme and if it will be front-loaded.  In the event that these bodies do not step up to the mark, when will we see the machines rolling in to undertake the work?  We need to deal with practicalities now because the houses will not stop disintegrating.  We must stop talking and get some action on this.  We are talking about days.</p></speech>

I am the first Minister to deal with this legacy issue in the Department and the first person to do something about it.  I got to the root of the issue by bringing everybody together through the pyrite panel.  Nobody had done anything about this until I became Minister.  The Deputy talked about practicalities; I can impose a levy in the morning but it will take about six to eight months before it starts to accrue into any meaningful fund.  I want to get a fund in place immediately to start work now.  A substantial fund is required to get that under way.  I want to get the people who are responsible for causing this problem for the homeowners affected to be part of the solution.  I can impose a levy but I cannot legally force them to do anything like that.  I have asked them to come forward voluntarily.  I have made progress, which I am reporting to this committee, on providing an immediate fund and an operational plan that can do something for those affected, particularly the people who are very badly affected.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the testing protocol, which we will have by Christmas.  It has to have the necessary oversight of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, otherwise it would not stand up in any legal process if legal action was taken in due course.  We would not otherwise have the necessary people in place to sign off on the proper implementation of any remediation programme.  I am doing what I can but I do not mind waiting another few days to get this right on a voluntary basis in order to make progress for those affected. </p></speech>

I hope we are putting real pressure on these organisations and that we will not have to wait two, three or four weeks.  We should come to a solution as soon as possible.  In all these negotiations, have we ruled out up-front Government funding?  A levy will take a long time to be effective.  Are the banks involved being pressed to front-load money?  Is that the tactic we are employing?</p><p>  I am also worried about future regulations.  If we have to enact legislation, will it be retrospective?  If someone presents next week with a problem that arose five years ago, will the legislation cover that?  Do we have any idea how long it would take to put this legislation through? That may delay matters even further.</p><p>  Have all the various industries to which the Minister referred now become engaged?  Is it the case that each one of them is engaging positively at this stage?  It is important for us to know that.</p></speech>

I got a call to indicate that there were possibilities of further engagement that would be worth exploring.  I have put all the pressure I can on the stakeholders to ensure that will be the case.  As of today, I am satisfied that one side of the equation - namely, the financial sector - is now prepared to look at putting some money up front.  The levy would take time to accrue, which would not be of much help to the consumers - those directly affected - who are my foremost concern.  However, the financial sector is now prepared to put some thought into how it can put some more money into the system earlier.</p><p>  The levy will require legislation.  One cannot impose a levy without legislation, which takes time.  That is why I have asked, and have put as much pressure as I possibly can, on all the stakeholders in the financial and construction sectors to come up with a voluntary solution.  There is a responsibility on, and a window of opportunity for, the Construction Industry Federation and the Irish Concrete Federation in the next 24 hours to respond to the proposals that have been put forward by the financial sector today.</p></speech>

That is my first question.</p><p>  Second, when the Minister says that the financial sector is now prepared to come in with an up-front kitty, or whatever, does that mean all the financial institutions?  Can the Minister provide us with more substance on that proposal?  Is the Government itself going to add to that kitty?  The Minister said that a levy would require legislation.</p> <p>We knew a levy would require legislation before the panel was established.  Several aspects of the pyrite panel's report which were referred to in the opening statement have been disputed by others.  The first one is the amber category which involves a significant number of households-----</p></speech>

I am responding to the points the Minister made about the traffic light system and the amber category.  As a result of the pyrite panel, we have homes which were being remediated by Premier Insurance but are not anymore because they are in the amber category.  Those properties are not displaying enough proof of pyrite and are connected to timber framing.  That is a negative outcome from the pyrite panel.  What is the Department doing to address that?</p><p>  The Minister referred to five quarries being affected but seven were mentioned by the pyrite panel.  Will he elaborate on this?  What is the Minister proposing to do with HomeBond?  It had &euro;25 million in the kitty prior to being covered by Allianz and becoming a proper insurance scheme.  Those moneys will not be drawn upon by anything other than pyrite.  What steps has the Minister taken to sequester that &euro;25 million to be used as part of an immediate upfront fund to get the pyrite matter resolved?  What is his adjudication on the property tax and whether pyrite-affected houses will be exempted?  Can he give us a bit more substance with regard to the testing protocol?</p></speech>

I inherited this particular problem and I am dealing with it.  Deputy Clare Daly can make all the political comments she wishes but I am trying to solve the problems for the home owners.  She claims no progress has been made; substantial progress has been made which I have just outlined.  She will have to take my word on it.  I know she does not have much time for my word but she needs to take it on this occasion.</p><p>  The Government does not have the money to add to the funds but we are seeking to get them elsewhere through the financial sector and the stakeholders directly responsible for this problem.  We are facilitating the rectification of this problem through an oversight process we will put in place for the pyrite resolution board.  The number of houses affected is not 60,000, a figure that the Deputy has bandied around in the past.</p><p>  I cannot confiscate the moneys from HomeBond, which the Deputy knows as well.  I am involved in getting them to accept their responsibilities in this matter and to work with the Construction Industry Federation and the Irish Concrete Federation to present proposals that will help to resolve the problems for the home owners.  This is another part of the equation in trying to find a final resolution for the home owners affected.  The property tax is a matter for the Minister for Finance in the budget, but I am sympathetic to the point expressed by the Deputy.</p></speech>

The affected home owners should not have to wait any longer.  In case the Minister cannot set up the fund immediately, will he consider the Government accessing the money by making the stakeholders pay for it?</p><p>  The Minister stated the regulations compare well with Britain and there is a bit of innocence on board here.  I agree building regulations here are as good as anywhere.  However, the manner in which the testing of hard-core stone was regulated was not as good.  The Minister may claim knowledge about this was weak before 2007 but I was always told ignorance of the law was not an excuse.  The Government has a responsibility in this regard to look after the home owner first.  It must take the leading role and then access the moneys from the stakeholders.</p><p>  The Minister does not see the logic, given the expense involved, of testing homes that have been proved to have pyrite.  Would he consider setting up an agency that would core test homes in respect of which testing has been requested and make them pay for the remedial work, a bigger bill than testing?</p></speech>

I hope they will because they have caused the problem, not the home owners.  The reputation of the industry is at stake.  They have an opportunity to repair it and, more importantly, to remediate the dwellings of the unfortunate people who have been affected.  There is a precedent in this with some members of the Construction Industry Federation carrying out work on houses affected by pyrite.

I will know in the next few days if their bona fides are sound.  I agree with the Deputy they have not shown it up to now.  I am prepared to give it another couple of days.</p><p>  The pyrite resolution board will be established in the next few days.  It will be the oversight and supervisory authority on behalf of the consumer.  It will deal with issues like the test.  We have asked the standards authority to devise a test that will be robust in the event of any legal action taken in the future and a protocol to determine whether there is pyrite in a result.</p><p>  The question of upfront money and getting on with the job as quickly as we can are the crucial points.  It will take the mandatory levy some time to accrue some moneys into its fund.  That is why I have made some progress with the financial institutions to provide some money for the pot to get it up and running while the levy is accruing, if we ultimately have to go down that road.</p></speech>

The Minister reported he has made significant progress in resolving this matter.  We owe it to him to give him some space to allow him to bring it to a conclusion.  However, I would urge that he not let it drag on because there are people waiting.  I am pleased the pyrite resolution board will be established soon.  Irrespective of the source of its funding, whether it is voluntary or through a levy, we will have to have such a board to implement it.  Will the Minister be announcing the board&rsquo;s membership in the next few days?</p> <p> On the reference to some comfort from responsible builders and others who are progressing the matter, is the Minister aware that whereas Premier Insurance was progressing the matter and doing the remediation, it is beginning to play hardball with residents?  Although its buildings have pyrite damage, the company is disputing the nature and level of the damage.  I ask the Minister to engage with Premier again to see whether its position has shifted.</p></speech>

I certainly will be prepared to engage with the company on that basis again to see whether its position has shifted.  I can assure Deputy Ryan that we are in a position to proceed immediately with a pyrite resolution board.  We have the terms of reference approved.  However, I must go to Government on the matter of the mandatory level, if that is where I end up.</p><p>  I assure Deputy Ryan that I will not waste any more time in waiting around for persons to make up their minds about this matter.  I was asked because of those important meetings today in the construction side and I want to give them the necessary space between tonight and tomorrow to come to a resolution on these matters, which I hope they do.</p></speech>

It sounds as though at long last there is light at the end of the tunnel and I thank the Minister for his efforts in that regard.  It has been a horrendous time for those involved.  At the end of the day, it is a consumer protection issue and those who were responsible for solving this initially did not do so.</p><p>  The research conducted has been extensive and it has given rise to all sorts of reasons that this occurred.  What will the Minister do with that information to protect the consumer in the future?  For example, deficiencies have been found in third level education, where particular geological information was not being given to students on particular courses.  Will there be some sort of cross-sectoral linkage between the third level sector and, for example, the National Consumer Agency to ascertain where they could fill the gaps to ensure something like this never happens again?</p><p>  My other question relates to the Buildings Regulation Advisory Board.  When the board was before the committee recently, we were most concerned to discover that HomeBond held a position on it.  Has the Minister considered the withdrawal of that position from HomeBond, as this committee recommended, because of HomeBond's disgraceful actions in this but also the fact the company would not come before the committee to account for itself?</p></speech>

A number of weeks ago the committee wrote to the Minister about a recommendation it made based on extensive discussion, that is, the reappointment of a person from HomeBond on the Buildings Regulation Advisory Board.  It was the view of the committee, given the manner in which HomeBond approached the issue, specifically its absolute refusal to come before the committee, as a result of which members were quite correctly incensed, that we recommend HomeBond not be considered for reappointment to the board.  HomeBond has almost added insult to injury.  The Minister might consider that in the context of his reply to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.</p></speech>

The information matters that have arisen from this, from Priory Hall and other issues will form part of the solution in terms of future building regulations which I will bring to Government shortly.  It is not acceptable that those who took money from consumers on the basis of a structural guarantee did not discharge their responsibilities, which is what HomeBond and Premier did.  They were set up by the Construction Industry Federation to provide certainty to consumers about structural matters and they let everybody down in that regard.  Professionals let people down.  Unfortunately, those who were affected were the consumers.  I am very much in the space of helping consumers to overcome the difficulties which were created through no fault of their own.  I am pleased by the constructive approach of most members of the committee who are trying to find a resolution to this.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for giving me an opportunity to discuss the pre-budget position for my Department in 2013 with the joint committee.  He is aware that engagement with the committee and the opening up of the Estimates and budgetary process to wider public and parliamentary scrutiny are important elements of the reform agenda and the programme for Government.  Members of the committee will be aware that the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht oversees and has policy responsibility for the conservation, preservation, protection, development and presentation of Ireland's heritage and culture.  The Department seeks to promote the Irish language, support the Gaeltacht and assist the sustainable development of island communities.  A gross provision of almost &euro;269 million was provided to the Department for this purpose in 2012, with a further &euro;8.6 million allocated to the Vote of the National Gallery.</p><p>  As Members will appreciate, a consequence of the significant fiscal deficit facing the country is that sufficient resources have not been available in recent years to fund all the services we would like to provide.  The 2013 allocations will reflect this position once more.  In the present economic circumstances, unfortunately we have no choice other than to accept the reality that any failure to meet public expenditure targets at this time would have much more serious implications in the years ahead.  It would affect our continued ability to maintain, promote and protect Ireland's heritage and culture, develop cultural tourism, advance the use of the Irish language and support the sustainable development of the islands.  I hope the material my officials have provided to the committee will assist today's discussions.  I propose to provide some further detail in respect of the comprehensive review of expenditure indicative allocations and the key areas of expenditure under my direct responsibility.  I will give the committee a broad update on the issue of public sector reform and on the amalgamations and mergers process as they relate to the Department.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, will speak about the relevant aspects of the Gaeltacht, Irish language and islands programmes.</p><p>  As part of the comprehensive review of expenditure and the parallel capital review process, which involved a thorough and detailed evaluation of each area of spending under my remit, a number of options for expenditure reductions were identified in line with the guidance of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  These reviews set an indicative expenditure ceiling of &euro;276 million - current expenditure of &euro;232 million and capital expenditure of &euro;44 million - for my Vote group in 2012 and an indicative expenditure ceiling of &euro;256 million - current expenditure of &euro;218 million and capital expenditure of &euro;38 million - for the same group in 2013.  Members will be aware that my Vote group allocation of &euro;277 million in 2012 was in line with that indicative ceiling.  The additional &euro;1 million that was provided relates to delivery of the EU culture programme, which my Department leads.  With regard to current expenditure in 2013, an adjustment of some &euro;15 million on this year's allocation will be required to meet the indicative ceiling of &euro;218 million.  A further reduction of &euro;6 million on the capital expenditure side would be needed to meet the 2013 indicative ceiling of &euro;38 million.  If we are to achieve this level of reduction, an overall decrease of approximately 8% will need to be applied to each of my programme areas, including the National Gallery.  In light of the level of reductions across various programme areas in recent times, members will appreciate that this represents a very challenging scenario for my Department and for the National Gallery.</p> <p>Between 2008 and 2012, the overall programme expenditure provision, excluding departmental administration for my Department's four programme areas, has increased by almost &euro;247 million or 51%.</p><p> My Department will continue to focus to the greatest extent possible on achieving savings through efficiencies rather than through reductions in services.  However, it must be acknowledged that in addition to the indicative reductions for 2013, there are some significant upward pressures for funding that must be addressed.  Among the most notable are the provision of compensation relating to turf cutting in protected areas and meeting the capital requirement for the major renovation programme for the National Gallery.  Against this background, the Department is continuing discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Estimates process.</p><p> In broad terms, the 2012 allocations to the Department are &euro;141 million for arts, culture and film, including some &euro;63 for the Arts Council; more than &euro;48.5 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage; &euro;44.8 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands; and almost &euro;43 million for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.  Excluding departmental administration elements, these allocations reflect significant overall reductions since 2008, some 39% in the arts sector, 77% in the heritage sector, 64% in the Irish language, Gaeltacht and islands sectors and 25% in North-South co-operation.  Clearly the chellenge ahead is how best to balance the competing demands of expenditure reductions and the various upward pressures while at the same time maintaining the Department's core functions and the range of services provided to the public.</p><p> We will, within the resources available, continue to place emphasis on supporting jobs in the film and television sector and in the Gaeltacht, targeting investment in priority areas in the culture and heritage sectors that will support cultural tourism as one of the most important elements of Ireland's tourism product, on complying with the EU directives, including with investment in alternative solutions for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting in special areas of conservation, and on supporting the built heritage, the strategic development of national parks and the development of our waterways in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  We also accept, however, that at this stage there are no easy decisions remaining and I am therefore looking forward to discussing these matters with the committee and to receiving any inputs the committee might have in this regard.</p><p> There are three areas of particular significance within my Department's ambit: the EU Presidency, the decade of commemorations and the public sector reform plan.  Ireland's upcoming Presidency of the European Union in 2013 offers a new platform for cultural links with our key European partners.  My Department is actively involved in the ongoing preparation for the Presidency, including preparations for events on both the European and wider international stage in the lead-up to and during the Presidency.  In particular, I am overseeing development of a cultural programme to accompany the Presidency.  This programme represents an important opportunity to showcase Ireland's cultural heritage and artistic talent and to win positive publicity for Irish creativity both on the European stage and further afield.</p><p> As the committee is aware, we are now at the commencement point for a number of important commemorations in our country's history.  The decade from 1912 to 1922 was one of considerable economic, political and social change, not just in Ireland but in Europe and globally.  I am proud to serve as chairman of the all-party Oireachtas consultation group on centenary commemorations which is dealing with the commemorative programme for the decade of centenaries, 1912 to 1922.  The programme will seek to respect the various traditions on this island in a way that is sensitive, fair and reflective of our growth as a people of shared, disparate and sometimes conflicting interests, heritage and culture.  I look forward to working with partners in both the North-South and east-west context, as the various commemorative events take place in the years ahead.</p><p> I reaffirm my support for the vital work of public sector reform.  The Government decision of 17 November 2011 announced a streamlining of State bodies, including a number of bodies funded from my Department's Vote group.  The Department has been engaged in a process of consultation over recent months to determine the best way to implement the Government decision and achieve savings and efficiencies while maintaining the integrity of the cultural institutions.  This process has involved consultation by the Department with each of the relevant institutions.  In addition, I met the chairmen of the various institutions involved in this process to afford them an opportunity to express their views.  Meetings took place with a range of stakeholders and interested parties on these issues.</p><p> Following this period of assessment, consultation and review, the Government recently considered progress made to date and noted and agreed the range of reform actions to be undertaken.  These include a streamlining of all boards and advisory councils, with fewer members and all serving without fees; co-operation between institutions in a real and practical way across a wide range of services like communications, procurement, security, retail services and marketing; making greater use of the Department in providing support services such as HR, IT, legal services and finance to some institutions so those organisations can concentrate on offering core services to the public; aligning the work of relevant organisations with the broader agenda of Government, which is focused on driving investment into Ireland and rebuilding our reputation overseas; encouraging organisations to proactively attract philanthropy and fund-raise nationally and internationally to bolster the funding they receive from the taxpayer; and strengthening the programming, curatorial and operational independence of directors.</p><p> The committee should note that savings of &euro;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value for money were targeted in the public service reform plan.  In this context, it is expected that savings in the region of approximately &euro;1 million will be made initially across the institutions involved in the reform programme which are funded from my Department's Vote group, with further savings to be identified as various cost saving measures are implemented.  The real benefit from the rationalisation of State agencies will be a less crowded administrative landscape, resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for the citizen.  I am confident these reforms will save money at a time of scarce resources and will modernise how these institutions co-operate and work with each other.  The organisations funded by the Department understand the challenge Ireland faces and that we must do more with less in the years ahead.  I also firmly believe we have an opportunity for reform that should not be lost.  I am ambitious for Ireland's cultural and heritage offering and want to equip our organisations with the skills and structures they need in the challenging times ahead.</p><p> I will be happy to expand on any matter members may wish to raise.  Before passing over to my colleague, the Minister of State, I want to assure the committee I will listen to any proposals the members would like to make.  The Estimates for 2013 have not been finalised so if the committee would like to place emphasis on any particular area, this is a good opportunity.</p></speech>

Chomh maith le sin, cuireadh maoini&uacute; ar f&aacute;il do thionscnaimh th&eacute;arma&iacute;ochta, aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, logainmneacha agus focl&oacute;ireachta, mar aon le maoini&uacute; d'eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; at&aacute; ag tac&uacute; le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</p><p> Chomh maith leis an maoini&uacute; a chaitheann mo Roinn ar an nGaeilge laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, cuirtear maoini&uacute; ar f&aacute;il d'&aacute;is&iacute;neachta&iacute; a bhfuil r&oacute;l reacht&uacute;il ar leith acu agus a thagann faoi ch&uacute;ram mo Roinne, is iad sin &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, an Foras Teanga agus Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga.

Chomh maith le sin, t&aacute; sol&aacute;thar caipitil de bheagnach &euro;6 milli&uacute;n ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s &oacute;n St&aacute;tchiste ar mhaithe le hinfheist&iacute;ocht fiontra&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeltacht agus t&aacute; foins&iacute; maoinithe eile de thimpeall &euro;5 milli&uacute;n ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s f&eacute;in chun cur le seo i mbliana.  Mar thoradh ar an maoini&uacute; seo, t&aacute;thar ag s&uacute;il go n-&eacute;ireoidh leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s 400 post nua a chruth&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht i mbliana, chomh maith le bonn fosta&iacute;ochta de 6,500 post i gcliantchuideachta&iacute; an &uacute;dar&aacute;is a choinne&aacute;il sl&aacute;n.</p><p> T&aacute; athruithe d&eacute;anta ar fheidhmeanna agus ar strucht&uacute;r &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta faoi Acht na Gaeltachta 2012.  Tugann an tAcht feidhm reacht&uacute;il don &uacute;dar&aacute;s maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Chomh maith leis sin, d&eacute;antar for&aacute;il faoin Acht chun l&iacute;on comhalta&iacute; bhord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is a laghd&uacute; go suntasach agus chun deireadh a chur leis an riachtanas do thoghch&aacute;in do bhord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  Is athruithe chun feabhais iad na hathruithe seo go l&eacute;ir a chuirfidh le h&eacute;ifeacht an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  N&iacute; miste a r&aacute; sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo go bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist agam bord nua an &uacute;dar&aacute;is a ainmni&uacute; go luath.</p><p> Is gn&eacute; th&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; d'obair mo Roinne tac&uacute; leis an chomhoibri&uacute; Thuaidh-Theas agus t&aacute; suim ioml&aacute;n de bheagnach &euro;15.5 milli&uacute;n curtha ar f&aacute;il &oacute;n St&aacute;tchiste chun tac&uacute; leis An Foras Teanga i mbliana.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; &aacute;is&iacute;neacht ar leith i gceist leis An Foras Teanga, is iad sin, Foras na Gaeilge, at&aacute; freagrach as cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ar fud an oile&aacute;in, agus Gn&iacute;omhaireacht na hUltaise, at&aacute; freagrach as cur chun cinn na hUltaise agus an cult&uacute;r a bhaineann l&eacute;i ar fud an oile&aacute;in.  Ach an oiread le hUiscebheala&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, t&aacute; An Foras Teanga c&oacute;mhaoinithe ag mo Roinn agus ag an Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on agus F&oacute;ill&iacute;ochta &oacute; Thuaidh.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, beidh buis&eacute;ad na bliana seo chugainn don Fhoras Teanga le haont&uacute; leis an Roinn &oacute; Thuaidh agus le faomhadh ina dhiaidh sin ag an gComhairle Aireachta Thuaidh-Theas.</p><p> Labhair an tAire, an Teachta Deenihan, ball beag roimhe seo maidir leis na gn&iacute;omhartha athch&oacute;irithe at&aacute; &aacute; gcur i bhfeidhm ag an Roinn ag eascairt as plean an Rialtais um athch&oacute;iri&uacute; na seirbh&iacute;se poibl&iacute;.  Ar mo thaobhsa, t&aacute;thar ag dul ar aghaidh leis na hathch&oacute;irithe a chur i bhfeidhm i gc&aacute;s Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga agus an Choimisi&uacute;in Logainmneacha.  Mar thoradh ar chinneadh an Rialtais, beidh Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga at&aacute; ceaptha go reacht&uacute;il lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht i gc&oacute;na&iacute; agus leanfaidh an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga le feidhmi&uacute; a chumhachta&iacute; reatha go neamhsple&aacute;ch faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003.  Chomh maith le sin, tiocfaidh coiste saineolaithe, a bheidh ag feidhmi&uacute; ar bhonn <i>pro bono</i>, in &aacute;it an Choimisi&uacute;in Logainmneacha.  Beidh leasuithe reachta&iacute;ochta de dh&iacute;th chun feidhm reacht&uacute;il a thabhairt do chinnt&iacute; an Rialtais sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; seo.</p><p> Mar fhocal scoir, n&iacute; miste a r&aacute; go bhfuil feidhm th&aacute;bhachtach ag mo Roinn maidir le forbairt na n-oile&aacute;n.  Cuireadh &euro;5.9 m&iacute;lli&uacute;n i maoini&uacute; reatha ar f&aacute;il do na ho&iacute;le&aacute;in i mbliana chun fordheontais a &iacute;oc le sol&aacute;thr&oacute;ir&iacute; iompair &eacute;ags&uacute;la a chuireann seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; farant&oacute;ireachta, lastais, bus agus aeir ar f&aacute;il chuig 20 oile&aacute;n amach &oacute;n gc&oacute;sta.  Ina theannta sin, cuireadh &euro;963,000 ar f&aacute;il i maoini&uacute; caipitil i mbliana chun cothabh&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh ar thogra&iacute; infreastrucht&uacute;ra ar na hoile&aacute;in.</p><p> T&aacute; l&eacute;argas gairid tugtha agam ar na gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus ar na forais a bhfuil mo Roinn ag tac&uacute; leo sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus oile&aacute;n.  Is &eacute; an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n at&aacute; romham mar Aire St&aacute;it n&aacute; feidhmeanna mo Roinne a chur chun cinn sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus oile&aacute;n laistigh de na laincis&iacute; airgeadais at&aacute; orainn agus cosaint a thabhairt oiread agus is f&eacute;idir don raon seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a thugtar don phobal sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; sin.  Ach an oiread le mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an tAire, an Teachta Deenihan, beidh m&eacute; l&aacute;ns&aacute;sta aon cheisteanna a fhreagairt faoi mo chumais agus &eacute;isteacht le h-aon mholta&iacute; at&aacute; ag na baill agus gn&iacute;omh&uacute; chomh fada agus is f&eacute;idir faoi na laincis&iacute; at&aacute; orainn.</p></speech>

I was looking at the Estimate for the Department and have two questions for the Minister.  Are there opportunities for increasing the appropriations-in-aid by, for example, changing the fees?  The same thing would apply, for example, with regard to ferry services.  Many islanders, even though they value the &euro;8 return fare, would rather pay &euro;1 extra to retain the services they have rather than suffer a traumatic cut.  Are there possibilities in this regard?  Could we raise more money from fees rather than make cuts to institutions?</p><p>  Under the caps on the access programme, the cultural cinemas programme, Bord Scann&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann and so forth, how many projects promised funding under this programme are being carried out currently?  Will enough money be made available under the respective headings to ensure all of these projects, without fail, are given the money sanctioned for them in order that they can be completed and we do not end up with half-finished white elephant projects?</p></speech>

Bhain an ch&eacute;ad cheist le baill an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  De r&eacute;ir an Achta, beidh 11 agus Cathaoirleach ar an &uacute;dar&aacute;s.  T&aacute; c&uacute;igear acu sin roghnaithe cheana f&eacute;in ag na comhairl&iacute; contae ina bhfuil ceantair Gaeltachta faoina gc&uacute;ram.  T&aacute; seisear eile agus Cathaoirleach le hainmni&uacute; agus beidh siadsan ainmnithe gan mhoill, taobh istigh de laethanta, n&iacute; seachtain&iacute;.

Chomh maith le sin, beidh c&uacute;ram &uacute;r orthu an phlean&aacute;il teanga, agus sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil d&uacute;il agam go mbeidh daoine a mbeidh na scileanna sin acu ar an &uacute;dar&aacute;s &uacute;r.

Maidir leis an strait&eacute;is, is cuid &iacute; seo d&rsquo;obair na Roinne agus de chaiteachas na Roinne ar fad.  T&aacute; cuid mh&oacute;r den airgead at&aacute; &aacute; chaitheamh ag an Roinn ag dul chuig taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt d&rsquo;eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus gluaiseachta&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht agus d&rsquo;oideachas sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; siad sin go l&eacute;ir fite fuaite le ch&eacute;ile.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; ar intinn an oiread seo a atheagr&uacute;.  Is don strait&eacute;is &eacute; sin.  Beidh tionchar ag an strait&eacute;is n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in ar gach gn&eacute; de chaiteachas airgid na Gaeltachta &oacute; seo amach, ach de chaiteachas airgid Ranna eile.  Beidh cuid d&rsquo;airgead na Roinne Oideachais agus Scileanna d&iacute;rithe isteach ar an strait&eacute;is, agus cuid d&rsquo;airgead Ranna eile chomh maith.  Beidh na Ranna a bhfuil feidhmeanna acu sa Ghaeltacht ag tabhairt aghaidh ar an strait&eacute;is chomh maith.  Mar sin, t&aacute; buis&eacute;ad ioml&aacute;n sa bhliain reatha de &euro;60 milli&uacute;n &aacute; chur isteach i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; sin go l&eacute;ir d&iacute;rithe isteach ar an aidhm at&aacute; ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus ag Foras na Gaeilge an strait&eacute;is a chur i bhfeidhm.</p><p>  Maidir leis na hoile&aacute;in, caitheadh breis agus &euro;5.9 milli&uacute;n i mbliana ar na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chuirtear ar f&aacute;il do na hoile&aacute;in ar fud an ch&oacute;sta, oile&aacute;in Gaeltachta agus oile&aacute;in nach bhfuil sa Ghaeltacht.

T&aacute;imid ag cur an-chuid airgid ar f&aacute;il, do dh&aacute;ilcheantar an Teachta U&iacute; Chu&iacute;v f&eacute;in chomh maith.  T&aacute; sc&eacute;im taca&iacute;ochta linbh agus sc&eacute;im taca&iacute;ochta teaghlaigh ar bun &oacute; Indreabh&aacute;n siar go dt&iacute; an Cheathr&uacute; Rua.

I have established a philanthropy initiative and I am encouraging the national cultural institutions to take part in it.  The National Archives have been successful in getting a philanthropic contribution of &euro;250,000 from the Wellcome Trust, which proves this can be done.  I see the director of the Abbey Theatre is at this meeting.  My Department is working closely with the Abbey Theatre on a number of issues, including the acquisition of land to ensure a new theatre can be built in the future.  The director was in Boston recently looking for philanthropic opportunities.  The director of the National Library is looking at opportunities.  We are trying to get funding from as many sources as possible because the taxpayers' contribution will be reducing, as we know.</p><p>  I have asked the National Museum, the National Library and the National Gallery to ensure we encourage personal donations, without having compulsory entry fees.  I have visited museums and libraries all over the world and I have noted there is almost always a place at the entrance or elsewhere where visitors can make a contribution if they wish.  I have seen people making very generous contributions.</p><p>  We are trying to encourage people to use the national cultural institutions.  I am proposing different approaches to seeking revenue for those institutions.</p><p>  An interesting programme was initiated recently by the Arts Council.  The RAISE project is working with ten different groups to build the council's capacity to raise funds.</p> <p>That will prove to be productive.  The idea is to raise &euro;10 million in extra funding over the next ten years, and if anyone has any ideas, I will listen to them.  We want to protect the free entry, and the census documents have also proven very popular.  There were around 700 million hits on them and access is free of charge.  They offer a service to the diaspora without charging for it.  The more we can make available free of charge to the diaspora, the better.  It is the least we can do for them.</p><p> The Deputy is a man of ideas and if he has any more I will be delighted to entertain them.  It is part of my vision at present to source as much funding support for the national cultural institutions as possible.  This week I will be in New York at the Lincoln Centre with representatives of the National Concert Hall.  We are trying to identify potential contributors and philanthropists that will donate to the National Concert Hall.  It is part of our policy at the moment.</p><p> As regards access and capital, we are trying to manage the projects.  This year, Smock Alley Theatre was completed, along with the Niland Gallery in Sligo and the Belltable Theatre and the City Art Gallery in Limerick, and the Garage Theatre in Monaghan is about to be completed.  This committee should visit that venue because it was done in collaboration with County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee so education and the arts will take place side by side in the centre of a complex that will support first and second level educational institutes.  It is an example for everyone.  The Theatre Royal in Waterford is almost completed, and although Solas in Galway is proving to be a challenge, we are trying to manage it as best we can to ensure its completion.  Work is also ongoing on Athlone Art Gallery, and in the next few years there will be high profile projects in the Butler Gallery in Kilkenny and the theatre in Tullamore.  No project has failed yet, and despite the tight finances, we are still managing to ensure cashflow for their completion.  I am confident the commitments made in the access programme will be honoured within the constraints we face.</p></speech>

Is that &euro;1 million already taken into account or can we look forward to that saving with the 2013 allocation?</p><p>  We now know the envelope and medium-term expenditure framework over 2013 and 2014, and looking for that additional &euro;20 in savings, how much more can we look forward in the context of mergers and abolition in 2014?  We must clarify that so we can look at supporting the decisions the Minister must make.</p><p>  There is a ceiling of &euro;232 million for 2012 and a decrease to &euro;218 for 2013.  The Minister must look for savings of &euro;14 million, although he mentioned &euro;15 million in his opening remarks.  I presume the extra million is to do with the EU Presidency.  Will that be ring-fenced and will it become a saving in 2014?  How is it treated?  It is almost like a punishment where the Minister is given this &euro;1 million but it is then taken away from him afterwards.</p></speech>

These are clarifications.</p><p>  The baseline figure for Arts Council funding is &euro;63 million.  The Minister mentioned having to look for an 8% cut.  Can he give the top end percentage cut for which the council, and therefore arts organisations, should be prepared?  We might not be able to get an exact figure and we might have to wait for the budget but can we get the headline figure?  The Minister invited us to give our opinions on how the ever-decreasing resources might be spent and I urge him to spend most of the money on the living arts.  There are some capital requirements but the majority of the money should be spent on arts organisations and groups, whether on traditional music or other art forms, and on the presentation of work for the here and now that will ultimately support not only our communities but also The Gathering.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister's initiative on income streams.  He has consistently been supportive and taken a lead in philanthropic policy in the Department.  I was sorry to miss the conference in Smock Alley Theatre but I was in the United States to raise funds for the Abbey Theatre.  Can the Minister confirm the amount that has been set aside for the philanthropic initiative and can the committee know what subhead that comes under in order that we can look at both 2013 and 2014?</p><p>  I assume subhead A7 outlines some of the necessary capital funding and the valuable work of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, which I welcome.  Are there any other arts bodies included in the subhead that receive current funding?</p></speech>

Also, the savings will be made when the rationalisation takes place, which will depend on the introduction of legislation.  The saving I can make immediately, and I contacted the chairmen of the institutions on this, is that all directors and board members will act on a <i>pro bono</i> basis.</p> <p>They will not pay fees to members of boards.  That will save approximately &euro;350,000.  Other savings will be made when the changes take place, for example, when the boards of the National Museum and the National Library are taken over by the advisory council and the services are shared from our Department.  It is hoped that savings will be made through rationalisation.  The extent of these savings depends on how soon we put in place the new arrangements and when the various shared services are rolled out.  As the galleries put forward the proposal on shared services, they have already agreed to it.  Given the tightness of the budget, I see substantial opportunity for adding money to my philanthropy budget.</p><p> As regards funding for Europe, this was a one-off contribution for this year that we could use for next year.  This money has been spent.  I argued on Committee Stage of the Arts Bill 2002 that the arms length principle should be protected.  I am trying to provide as much funding as I can to the Arts Council.  Over the three years until last year, its funding had been substantially reduced in each budget.  I arrested that trend to some extent and the cut was just 3% last year.  I will do my best to limit the reduction in Arts Council funding because I realise that groups and centres in all parts of Ireland benefit from the grants it provides.  These grants are allocated not on a political basis but according to criteria decided independently by the Arts Council.  I am sure members will support me in minimising the reduction to Arts Council funding.</p></speech>

My priority will be to do my best for the Arts Council.  As regards incomes, I got &euro;230,000 last year for a special philanthropy scheme to see how it would work.  We hope the scheme will leverage &euro;1 million, which can be built on next year.  If an investment of &euro;230,000 can get a return of &euro;1 million, it is worth investigating other sources of funding for arts organisations.  The Arts Council allocated &euro;620,000 last year to encourage philanthropy.  This is funded under subhead A7 and other organisations funded under subhead include Business to Arts and IntroArt.</p><p>  We will do our best to protect funding for the Arts Council and the arts.

Heritage is a key part of cultural tourism yet its budget is being reduced by 77%.  How will the Minister implement this key aspect of the programme for Government if its budget is being cut by 77%?  Does he intend to rely solely on the 13 world heritage sites mentioned in his report?  What about the importance of local heritage as an educational tool for young children and a potential source of local employment?  Does he accept that depending on just 13 key sites limits the potential for developing the domestic tourism market?</p><p>  Is the Minister concerned about over dependency on philanthropy among the key national institutions?  Can he give an assurance that his Department does not intend to introduce an admittance fee for entry into any of the key institutions?  Has a budget been put aside for compensating turf cutters and, if so, how much money has been allocated?  Where will the &euro;500,000 saved on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta elections be spent?

Heritage tourism is very important and I accept that funding for heritage decreased significantly from &euro;97 million in 2008 to &euro;22 million in 2012.  That is a major reduction in funding.</p> <p>That is putting funding for our built heritage and other aspects of our heritage under a great deal of pressure but we have to cope with what we have.  In the heritage sector, we also have compensation for bogs.  Last year, I set aside &euro;5 million and the allocation will be similar next year.  That places a further burden on the available money.  We are doing our best and coping with the budget we have.  We are doing innovative work and sometimes when one has less money, one must think more.  My Department is doing a good job in managing national parks and doing creative work in introducing good initiatives.</p><p> Ireland has two world heritage sites at Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Skellig Michael.  A number of sites are on the tentative list, which it is hoped will in time become UNESCO world heritage sites.  Heritage sites are major attractions in the State and it is important we maintain and protect them properly and promote them as much as possible.</p><p> As regards admission fees, we will do our best to avoid charging to visit the National Museum and the National Library and to secure other sources of funding.  The voluntary contribution, which is used in many museums around the world, is one I favour very much.  I do not suggest there should be an over-reliance on philanthropy.  We must try to balance what we generate through philanthropy with State funding and, hopefully, in a few years, when the recovery comes, we can begin to increase State funding again.  At the same time, I do not wish to take away the emphasis from philanthropy.</p><p> Last year we set aside &euro;5 million and compensated a large number of turf cutters.  The Department received 2,472 applications for compensation and 723 for relocation, of which 2,444 have been acknowledged, 1,729 have been paid, including second payments to applications from the previous year, and 145 turf deliveries have been made with a further 71 approved.  To date, almost &euro;3 million has been spent on compensation.  This was a significant logistical issue.  Such a process had not been undertaken previously and it was difficult because the applications had to be verified and so on.  There are problems with title when it comes to bogs.  I compliment the departmental officials who took on this challenge on doing an excellent job.  There has been a huge uptake of the scheme.</p><p> We were at the door of the European court and if we had not put this process in place and turf cutters had not accepted the compensation, stayed off the bogs and obeyed the law, we would have faced a massive fine of &euro;25,000 a day.  That is not an exaggeration.  People were concerned about it from the Taoiseach down and the fines would have been imposed.  This was not a threat.  The fines were going to happen because formal notice had issued and reasoned opinion had been provided.  The next step was court and this country would have been fined heavily because we were supposed to do this ten years ago and it was not done.  We procrastinated and we did not do what we promised having transposed the directive into domestic law.  We were not getting sympathy on this.  I acknowledge the work of Mr. Conor Skehan who is still a member of the Peatlands Council.  He stepped down as chairman having made a commitment that he would give it one year.  He has been replaced by Mr. Seamus Boland, who was very much involved in the successful relocation in Clara, County Offaly.  Mr. Skekan's contribution will be valuable and important.</p></speech>

It is estimated there was a saving of &euro;500,000 in the allocation for the Gaeltacht elections.  While we saved money on the election, it is part of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's overall budget and savings.  The capital budget could be less than the &euro;6 million I succeeded in getting this year.  This amount is part of the overall savings and therefore, it is included in the current budget.  If we had an election, it is likely the organisation would get less for capital spending.</p><p>  The administrative cost of the organisation is &euro;9.871 million and it is estimated the current pensions bill is &euro;4.3 million per annum.  That covers the pensions for 136 former employees.</p><p>  It is a matter for the cultural institutions primarily to adhere to the Officials Languages Act 2003.  I understand that under the Act the Department has no direct responsibility to order them what to do.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister on the practical measures he has introduced to encourage philanthropy in the arts.  They are welcome at this difficult time.  The fact we are in a financial crisis does not make the arts less valuable within our society.  The growth of community arts has been one of the most exciting developments in recent years.  Community arts have spread to all corners of the country and they are not just based in the large centres of population, in particular, Dublin.</p><p>  My concern is the manner in which the Arts Council allocates money and how the 8% cut referred to by the Minister will be passed by the council to the groups and individuals to whom it awards grants, particularly the arts venues that have expanded successfully over recent years.  As we discuss cuts being meted out, the reality is they are not being meted out equally.  The council has funding commitments, to which it is adhering, to established galleries, theatres and arts venues in Dublin and other urban centres to a lesser extent.</p> <p>My concern is for the other arts venues throughout the country, which have very commendable programmes which include community arts.  I stress this because, unfortunately, for a long time the arts have laboured under the idea they are for certain people.  Community arts and the outreach work of many arts centres have made the arts relevant through people participating and through interaction with professional artists.  It gives a platform to the abundance of creativity we have.</p><p> Will the Minister engage with the Arts Council and point out to it that smaller arts centres are taking a greater percentage of the cuts because of commitments to larger institutions?  These cuts are more detrimental to the future of these arts centres, particularly in light of the fact that town councils are being discontinued.  Many town councils fund arts centres and this funding stream will go.  The Minister should raise this with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The town councils which fund the arts get their money from ratepayers and I am aware of a number of arts venues which will suffer from the loss of town councils.  This cannot happen.  It is a serious problem and it will be impressed upon the Minister even more as reality bites for arts venues.  Is the Minister prepared to discuss this with the Minister, Deputy Hogan?</p><p> I also have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley.  If part of a proposed business or operation was in an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta area, would a joint venture between the &uacute;dar&aacute;s and the IDA or Enterprise Ireland be possible whereby they could work co-operatively to deliver to an area larger than the &uacute;dar&aacute;s area?</p></speech>

She raised a number of relevant subjects.  As I explained before the Deputy arrived, it is enshrined in the relevant Act that the Minister cannot get involved in the day-to-day activities of the Arts Council.  The Minister cannot direct the Arts Council to give any particular organisation or individuals funding.  I argued in favour of this principle almost ten years ago when the Bill was going through the D&aacute;il.  What I can do is give policy directives to the Arts Council.  I did so with regard to touring, it was quite successful and I recognise the fact the Abbey Theatre was in Tralee recently.  I am sure it also toured the Deputy's county and it was in Limerick.  It was very successful and got a great reception in Tralee, as I am sure was the case in Limerick.</p></speech>

The important point is that all parts of the country can see a professional performance by a national cultural institution.  I mentioned the Abbey Theatre because seeing a professional performance resonated in Tralee and Limerick and this is how it should be.  The Arts Council took on the policy directive with regard to touring.  I also gave a policy directive on having a national literature strategy, and the Arts Council is working on this.  It has also taken up the challenge of philanthropy with a very creative approach.</p><p>  The committee should invite the Arts Council to come before it as soon as possible, prior to it making its allocation, to put these issues to it.  Legally I cannot give the Arts Council a direction on how it spends its money.  I am trying to limit the reduction as much as I can within reason, taking into consideration every organisation and those who depend on our funding.  As the Arts Council funds organisations throughout the country, it has a considerable effect on the arts in all communities.</p><p>  From my travels throughout the country I agree with the Deputy that there is great energy in the performing and visual arts in communities.  Every village and town has an arts group, with several such groups in some places.  There are drama groups and music and singing clubs, and there is an amazing cultural movement, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; would confirm.  As a small example, there is a singing club in my village of Finuge.  The rambling house there was the only one several years ago but now there are several in north Kerry.  Much is happening which must be supported and encouraged.</p><p>  The point with regard to town councils supporting local centres through the arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, and previous programmes must be carefully considered in the change in structures.</p></speech>

Under the 1956 Act, the &uacute;dar&aacute;s is primarily responsible for industrial development within designated Gaeltacht areas.  Other agencies such as the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are responsible for development outside the Gaeltacht areas.  The Deputy mentioned projects which straddle Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht areas.  There is an impediment in the Act which prevents the &uacute;dar&aacute;s from assisting in anything outside the designated Gaeltacht areas.  However, having said this, there is a mechanism in the Act which enables co-operation between the &uacute;dar&aacute;s, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, and a working group has been established between the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Earlier this year, this co-operation was visible as Bioniche Pharma and the international company Mylan announced more than 600 jobs.</p> <p>On the same day &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was represented and in negotiations with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  Some 350 jobs were created in Baldoyle, with 250 more in Galway.  That shows the level of co-operation between the agencies.  If the Deputy knows of a specific case, she can send on the details and we will see what can be done.</p></speech>

Like my colleague, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, I also declare an interest because I am associated with Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann which is a beneficiary of the Department.  To paraphrase Martin Luther King, that help enables us not only to dream but also to realise a major part of the dream.</p><p>  It is widely acknowledged that culture is an important ingredient of national morale, but sometimes its economic aspect in national development is understated.  The fact that 73,000 jobs are dependent on cultural tourism is significant.  In its 2009 survey F&aacute;ilte Ireland identified that &euro;1.9 billion was generated by the cultural and heritage aspects of tourism.  It is estimated that there will be growth of 15% per annum worldwide in cultural tourism.  If this figure was related to any other industry in the current recessionary times, it would be a huge cause for celebration.  In that context, we must be careful to know which goose is laying the golden egg.  Can we take it that this aspect of the generation of funding will be kept in mind when funds are being dispensed and policy is being formulated?</p><p>  Connected with this issue is the EU Presidency.  Is it envisaged that events will not be confined to Dublin city?  Will entourages and related activities be widely dispersed?  I could issue straightaway an invitation to visit the Rock of Cashel and Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; if the Minister was going in that direction.  Because of the importance worldwide of cultural tourism, we will benefit, but we must share the publicity.  In the case of the Eurovision Song Contest, for example, other aspects of Irish life were shown.  I hope this will be a priority in planning and that we will ensure those who come to Ireland will get to see the whole island.</p><p>  The Minister has invited us to bring forward our ideas on how to generate finance.  I have one suggestion at which he might look.  If a person deposits surplus cash in the bank, at most he or she will receive interest at a rate of 1%, on which DIRT is payable.  There is a message to be learned from how charities can claim back tax on donations.  The Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht could devise a scheme under which those who deposit money with an arts organisation would receive interest on the sum deposited tax free.  This should apply to both capital and current funding.  If a person borrows money from a bank, he or she will pay at a rate of 4% or 5%.  This might sound like an unusual idea and while it is not radical because the concession for charities is already provided for, it would be novel because the opportunities to raise money are fewer and there are huge sums on deposit - up to &euro;70 billion.  There must be a way to release some of these funds from the banks into the business sector by offering some carrot to do so.  It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility.  I ask the Minister, even if it is outside his remit, to consider it with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

Across the country communities in villages and towns are gearing up by organising different festivals that will all be based on culture.  The test of our cultural product is whether we can attract more visitors.  Many people will come for family or school reunions or for other reasons, but the cultural product available is different from what was available 30 years ago.  The Senator will agree that the standard has improved because of work done by his organisation and the different schools of music, from primary to third level.  There is a major movement.  I was in the Senator's parish some time ago when I was very impressed by a young harper.  It is now cool to play Irish music and there has been a great revival in the playing of the harp.  We will put this to the test next year in seeing how many will come during The Gathering and if we can gain an extra 350,000 tourists.  That will be a challenge, but we do have a great cultural offering.</p><p>  As regards funding, I encourage people to look to the Leader programme under which there is more of a fund for heritage projects than in my Department.  It provides vital funds, as does the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It offers product development funds for important cultural projects across the country.  Apart from my Department - as Deputy Sandra McLellan points out, the funding for heritage projects has been cut drastically by 75% - there are other sources at which people should look in seeking funding for heritage and cultural projects.</p><p>  We will launch the programme for the EU Presidency on 29 November and it would be great if committee members could attend.  There will a huge regional aspect to the programme.  Despite the financial constraints, it is a very good programme.</p><p>  Senator Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s idea is a very good one.  Does he know if it has been tried in any other country?</p></speech>

We are doing preliminary work on that at the moment.  Local aspects of the matter are being considered.  Obviously, we would love to engage with the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association.  As members of the committee will be aware, the association left the Peatlands Council last year.  It is important for the association to come back into the council.  When Deputy Luke Flanagan and others tabled a motion in the D&aacute;il calling for a national plan on raised bogs, I accepted the motion and took the substance of what was called for in the motion to the Commissioner in Europe.  The Commissioner accepted that.  The motion called for a plan to be drawn up for the 53 raised bogs in special areas of conservation and for an accommodation to be found in the cases of a small number of bogs where there are no relocation possibilities.  That is exactly what this plan will be pursuing.  It will be in the spirit of what was accepted by the Commissioner last year.  That is exactly what was proposed in the D&aacute;il at that time.  It is there.  The motion is there.  I accepted that motion.  I took the spirit of that motion to Europe and it was accepted by the Commissioner.  This process is happening with regard to raised bog special areas of conservation.</p><p>  Both parties in government gave a commitment in the programme for Government to examine the management structure of natural heritage areas with a view to finding an alternative approach.  The derogation that applies to natural heritage areas will not expire until 2014.  We have another year in which to complete the review we are carrying out at the moment.  The Peatlands Council is examining the matter at present.  The difference between special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas is that special areas of conservation are designated by Europe whereas natural heritage areas are designated under national law.  Obviously, we have some flexibility with regard to natural heritage areas.  In the programme for Government, we promised to review natural heritage areas and examine different approaches.  I have explained the difference between the two issues that are arising at this time.  I thank the Vice Chairman, Deputy McLellan and Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for staying for the duration of this session.  I congratulate them on their endurance and patience.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have the opportunity to brief the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs ahead of this month's meeting of the General Affairs Council which will take place in Brussels on Tuesday, 20 November.  The General Affairs Council will meet for a morning session, at which I will represent Ireland and be joined by the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton.  Agenda items include: the cohesion policy legislative package; presentation of the European Commission's work programme for 2013; follow-up on the European Council of 18-19 October; preparations for the special European Council of 22-23 November; and preparations for the European Council on 13-14 December.</p><p>  An informal working dinner for General Affairs Council Ministers will be held on 19 November.  President Van Rompuy will attend the working dinner when discussion will focus on the multiannual financial framework, MFF, and preparations for the European Council on 22-23 November.</p> <p>As I look ahead to next week's Council meeting, it might be helpful also to update the committee on the last General Affairs Council discussions, which took place in Luxembourg on 16 October.</p><p> The Cyprus Presidency has substantially progressed work on the cohesion legislative package.  The GAC has by now agreed a partial general approach on seven thematic blocks of the cohesion legislative package, including on elements of the European territorial co-operation regulation and country-specific recommendations.  The EU's cohesion policy remains a clear demonstration of the solidarity between member states, enabling change and encouraging development in the regions.  It is perhaps worth reflecting here that our experience of cohesion policy has been overwhelmingly positive.</p><p> The General Affairs Council next week will discuss some further elements of the cohesion policy legislative package and details of these elements will be confirmed by the Presidency shortly in advance of the GAC meeting.  This legislative package aims to reinforce the strategic dimension of cohesion policy and to ensure that EU investment is targeted at Europe's long-term goals for growth and jobs.  These partial general approaches do not prejudge the outcome of negotiations on other elements of cohesion policy or on the multiannual financial framework.</p><p> Next week's Council meeting will also include a briefing by the Commission on its work programme for 2013, which it adopted on 23 October.  Each year the European Commission publishes an annual work programme outlining how the European Commission President's political guidelines for 2009 to 2014 will be implemented in the coming year.  The Commission work programme 2013 contains a comprehensive outline of the Commission's priorities for 2013.  The programme is divided into seven key areas of work: towards a genuine economic and monetary union; boosting competitiveness through the Single Market and industrial policy; connect to compete - building tomorrow's networks today; growth for jobs - inclusion and excellence; using Europe's resources to compete better; building a safe and secure Europe; and pulling our weight - Europe as a global leader.</p><p> In its work programme, the Commission puts particular priority on the implementation of existing legislation as well as on measures that contribute to tackling the current economic crisis.  The focus is on strengthening effective economic governance and on increasing Europe's competitiveness, including making better use of the untapped potential of the Single Market.  This focus ties in well with Irish Presidency priorities, and as such, serves Irish national interests favourably.  The work programme contains proposals that will directly contribute to fulfilling the political goals agreed upon in the compact for growth and jobs.  I am also pleased to note that the work programme anticipates progress on a range of trade agreements with third countries, including the United States and Japan, both of which are of particular interest to Ireland.</p><p> During the October meeting of the GAC in Luxembourg, President Van Rompuy joined Ministers via video link for a lunchtime discussion of preparations for the October European Council.  At last month's European Council meeting in Brussels, leaders had a number of substantive issues on their agenda, including reflection on the possible future shape of Economic and Monetary Union, which underpins our shared currency, as well as taking stock of implementation of the compact for growth and jobs.  Beyond those economic issues, Heads of State or Government also had a good exchange on our relationship with the Union's strategic partners, most notably with China, and they adopted a comprehensive set of conclusions on the developing position in Syria, Iran and in Mali.</p><p> The central focus of deliberations among leaders was on the means of strengthening economic and monetary union and most particularly on progressing towards so-called banking union.  The framework for these discussions was provided by President Van Rompuy's interim report, Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union.  It was agreed that President Van Rompuy will continue his consultations with member states and others before bringing forward his final report to the December European Council, which will set out a specific and time-bound map for strengthening economic and monetary union.  Importantly, leaders reaffirmed their commitment from June to break the vicious circle between banking and sovereign debt.  Heads of State or Government also clearly reaffirmed the commitment to provide for the possibility of recapitalisation of euro area banks by the European Stability Mechanism.</p><p> With the single supervisory mechanism, a critical step in the creation of a banking union, leaders have now agreed a clear timeframe for its entry into operation as a matter of priority, with its legislative framework concluded by the end of this year.  Work on the operational implementation of the single supervisor is to happen during the course of 2013, and this concrete timeframe is most welcome.</p><p> The European Council tasked the group of finance Ministers, including our Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, with drawing up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisation by the ESM in full respect of the June decisions.  This too is a positive outcome.  Leaders also adopted conclusions on the implementation of various aspects of the compact for Growth and Jobs.  Progress has been made in beginning to implement the various elements of the compact but it is evident that more needs to be done, and implementation is key.  Taking forward the various aspects of the compact at EU level, whether concerning, for example, the Single Market, youth unemployment or expanding opportunities for external trade, will form an important aspect of the our work in the Presidency next year.</p><p> The European Council meeting on 22 and 23 November is expected to be focused almost exclusively upon the multiannual financial framework for the period 2014 - 2020.  President Van Rompuy is aiming to conclude negotiations of the EU budget multiannual financial framework at this meeting.  The MFF will be discussed informally at a dinner with President Van Rompuy, ahead of the General Affairs Council on the night of 19 November and again during the meeting of the General Affairs Council itself.  The Cyprus Presidency has been leading on negotiations up to now.  It recently put forward a new version of the MFF negotiating box, which for the first time contained proposed figures for different elements of the MFF.  Among other elements, the Cyprus Presidency proposed significant cuts to agricultural and cohesion spending.  However, its compromise proposals have not gained the support of member states.  This happened because in some cases the amounts proposed were felt to be too large and in other cases, including ourselves, because it was felt the amounts were too small.</p><p> Negotiations will from now be led by President Van Rompuy and his team as we approach the meeting of the European Council after next week's GAC.  President Van Rompuy will shortly table a draft compromise proposal which will form the basis of discussion at the General Affairs Council.  It is expected that this proposal would seek significant cuts to the original Commission proposal, and in all probability cuts greater than those proposed by the Cyprus Presidency.  This would be welcomed by some member states but opposed by others, including ourselves.  In addition to the proposed global amount of cuts, there would also be a question of how those cuts would be distributed among the different headings of the MFF.  There is no doubt that reaching agreement on the MFF this month will be a difficult task as member state positions are far apart.  Some have quite hard-line positions, especially those who want the overall size of the budget reduced.  Some have called for very significant cuts to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and some want increased spending on cohesion.  The gaps will be hard to bridge but I am convinced that with the right political will we can get there.</p><p> How will we approach the European Council meeting next week?  As the members of the joint committee are aware, Ireland wants a properly funded and properly functioning European Union, with the right mix of priorities, fair allocation of resources and a focus on jobs and growth.  The EU must have a budget that is fit for purpose.  We are committed to supporting a vigorous, consumer-focused agricultural production base in Europe, with a commensurate CAP budget.  The EU budget must also support the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and growth while at the same time reflecting current budgetary consolidation imperatives in Member States.  We will seek to ensure that adequate funding is available for investment in economic growth and the creation of employment and that countries in our position, especially regarding unemployment, can access all EU growth-enhancing programmes.  These are our aims but we must be realistic; a deal will require compromise by all member states, including ourselves.  Nevertheless, we will try hard to get the best deal possible.</p><p> Next week's Council meeting will also take the first step in preparing for the European Council scheduled for 13 and 14 December by considering the annotated draft agenda for the meeting.  The annotated draft agenda was circulated last evening and sets out the key matters for consideration by leaders.  The December summit is expected to centre around deliberation on President Van Rompuy's final report on strengthening economic and monetary union.  This report, prepared in close collaboration with the Presidents of the Commission, the Eurogroup and the ECB should set out the specific and time-bound roadmap for moving ahead on the essential building blocks for a genuine economic and monetary union.</p><p> We will continue to engage with President Van Rompuy's team as they continue work on the final report, which I look forward to reading.  It will, I am sure, seek to guarantee a strong and stable currency, something which is clearly in our own national interest as well in the interests of the euro area and indeed the European Union as a whole.</p><p> The December European Council will also assess progress made concerning the single supervisory mechanism for euro area banks as well as on other banking-related legislative proposals.  It will provide further orientations if necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.852" nospeaker="true" time="15:40:00" ><p>Leaders will also take stock of progress made under the compact for growth and jobs and under the various Single Market initiatives.  This close and ongoing follow-up at the level of Heads of State or Government on these critical issues for the Union is something that I warmly welcome and encourage.  The European Council will further provide guidance concerning the issue of EU enlargement.  This consideration will be undertaken on the basis of the Commission's autumn assessment.  Foreign policy issues will also be addressed by leaders as necessary and where they can add value.  I appreciate the attention of the committee and I look forward to hearing its comments.  Within the time available to us, I will be happy to respond to points or queries raised.</p></speech>

I thank him for his comprehensive overview.  I have a couple of questions on the multi-annual financial framework.  I would like an update on the deliberations that have taken place on two areas, the funding for the youth guarantee scheme and the development aid programme.  I know that budgets are under pressure.  Can he give me an update, and tell me what is being said about the European wide development aid programme?  I call the second questioner, Senator Leyden.</p></speech>

I thank him for the comprehensive report.  I shall not start second-guessing him because he has a busy schedule of meetings.  I wish him continued success in that regard, particularly taking over the Presidency of the EU in January 2013.  I also congratulate him on Ireland gaining a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council next year, for a three-year period.  It consists of 47 countries.  I congratulate him, his diplomats, Bono and others who contributed to securing the seat.  The seat recognises Ireland's position on human rights and we will continue to work on human rights.  It gives Ireland an additional role and continues the work done by the former President, Mary Robinson, and others.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste welcomed the announcement by stating that Ireland's reputation had been restored.  I do not think that it had to be restored as far as human rights are concerned.  I remind him that Ireland won a seat on the UN Security Council in 2001.  It was a great success, and there were no diplomats then, so Ireland's recent success is not unique.</p><p>   I take exception to the attack made on Tr&oacute;caire by the chairman of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Charlie Flanagan.  It is unfair because Tr&oacute;caire does excellent work throughout the world, particularly in the Middle East. </p></speech>

I want to refer to the budget for the multi-annual framework.  Obviously the negotiating box by the Cypriot Presidency last week did not garner enough support.  I have already raised the issue of macro-economic conditionality of Structural Funds with the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Creighton.  I am disappointed that the matter is still being discussed.  It is a dangerous concept.  It is unfair that good social projects in, for example, disadvantaged areas along the Border or in a Border county, could see funding or workers' pay suspended due to the wider economic problems here.  I know that the EU Parliament and the Government oppose conditionality.  How does the Government propose to work with others to remove conditionality?</p><p>  There seems to have been little progress made on our own resources and there has not been agreement so far.  The Commission, with the support of enough countries, seems intent to push ahead with the financial transaction tax.  Does the T&aacute;naiste foresee a situation where the contribution of one state is calculated using one method, such as the financial transaction tax, while another country, like Ireland, outside of the financial transaction tax, will have its contribution based on the current VAT model?  What is the preferred method of own resources or contribution calculation for Ireland?</p><p>  I probably sound like a broken record because I have talked so much about youth unemployment and the Irish Presidency at meetings of the committee.  What about funding, part funding or a youth guarantee?  The Minister for Social Protection has said that she will advance the matter during the Irish Presidency.  Where does the T&aacute;naiste think funding will be found?  Figures sourced from the International Labour Organization show that the amount of Ireland's entire ESF money would need to be used to deal with youth employment.  Other member states have linked the issue to a financial transaction tax that Ireland would not be part of.  Does the T&aacute;naiste see a youth guarantee working on an EU scale?  Where will the funding be found?  Has thought been given to creating a specific funding instrument?  In broader terms, beyond following the Commission's plan in December, will the Government prioritise the fight against youth unemployment during its Presidency? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.861" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012111300004#C01000"><p>I thank Senators Leyden and Reilly for their congratulations on Ireland's election to the UN Human Rights Council.  It demonstrates the high regard in which Ireland is held by the international community.  I pay tribute to my colleagues in government, and to members of the committee and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, who promoted our case, to become members of the human rights council, through their various contacts with other states.  I also pay tribute to the staff of my Department, the diplomatic or embassy network and Ambassador Anderson, our representative at the UN in New York.  They all did an outstanding job in securing our election to the human rights council.</p><p>  There have been a number of questions on the multi-annual financial framework and the level of discussions.  We have the negotiating box from the Cyprus Presidency.  We have, along with many other member states, expressed our opposition to the negotiating box.  It falls short of the Commission's proposals that we had supported.  We expect that President Van Rompuy will present a new set of proposals in advance of the GAC meeting next week, on 22 and 23 November.</p><p>  As I said in my introductory remarks, it will be difficult to reach agreement.  There are large gaps in views between member states.  Some states have expressed a clear determination to drive down the size of the budget while other states, like ourselves, have argued that we need to have a European budget that is fit for purpose.  In particular, we need a European budget that delivers on the objectives that the European Union has, particularly the implementation of the compact on jobs and growth.  Clearly included in that matter is youth employment which is high in this country and in other European Union countries.  The current level of youth unemployment is simply unsustainable for the European Union.  We need a European Union budget that is capable of addressing the problem.  A youth guarantee is one measure that we intend to pursue during the course of our Presidency.  The Minister for Social Protection has set out her objective to pursue it through the <font color="#222222">Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO, and s</font>he shall seek agreement on a youth guarantee during the course of our Presidency.  </p> <p>While funding for the youth guarantee is not a matter for the budget discussions on 22 and 23 November, we need to ensure there is a budget to cater for it.  Regarding the specific point on development aid provision in the budget raised by the Chairman, we are anxious that there is a final package for heading 4, to reflect our development co-operation policy objectives and interests and reflecting the values of our development co-operation programme.  We support funding for initiatives that support food security and sustainable agriculture, the environment and gender equality.  In the reductions proposed in heading 4, we do not support an across-the-board cut.  The three largest instruments, the development co-operation instrument, the European neighbourhood instrument and the instrument for pre-accession, should be reduced by an equal portion if they are to be reduced.  Smaller instruments, which are strategic in nature, should be exempted from cuts as any reduction would be more keenly felt than for the main ones.</p><p> Given the EU's position as the largest humanitarian aid donor, it is important that the instrument for humanitarian aid be protected from cuts.  Regarding the issue raised by Senator Leyden, I value the work of Tr&oacute;caire over many years in promoting development aid and in its direct work on its projects and the volunteers who work with Tr&oacute;caire in many countries.  My Department works closely with Tr&oacute;caire, as it does with other NGOs.</p><p> Regarding macroeconomic conditionality, as raised by Senator Reilly, the need in principle to improve economic and fiscal discipline is accepted.  We suggest the approach should be rational, appropriate and balanced, with safeguards against unforeseen circumstances.  The modalities under which macroeconomic conditionality is applied to the cohesion and structural funds require careful attention.</p><p> In paragraph 71 of the negotiating box, we note that suspensions should be proportionate and effective to take account of the circumstances of the member states concerned.  That is in accordance with Ireland's position.  Where there is an understanding of the need to maintain fiscal and macroeconomic discipline, we have reservations about the modalities for implementation in respect of cohesion and structural funds.  We want the approach to be rational, appropriate and balanced, with safeguards against unforeseen circumstances.  We need to ensure the application of conditionality does not undermine the key aim of promoting growth, which is the best way of reducing fiscal deficits.</p><p> With regard to own resources, Ireland's position remains that is while we believe a system based on gross national income, GNI, is the fairest, simplest and most transparent and provides stability, we are willing to constructively examine all options.  As already signalled, we will not be participating in the financial transactions tax, FTT.  As stated in the Presidency paper, more information must be provided by the Commission for serious evaluation of the different proposals.  I think I have covered most of the questions raised.</p></speech>

Picking up on some of the themes raised in his address, the T&aacute;naiste touched on discussions taking place on the future shape of the European monetary and banking union.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the current situation of Greece, and reaffirm that it is in Ireland's and Europe's interests to ensure Greece continues to be a member of the eurozone and that it is facilitated in dealing with its major difficulties.  Some of the discussion that took place a year ago, regarding the idea of Greece leaving the eurozone, was misguided and dangerous.  It is essential we find a way of facilitating Greece and allowing it to work through its difficulties while continuing to be a member of the eurozone.  That should be made clear.</p><p>  My second question concerns the situation in the United Kingdom, which the T&aacute;naiste touched upon in terms of the discussions taking place on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  There is an increasingly strong stance coming from some members of the British political system with regard to a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union and its participation or non-participation in a banking union.  We have been successful at riding two horses at the same time, maintaining a close relationship with Britain and deepening political integration with the European Union.  The strong statements coming out of the British system are challenging continued deep participation in the European Union.  I would appreciate the T&aacute;naiste's views on where that stands and the choices it may present to Ireland in the future.  In support of a point made by the T&aacute;naiste with regard to the MFF and the sub-heading of global hunger, having seen the way the money is spent when I visited Malawi, it is of great importance that Ireland supports the value of the sub-heading and ensures the European Union's role in maintaining an increase in nutrition and in fighting global hunger is not affected as a result of these negotiations.</p></speech>

I warmly congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on his success in getting a place for Ireland on the United Nations Human Rights Council.  It is a great achievement and represents another chapter in the enhancement of Ireland's international role.  It is great for the country.</p><p>  I am happy to hear the T&aacute;naiste reiterate the Irish position that jobs will be central to our Presidency and that job creation is central to our agenda in the next General Affairs Council meeting.  It merits repeating that youth unemployment is the greatest crisis of our time.  It is in the region of 30% here and as high as 50% in other countries.  It is unacceptable that this continues.  Is the T&aacute;naiste optimistic that we will get the kind of funding and direct initiatives, on a Europe-wide basis and specifically here, to enhance our ability to deal with youth unemployment?  It is dealt with on two levels, at the level of reskilling and retraining and at the level of job creation.  The latter is slightly difficult, as it must come from a number of fronts, including the private sector.  There must be a direct involvement in creating jobs.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think we will get product?  Over the course of the Presidency, will there be an initiative of some substance in that area?  We are all with the T&aacute;naiste in identifying it as the greatest priority for our country and our Presidency going into the General Affairs Council meeting.</p><p>  I am happy to know that work has been agreed and is continuing on effective governance in the financial sector.</p> <p>Ultimately, that might have a satisfactory spin-off for this country and assist the work of the Minister for Finance. </p><p> The T&aacute;naiste made interesting and relevant points on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which is of significant concern.  We support the position he has taken on maintaining the absolute amount.  He does not need to be reminded that the Common Agricultural Policy is critical in achieving the 2020 objectives, our employment goals and the regeneration of the economy.  As he said, there are member states which want to reduce the absolute amount devoted to the Common Agricultural Policy.  Does he think he has built a sufficient set of alliances among like-minded states to hold the position, or as close an amount to it as possible?  Having held the overall amount under the Common Agricultural Policy, does he think he will be able to hold the power of discretion for the Government on the spending of our share of the fund?  We know best how to apply it to meet the requirements of domestic agriculture rather than have something prescriptive that might not fit in an Irish context.  Let me reaffirm that we are very happy with the priorities identified.</p></speech>

I had three questions but two of them have been touched on.  I reiterate Deputy Paschal Donohoe's concerns regarding the budget being used by certain member states to whip up an anti-EU feeling.  Deputy Joe O'Reilly commented on the CAP budget, but the T&aacute;naiste has stated some member states have called for significant cuts to agricultural and cohesion funding.  I wonder whether they recognise the role the Common Agricultural Policy plays in guaranteeing food security, protecting rural communities and preventing Europe moving towards a system of factory farming, which would be more likely to happen in the absence of a strong Common Agricultural Policy.</p><p>  On the Social and Cohesion Funds, the trend in recent years has been to support initiatives in regions as opposed to individual member states.  Obviously, there is a cross-Border role, but is the T&aacute;naiste concerned about what that trend would mean for us in the future, including the west and Galway, in particular?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.867" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012111300006#E00300"><p>I will comment on the point made by Deputy Paschal Donohoe on Greece.  Difficult discussions are under way aimed at helping Greece to return to the path of sustainability.  It is fair to say one year ago there was much public and political discussion about whether Greece would leave the eurozone.  That is not on the agenda and is not being raised as a serious prospect.  It is important to recognise that progress has been made and that it is clear that Greece intends to stay in the eurozone and that the European Union as a whole and the eurozone wants Greece to stay in it.  It will work with Greece to ensure that happens.  It is also interesting to note the discussion which has taken place in the past couple of days on whether it will take eight or ten years for Greece to work through its difficulties.  Not so very long ago there were voices in this House stating we should do what Greece was doing.  We now see the wisdom of not having doing so.  We are looking at a situation where it could be eight to ten years for Greece to work through its difficulties.  We are talking about exiting our programme next year.  The most recent discussions with the troika were in that space.  It is very important that there is solidarity with Greece.  The European Union is about solidarity and members states showing their support for others.  That will be part of the discussion.  I am glad, therefore, that the speculation about Greece exiting the currency has come to an end, as that will probably help to ensure stability.</p><p>  Ireland and Britain, our nearest neighbour, joined what was then the EEC at the same time.  Britain has always been a very important partner for Ireland in the European Union.  We have very often found ourselves on the same side of discussions and arguments.  As a consequence, we have a very special relationship.  There is a certain degree of debate in Britain about its future in the European Union.  It is very much in our interests that it remain a fully engaged member of the Union.  In bilateral discussions we have with it, we express the hope it will continue as a member.  The European Union is very important for the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom is a very important member of the European Union.</p><p>  We are anxious to ensure the provisions in respect of hunger will be maintained.  We have our own development body.  Development aid policy is very much focused on hunger and nutrition.  We were a leader in what has become known as the SUN - Scaling Up of Nutrition - movement.  We want to see these funds maintained in the budget.</p><p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Joe Reilly on youth unemployment, the sequence is that we expect there will be a package of measures which we hope will include proposals in respect of the youth guarantee and youth training to come from the European Commission in December.  The discussion on the funding of these proposals will follow and we will continue to press for an adequate weighting in the Cohesion Fund allocations for unemployment, particulary youth unemployment, measures.</p><p>  On the Common Agricultural Policy, we are very conscious that 85% of the funding allocated to Ireland through the European Union comes through the Common Agricultural Policy.  Clearly, it is a major financial priority for us to ensure we secure the right outcome.  We are working closely with other member states with an interest in the Common Agricultural Policy to ensure we secure the best outcome in the negotiations, including maximising the flexibility under Pillar 1 in respect of direct payments.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, who mentioned the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy in respect of food security and rural communities, would strongly agree with this.  Since we have placed a very strong emphasis on the European Union budget, its objective to address job creation and growth, the food sector is of significant importance in that context.  As we have seen in the past couple of years, growth in food and agricultural production in terms of its potential for economic development and job creation is of major importance.  It is not a case of either-or.</p> <p>I asked about the regions.</p></speech>

We will work to ensure there is maximum Irish access to cohesion funding at regional level.  It is not just a national policy.  We are keenly aware in the negotiations of the need to maximise our access to those funds.  We will watch the statistics relating to the relative prosperity of the regions carefully.  More developed regions need to continue to be able to access cohesion funding, particularly to tackle issues like unemployment and disadvantage.  Obviously, that is part of the discussions that are taking place at two levels, the first of which relates to the budget itself.  The second tier of the discussions that are under way relates to the distribution of the budget that will be agreed.</p></speech>

It is great that he is here in advance of next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council.  I will begin by speaking about youth unemployment.  We learned today that this country has a youth unemployment rate of 34%.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that the equivalent figures for Greece and Spain are approaching 50%.  The Seanad was honoured last week to be addressed by Professor Pissarides, who is a Nobel economics laureate, on the subject of youth unemployment in a recession.  I was struck by some of his wise words in the context of the decisions we have to make, the opportunity we will have when we assume the Presidency of the EU and the funding commitments we have to make.  He was cautious about the youth guarantee because he felt it was expensive.  As far as I know - I might be wrong in this regard - countries like Finland and Sweden which are taking this approach are investing approximately 5% of GDP in this area.  Professor Pissarides said that he feels that a four-month timeframe for employment or training is too short, given the scale of the problem.  Ireland has a long-term unemployment problem at this stage.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste's comments on that.  Is he open to taking this approach on board?  Can he see a way of influencing Europe in this regard?</p><p>  It is interesting that Professor Pissarides believes we have a massive opportunity to persuade the powers that be in the troika to split the budget between investment spending and recurrent spending on things like public service and Civil Service salaries.  He feels that a component of the budget should be dedicated to investment spending in certain areas.  For example, this week we welcomed the European Investment Bank's decision to provide &euro;50 million in funding towards public private partnerships on school projects.  He pointed to all the evidence in the IMF research of the multiplier benefit of public investment programmes, job creation projects and education and training.  The Government has committed to some job creation projects, particularly in the green economy.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste's thoughts on the decisions we need to make.  As Deputy O'Reilly just said, youth unemployment is the greatest crisis of our time.  It is a scourge that leaves a mark and a scar on people for a very long time.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste's views on how he expects to influence what is done in this area.  We have to be careful not to take the youth guarantee on board without being sure it is the best thing for Ireland and for Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.872" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012111300007#F00600"><p>I compliment the T&aacute;naiste on his success in securing a position for Ireland on the UN Human Rights Council.  I congratulate him and his Government colleagues on the tremendous effort they are putting into the whole European project at present.  I refer particularly to the position they are pursuing in the context of Ireland's need for a healthy budget.  The disparate views that emerge within the EU lead me to despair from time to time.  Some of the member states in question are in the eurozone and others are not.  If those disparate views are ultimately to be accommodated, we will end up with a mishmash of views, opinions and policies that will achieve neither one thing nor the other.</p><p>  The Chairman and I recently attended a meeting in Brussels that was addressed by Mr. Barroso.  He must have repeated the word "solidarity" at least ten times in the course of his speech.  If there is one element that is lacking in every issue that affects Europe at present, it is solidarity.  I think the T&aacute;naiste will agree with that.  Everything he and his colleagues try to do seems to be frustrated after a few days when somebody makes an offhand remark that creates ripples in the pond and is not of a cohesive nature.  I would like to draw particular attention to the budget in this regard.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the Greek example.  It should have been obvious to our betters in the European scene two or three years ago that it was not possible for Greece to emerge from the extent of the burden it was facing in the time allotted at that stage, especially in light of the nature of the Greek economy.  It was obvious to many people that it was not possible.  Would it not have been better to recognise at that stage that the system needed to be changed and made a little easier for those who were having difficulty?</p><p>  The last point I want to make is that we do not seem to be progressing in the same direction.  Everyone in Europe does not seem to be facing in the same direction.  There are those who want less of Europe and those who want more of Europe.  There are those who want integration and those who want out.  We cannot make progress in such circumstances.  If one state of the United States sought to secede from the union - I do not foresee that happening - I do not think the union could continue to be cohesive.  It does not work that way.  It is a question of unity of purpose.</p></speech>

I join others in acknowledging this country's good news on the human rights agenda.  It is indicative of the T&aacute;naiste's commitment to delivering for this country that we have secured such a prestigious opportunity to show our compassion at international level.</p><p>  I would like to raise an issue that is of great concern to me.  Like many Members of the Oireachtas, I find the news coming from Uganda particularly odious.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that the Speaker of the Ugandan Parliament has said that the Parliament intends before Christmas to pass anti-homosexual laws that would impose the death penalty on homosexual people.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, homosexuals in many African countries - particularly Uganda - suffer from severe discrimination and persecution.  The proposed legislation in Uganda would represent a serious escalation and persecution of vulnerable people in those societies.  I suggest that pressure is required from the international community, particularly from Ireland and the rest of the EU, to prevent this Bill from passing in Uganda.  I would like to ask the T&aacute;naiste if he intends to raise this matter at the EU or with our European partners.  He is aware that the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden have said they intend to cut off aid from Uganda if this legislation is passed.  This seems to be a reasonable proposal that would apply maximum pressure on the Ugandan Government.  It is simply perverse for Ireland and other EU countries to supply aid to a country that is guilty of gross human rights breaches.  Is the T&aacute;naiste in a position to describe how he plans to approach the matter at EU level?  Does the Government have any plans to suspend Irish aid to Uganda if this legislation is not withdrawn?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.874" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012111300007#F00800"><p>I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in these negotiations.  We would all agree with his statement that Ireland is in favour of a properly funded and properly functioning EU with the right mix of priorities, a fair allocation of resources and a focus on jobs and growth.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, the EU needs a budget that is fit for purpose.  I agree that it is time to break the vicious circle between banking and sovereign debt.  While there may be some disagreements across all parties in the House, at the end of the day we all genuinely appreciate that these negotiations are vitally important for Ireland and for countries right across Europe.</p> <p>The multi-annual financial framework is set to be slashed by &euro;50 billion yet we are told it will be used to stimulate growth and create jobs.  Many people would see a contradiction there.  I recognise there is pressure from other countries to cut the budget, that is understandable.  If the MFF is used to promote growth and yet it appears it will be cut, what message does that send?  Demand for this funding will be greater now than ever.</p><p> In regard to the criteria for determining which regions fall into which category for cohesion spending, the Minister mentioned the Cyprus Presidency.  Does it represent a good deal for Ireland's regions in terms of accessing EU Structural Funds?  Does the proposal from the Cypriots take sufficient account of the economic stagnation across Europe?   For those regions that come under a transition category, are there any other mitigating factors in the criteria that will allow regions, some of which are in Ireland, to access more funds or a higher co-financing rate?  A brief from the Department to the committee on the options available and where we stand would be helpful.  There is a concern in regard to the formula.  The position has changed greatly right across Europe.  Are we dealing with the realities of today or the realities of the past?  Perhaps the Minister would comment.</p><p> The Minister referred to the banking and fiscal union.  The Constitutional Affairs Committee of the European Union Parliament which appeared before the committee last week suggested that a referendum may be needed on the issue.  Does the Government have any advice on that issue?</p></speech>

I reiterate that there is no issue which is more urgent for Europe and ourselves than the issue of youth unemployment.  The level of unemployment here at 14.8% is too high and we must get it down.  That is the reason the singular focus of Government is towards growing the economy and the creation of jobs.  There is a particular problem of youth unemployment which we share right across the European Union, about which there must be an urgency to address.  This is not an issue on which we can afford to spend an inordinate amount of time holding seminars and hearings, undoubtedly worthy of comment, on what is the best way to deal with it.  There is an urgency about dealing with it.  I do not think there is a single silver bullet approach that will deal with it.  We have to deal with it at a number of levels.  The compact for jobs and growth agreed by the European Council in June is part of addressing the issue.  The &euro;120 billion committed to the compact, completion of the Single Market, the completion of trade agreements with countries outside the European Union, such as the US, Japan and Canada, all have enormous potential for growth in the EU economy as well as the measures we are taking to promote employment by attracting inward investment.</p><p>  The Commission will present the youth transition proposals in December.  I expect the youth guarantee scheme will form part of the proposal and it is an issue we want to pursue during the course of the Irish Presidency.  These measures are specifically geared to addressing youth unemployment.  I am not sure I would agree with Professor Pissarides in his view that one can make a distinction between recurrent spending and investment spending in this context, particularly in the area of youth unemployment, much of which is around issues of apprenticeship, training and further education.  It is not possible always to make the distinction between recurrent spending and investment.</p></speech>

In regard to infrastructural projects, the stimulus package agreed by the Government during the summer is aimed at schools projects, health centre projects, and the recent decision on the national children's hospital.  All of those, in addition to addressing service needs, are about the generation of employment.  There are areas where the potential for growth and employment is as much about knowledge as about infrastructure.</p></speech>

The European Union is built on the concept of solidarity.  I tend to take the more positive view.  The decisions made in June and October are clear demonstrations of solidarity.  The decision to proceed with banking union and the decision in October in regard to timelines to complete the legislative framework by the end of the year is a positive signal in regard to solidarity.</p><p>  To respond to Deputy Keaveney, we have suspended aid payments to the Ugandan Government for reasons other than the one raised by the Deputy.  The issue of the legislation which is being considered in Uganda on gay people is a matter we have already raised with the authorities there.  I raised it directly with the President of Uganda and with a number of members of the Ugandan Government.  I expect it will be pursued at European Union level.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe raised the issue of the multi-annual financial framework.  We need to reflect on what is in the glass when talking about the multi-annual financial framework and the European Union budget.  The Cyprus Presidency proposed a &euro;50 billion reduction on what had originally been proposed by the Commission.</p> <p>However, we need to bear in mind that the Commission originally proposed &euro;1,033 billion for the European Union budget for the period up to 2020.  By any standards, this is a sizeable sum of money.  While it is our position that we support the Commission's proposal and oppose reductions to it, we also need to recognise that the taxpayers of Europe provide a substantial sum of money for a common European Union budget to be used to promote initiatives for jobs and growth, support agriculture, the regions, innovation, research and education and training, develop infrastructure throughout Europe and do the many things we need to do in common in Europe.</p><p> We are pressing for the regions to receive funding.  Declines in GDP, increases in unemployment and high levels of youth unemployment are factors and criteria that should be taken into account on the basis of the most up-to-date figures available rather than on sets of figures dating back some years. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.896" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012111300002#A00500"><p>Today's meeting has been called regarding the misappropriation of Irish Aid funds in Uganda.  We will discuss the matter with Mr. Brendan Rogers, director general of Irish Aid, and his officials.  I welcome them.  Mr. Rogers is accompanied by Mr. Michael Gaffey, deputy director general, Mr. Liam Mac Gabhann, director of programme countries, and Dr. Vincent O'Neill, director of policy, planning and effectiveness.  I thank the director general for keeping me informed in recent weeks of the situation in Uganda.  He made personal calls to keep me updated.</p><p>  Members of the committee and the Irish people, who are the most important element, were disturbed to hear that &euro;4 million in Irish Aid development funds had been misappropriated by the Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda, that country's highest office.  As the committee is aware, Irish Aid has a proud history of providing development assistance to the world's poorest people and our international reputation for the quality of our aid programme is second to none.  Many members have witnessed this during their visits to a number of programme countries, particularly our recent visit to Sierra Leone.  That we are able to continue to fund the delivery of high-quality aid programmes in the midst of the most difficult economic crisis ever experienced by Ireland is a testament to the Irish Aid success story.  Most Irish people appreciate the significant work being done by Irish Aid and the non-governmental organisations, NGOs.</p><p>  However, it has always been of the utmost importance that money provided by the Irish taxpayer for development assistance reaches the people for whom it is intended.  Taxpayers need to be confident that, notwithstanding the difficult environment in which aid is delivered, money is being well spent.</p><p>  The committee's job today is to explore with the officials in charge of Irish Aid what went wrong and how the Irish people can be sufficiently reassured so that we can continue to be confident about the way Irish Aid's budget is being spent.  It is key that we reassure people that this is a one-off.</p> <p> The Government and Irish Aid made a good start.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs moved immediately to suspend all Irish assistance channelled through the government of Uganda.  A team of officials, from the Department's evaluation and audit unit, immediately travelled to Uganda to investigate the matters, as did the director general of Irish Aid and his officials.  The Government of Uganda has already confirmed that all of the misappropriated money will be reimbursed.  It is also worth recalling that it was Uganda's auditor general that discovered the misappropriation.  </p><p> The Office of the Auditor General in Uganda has had significant support from Irish Aid to supply skills and capacity building.  The independence and strength displayed by the office in this investigation is encouraging and demonstrates the value of the support and connection.  That said, it is not the Ugandan auditor who is accountable to the Oireachtas for the way in which Irish Aid funds are managed, that is the job Irish officials and officeholders.  Since the misappropriation was uncovered it was important that officials travelled to Uganda to report their preliminary findings as quickly as possible.  Mr. Rogers and his team have come here at their earliest opportunity and are anxious to share with us their findings and to tell us what happened.  </p><p> I wish to advise the witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence relating to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Rogers to make his presentation and afterwards the delegation will answer questions from Members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.898" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Rogers" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012111300003#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and Members of the Oireachtas joint committee for meeting me today to discuss the recent events in Uganda.  My organisation has appreciated their support for many years of the programme.  Without that support we would not have the programme.</p><p>  I shall start by expressing my deepest concern about the misappropriation of Irish Aid funds in Uganda.  I have watched the development of Uganda, from the mid-1980s when it was regarded as a failed state after a generation of brutal dictatorial rule and civil strife, into a stable, relatively peaceful, modern but far from perfect democracy of recent years.  Most of us will remember the depredations of Idi Amin and Milton Obote.</p><p>  I am committed to the aid programme in Uganda having served there as head of mission for two years from 1998 to 2000.  The recovery and transformation of Uganda has been made possible through the efforts of the Ugandan people, together with international donors, including a significant contribution made by Ireland.  As Members will be aware, a special investigation was carried out by the Auditor General of Uganda which discovered the misappropriation of &euro;4 million of Irish Aid funds that had been provided by Ireland specifically for northern Uganda.  As the Chairman said, our response was immediate and decisive. The T&aacute;naiste suspended all Irish assistance, totalling &euro;16 million, that was due to be channelled through the Government of Uganda in 2012.  He demanded the return of the &euro;4 million misappropriated and announced an immediate investigation into the findings of the Auditor General.  A team from the evaluation and audit unit of the Department travelled to Uganda within days and they will report to the T&aacute;naiste shortly.  He has indicated that he will release the report and he is committed to implementing any recommendations contained in the report.</p><p>  The report of the auditor general into the handling of aid funds by the Office of the Prime Minister found that there was significant financial mismanagement of the Peace Recovery and Development Plan for northern Uganda.  The PRDP had been established to rebuild infrastructure in the region after decades of conflict and the ravages of Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army.  The Auditor General found that an elaborate and sophisticated fraud had been perpetrated involving a high level of collusion that would have been difficult for any normal audit systems to uncover.  The Auditor General's special investigation found that over &euro;12 million received from Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, of which the Irish Aid component is &euro;4 million, had been diverted into unauthorised accounts controlled by the Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda and a significant proportion of these funds were unaccounted for.</p><p>  I travelled to Kampala and, together with our ambassador in Kampala, met the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance and Economic Development of Uganda.  I made it clear to the Ugandan authorities that the T&aacute;naiste and the Irish Government regarded it as absolutely intolerable that development assistance, given by the people of Ireland, should be misappropriated or diverted.  I reiterated the T&aacute;naiste's clear statement that Irish funding had to be repaid as a matter of urgency.  I emphasised that all necessary actions should be taken to pursue those guilty of the crime and that the control weaknesses identified in the report of the Auditor General be corrected.</p><p>  The Ugandan Government has since confirmed in writing that: all Irish Aid funds that have been misappropriated will be reimbursed; that the officials against whom financial impropriety has been established will be prosecuted; and that strong measures will be undertaken to tighten their internal controls.  The T&aacute;naiste has welcomed the commitment and our ambassador in Kampala will work closely with the Ugandan authorities to ensure that these actions are followed through. However, the suspension of &euro;16 million of funding due to be channelled through the Government of Uganda remains in place as we closely examine our options for engagement with Uganda in the future.</p><p>  Ireland's aid programme is strongly focused on the poorest people and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.  The Government will not provide financial support under our development co-operation programme unless it is clear that Irish money is being spent for the purpose for which it was allocated.  Funding programmes through Government systems is an important tool in achieving strong development outcomes and empowering national Governments to deliver and take ownership of the provision of services.  This is essential if the improvements that we put in place are to be sustainable in the long term but it can only take place when such systems are accountable, transparent and effective.</p><p>  In the case of Uganda, the independence and strength of the Auditor General are a clear sign of Ugandan Government accountability systems working well and the importance of assisting in this work.  Ireland has provided technical and financial support to his office for a number of years in order to build the skills and capacity required for the conduct of complex investigations.  The Auditor General also visited Ireland in 2001 to learn about our systems of accountability.  Ireland's support of the Auditor General was strengthened after the previous Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs met the Auditor General during its visit to Uganda in 2008 and it endorsed his work.  </p><p>  The findings of the Auditor General in this case are deeply disturbing and affect the excellent reputation of the aid programme.  However, the fact that the Auditor General is now in a position to make them is a demonstration of the increased capacity and the determination of progressive and forceful elements within the Ugandan Administration to enforce accountability in the use of Government and donor money.  It is only by building national accountable systems that corruption can be fought and eliminated.  If we are in a position to resume development assistance to Uganda further assistance to strengthen the Auditor General's office must be an essential component.</p><p>  Our aid programme in Ugandan is regularly examined and evaluated in order to ensure that we achieve effectiveness and value for money.  It is done in a number of complementary ways: through auditors based in our embassy in Kampala; through the evaluation and audit team at headquarters; through international accountancy firms which we commission to carry out audits; through the national audit offices of our partner governments; and through the Department's audit committee that provides an independent appraisal of Irish Aid's audit and evaluation, meets the Comptroller and Auditor General and publishes an annual report on its work.  We have invested heavily in our financial tracking systems and there is real time access to all of our financial transactions that allows us to have rigorous control and oversight of what moneys are spent in the field.  It is clear that, notwithstanding all of the checks and balances, funding programmes through government systems in more volatile regions of the world can be challenging, as we can see in this case.  We are committed to ensuring that we learn from what has occurred in Uganda and strengthen our systems of risk identification and management, as well as monitoring and audit, in order to minimise the potential for the misuse of funds in the future.  In this regard we will look closely at the conclusions and recommendations contained in the evaluation and audit team's report that will be presented to the T&aacute;naiste shortly.</p><p>  Ireland has had a bilateral aid programme with Uganda since 1994.  The programme is focused on reducing poverty among some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities in the country.  Our aid programme in Uganda is designed to reduce the incidence of HIV and AIDS; to build schools and provide education for poor children; to reduce the incidence of gender based violence; to improve government accountability; to promote protect human rights; to help develop the capacity of the private sector to provide jobs and economic opportunities for Ugandans; and, in particular, to provide support for Karamoja which is one of the poorest and most marginalised regions of the country.  </p><p>  Since commencing our work in Uganda, we have witnessed significant improvements in the quality of life for the Ugandan people. </p> <p>Peace has returned to most of the country.  Some 8.3 million boys and girls are in primary schools, compared to 2.5 million in 1997.  The HIV prevalence rate has reduced dramatically from 18% in the 1990s to just over 6% today.  Most importantly, poverty has more than halved over the past two decades.  These are real achievements which have been made possible with the support of donors such as Ireland.</p><p> Today, Uganda stands at a crossroads, faced as it is with economic and political decisions that will significantly affect its future prospects.  Substantial oil reserves have been found in the west of the country, which have the potential to double Uganda's total income within ten years.  However, this oil wealth will also bring many challenges.  Uganda has the potential to achieve sustainable development for all her people.  In order to build on this, the Ugandan Government must strengthen its response to corruption.  This can only come from strong political leadership and from the development of more transparent and accountable systems.  Development partners are ready to support Uganda to achieve this but we want to see compliance with the systems and the full application of the rule of law for any wrongdoing by officials.</p><p> Ireland has a strong relationship with Uganda, much of which is due to the support provided by Irish taxpayers for our development co-operation programme.  However, it is also built on a proud missionary past.  At the turn of the last century, an Irish Franciscan nun from County Wicklow had a major impact on Uganda.  Mother Kevina had built up 90 institutions, including schools, clinics and hospitals, when she died.  Many more have followed in this proud tradition, which has had a major impact on the country.  Ugandans proudly speak about the good education and high-quality health care they received from Irish missionary institutions.  This has positioned Ireland well to hold the Ugandan Government to account over this case and to help rebuild our relationship in the future.  In the past few weeks, we have used our position to take the lead on donors affected by this fraud to impress upon the Government of Uganda in no uncertain terms the importance of taking swift action to respond to the findings of the Ugandan auditor general.</p><p> I assure the committee that we are committed to ensuring our support is used for the purposes intended, is directed to the poorest and most vulnerable in the countries where we are working and represents the best value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  We are working urgently to have Irish funds restored and are putting significant pressure on the Ugandan authorities.  The impact of the funding crisis has brought us to a crossroads in our long-standing relationship with Uganda and we must now reflect on how we move forward to ensure the money given by the Irish people is fully protected while still offering hope and assistance to the poor in northern Uganda.</p></speech>

I am sure members will not mind if I ask a question before handing over to Deputy Smith.  Mr. Rogers referred to the fact that our aid programme in Uganda is regularly examined and evaluated to ensure we have achieved effectiveness and value for money.  It is done in a number of ways: through auditors based in our embassy in Kampala, by the evaluation and audit team at headquarters, and through international accountancy firms.  Where was the money going in northern Uganda?  Four million euro is a lot of money on the ground.  Could one see at first hand where the money was going?  I refer in particular to the education and gender balance programmes, malnutrition projects, HIV projects and physical structures such as buildings.  Did our local Ugandan consultants, who are important people, have any suspicion at any stage of corruption in terms of how the money was spent?  The sum amounts to &euro;4 million, which is a lot of money to go unnoticed in the Irish Aid programme.  Much of the money is channelled through government programmes.  Was there physical infrastructure?  With all the checks and balances in respect of the team of local Ugandan consultants, who were part of the Irish Aid advisory group, why was this not spotted by Irish Aid people?  Could this be happening elsewhere?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-13a.901" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Rogers" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012111300004#C00300"><p>Uganda is a very risky place in which to work.  The sum of &euro;4 million represented phase 2; the first phase involved &euro;3.2 million, which went where it was supposed to go.  We are one of the only donors to have placed an office in Karamoja to examine the infrastructure that has been built on the ground.  Our team in Kampala travels regularly to Karamoja, which is an inhospitable spot.  Two or three years ago, one could travel in northern Uganda only with flak jackets and armoured personnel carriers.  Now, one can walk around the area and life is coming back to the 55 districts.  Northern Uganda is approximately the size of Ireland and was essentially a wasteland.  Slowly but surely, we are seeing life, infrastructure and hope return to the area.  Our funding and the funding of the Government has been making a difference.  There is a lag between putting money in at the top and seeing what is happening on the ground.  I assure members there has been an enormous change.  When the members of the committee come to visit, they will see what is happening on the ground.</p><p>  Should we have found out about this matter ourselves?  We would have found it out eventually.  When we looked back at where money was spent on the ground - when we looked at the government budget and our budget - we would have seen that the funds did not reach the area.  There was a gap.  However, at the top, the key organisation and institution of the Ugandan Government with responsibility for examining government systems is the auditor general, who has a team of 400 people working with him.  They are highly trained and highly competent.  Their capacity has been built up from the money provided by Ireland and other donors.  The office of the auditor general has enormous capacity and special investigative powers.  Its staff were able to go in at the top - into the office of the Prime Minister - to examine what was happening, and saw very quickly what was happening.  They identified a sophisticated collusion among a number of people in different Ugandan Government departments.  One could not have anticipated it.</p><p>  We will have to examine our risk profiles.  In the past, we looked at risk in districts, further down the line, with procurement and capacity issues.  Risk was determined in respect of whether the money would reach the ground.  Many of the donors working together had looked at the systems and said that, in general, they were fit for purpose.  A joint assistance framework is a very sophisticated system, with donors and the government looking at the overall public financial management system.  In general, they said the systems were reasonably fit for purpose.  The risk for us was at the bottom.</p></speech>

The embassy put the money into the Bank of Uganda.  It goes in at that end but we were also monitoring at the other end.  Other donors were not necessarily doing so.  We have an office in Karamoja with an employee of ours working there all the time.  There were regular visits from the embassy.  It is a remote and difficult environment.  When I went there in April, we looked at the effect of the programme on the ground and examined schools and infrastructure.  We went to the local offices where we wanted to see additionality.  The Government is putting money into Karamoja but this programme adds additional money.  We wanted to see, in the books of the local authorities, that the additional money was arriving, that it was being used properly and that it was having an effect.  One can see the effect on the ground.  If that was the case, how did we not see that &euro;4 million had not arrived in Karamoja?  The point made by Mr. Rogers is correct.  Our first contribution of &euro;3.2 million was put into the PRDP in October 2010.  We put in the sum of &euro;4 million in July 2011.  There is a timeframe for public expenditure and procurement in any country, as there is in Uganda.  We were seeing progress on the ground but in April 2012 we did not see the full effect.  We would not expect to see the full effect of the &euro;4 million, which would come later.</p> <p>The positive aspect of this very difficult situation is that the discrepancy was found by the Auditor General.  I am convinced that it would have become evident through slower activity and delivery on the ground in karamoja and we would have been able to raise our concerns and point it out.</p></speech>

I imagine it would be this year.  That is not to be exact on the exact timeline.</p><p>  When I was there in April, the second phase of the <font color="#222222">Participatory Rural Development Project </font>programme, PRDP 2, was underway.  There were some concerns among our staff on Ireland continuing its funding of the PRDP 2 .  There were concerns that there would not be sufficient engagement between the donors and the Office of the Prime Minister, which is managing it.  We held off on committing to that programme.  The second phase of the programme was announced on 20 June, the press release from the Office of the Prime Minister mentions Sweden, Denmark and Norway.  We needed more time to work with them on the level of engagement there would be with donors.  We were not ready to do that until later in July.  However when it came to September, the time to make our first contribution to the PRDP 2, there were concerns about the investigation, the audit.  The decision not to make the contribution and commit the money for 2012 was taken before there was any knowledge of fraud and before the report of the Auditor General.  That was not because of a suspicion about the Irish funding in 2011 but about how things were going in regard to the second phase of the programme.</p></speech>

It is welcome that we are getting an early report on what is intolerable behaviour at official level in Uganda.</p><p>  Every Minister reports the expenditure profile of his or her Department to Government on a monthly or bimonthly basis.  Why did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade not have an ongoing expenditure profile system in place when it has dealings with authorities in countries in which governance is not at the level we would wish?  Mr. Rogers stated that outside firms were brought in to carry out auditing in the embassy as well as the auditing conducted by head office.  There needs to be an ongoing expenditure profile system when substantial sums are involved.</p><p>  Mr. Rogers outlined the progress that has been made and the return on Irish taxpayer's money.  In the current circumstances this story would get substantial coverage.  We face many challenges and we want to ensure the effectiveness of Irish aid.  Mr. Rogers mentioned that the report will be given to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade shortly.  When does he expect that to happen?  Have Irish embassy staff in Uganda ongoing contact with the other donor countries on their auditing systems?  Has he concern in respect of the oversight of funding provided to NGOs and how the money is spent on different programmes in Uganda and elsewhere?</p></speech>

A team is working on the report independently.  It will be presented to the T&aacute;naiste and I presume it will be available publicly within six days.</p><p>  The team will carry out a forensic examination of our systems, which are obviously are not perfect.  We must put our hands up.  Money has disappeared so there is room for improvement.  We must embrace the recommendations.  We will do that.</p><p>  On the question of expenditure profiles, we carry out very detailed expenditure profiles on the money that leaves the system to go to the NGOs, government or other international organisations.  Northern Uganda is remote, and Karamoja is one of the 55 districts which are inhospitable remote places.  They are only coming back to life.  There are very detailed district plans which have been budgeted for and the additional funds from the PRDP programme are measured.  The money was coming down and was being measured.  Clearly, Ugandan Government money was coming down into the system.  The gap in the donor funds had not been reached yet.  I examined some of these profiles in the past couple of months and what was quite clear was that the amounts of money going into the districts had dipped.  It was way below what it should have been, which now would be a red flag matter.  We would then work back into the system again.</p><p>  The Ugandan financial system has been evaluated as being reasonably robust by the World Bank, the IMF and FID.  The British carried out a fiduciary risk assessment and we use these assessments all the time because they are highly technical and have been done by experts.  Our view is that on balance the risk is reasonable.  What happened with these funds is that they did not go into the system.  They went into a holding account, because we wanted to mingle them with the other donor funds and collusion at a very high level was required to go into the system and extract those funds before they went into the Treasury.  To see collusion at that level is a matter of grave concern.  That is the reason we had to take the serious decision we did.</p><p>  We have been working very hard and Mr. Michael Gaffey has taken the lead on this in the past couple of years to work with NGOs to improve their results focus and accountability.  They have made real improvements.  We work in very difficult and risky environments.  All of us, NGOs, international organisations and Department officials must try to mitigate that risk to the extent possible.  Clearly we did not put enough focus on the risk at the very highest level.  Neither did the other donors, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.</p><p>  We work very closely with other donors.  There are a number of donor groups in Kampala, meeting all of the time and exchanging information.  I can say hand on heart that this took those other donors completely by surprise.</p></speech>

We go forward, having learned the lessons from those mistakes.  What facilitated this misappropriation of moneys at the highest level?  It is ironic that northern Uganda is the place that is in greatest need of aid, and yet that is the area from which they chose to misappropriate the money.  Mr. Rogers mentioned in his report about building national accountable systems by empowering national governments.  How does one empower national parliaments?  It does not appear that the African parliaments have the role of holding the government to account, as is the case in Ireland.  Is there a need for more training and capacity building in that area?  What was the reaction in Uganda to the uncovering of the misappropriation of funds?</p></speech>

There was collusion between a senior official in the Office of the Prime Minister, senior officials in the Bank of Uganda and a senior official in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development.  The Ugandan system is quite complex.  One cannot take money out of the system unless there are signatures, endorsements of those signatures, the use of passwords.  It is quite a sophisticated process and the Auditor General has pointed that out in his report.  Our investigative team will be looking at what exactly happened.  This was not an easy thing to do.  It was unprecedented to have people in those three systems.  Some 17 people have been interdicted, more are to be interdicted and two have been already charged, including the principal accountant in the Office of the Prime Minister.  This is at a higher level than any other donor had ever anticipated before.</p> <p>It took our breath away, which is the reason we had to respond quickly.  There could be no &quot;ifs&quot; or &quot;buts&quot;.  In our joint financing arrangement with the Ugandans, we have a system in place whereby we have dialogue if something goes wrong.  In this case, we decided not to avail of this dialogue because the matter was too serious and we had to halt operations immediately.  That is what happened.</p><p> I met the Ugandan Minister for Finance and he was horrified by what occurred because it goes to the heart of the system when one has collusion of this type.  As we speak, a new system featuring voice and fingerprint recognition is being introduced.  I hope this issue will not arise again. </p><p> As part of our governments programme, we are focused totally on parliaments.  When we say we are assisting through government systems, we mean everything related to governments.  For instance, the assistance we provide to parliaments, auditors general and human rights commissions is considered government assistance, which is an all-inclusive term.  We have been working with Parliament in Uganda for a number of years and I hope this programme, which has stopped, will continue.  </p><p> On the reaction in Uganda, I was amazed to find on my return to the country after some time that Ireland and the other donor countries are dominating newspaper headlines.  Our ambassador has been leading the charge with meetings with the Ugandan Prime Minister and other Ministers.  Members of Parliament from northern Uganda, including Karamoja, travelled <i>en masse</i>to Kampala where they demanded and received a meeting with the President and met our ambassador at the Irish embassy.  The issue has been addressed in Ugandan newspapers almost daily and has energised civil society.  I understand people are wearing black and removing their shoes to indicate its importance. </p><p> In the 20 years I have known Uganda, I have never experienced such a cataclysm through the country's system, from top to bottom.  While the Ministers to whom I spoke were in shock, they allowed this type of corruption to grow unchecked and recent developments are the result of that.  This is the first time donors have been so united.  Ireland has taken a lead in this matter. </p></speech>

As he will be aware from previous discussions with officials, Irish Aid is fully aware of the importance of providing absolute support for parliaments.  Given that those who are best qualified to hold governments accountable are elected representatives, parliaments must be a vital part of our programme.  We work with and support the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, and other groups working in this area.</p><p>  The role of the Ugandan Parliament is crucial.  As Mr. Rogers noted, this can be seen in the reaction in Uganda where this issue has caused uproar among parliamentarians, especially those who represent northern Uganda, the intended destination of the relevant funding.</p><p>  As part of the aid programme, for some years a group of donor countries has been providing support for what is known as the financial management and accountability programme, otherwise known by the acronym FINMAP.  Under the programme, the donors work with institutions of government to build up accountability.  Donors are providing $60 million in the current three year phase of the programme.  The &euro;1.3 million per annum Irish Aid has budgeted approximately for FINMAP is part of the money that has been suspended as it is aid that goes through government systems.  Within the overall programme there is strong support for the Ugandan Auditor General's office, for which funding of some $15 million over the three-year period has been provided by the donors.  In addition, well in excess of &euro;1 million has been provided for building oversight and scrutiny in Parliament.  This integral part of our programme, which works through the various systems, has been suspended.  As a result, our assistance to the Office of the Auditor General, the Ugandan Parliament and some other aspects of the programme have also been suspended because we must await the outcome of the report.</p><p>  Looking ahead to how Ireland engages with Uganda, the joint committee may wish to consider the nature of Irish Aid support to the country, what we support and how we support it and whether we should drop support to the Ugandan Parliament and Auditor General or find a way to support them while scrutinising the other ways in which we work.<br /><b></b>A question was asked about funding to non-governmental organisations.  Outside our programme budget of &euro;32 million, we will provide approximately &euro;5.5 million directly through NGOs, most of which is through our programme funding for the major Irish non-governmental organisations.  For instance, we will provide &euro;1.8 million to GOAL and &euro;730,000 to Tr&oacute;caire in Uganda.  The scrutiny of this funding has been significantly strengthened as a result of the new results-based management system in place for funding NGOs.  Under this system, the non-governmental organisations must set out in advance their programmes and the results they wish to achieve using Irish Aid funding and against which they can be measured annually.  We have significantly strengthened management of NGO funding.</p><p>  In recent weeks, representatives of the non-governmental organisations have made clear to Irish Aid and Ministers that they do not seek to become the main channel for funding for Irish aid through Uganda.  They recognise that if one wishes to achieve sustainable change for poor people in Uganda, one must find a way to work through government systems, while also ensuring the funding in question is entirely safe. </p></speech>

To what extent is consideration given to achieving greater accountability by bypassing local administration and providing direct assistance?  It would appear relatively simple to have non-governmental organisations or the donor country in question identify projects to ensure the money goes directly to the people for whom it is intended and no one is able to get his or her hands on it beforehand.  By the same token, it should be possible to achieve the same outcome with a combination of worldwide NGOs.</p><p>  How much influence is exerted by the parliaments of the countries to which we donate money?  If a parliament is ineffective, it does not make sense to expect it to defend the integrity of the programme or project.</p><p>    When Mr. Gaffey visited the region in April and July 2012, was he suspicious that something was amiss?  I suspect that someone, somewhere along the line, would have become suspicious if something of this nature was taking place.  I refer specifically to the operatives on the ground in northern Uganda who should have known that the tap had been turned off.  Was Mr. Gaffey aware of the problem?  Was he tipped off about it?</p></speech>

Since then, there has been a revolution on the continent, both a democratic one and in terms of conflict.  While conflict in Africa continues to receive much publicity, it has declined significantly.  In 1990, there were wars in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Angola and apartheid was still in place in South Africa.  Part of the revolution in Africa over the past 20 years has been the growth of multi-party democracy, imperfect as it is in the African context.  In the past ten years in particular, parliamentarians have become emboldened and empowered across the continent.  This process has been stronger in some countries than others.  For example, I note from my visits to Uganda that the country's media is freer than in Europe as it does not appear to be subject to any libel or slander laws.</p><p>  A revolution is taking place and its trajectory is the correct one.  We want to ensure that in ten or 15 years development co-operation will have been eliminated and replaced solely by trade.  To achieve this we must work with governments and parliaments and establish sustainable institutions.</p> <p>However, there will be setbacks.  I worked in Zambia for many years, both with the Department and outside the Department, when we did much direct implementation.  When I first worked at the embassy in Zambia in 1991, we did not really work through government systems; rather, we used direct implementation.  Some of it worked well and some did not.  I told the committee that on a number of occasions when I spoke to missionaries, having visited them all over northern and southern Zambia, they said that what we were doing was helping them but that they were working in schools without teachers, curriculums or books and asked that we work with the system to change the situation.  That was what shaped my thinking.  I decided there was a requirement to work with the missionaries and to continue with direct implementation, but we had to create a system so that eventually there would be no more need for development assistance.  There must be a balance and there must be systems of accountability.  We need to take the risks and we must have some appetite for risks, but we also have risk mitigation.  Sometimes we have to make judgment calls and say "Let us not go in that direction."</p><p> Direct implementation, particularly in emergency situations, is still on the table and we do a little of it.  However, our system is that we work with NGOs, with missionaries on the ground, who are getting all the intelligence, and with government systems.  We now have a powerful auditor general with a staff of 400 in Uganda, a country which in 1986 was affected by conflict and was basically a failed state.  Ireland has played a role.  There is bad news here today with regard to the &euro;4 million that was misappropriated, but there is a lot of good news in terms of the money invested over 20 years.</p></speech>

We are always extremely watchful and concerned when administering Irish taxpayers' money in a difficult environment.  If one is working on development co-operation with the poorest communities and the poorest of countries, there is always the risk of corruption.  Poverty and corruption, unfortunately, go hand in hand.  Therefore, one has to take measures to mitigate the risk.  One must be constantly watchful.  There was an old phrase that Ronald Reagan used about disarmament: "Trust, but verify."  One cannot just trust; one must also look to see where the money goes.  When I was in Karamoja with our team in April, we travelled around with the member of our staff who is permanently based there and who knows the region.  We met local officials.  We saw progress and the building of infrastructure.  We saw in the books where additional funding was coming in.  We are not remotely naive, but in regard to the particular &euro;4 million that was put into the Bank of Uganda as our contribution to the PRDP in July 2011, we were not suspicious at that stage-----</p></speech>

There was delivery on the ground.  In the coming months, as the books are examined, it should become clear that there was less money coming through.  The tap was not turned off at that stage, but it would have been gradually turned off.  We have to understand the nature of the fraud before we can come to definitive conclusions, because we have to understand how it was that money was diverted and yet it was still being delivered.  Time lag is one explanation.  It is not good enough.  We have to see the results of our investigation.  In addition, the auditor general is carrying out a series of other investigations across government in the coming months and we will have to examine those reports closely.  I would not foresee ministers deciding to end the suspension of funding through government systems before we have fully understood these.  As officials who are held accountable, we cannot accept that we do not fully know the story yet.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, the area was devastated by the Lord's Resistance Army.  We know the history of the region.  The conducting of fraudulent activities by a government to divert Irish taxpayers' money is a crime that I hope will reach the proper authorities in Uganda and lead to the jailing of those involved.  The Prime Minister's office and officials have been mentioned.  Is it premature to suggest that the Prime Minister may have been a perpetrator of the crime, or is it a case of corruption at lower levels?  If that is the case, can the officials reassure me that the office of the attorney general is safe from political repercussions?  Irish Aid, our officials and this committee should take a bow, because we have aided and empowered the Ugandan accountants in the office of the auditor general to effectively expose a crime committed against Irish taxpayers.  That is laudable and may be important down the line.  Having returned from Sierra Leone, we know the government structures are weak and need strengthening.  This will be an issue for Irish Aid in the future.</p><p>  Do the officials think the Auditor General's office is secure from repercussions?  Can they confirm that we have supported the empowerment of the Auditor General, who effectively prevented the commission of fraud?</p></speech>

That is actually not the case.  The office of the Prime Minister has a number of ministers.  It has grown incredibly in recent years as it is taking management control of various projects and programmes.  It is a vast office which has grown far too quickly, and that is one of the reasons the auditor general wanted to have a look at it.  There is no evidence to the effect that it goes beyond the chief accountant.  That is the information we have.</p><p>  In fairness to the Government of Uganda, it has given the auditor general incredible investigative powers and has set him up independently.  When the committee visited Uganda in 2008, one of the issues he raised was that, as he had been placed in the ministry of finance, he was too near the government.  He has since moved out of government and into new buildings; his staffing has been increased and he has received money to pay for good staff.  The President, apparently, has given him these special powers.  To date there has been no attempt to stymie his work.</p></speech>

For example, when he was carrying out a value-for-money study in the office of the Prime Minister and felt he was not getting enough information, he immediately called on his investigative powers and was able to go straight in within six or seven weeks.  Normally, a comptroller and auditor general takes a year to do this, and looks back on that year in his work.  The Ugandan year ends in July, and the auditor general's report was produced on 19 October, which was very fast.  That is an indication of his powers.  He has personal bodyguards with him but he is very secure.  He has a large programme, and he has the support of the public in Uganda.  What is happening is amazing; I have never seen that type of debate in Uganda before.  This is not a positive story, and I am not trying to put a positive gloss on it, but the positive part is that for the first time a country which was a failed state under Idi Amin and Milton Obote has a strong auditor general holding the government to account.  This is new in Africa in many respects.  That is the positive side.</p></speech>

What confidence can we have that fraud is not taking place in other countries in which we provide substantial aid?  We would like assurance in that regard.  Are there any plans to strengthen oversight procedures to ensure this type of issue does not arise again?</p><p> Mr. Rodgers referred to the fact that the &euro;4 million misappropriated is to be repaid.  What is the timescale for that repayment?  With regard to the suspension of &euro;16 million in aid, what is the likely outcome of the situation?  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the reaction in Uganda, but the reaction here has been quite negative, particularly on radio shows over the past weeks.  What is being done to ensure we maintain public support for Irish Aid and to ensure Irish people continue to support worthy causes abroad and help fund the underprivileged throughout the world?  There is a job of work to be done to repair the damage that has been done as a result of this.  While the situation has been handled well, people still feel that if it can happen in one country, it could be a widespread activity.</p></speech>

There was palpable anger in the division and the Department and with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State over this, because of the damage it has done to the reputation of the aid programme, particularly in view of the current circumstances here and the incredible generosity of people over generations and their continuing generosity despite the downturn.</p><p>  We must examine all our systems in all of our programme countries now.  I have already sent a message out to all of our ambassadors and all of our heads of development informing them that in view of this I want them to interrogate their systems, check they are fit for purpose and examine what auditing and valuation are being done.  This message has gone out in the past few days.  Also, over the past 18 months, we have been working with all of our programme countries on carrying out a public financial management assessment.  As I mentioned earlier, we looked at what the World Bank, the IMF and DFID have done.  Now we want to look at ourselves and had been looking at our programme countries over the past 18 months.  About four weeks ago we had just got to Uganda to have a look at its systems.  We will now have to interrogate all of our systems.  We must put our hands up and look at them all again.  We are going to do that.</p><p>  I am hopeful and reasonably confident that we will not see anything like this elsewhere.  Nothing like this has happened to donors previously.  However, we must check.  We must be clear and transparent on this rather than be defensive on it.  We will do that.  With regard to the timescale for repayment.  I went out to Uganda as soon as we suspended our aid and spoke to the Ministers.  We have a written commitment - I do not think other donors have this yet - from the Government of Uganda that it will restore the money.  That is a sovereign agreement between two nations.  Of course Uganda has budgetary systems and parliamentary oversight.  It has yearly budgeting.  We will work with them to get that money back as soon as possible.  In the meantime, nothing moves.  Therefore, the timescale is as soon as possible.  However, we are reasonable on that.  We want to get the money back and want to use it for the purpose for which it was intended.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State will have to take the decisions on that.  We have the &euro;16 million.  We kept to our word and took that back and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State will decide what to do with it.</p><p>  The negative publicity is very dispiriting.  The people of Ireland have been incredibly generous.  They are incredibly generous during emergencies and were incredibly generous during the tsunami, when we had one of the highest rates of personal contributions in the world.  They were incredibly generous towards Haiti.  When we have polled people, they have been very supportive of the programme.  However, in the current environment, when they see &euro;4 million going missing and are aware of what the situation here at home, the reaction is of course negative.  We need to assure them of what is happening to their money.  Over the past few years there has been much more openness and transparency about the good work being done.  When Irish people are asked whether we should support that work, they say "Yes".  Of course they say misappropriation such as this is appalling, wrong and criminal and this affects their attitude negatively.  Therefore, we must all work together on this over the coming years.  That is why we are so angry.</p></speech>

A positive outcome from today's meeting will be the message relating to the good that has been achieved in Uganda. In the 1990s, 18% of the population had HIV-Aids, but that this is now down to 6%.  Some 8.3 million children are now in schools there and poverty has been halved.  These are the positive stories that emerge, on the back of this negative criminal act.  It will be good if the positive message goes out from here today.</p><p>  I believe people want us to do things differently in the future.  Mr. Rodgers spoke about investing heavily in financial tracking systems and real time access to all financial transactions, allowing vigorous control and oversight of where moneys are spent in the field.  Will he expand on that?  If he cannot do so today, will he get back to us with regard to the systems in place for this?  The fact the misappropriation was discovered by the Office of the Auditor General in Uganda and the fact this committee and the Department had a role in training and upskilling that Department is positive.  However, it also highlights the fact that many people working with Irish Aid and familiar with that area were not aware of what was happening.  It is important to broadcast the fact that these systems that work and support countries are being put in place.</p><p>  I do not understand what happened with regard to Denmark, Norway and Sweden.  What did they do differently?  What we did seems to have worked, but they have not received a written commitment with regard to their moneys.  I presume their reaction was similar to ours and that they are annoyed with what happened.  However, they seem to have taken a different approach.  Did Ireland discuss the issue with them before the misappropriation was made public?  What was the timescale with regard to this being discovered and it being made public?  Was there agreement between the countries involved with regard to taking a similar approach or did Ireland go and do its own thing?</p><p>  Yesterday, it was announced that Ugandan Government officials are planning to create stronger anti-homosexual laws and that they hope to pass a Bill before the end of 2012.  I presume the Department is aware of this.  Have concerns been raised with the Ugandan Government on this?  Will this impact negatively on Irish Aid's good governance work?  What will Irish Aid do differently in the future?  What does it need to do differently and what does it need to watch out for?</p><p>  Deputy Byrne spoke about being in Sierra Leone recently and visiting some of the projects in which Irish Aid is involved.  What do delegations from this committee need to watch out for in the future?  People put the responsibility on those who visit projects in these areas.  Perhaps we should not just look at the success stories, but also at financial transactions and how they operate with regard to these projects.  I do not know if this has happened in the past but it would be a positive result from this meeting.</p></speech>

We take the risk and make a decision where a country is not ready for that.  I agree that when delegations from this committee travel to projects, they should not only see the good work but should look into some of the technical aspects of the audit and evaluation.  A day should be set aside for that and Irish Aid should make a presentation on the issues before the delegation leaves Ireland and when it arrives in the country in question.  We would welcome that as something new and important.</p> <p>We keep in very close contact with the other donors and work closely with them.  They work with their own headquarters, at their own pace and they have their own political systems to go through.</p><p> In terms of the timeframe, the Auditor General's report became available to the Government of Uganda on the evening of Thursday,18 October.  The Auditor General called in the criminal intelligence directorate, CID, the head of police and a number of heads of departments and gave them the report.  We received the report the next day, Friday, and were the only ones to receive it that day.  We circulated it to the other donors over the weekend.  We had the report over the weekend.  I saw it on Tuesday, 23 October and we suspended our activities on Thursday, 25 October.  We reacted almost immediately.  We were in touch with our donor colleagues and we told them what we were going to do.  We felt we had to tell them that.  They were obviously having their own discussions.  The other three are part of the Nordic group and wanted to issue a general statement with which they could all agree.  We wanted to move quickly.  We were lock-step, more or less, but we were certainly out front.</p><p> On the ground, our ambassador was co-ordinating with them and arranging a meeting with the Prime Minister.  I went out with a very clear agenda, I am afraid.  We worked with the other donors but we had an agenda which we wanted to get across very clearly, through the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, regarding the seriousness with which we regarded this issue.  We are a good partner in Uganda.  They regard us as a country that has stood by them, that has no colonial history in Africa and that is a good friend.  To lose us as a friend is a major issue in Uganda.  We have influence there.  The Nordic donors are also considered to be very good friends of Uganda.  I am not sure if they got a letter but we received a letter quite quickly.  The Prime Minister announced a number of days ago that moneys would be restituted to all four donor countries.  It is a lot of money for the Ugandan system to come up with.  </p><p> The question was asked as to what we would do differently in the future.  For a start, we must examine our risk profiling.  Some of this is about political intelligence, judgment calls and analysing media.  There were rumours in the media in July and August that there were problems in the Office of the Prime Minister, OPM.  We do not fund the OPM, but other donors do.  We fund through the Treasury, which is a system that is supposed to be ring-fenced.  It was the fact that officials in the OPM extracted money that was not for the OPM which blind-sided us.  There is always a lot of talk in the media but the question was whether the Auditor General could find any evidence of wrongdoing.  He went in there in a very forensic fashion and extracted the evidence quickly and that is why we responded so quickly.</p><p> Mr. MacGabhannn will say a few words on the systems but we will also write to the Chairman and outline the systems, in writing, in the next few days.</p></speech>

The level of oversight by the Auditor General, the Ugandan Parliament and the administrative system is an important element of our control system.  Mr. Gaffey mentioned earlier the support we provide to the Office of the Auditor General and the parliamentary oversight structures through the FINMAP programme.  That is critical to overseeing the support that we provide through government systems in Uganda.</p><p>  In terms of our own controls, when we initially look at a programme for a country like Uganda, we go through a complex and elaborate process to determine what type of programme is appropriate to that country and what types of oversight measures should be introduced.  That process takes almost a year.  We must work out the types of audit and evaluation system to put in place.  If we are working through government systems, we must determine what supports we should provide to make sure they have the capacity to oversee these programmes.  We have audit and evaluation systems in place.  We have our own independent audit committee in the Department, to which we report.  We have improved the capacity of our embassies with internal auditors and accountants who are charged with evaluating, auditing and overseeing the programmes on the ground.  We work with other donors too.  We have joint arrangements with donors through basket funds and we work with them to make sure the programmes are being managed properly on the ground.  We also work with the governments of the programme countries.  In Uganda we have joint arrangements whereby we sit down with the Government and other donors to examine the way in which the programmes are being managed on the ground.  We continuously assess whether the correct structures are in place to manage the programmes properly.</p><p>   Members should note that it is no accident that we have not had much fraud of this nature in the past.  Our systems have worked well and have been robust and effective in avoiding this level of fraud.  We will learn from this incident and must do so.  I wish to reiterate that we have not had serious fraud of this nature in the past because of the success of the systems that we have in place.</p></speech>

The swiftness and efficacy of their response has probably mitigated against any potential damage that could have been done to Irish Aid and that must be acknowledged.  We are all very supportive of the work of Irish Aid.</p><p>  We are talking here, in general terms, about officials from the OPM.  Can the witnesses say with any certainty, at this stage of the investigation, that elected representatives had no hand, act or part in the fraud, either by way of encouragement or direct involvement?  It may be too early to determine that but I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that question.  </p><p>  Are the witnesses satisfied that the civil service of Uganda is sufficiently independent to ensure that there was no political involvement in this particular collusion, as the witnesses described it?  If it is the case that there was high-ranking political involvement, that would have serious implications for Irish Aid's ongoing engagement with Uganda.  That would be a shame, given that Irish taxpayers have contributed enormously to the development of that country and are very proud of that fact.  Is it known whether the officials in question were political appointees or members of an independent civil service?  In the context of the legal and judicial system, Mr. Rogers made reference to the fact that two individuals have been prosecuted to date.  By any measurement, that is a swift prosecution, given that the authorities apparently only became aware of this in October.  Would the witnesses fear that in the rush to find a head and someone to blame for this regrettable series of incidents, the independence of the judiciary and the legal system might be called into question?  I know from my own contacts in Uganda that the focus in the media on this issue has been intense and the political system might rush to a response.  Are the witnesses convinced that the political and legal systems will hold up, will identify those responsible and prosecute them in a fair and just way?</p></speech>

In that context, there would be some merit in working with other donor countries, many of whom are EU members, to send out a message that there are rigorous and robust systems in place to ensure the effectiveness of the substantial aid programme.</p> <p>Those mentioned are predominantly European Union members as well.  We could work with them to send out a message calling for a rigorous and robust system to ensure the effectiveness of the substantial aid programme whether from individual member states of the European Union or the European Union.  The message should go out everywhere that the misuse or abuse of funding will not be tolerated under any circumstances.  If that message came from the European Union and other countries and it was a united and strong message from all donor countries it would be a good thing.  None of us wishes to see money provided by the British or Danish taxpayer put to misuse in those countries or for the people for whom it is intended not being the beneficiaries of such investment.</p></speech>

However, he did say that this is a difficult sum of money for a government to roll back.  Is Mr. Rogers suggesting that the money has been effectively completely stolen or is it still in some of these accounts?  Surely the process could be easily reversed.</p></speech>

How long will the investigation go on?  Are there any plans on the part of the Ugandan Government?  You remarked on the high profile nature of this case in Uganda on television, radio and in the media.  Are there any plans by any senior Government official there, whether the Prime Minister or the Ministers with responsibility for finance or foreign affairs, to come to Ireland and more or less apologise for what has happened?</p></speech>

It has asked to be given time, as has the auditor general, in order that it can assemble all the evidence.  For example, people have asked what the term "interdicted" means.  Interdicted means one loses ones job and one is on suspension with no pay.  The investigation team sought to do that when people were in their offices.  They believed that if the word got out, people would go off into the bush and they could not be contacted on their mobile telephones.  They are doing this in a clear and focused way, incrementally in order that they get all the evidence.  This is what we have been told.  Two people have been put in jail.</p><p>  While we wish to see prosecutions brought and people brought to justice, we are keen for it to be done in line with good judicial practice and with free and fair trials.  We have no wish to see a rush to judgment.  They have put it to us that they wish to do it carefully, clearly and ensure they have the evidence.  A total of 17 people have been named in the Auditor General's report.  The point about this fraud is that it occurred at a high level.  There were passwords and forged signatures involving three Government Departments.  It was difficult to detect but once it was detected, it was clear that all the tracks were apparent and all the signatures were there.  They have the 17 names and they know who did this.  I cannot understand how they thought they could get away with it.  They also stole Government of Uganda money as well.  Approximately &euro;5 million is gone from the Government of Uganda.  They were stealing their Government's money from the Office of the Prime Minister as well, as far as I know.  Several audits are under way.  As Mr. Gaffey said, the auditor general is carrying out comprehensive work across every Government Ministry, the Peace Recovery and Development Plan and the treasury.  This will take six months.  There will be a forensic investigation and perhaps things will come out in the wash about other donors as well.  There is no evidence at the moment with regard to the politicians.  If there was real evidence linking them and there was no follow up subsequently, it would have grave repercussions for our relations.  Anyway, there is no evidence and we do not know about any evidence at the moment.  Other partner countries-----</p></speech>

It is based on the British system, although I say that with quotation marks.  People know each other; one thing about Africa is that everyone knows everyone.  Anyway, they are independent.  When this was discovered I was surprised there was no reference to whistleblowers.  When there are 17 people involved there will be whistleblowers everywhere and apparently this has begun to emerge in recent months.  It amazes me how they thought they would be protected.  Anyway, we do not know that yet.  I believe more people will be interdicted and that piece by piece it will progress.  We simply do not know at the moment.  CID is carrying out its work.</p><p>  Reference was made to other programme countries.  The British permanent secretary with responsibility for development is visiting Ireland tomorrow as part of our normal contacts and this issue is on the agenda.  The British are carrying out their own forensic audit.  Ireland has been moving away somewhat from direct Government systems in recent years because Uganda is getting up on its feet and we have changed the nature of our work.  We have moved somewhat away but other donors are heavily invested and this is dangerous for them because they are really a good deal more heavily invested that us.  We will be discussing this.  We will be discussing the matter with other donors in each of our programme countries and we will make our views clear.  We will be carrying out a risk analysis and re-examining the risk levels and making a judgment.  We will be doing that in every country.  Certainly, I hope we will not be back here for something as large in another country.  However, we must investigate and interrogate each of our programmes.  The people and the Oireachtas deserve no less than that.</p><p>  The draft anti-gay Bill has been on the agenda in Uganda for three years but the Government has no appetite for it, really.  However, several people in the Parliament were promoting it.  We have been absolutely clear on it for the past three years at ambassador level.  We have made the case at every opportunity that this is against our values and principles and that Uganda is in contravention of conventions to which it has signed up in respect of civil and political rights.  We have been clear about it.  As recently as last July when the T&aacute;naiste was in Uganda he raised this at length.  Some developments have taken place which are not overly positive and I will call on Mr. Gaffey to outline them.</p></speech>

In July, the T&aacute;naiste raised our concerns at length with President Museveni over the anti-homosexuality Private Members' Bill that was waiting and that kept cropping up.  Our ambassador raises the matter regularly.  Our ambassador and staff keep in close contact with members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in Uganda.  During the past week there has been renewed controversy in part because of a dispute between a visiting Canadian minister and the speaker of the Parliament.  It appears this Bill is being brought forward again.  There is a suggestion that it might come before the Parliament in the coming weeks or before Christmas.  All I can say is that we are following it closely at embassy and ambassador level.  We are co-ordinating with other donors and other interested parties.  We will leave the Ugandan authorities in no doubt about our continuing view that this would be most detrimental.</p></speech>

It is a remarkably sensitive issue in Africa in general.  We must understand that.  However, our African partners must also understand that there are certain values that we hold to be absolutely crucial.  We have made clear that it would be a remarkably serious and detrimental development.  We hope the Bill will not come forward or, if it does, that it will be defeated.</p></speech>

The CID investigation will go on as long as it takes to bring to book all those responsible.  The work of the auditor general is continuing but he has indicated that he hopes to have it finished by April.</p> <p>He has a big team but a lot of work to do, so it might take a little longer than that.</p><p> When I met the Minister for Finance and Economic Development she said she would look forward to visiting Ireland and speaking to the Irish media, Members of the Oireachtas and the Government about all of this.

Therefore, we want the money back.</p><p>  The Auditor General has been looking into where the money went.  It was transferred to an account called the crisis management account for Karamoja.  He is examining a long series of vouchers and receipts relating to that.  The Minister said she thinks they will get most of the money back.  That remains to be seen.  Twelve million euro is a lot of money.  It cannot be spent overnight by a number of individuals so I assume they will get some of it back.  She also asked us about our own Criminal Assets Bureau in terms of going after the assets of people who are involved in malfeasance at this level.  We, obviously, said we had experience in that area and could share that experience.  The area is complex and requires legislation but we would be open to doing that if our relations get back on track.  They will not be back on track, however, until all of this is resolved and the money is back.  That is going to take a little time. </p></speech>

In June 2012, with regard to a recommendation to appoint a risk assessment officer, the chairman of the audit committee said:<blockquote><br />It is disappointing that the Department has not yet found itself in a position to implement two appointments recommended in the previous audit committee reports: designation of a chief risk officer with direct access to you and; the appointment of a professionally qualified head of finance.  The committee believes that both appointments would enhance the managerial capability of the Department.  I understand from my contacts with you that while this view is shared by the Department it has thus far been unable to progress them because of staffing limitations.     <br />I know what that is all about.  In light of recent developments, we should look at that recommendation and have a discussion with the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the earliest possible opportunity.</blockquote></p></speech>

I also commend you on your quick response on this serious incident.  All politicians have heard concerns from our constituents about how Irish Aid money is being spent.  Whether we like it or not, some damage has been done to our aid programme, but I believe we can recover.  Irish Aid moved quickly with regard to the incident and a visit by a senior Ugandan politician to Ireland to apologise for what happened would be important.</p><p>  The committee will keep in touch with the Department with regard to what is happening.  We look forward to the publication of your initial investigation in the coming days.  We may see you again after Christmas.   This has been a constructive engagement and the committee will continue to monitor and progress the investigation.  It is important for us, in our oversight, that we keep in touch with the situation to ensure that this never happens again.  One can never say it will never happen again, but improved checks and balances must be put in place so that our aid programme can continue.  We have seen its positive effect in programme countries and we know the hard work being done on the ground.  This incident was unfortunate and has caused some damage.  I hope that damage will be repaired in the near future.</p><p>  I join with committee members in welcoming the appointment of our former colleague, Mr. Barry Andrews, as chief executive officer of Goal.  I propose that we write to him, congratulate him on his appointment and suggest that the committee meet him at some stage in the near future.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p>  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the successful campaign to secure a seat for Ireland on the UN Human Rights Council.  A significant political and diplomatic effort went into getting this result.  I know the T&aacute;naiste and his officials will use this opportunity to promote a progressive vision for human rights.  I congratulate our ambassador in Geneva, His Excellency, Mr. Gerard Corr, and our ambassador at the United Nations, Her Excellency Ms Anne Anderson, who had an important role to play in ensuring that Ireland has a seat on the Human Rights Council.  The committee will write to the T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary General in this regard also.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  As there is no other business, the meeting will adjourn.</p></speech>
