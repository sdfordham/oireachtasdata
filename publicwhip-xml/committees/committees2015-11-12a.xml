During that meeting with the officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the debate strayed into the issue of burglary.</p><p>When the witnesses were being questioned, one of the senior officials in the Department of Justice and Equality made a comment that in their opinion judges were not taking burglaries seriously enough.  It has transpired that some pressure was put on that official to apologise for that remark.  That is quite significant.  Our system of Government is not exactly like the US system in that we do have a separation of powers.  Our Executive and our Legislature is rolled into one, and then we have the Judiciary.  I do not believe that it is out of bounds for one arm of the State to criticise another arm of the State if it is a genuinely held belief which is based on policy.  When I read the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015, which is currently passing through the Oireachtas, it is clear that the Department of Justice and Equality felt it was necessary to restrict judges' ability to give bail in some circumstances.  That is the essence of that piece of proposed legislation.  When one reads the Bill it is clear that there is a view within the Department of Justice and Equality that some judges are not taking the issue of burglaries seriously.  This is why the Bill was drafted.  I believe that a Judiciary which does not hold back in criticising the Legislature or the Executive has no right to expect to be above general criticism.  I do not think there is any bar within the Constitution on a senior official in the Department of Justice and Equality giving the kind of opinion that was given in this committee last week.  The matter needs to be looked at and the question asked: why was the official forced to write an apology to the President of the District Court?  What occurred at this committee last week, and after the fact, was very significant.  I will not say it was a seminal moment with regard to the separation of powers in the State, but I have never come across an incident like this in which an apology was demanded by one arm of the State from another.  This is a parliamentary committee and the official in question is a very senior official within the Department of Justice and Equality.  His view would be agreed with by the vast majority of citizens and might even be agreed with by some members of the Judiciary.  It is reasonable to ask who forced the official to write that apology.  This incident should not be allowed to pass.  There are checks and balances within the Constitution.  I do not believe the official in question crossed the line, and that should be pointed out by this committee.</p></speech>

What is the Deputy suggesting?</p></speech>

The official gave an honestly held opinion which is backed up by the legislation now going through Parliament.  The pressure put on the official to write the apology was uncalled for.  I believe the official was correct to express the view he expressed last week to this committee, and that right should be defended by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#B00400"><p>We can write to the Department to express those views and ask the question.  When an answer is received the committee can discuss the matter further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#B00500"><p>Sure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#B00600"><p>I believe that Deputy Deasy's point is important but I am not sure that what actually did transpire is quite as clear as that.  Rather than suggesting that there was interference at any level, a better approach might be to seek clarification on the remarks made in this committee and clarification on the statement that subsequently emanated from the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#B00700"><p>I understand that what Deputy Deasy is doing now is expressing his opinion.  In writing to the Department, we can put it in such a way as to seek the clarification that is needed.  Thereafter, when it comes back to this committee, it could be dealt with in a more substantial manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#B00800"><p>I read the transcript of the committee meeting in question and it is very clear what the official said on the day.  If the committee asks for clarification from the Department it will just be a regurgitation of "There was no attempt to criticise the Judiciary."  I am afraid the committee will get nowhere with that approach.  It was very clear, and I read the transcript a couple of times.  I believe his right to make a criticism of the Judiciary should be protected.  It was uncalled for to force a senior official to issue an apology after the fact.  It is a serious matter if a person in his position cannot give an opinion or a criticism of the Judiciary; according to our Constitution the Judiciary are not above it completely.  It should be perfectly okay for one arm of the State to make a criticism of another.  If the official had mentioned one judge or member of the Judiciary specifically, then he would have crossed the line and an apology would have been warranted, but he had a right to comment on the Judiciary as a whole.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#B00900"><p>That requires clarification; was it a general criticism right across the board?  There is a serious issue about criticism by one arm of the State of the Judiciary and how it conducts its business.  We need to be delicate about how we approach the issue of criticism of the Judiciary, and clarification is required before any further action is taken by this committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#B01000"><p>It strikes me that there are two issues here.  Everyone acknowledges the sensitivity and the caution which applies in making any comment on or criticising the Judiciary or anyone on the Bench.  The actual issue Deputy Deasy raises is the concern over an instruction given to a senior official to apologise for a view which he expressed.  If this committee sends a general letter it will, with respect to the system, receive a fudge in response.  I hope I am not breaching anything by making that criticism.  I would suggest that any correspondence by which we hope to gain clarification be hinged on the requirement on or the request to that senior official to write an apology.  If the official had seriously overstepped and had identified an individual on the bench then I imagine other steps would have been taken, but I believe the point raised by Deputy Deasy is a fair one.  It is ironic that there is a proposal for legislation around ethics and the conduct of public and elected officials.  One of the problems stems from the culture within the system whereby raising a dissenting voice is frowned upon. Everyone recognises that this needs to be addressed.  It is not in any way helpful if a senior official comes to an Oireachtas committee and gives a considered view and as a result gets a rap on the knuckles and is instructed to apologise.  He was not making these comments on a bus or in a pub.  It is a very worrying development which goes against the grain of what is being attempted by way of public sector reform.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#C00100"><p>If we are writing, we should ask some very specific questions of the Department.  What motivated the official to do this?  Did anyone, either political, internal within the Department or a member of the Judiciary, approach him in any way to apologise?  It is important to know how these things work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#C00200"><p>We will take the views of committee members as expressed.  While it is considered by some to be a sensitive matter, the appropriate letter can be written to the Department to get the answers.  I do not want to reduce the importance of the issue raised by Deputy John Deasy.  In my thinking, it goes along the lines of controlling and policing the committees, having one voice in the committees that does not in any way upset the <i>status quo</i>.  Frankly, this is more of the same.  While the separation of powers is important, it is also important that we hear the views and opinions of officials.  It is akin to asking the clerk not to speak at a meeting.  When democracy goes to that extent, it is a step too far.  We will write that letter.</p><p>The other matter arising from the minutes is the draft report on the issue of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  We now have a copy of it.  There is a request from the clerk that if there are amendments, members should let him have them because we will publish it next week.  We have been making some changes to the draft.  I think next week is publication date.</p><p>On HL Commodity Foods, the clerk has circulated a note on the issue.  When one reads it and recalls the meetings held, the company was treated most unfairly.  It now falls on the Shannon Group to offer some remedy to the company.  Will the committee agree to the proposals contained in the note circulated by the clerk?  It details the key facts and gives an account of the review by the committee and suggests further action by it.  In that regard, we are saying the committee can highlight what appears to have been an unwarranted action by a State agency.  It also recommends that the Shannon Group, in consultation with the Minister, consider any remedy which may be appropriate in the case.  It is extremely important that we state this clearly and make our views known.  Is it agreed to endorse this proposal?  Agreed.</p><p>We will now deal with correspondence received since the meeting on Thursday, 5 November.  No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 9 November 2015, received from the Office of the Local Government Audit Service on the Louth Environmental Group.  It will be noted and published.</p><p>No. 3C is documents for today&rsquo;s committee meeting.  Nos. 3C.1 to 3C.5, inclusive, are briefing documents and the opening statements for the meeting.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p><p>Nos. 4.1 to 4.4, inclusive, are various reports, statements and accounts received since the meeting on 5 November.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will take us through them.</p></speech>

There is a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to several issues.  The first is a recognition of a deferred pension funding asset which, as I have said before, is standard for education bodies.  I draw attention to the non-competitive procurement of &euro;2.6 million worth of services by the college.  A second point in the area of procurement is that UCD applies a threshold of &euro;60,000 for the open tendering of contracts, rather than the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s requirement for open tendering for contracts with a value of &euro;25,000.</p> <p>  The final point concerns a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners to a total value &euro;2.28 million which was finalised in February 2014.</p></speech>

First, when are the financial statements for 2014 due?  On the non-competitive procurement threshold of &euro;60,000, was it an arbitrary figure?  Is it related to the figure of &euro;2.6 million worth of services?  How are the two related?</p></speech>

There were seven suppliers with combined transactions to a value of &euro;2.6 million, which would be considerably above the &euro;60,000 threshold.  They were services that should have been procured in an open fashion.  However, we have heard previously about the practice where, say, a contract is expiring and it is then rolled over, rather than going back to the market.  Individual circumstances arise in individual cases.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requires open advertising on <i>e-tenders</i>of any contract expected to cost &euro;25,000 or more.  UCD takes a different view for efficiency and practical reasons.  It only engages in open tendering on <i>e-tenders</i>for something it expects to cost &euro;60,000 or more.  That is its routine. </p></speech>

Most of the institutes of technology - 13 of the 14, I believe - found it more efficient to engage in a framework contract because they operate on a somewhat smaller scale.

Are they trained at all?  Most of the standard small businesses throughout the country would know their obligations in relation to VAT.  It is only in the big area of transactions that it becomes technical and where these questions arise.  One wonders whether one is included or excluded in terms of paying VAT.  However, the university is providing education to future business and community leaders.  Is it not just staggering that what has been described would happen and that it would just be passed over?  Who conducts the audit and could I have a little more detail on what happened on the question of VAT?  One gets fed up listening every Thursday to the excuse that it was an error.  Usually, it is said that it is a systems failure or that it is systemic.  It is never Joe Bloggs or Mary Bloggs; it is always somebody else's fault.  I am not asking Mr. McCarthy to pin down a person but who in the college conducts the audit.  What system has the college in place?

The threshold of &euro;60,000 applies when it should be &euro;25,000.  Mr. McCarthy brings this to the college's attention.  I will not say it ignores it.  Whoever is here next year will see whether it ignores it.  It seems there is a trend right across Government bodies and Government agencies to make themselves look good, by and large, on the day they appear before us, perhaps being half apologetic about what they are doing.  The trend is to walk out the door thanking God the meeting is over and say one will go back to business.  The bodies do not change their way of doing business.  That is an issue for someone.  I am only clarifying this in my head so we can take it up elsewhere.  It is an issue for the president, who is the accounting officer, and for the HEA, which is responsible for this area.

It states:</p><blockquote>UCD has put in place procurement policies and procedures and all non-pay expenditure is required to be procured in accordance with these policies and procedures.  Instances of non-compliance identified by management or in Internal Audit reports are brought to the attention of the Head of the relevant School/Unit or budget-holder.  In framing its procurement policies and procedures, UCD has applied a threshold of &euro;60,000 above which all expenditure must be subject to tendering.  UCD does not operate the &euro;25,000 threshold set out in national public procurement guidelines as adherence to this level would be administratively challenging due to the limited procurement staffing resources available.  The current threshold of &euro;60,000 allows UCD to focus on getting best value from higher-value purchases.  Expenditure under &euro;60,000 requires competitive quotations to be obtained.  In addition, the &euro;25,000 threshold is applied to some research expenditure where this is required by the terms and conditions attaching to the particular research grant.  The UCD Procurement Office runs tenders on behalf of the university and provides support and training to staff across the university.</blockquote> <p>That is the position.</p></speech>

A matter to which I did draw attention in that regard is note No. 7 of the financial statements, which outlines the circumstances in which &euro;165,000 was distributed in error among charities in June 2014.  The commissioners set about calling back the funding and redistributing it in a more appropriate manner but, as at the reporting date, &euro;30,000 still remained to be recovered.</p></speech>

They invest the funds.  As I understand it, they distributed interest generated by making a set of decisions around the best way to apply it.  They subsequently identified that they could have distributed it in proportion to the charities whose funds had generated the interest.  They had distributed it to other charities.  It was subsequently found that it was more appropriate and fair to distribute it in line with those who had deposited the funds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#E00400"><p>I ask members to note all of these statements and accounts.</p> <p>  We will move on to No. 5, which is our work programme.  It is now on the screen.  Next week, representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will come before us.  I will ask the clerk if it would be possible to give us a list of the various breaches of procurement by the different universities, institutes of technology or the HSE or whatever it might be, so that members will have a list before them for next week.  Also relevant will be any other matters pertaining to the works of that Department relative to other agencies and Departments in respect of which we can raise issues of procurement guidelines and so on.  Does anyone wish to raise an issue on the work programme?  No.</p> <p>  I will also ask the clerk to circulate the OECD report which was published yesterday and presented to the Ceann Comhairle.  The report concerns pre-budget arrangements, scrutiny and so on by various committees.  It is a reasonable starting point for reform that might be taken up by the next Administration.  I expressed disappointment that there is not sufficient commentary in the report on the workings of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That office was mentioned in respect of informing other committees on budgetary strategies.  The one single reforming step that could be taken if an Administration were serious about controlling issues such as procurement overspend and inefficiencies within the State, would be to increase the level of resources available to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  They should be made effective right across Government Departments and agencies from the point where money is allocated to that when it is spent.  Funding and resources should be provided to cover forensic examination of different accounts where that is deemed to be warranted.  There should also be an amalgamation of local government and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  I made those points yesterday at the briefing session.</p> <p>  The sooner the Houses of the Oireachtas begin to examine that part of the balance, the better it will be for the taxpayer.  I think it is urgent and every single political party in the forthcoming election should be making an issue of this part of the administration of the State in terms of public sector reform.  We might have seen glimpses of reform but we have not seen what I would consider to be real reform, which would affect the quality of monitoring and control of the spend of taxpayers' money.  The first step should be to amalgamate those two offices and centralise power with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The resources should then be given to that office.  That would go a long way towards starting reform.  What gets counted gets done.  That is the way they should do it.  I welcome the report although I was disappointed with that aspect of it.  I ask that it be circulated to members and that we make our views known to the Ceann Comhairle.</p> <p>  Our agenda for next week is the appropriation accounts of the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform: superannuation; retired allowances; shared services; the Office of Government Procurement; Vote accounting and budget management; management of Government grants; payroll accrual for national accounts; and the national lottery fund.</p></speech>

Mr. Douglas Fannin has been in touch with me again in respect of the special investigations unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  He is extremely anxious that his case and the issues arising receive proper scrutiny and examination.  I wanted to raise this again with the committee and ask for confirmation that documentation from the special investigations unit is expected to us this week or perhaps next week.</p></speech>

This feeds in to the whole issue of poor responses from Departments and agencies to the committee.  It simply has to change.  We are in the dying moments of this game but I would encourage any future members of the Committee of Public accounts to be absolutely vigilant in their work and intolerant of the types of responses we have received from and delays to which we have been subjected by Departments and agencies.  We get an immediate response if we even verge on asking a question that might discomfit someone from the State but when it comes to getting the replies that we ask for and to which we are entitled, there is a dragging of feet.  It is poor practice and shows no courtesy or respect for a committee of this House.</p></speech>

The combined net cost of these services in 2014 was around &euro;75 million.  I issued clear audit opinions in respect of all three appropriation accounts.  No matters arising from the audits of these accounts were included in my report on the accounts of the public services for 2014.</p> <p>  The 2014 appropriation account for the Vote for the Office of the Attorney General records gross expenditure totalling &euro;13.8 million, under a single programme dealing with the delivery of legal advice and services to the Government and to Departments and offices.  Pay costs accounted for &euro;10 million of the spend.  Vote expenditure also includes provision of a recurrent grant to the Law Reform Commission, totalling approximately &euro;1.9 million in 2014.  At the end of the year, the office had underspent by &euro;1.3 million relative to its budget and that amount was accordingly liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.  Overall expenditure on Vote 3 for 2014 was down approximately 2% compared to the 2013 outturn.</p> <p>  The 2014 appropriation account for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor records gross expenditure totalling &euro;27 million under a single programme dealing with the provision of legal services to central Departments and offices.  The expenditure included &euro;14 million spent on staff pay, just under &euro;10 million spent on fees to counsel and &euro;1 million spent on general law expenses.  The balance of the expenditure was incurred in relation to administration non-pay costs.  Overall expenditure on the Vote for 2014 was down approximately 9% compared to the 2013 outturn.  Appropriations-in-aid of Vote 6 amounted to &euro;1.5 million in 2014.  These comprised employee pension-related deductions of &euro;873,000 and costs and fees of &euro;641,000 recovered by the office.  Accrued income of &euro;9.7 million is recognised on the balance sheet in respect of taxed costs due but not yet recovered.  At the end of the year, the office had underspent by &euro;840,000 relative to its budget and that amount was accordingly liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  Vote 5 presents the expenditure in respect of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The total spend on the Vote in 2014 amounted to &euro;37.7 million, with little change year on year.  This comprised &euro;13.4 million spent on fees paid to counsel, &euro;12.6 million spent on staff pay, &euro;6.4 million spent on acquiring local state solicitor services and the balance of &euro;5.2 million spent on general law expenses and other non-pay items.  Appropriations-in-aid in 2014 amounted to just under &euro;1 million, again with little change year on year.  These mainly comprise employee pension-related deductions.  The surplus for surrender at end 2014 was small, at around &euro;136,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam O'Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#F02600"><p>I am pleased to come before the committee to discuss the 2014 appropriation account of the Office of the Attorney General and the 2014 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  As background, I will provide a brief overview of the office and its work.  Our primary role is providing support to the Attorney General in discharging her functions as legal adviser to the Government pursuant to Article 30 of the Constitution.  To that end, we provide two main services to our client Departments, namely, legal advice and legislative drafting.  The advisory side of the office is organised into five specialist groups.  This allows the members of the group to become expert in those areas and provide a high level of expertise to clients.  There is constant contact between the groups and their client Departments, including meetings specifically to review the service being provided and discuss future developments.</p><p>The scope and variety of the legal work is very wide, with new areas of work constantly appearing and developing.</p><p>  The legislative drafting service is provided through the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  That office is organised into four groups, each serving a number of specific Departments, and this enables the drafters to build up a high level of familiarity with the Department's work and objectives, which then facilitates drafting on complex topics.  Like the advisory side, there are continual meetings with clients to ensure that the service provided meets their needs.</p><p> Much of the work of the office, particularly of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, is primarily driven by the Government's legislative programme.  Members will be aware of the extensive programme which places heavy demands on the office in the formulation of advice on legislative provisions as well as their actual drafting.  Much of the advice has to be provided and the drafting carried out at relatively short notice.  In particular, there has been an enormous increase in the number of amendments made to Bills during their passage through the D&aacute;il and Seanad.</p><p> The administration side of the office is an essential support to its legal work.  It is organised into a number of business units which cover the following:  human resources, finance, library and knowledge management, information technology, change management, training and development, corporate services and registry.  Senior management participate in the office's  management advisory committee while all staff are represented on the office partnership committee, as well as a number of partnership sub-committees on specific issues.</p><p> The office constantly reassesses the need to provide legal services to its wide range of clients and seeks to ensure that its lawyers are fully trained and resourced.  This involves making sure that legal staff are fully expert in their areas of legal work and have at their disposal all resources to do their work to the highest standard required by Government.  Law is constantly changing, through case law and new legislation, and is constantly being reinterpreted.  New developments of law emerge continuously, including through the actions of the European Union and its Courts of Justice as well as the European Court of Human Rights and changes in international law.  This means that the lawyers and the administration in the office must work together to ensure there are high levels of legal expertise and high standards of service delivery to our clients.  Everything that we do is focused on achieving this aim. </p><p> Knowledge management and information sharing is a central feature of how we operate.  Precedents, procedures and practices are recorded and made available as appropriate to staff.   In order to ensure that staff skills, particularly legal skills, are kept up to date and developed, the office promotes training as part of the performance management development system.   The office is consistently able to indicate one of the Civil Service's highest rates of compliance with the PMDS process and for 2014, the rate was 96%. </p><p> We work very closely with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, a component part of the office, in providing legal services and also share MAC, IT systems, knowledge management and an audit committee with it to ensure there are economies, efficiencies and expertise.  We also work closely with lawyers placed in Departments and offices.</p><p> As part of the diversification of the model of delivery of legal services, and in recognition of the expanding need for legal input at an early stage in Government Departments, the office has run a highly successful secondment programme since 2006, whereby advisory counsel from the office are placed as legal advisers within Government Departments.  In 2014, the office had 23 legal advisers seconded across 15 Government Departments and offices.  Currently, there are 18 across 13 Departments and the Irish Prison Service but following a recruitment process, former numbers will be restored with additional placements being planned.  The office also assigns an advisory counsel as legal counsellor to the permanent representation of Ireland in the European Union in Brussels.</p><p> The Office of the Attorney General is fully committed to public sector reform.  The work of the office is extremely specialised and demand-led.  We do not operate public programmes, as do other Government Departments, so it is not possible for the office to make savings or gain efficiencies through eliminating or restructuring such expenditure.  Nor is it possible to unilaterally decide to divest ourselves of work that our clients, the Government, Ministers and Departments, require us to carry out.  Our contention has always been that maintaining a high level of legal service in the provision of accurate advice and legislation and in the management of litigation results in savings and also the avoidance of significant costs to the State.  That is not to say that within the flexibilities available to us we have not been able to achieve significant savings.  As part of the public sector reform process, the office, since 2010, has prepared, implemented and reported on several action plans to effect change and achieve savings.  The office has consistently reduced its annual administrative costs.  By the end of 2014, compared with 2008, our gross budget had been reduced by 22.9% while our net expenditure was 22.5% lower.</p><p> For 2014, the office operated on an administrative gross budget of &euro;15.1 million of which the outturn was &euro;13.9 million.  A significant proportion, &euro;10.8 million, or close to 71%, of our budget was allocated to salaries.  This high proportion reflects the fact that the office is a legal professional organisation that provides legal services to the Government and Departments and does not have expenditure programmes.  The next largest allocation is the &euro;2.1 million, which is about 14% of the budget for the Law Reform Commission, which is channelled through our Vote as a grant-in-aid.  The remaining &euro;2.2 million, or 15%, is allocated to training, IT, premises and telecoms.  </p><p> During 2014, the office had savings of &euro;1.2 million.  The majority, or &euro;833,000, arose in subhead A1, which is salaries; &euro;279,000 arose in subhead A2, which is contract legal expertise; and &euro;139,000 arose in  subhead C, which is the Law Reform Commission.  The savings in salaries arose due to the time required to seek sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to run recruitment competitions and to fill vacancies.  The savings in subhead A2 arose due to a move to minimal reliance on contract drafting expertise.  The savings in the Law Reform Commission were due mainly to staff changes.  In all areas of expenditure, the office closely monitors and controls expenditure to ensure an appropriate use of funds and maximum value.  Each month the office's management advisory committee is briefed on the office's financial position, including such issues as the formulation of annual budgets and measures required to meet savings or staffing targets imposed by the Department of Finance.</p><p> The office operates a financial management system which greatly assists me and also informs the monthly presentation on financial matters to the members of MAC.  There is ongoing development of an interface between the financial management system and the case records management system to allow for the development of costing as well as enhanced financial and non-financial management reports. </p><p> In conjunction with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, my office has an audit committee.  The committee includes three members from the private sector, one of whom acts as chair.   Each year the committee agrees a programme of audits.  The resulting reports and recommendations are presented to the local management advisory committees and made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In late 2014, the Attorney General's Office and Chief State Solicitor's Office, jointly decided to put their internal audit work out to commercial tender.  Following that process, an external audit partner has been selected and has carried out several audits so far this year.</p><p> I will finish by saying that the need to ensure the State gets best value for money in public expenditure is fully appreciated by the office.  In the past five years, we have reorganised staff and our work in order to operate within the financial parameters set down by Government while still maintaining the expected high level of service.  Our main challenge will be continuing to adapt in order to ensure we meet the demands of our clients.</p><p> That concludes my brief overview of the work of the office and its organisation.  I am ready to answer any questions the members of the committee may have.  I thank the committee for its attention.</p></speech>

Before discussing the appropriation account, it might be useful if I gave the committee a brief overview of the work of the office and the more significant developments that have taken place in recent years.</p> <p>  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions directs and supervises public prosecutions and related criminal matters.  The office has two legal divisions - the directing division where decisions are made in the more serious cases as to whether there should be a prosecution and what the charge should be and the solicitors division which implements those decisions and represents the director in all the criminal cases in Dublin, as well as in constitutional and judicial review matters.  Outside of the Dublin area, there are 32 State solicitors who provide a solicitor service in the Circuit Courts and in some District Courts matters in their local areas.  These are solicitors in private who are employed on a contract basis to act on behalf of the director.  The two legal divisions of the office are supported by a policy and research unit and an administration division which provides HR, IT, finance and support services.</p> <p>  Since our last appearance before the committee, the office has established a small number of dedicated units to deal with new and specialised areas of work which I think is something that I should mention.  In 2011, a specialised financial unit was set up to deal exclusively with fraud and white collar crime cases.  The unit was initially staffed by two lawyers but it has expanded over time and now comprises five lawyers together with administrative support.  The nature of the work in the unit is such that very large amounts of documents need to be analysed and presented in court.</p><p>To facilitate this, the unit developed skills in the area of electronic collation and presentation of evidence.  Working with the Courts Service, the office has successfully presented a number of cases making extensive use of technology. <br/><br/>As the committee will be aware, in November 2014 a new Court of Appeal was established.  This resulted in a sharp increase in the number of criminal appeal cases to be dealt with by our solicitors division in court.  Sanction was obtained by the director to recruit three additional staff to deal with this increase in workload and a dedicated appeals section was established in the solicitors division of our office.  By July of this year, the Court of Appeal had processed a total of 280 criminal appeal cases.<br/><br/>As a result of the transposition of the EU victims directive, our office set up a dedicated communications and victims liaison unit in July of this year to deal specifically with this area of work.  Sanction was sought and granted for two lawyers and three administrative support staff for the unit.  The unit is responsible for developing the structures and procedures required to ensure the rights of victims and their families, as set out in the directive, are implemented in so far as they apply to the work of the office.  The directive will have direct effect on 16 November 2015, which is next Monday.  Under the directive, victims and the families of victims will have the right to seek reasons from our office when a decision is made not to prosecute, and also to ask for a review of a decision not to prosecute.  I should say that this builds on work we have been doing to date whereby there has been for many years a procedure for a victim to look for a review of a decision.  We have, since 2008, given reasons in fatal cases.<br/><br/>In 2014, the office dealt with just over 14,000 new prosecution files.  This represents the first increase in the number of files received since 2011 when we recorded the highest number ever of new prosecution files.  The complexity and size of files submitted in more serious case categories continues to increase, particularly in the area of fraud and white collar crime.  While the actual number of files received in white collar crime cases is low relative to other offence categories, this area of work, as Deputies can imagine, is very resource intensive because of the amount of material submitted in these cases and the complexity of the issues involved.  The total number of prosecution files received in the office, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of the level of resources required to deal with them.<br/><br/>The files now being submitted to the office by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na generally relate to more serious and complex matters.  This is because under section 8 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda is given a general consent to prosecute in less serious cases without reference to the office.  The general consent has been extended by the director to include a broader range of offences that can be prosecuted by the Garda without reference to the office.  The effect of this has been a reduction in the numbers of files submitted to the office in less serious cases.<br/><br/>Specialised regulatory agencies also submit files to the office.  These include the Revenue Commissioners, the Competition Authority, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Health and Safety Authority, local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  By their nature, files received from these agencies tend to be large and involve complex legal issues.<br/><br/>As the committee will be aware from the appropriation account, the total cost of running the prosecution service in 2014 was &euro;36.7 million.  The largest single area of this cost arises in relation to fees we pay to counsel who prosecute cases on behalf of the director.  In effect, we outsource advocacy work in the higher courts to prosecution counsel.  While the total amount paid in fees to counsel has increased in absolute terms in recent years, I would highlight that in response to the economic downturn, our office applied cumulative reductions of 24% in the rate of individual fees paid to counsel between 2009 and 2011.  These reduced rates continue to apply.<br/><br/>In 2014, counsel fees accounted for 37% of the total cost of the prosecution service.  It is important to note that the amount paid in counsel fees is demand-led and is driven by the number and, in particular, length of trials heard in the various criminal courts.  The office does not have control over the number and types of cases scheduled for hearing by the courts each year.  The establishment of the new Court of Appeal is also having an impact on fees paid to counsel.  This year to the end of October, fees amounting to &euro;944,000 were paid to counsel for appeals compared with total fees paid for all of 2014 of &euro;581,000.<br/><br/>The second largest expense for the office is salaries paid to staff which accounted for 34% of the total expenditure in 2014.  In common with all public sector organisations, the office operated within very tight staffing constraints in recent years and saw a reduction in staff numbers.  Arising from sanctions to recruit a small number of additional staff to deal with new areas of work, such as financial crime, the new Court of Appeal and the EU victims directive, staff numbers have risen to 190.  This is still well below our staffing complement of 196 from 2011.  Of the 190 staff employed by the office, 111 are legal staff and the remaining 79 are administrative support staff.<br/><br/>The State solicitor service and law costs awarded against the office are the two other largest areas of expenditure, at &euro;6.4 million and &euro;2.7 million, respectively, in 2014.  As I mentioned, 32 local State solicitors provide a solicitor service in the Circuit Court and some District Court matters outside of Dublin.<br/><br/>Most of the law costs arise from judicial review and <i>habeas corpus</i>applications taken by defendants.  These costs are managed through an office costs settlement policy which involves negotiating with the defence in cases where costs fall to be paid with a view to settling the question of costs without the necessity of having the matter determined by the Taxing Master.  This has resulted in a reduction in the total amount paid in costs from &euro;7 million and &euro;6 million, respectively, in 2009 and 2010.  Deputies will see from the appropriation accounts that the figure for last year was &euro;2.6 million, which is obviously a very considerable reduction.  It has also resulted in a saving of court time by reducing the number of court dates and hearings.  However, I note that this figure can increase significantly, as happened in 2012 when a small number of exceptionally expensive cases came to be settled.<br/><br/>I would like to outline briefly for the committee some of the challenges facing the office in the short to medium term which will need to be managed effectively to ensure we can continue to provide an efficient prosecution service.  I have mentioned the establishment of the communications and victims unit to deal with the additional work which will be generated by the victims directive.  It is difficult at this stage to gauge the volume of requests for reasons for decisions not to prosecute and requests for reviews of decisions that might be received from Monday next.  The office has done significant work in preparing for the directive.  Systems and procedures are in place to process and manage requests.  Our guidelines for prosecutors have been revised to ensure all prosecutors are aware of their obligations under the directive.  In fact, at our recent annual conference, which is attended by all prosecutors, the question of the victims' directive was central.  We are engaged in an extensive training programme, both for our own staff, State solicitors and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have drafted plain English information booklets, which will be published next week, explaining to victims how we make decisions and how victims can request reasons and reviews.  These are the documents I am referring to, and the National Adult Literacy Agency has been very helpful in terms of settling these documents to ensure they are in plain English.  While much work needs to be done, we are not quite sure at this stage what will be the resource implications of the directive.<br/><br/>The establishment of the new Court of Appeal has, as stated, resulted in additional work for the office.  We have additional staff in place to deal with the increased workload but we may be faced with additional expenditure on counsel's fees as the court deals with an increasing number of cases.  Cases being dealt with by our specialised financial unit will continue to put pressure on resources in the office.  Since establishment in 2011, the number of lawyers assigned to this specialised area of work has increased from two to five.  As more cases come before the courts, we will continue to review the resources allocated to this area.<br/><br/>I would like to mention an issue which I think will have implications for the office, that is, the starting salary level for a prosecution solicitor.  Now that the economy is recovering, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the public service, because of its relatively low starting salaries for lawyers, to attract and retain the calibre of legal staff required.  After a period of retrenchment, very attractive salaries are being paid in the private sector for even newly qualified lawyers.  If we cannot attract and retain the requisite level of expertise required by the work of the prosecution service, it will create real problems in maintaining standards and may also adversely affect the ability of the office to carry out its work.</p></speech>

I invite Ms Eileen Creedon to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen Creedon" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#H01200"><p>I also thank the committee for the opportunity to make a brief opening statement.  I am pleased to be able to assist the committee in its examination of the 2014 appropriation account of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p><p>I am pleased to be able to say that my office does not feature in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and, as requested, I have provided the committee with an update on expenditure in 2015.</p><p> As the committee is aware, my office deals with a wide range of legal work on behalf of the State.  This ranges from conveyancing and property work to advising on and dealing with commercial contracts, managing litigation taken against the State and dealing with challenges to the Constitution.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive and capable of attracting publicity.  Sometimes, they involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.</p><p> The Vote for my office is split into two parts, those being office administration and the provision of legal services.  It should be noted that payroll and legal expenses account for 94% of total expenditure.  Within the administrative subheads, payroll is by far the greater expenditure at &euro;14.1 million in 2014.  This equates to 52% of the entire expenditure under that year's Vote.  While my office has a staff complement of 226, there are 17 vacancies.  One of the main challenges I have faced in 2014 and 2015 is the recruitment and retention of solicitors.  With the economy picking up, there are more attractive financial opportunities in the private sector.  In 2014, eight solicitors resigned, with a further 14 resigning in 2015.  It has proven difficult to attract replacements.  The office has 13 vacancies at solicitor level.  This equates to 11% of its solicitor complement.  I am discussing this matter, which is posing a significant risk to the office, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> Expenditure on the remaining administrative subheads amounted to &euro;1.8 million or 7% of total expenditure in 2014.  The administration division facilitates a full range of support services that are critical to the provision of the legal service.  Expenditure includes items such as staff training, library and knowledge management services, utilities, building maintenance, photocopying and document preparation, and the provision of IT, telephone and postal services.</p><p> The provision of legal services is spread across five divisions, each managed by an assistant chief State solicitor, which is equivalent to assistant secretary.  The divisions are organised around legal case types.  All of the work is driven by the demands of Departments and Government offices.  The range of work undertaken is broad and includes matters of national importance that are high profile and of high monetary value to the State.  Much of the work is court based and can be subject to tight time limits, leading to great demands on my staff and the counsel used by my office.  The office has developed specialist expertise where necessary and has to maintain these specialisms across all legal areas.  The office also needs to be in a position to react to new legal developments as they arise for our clients.</p><p> Expenditure on legal services includes fees to counsel, general law expenses and external legal services, and it accounts for 41% of overall expenditure.  The main area of expenditure under this heading is on fees paid to counsel, which in 2014 accounted for 36% of the entire expenditure of my office.  I should point out that expenditure in this area is dependent on the level of activity in the courts and is, therefore, difficult to forecast accurately.  Significant controls are in place to manage expenditure on fees paid to counsel, and the management of this expenditure is a key activity for the Chief State Solicitor's office.  These are fees payable to counsel representing Departments and Government offices in litigation before the Irish courts and other tribunals and the European Court of Justice.  They also include fees payable to counsel for the provision of legal advice to the State, whether sought for the Attorney General's office or for client Departments.</p><p> While the controls in place are working well, recent legal activity has seen a marked increase in the complexity of the work being handled by my office in areas such as commercial litigation and transactional work, procurement work, litigation and advisory work resulting from our membership of the European Union and the implementation of directives, environmental law, planning, employment law, asylum and immigration, etc.  Furthermore, the new Court of Appeal has resulted in a faster throughput of appeal cases that heretofore would have remained pending on the Supreme Court list for a number of years.  My office has also handled a number of significant and high-profile cases relating to, among other issues, challenges to the Constitution and the recent referendums.  The result of all this is that I will not be able to remain within the 2015 Estimate allocation for fees to counsel and have commenced the process of seeking a Supplementary Estimate to be in a position to discharge all fees owing for 2015.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for allowing me the opportunity to make this short statement and will do my best to assist him and his colleagues in their considerations.  In the event that I do not have information with me, I will do my best to provide any outstanding material within two weeks.</p></speech>

I have a list of cases and information on what each cost.  The overrun for which I will propose a supplementary budget owes to the increased complexity of the work being done by my office.  I have had a large number of high-profile files and there has been increased activity in my office for a number of reasons, for example, the law has become more complex.  When I examine files on judicial reviews, the increased activity takes the form of more advices and consultations and longer running times for cases.  There is a faster throughput of cases at High Court level and the Court of Appeal has increased the number of cases with which we deal.</p> <p>  The other Accounting Officers made a point that I did not make in my opening statement but which I will now.  Expenditure on counsels' fees remains 44% lower than in 2008.  Even taking into account the supplementary budget that I will seek, overall expenditure on counsels' fees will be 30% lower than it was in 2008.  In recent years, there has been a reduction in my budget allocation for counsels' fees.  While I had been maintaining my office within budget for a number of years, that did not prove possible this year.</p></speech>

My office handled a number of referendum petitions.  Procurement is a new area of work for us and we dealt with a significant amount of High Court litigation in this regard when we would have dealt with none previously.  We also dealt with a significant amount of commercial litigation which goes through the Commercial Court.  This process is tightly managed and accelerates litigation.</p> <p>  Not all the cases I pay for in any given year are referrable to that particular year.  I might open a file in 2012 or 2013 but I will not be able to estimate when the case will come to a conclusion and fall for payment in respect of counsels' fees.  For example, it may be on a court list or settle.  This year, I had a larger number of cases where a high range of fee was paid than was the case in the past two years.  That is just when they fell due for payment having come to a conclusion in the courts.</p><p>It is unpredictable and, as Mr. O'Daly said earlier, we are demand-led.  We do not know what work is going to arrive on our desks and we cannot refuse any work.  We cannot accurately predict when a file will fall due for payment as it depends on when it runs, what time it concludes and whether it settles.</p></speech>

If there is a petition about a referendum one cannot predict whether it will happen.  Did you seek a bigger budget at the beginning of the year?  Having not got it, were you subsequently proved right because it overran?  How much of this came about through one-off complexities in the system?</p></speech>

A greater reduction had been proposed but I engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at that stage to indicate that, from my best estimate of what was then going through the office, the reduced amount would probably not meet my budget.  I expressed reservations about meeting my requirements but we were going through particular difficulties at that time and that was the allocation that was given to me.</p></speech>

It is a live case because it has not been finally concluded.  The rest relates to a balance of cases.  We pursue costs and manage them but we cannot always reclaim them successfully.  A lot of them would relate to lay litigants where it can be difficult to recover costs but we manage the process and we go as far as we can to recover them.  We have some successes but sometimes it can take longer because we may have to go to the District Court for instalment orders against individuals.  We are conscious that it is taxpayers' money and we have to pursue it.  People who engage in litigation with the State and are unsuccessful can sustain a cost burden and it is up to us to pursue it.</p></speech>

If we are pursuing a lay litigant and it becomes clear they are of very poor means, are unemployed or in ill health we might have to make a commercial decision as to whether we would be throwing good money after bad in pursuing it.  We are careful to make such a decision, though, because it is taxpayers' money and we are obliged to pursue it as far as we can.  We keep these matters under review so that if we feel somebody may be in a position to pay us at some point in the future we will put it on a review list and look at it again to see if their circumstances have improved so that we can recover the costs.</p></speech>

During the downturn it was easier to get people to come into the office because there were no other opportunities.  Working in law offices brings a particular type of experience.  It is very valuable experience and one gets good exposure to a lot of legal issues and a good level of responsibility very early.  Solicitors come here and enjoy the experience for a number of months but then they are offered salaries significantly in excess of what we are offering.  Many will say the work is extraordinarily interesting and, all things being equal, they would stay but when a person has to try to live in Dublin the differential is too big.  If they were offered &euro;5,000 more they might stay but the differential is broadening out.</p></speech>

I am quite sure that smaller practices outside Dublin are not offering the kind of sums mentioned earlier but, because we are operating in the Dublin market and because the type of work we do is very high-level, solicitors who come to work for me have experience that makes them attractive to the bigger firms.  I meet with all the solicitors who leave me and I ask them why.  The indications they give me are that they are getting &euro;55,000-&euro;65,000, and this differential is too broad for them.</p></speech>

They are renewed.  The 806 applications refers to 806 extant willing to act for the State.  When we last checked with the Law Library, we were told there were approximately 2,300 qualified barristers, not all of whom are practising.  Given that barristers who leave the Law Library do not receive P45s, it is unclear exactly how many are practising.  Of this population of barristers, 806 have applied to the Office of the Attorney General to do work, which is less than half of the Bar members.  Anecdotally, one of the reasons is that we do not pay as much as other types of work, and there is sometimes a disposition to act against the State rather than for it.  There are various reasons a barrister may not want to do State work.  All the applicants are placed on a panel and, depending on their willingness to act and suitability, and last year, approximately 340 of them received work from the Office of the Attorney General through the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p></speech>

A barrister does not mark a fee for his or her services and we agree.  At the end of a case, when the fee sheets are submitted by the barrister, they are vigorously assessed.  The barristers do not dictate the fee.  Since 2008, the vigorous process of scrutinising barristers' fees has resulted in a fall in cost of approximately 48%.</p></speech>

Before a barrister is given a case, does the Office of the Attorney General set a fee or a rate?

The members of the Bar understand it and they understand that the fee note generally bears no relationship to what they might be paid at the end.  They are generally paid at the end of a case, but may be paid during a case if it is very long.</p></speech>

They would give their right arms for some State work.  The old adage is that one does not make any money as a barrister until one has been at it for at least seven or eight years.  They are all doing extra jobs to pay the rent.  With this pool of people who are not new but have been there for a long time, and where there is competition for business, if it were properly done, the Attorney General could give younger entrants a step up and would save the State some money by targeting work at people who would probably charge less due to their level of experience.</p></speech>

There are specific amounts for the drafting of defence pleadings, with variations, which we use as indicators of what we would pay.  If a barrister marks a fee in respect of what he or she regards the piece of pleading to be worth, it is helpful.  However, it is not necessarily what we would pay.</p></speech>

However, cost is not the only criterion.  We must have competent counsel.  We must get the counsel who have the experience and expertise to do a certain type of case.

At the beginning of the meeting, we had a discussion about how UCD is not putting contracts under &euro;60,000 out to public tender, which it should be.  The State makes plumbers, electricians and all kinds of small businesses compete against each other in order to save &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000.  The market we use for counsel fees does not seem to use cost as a differentiator.  Mr. O'Daly has said he has an indicative framework within which he works, which has been benchmarked by the private sector for how much he pays for certain work, and, therefore, if a barrister submits a fee note, it bears no relation to the payment.  He also said, if somebody negotiates and offers to do the work for a lower fee, he will still return to his indicative framework.  This excludes cost as a competitive angle.</p></speech>

If a barrister offers to do the work for less, one listens and makes a commercial decision.  I return to the point that the expertise of the barrister and the need for a barrister to be able to do the case is the paramount concern.</p></speech>

Sometimes, in order to get the best, one may have to pay a little more.

No procurement process of any kind says that costs are the be-all and end-all.  Often, in procurement processes, it is not the lowest price that will win.  However, cost is a factor based on a number of matters.  First, there would be competence, record of experience in the business, number of projects done and completed on time, expertise, relationship, trustworthiness and customer satisfaction, and then cost.  These all would come into one's procurement process.</p> <p>  I totally understand that Mr. O'Daly will not send a first year junior counsel into the Supreme Court to defend a constitutional case.  There are different levels.  Experience, etc., comes into it.  I am struck by the system in place.  I am not trying to put forward the view that solicitors all should be offering to work for the minimum wage but, if one does not have a situation where 2,300 qualified, 800 applied for legal work and 300 of those get legal work, those in the broader pool can say that they can do the job a particular barrister has done just as well and cheaper, they will prove it and do so, and they should be able to compete on that basis to get the work.</p></speech>

There are the 800, first, who have handed in a sheet to Mr. O'Daly's office and then there are the 300 of those who get it, but then there are the broader 200 or 300.  I would not know if there is anecdotal evidence that there is no point in applying for State work as it is a closed shop.</p></speech>

Through our website, barristers can make an application.  All of them are considered.  That is the process.  As I say, those who actually showed a willingness to work for the State were put on panels.  They were of variable expertise, variable experience and qualification.  Not all of them would be suitable for every case.  Of the types of panels that we have, if one takes the asylum panel, there are a lot of barristers on that panel.  However, if one has a high-end asylum case to which there may be some constitutional aspects, one has to be careful who one picks from that panel to do that type of case.  Of course, it may be the situation that somewhere out there might be somebody who is not on the asylum panel who might be prepared to do the case for very small money but bearing in mind those on the panel have expressed a willingness to do a type of work, have gone to the trouble of going through the process of making that known and are on the panel, they have a general idea of what they are going to get paid.  That is how we do it.  It does not mean that there is some unknown quantity of barristers who would be willing to do that type of work for much cheaper.  It does not necessarily indicate that.  Second, as the Deputy stated, that cannot be the only reason the Attorney briefs them.</p></speech>

If something goes wrong in the legal profession, someone is seriously discomfited.  There are liberty issues.  It is very serious.  It is not to be likened to some other professions.  This is something we constantly hear.  Everybody is shocked when they hear about the cost of the legal fees, both counsel fees and solicitors' fees, associated with a case.  Millions of euro is being paid in fees and one of the primary actors in that is the Bar.  There does not seem to be recognition, certainly, in the way State procures services, that there is potential for a competitive market which could reduce the costs.</p></speech>

The discussions took place from the point of view of putting in processes that get value for money for the State.  That is the criterion.  Admittedly, things have moved on, but in 2011 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it was satisfied with the process we had in place to ensure we engaged the right barristers for the purposes of the cases for the State.  They were satisfied that the system produced savings and from that point of view, they were happy that we did not move.  There were discussions about different methods of procurement in the sense of how it might work.</p> <p>  I totally acknowledge the arguments Deputy Nolan has made in the sense that in certain types of litigation, it would be my view that there is room for a different method, particularly in relation to what I would regard as process-driven type litigation whereby perhaps, without in any way demeaning a level of work, the level of legal expertise is not as high.  However, in constitutional cases and in a large number of the very complicated cases we have, that just would not work because we need flexibility.  If we had a rigid procurement process for each case, for example, there could be different models.  It would not necessarily have to be for each case, we could have some form of tendering process for each panel as such.  That is possible.  In constitutional cases and for big cases - I am conscious that there are types of cases that involve other entities as well - the idea of not getting the best, and cost being the driver in that, is just not acceptable.  I understand the Deputy's point that cost obviously has to be a factor - of course it is under the system that we have - but a pre-eminence is given to people's expertise.</p></speech>

We are operating in Dublin and they are being offered other positions in Dublin in bigger practices.  That may not be the case in other parts of the country, but the kinds of position that solicitors who have experience in our offices are being offered in Dublin are at up to twice what we can offer them, and sometimes more.

Those transactional costs for high-end commercial work would not necessarily be in with the bar.  It would be high-end commercial solicitors' work.  It is difficult to know about those sorts of figures.  I hear them mentioned but I do not know how up-to-date they are.  From the point of view of State expenditure on legal work, we have strived to bring the cost down.  As I mentioned, when we had discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2011 in respect of how we go about this, the main point was to ensure that the costs came down.  In a sense, procurement methodologies came into the discussion.  It is acknowledged that we have brought State fees down.  We are not responsible for paying private sector solicitors' firms that Departments use.  That is outside our remit.  That type of work that those firms do we have nothing to do with in the sense of paying or monitoring or value for money or whatever.  Those are matters for the Departments.  From the point of view of the State work we handle, we have managed to bring costs down by approximately 48%.  That is the way it is now.  Of course, when I start talking about a baseline of 2008, it is not exactly satisfactory, but that is the overall result.</p></speech>

It is just left out there and people think a certain way about legal services, which are obviously very important and necessary.</p></speech>

We can generally take the different figures and quantify how much the legal costs are in layman's terms to the State.  Did the Attorney General's office ever look at the costs incurred by all of the Government agencies and Departments or even just the Departments with a view to streamlining the service and determining just how much the State is paying generally for legal services?  It seems that it is an astronomical amount of money when it is all gathered together.  One wonders if having, perhaps not a one-size-fits-all, but certainly a general approach drawing in the Department spend also would give us a greater idea of just how much the State is spending.  It might also suggest how better that amount of money could be spent if resources were pooled.  While this might be a policy matter, someone has to ask.  Is it not something the Office of the Attorney General would consider in the interests of the taxpayer if there were savings to be made?</p></speech>

The Chief State Solicitor might know a little bit more about this.  If one includes that as regards the State, there is going to be a framework agreement and procurement processes will be designed around it as regards local authority legal work.  Very soon - again through the Government procurement office - there will be consideration of the procurement processes that will have to be undertaken by centralised Government.  I am sure the Government procurement agency has some sort of figures on which it is working from the point of view of introducing these sorts of framework agreements.  Incidentally, the framework agreement that will be put in place for Government Departments only covers the procurement of solicitors' services.  It does not cover counsel.  The idea is that they want to look at the issue of Government Departments that are taking in quite a lot of legal advice from the private sector - mainly commercial-type solicitor firms - and how to bring the cost of that down.  Now, in looking at these issues it is certainly our disposition that more money should be spent fortifying the Chief State Solicitor's office, centralising legal services and bringing that up to a certain level of expertise rather than paying a small number because that is all who seem to be getting the solicitor work, of solicitor firms doing work for Departments.  In bringing forward these framework agreements, I take it that the Government procurement office has done the type of analysis the Chairman is talking about.  It is taking a whole-of-view approach.</p></speech>

I say this because there are procurement rules set down which are breached every day of the week, with no apology to the Government or anybody else that is trying to implement proper procurement across agencies and Departments.  I expect that all of the witnesses -  who all operate at the coalface in terms of the delivery of the services they are required to deliver - will make recommendations to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because the number of firms the PAC sees working for the different Departments is very small and the cost is enormous.  For example, I want to ask Mr. O'Daly about a particular matter.  I will not give the name of the case but it is something I came across recently where a barrister was being paid &euro;1,500 per day.  That went on for quite some time and cost the particular agency - and, therefore, the State - a considerable amount of money.  Is Mr. O'Daly asked for his advice in relation to costs and how much the AGO pays?  If owned a private company, I might ask my next door neighbouring private company how much it pays for a service.  Leaving  procurement regulations to one side, is that common-sense approach used by agencies of the State and Departments on a regular basis or does it just not happen?</p></speech>

There is no proper formalised structure, although I am conscious that during my time other agencies have come to the Office of the Attorney General to look at the indicative amounts we might pay to see where they are in respect of what they pay.  Equally, I am conscious that the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office have been asked to have input, for example, by the Department of Finance, with regard to the use of the commercial firms that have been doing the high-end banking work.  It is understandable that they would ask or draw on us to do some form of assessment or help or assist them in relation to how much they should pay.  If the Chairman is asking whether there is an overall structure or system, I have to say "No".</p></speech>

To relate it to the private sector, I might ask another business how much something cost.  I might ask if the firm that represented that business was any good and perhaps get a reference.</p><p>It would seem to me that there are no cost comparisons made and no references sought, such that people are being employed willy-nilly across the State sector.  Another disturbing thing about this is that in cases in respect of which legal firms are employed, the citizen is often beaten up by the fact that the legal firm, supported by the State, would seem to have endless resources.  That is a complaint I receive regularly.  The citizen, in spite of his or her case, feels hard done by because the powerful seem to get their way.  We now find that no cost comparisons or professional opinions relative to the quality of the individuals or companies from which services are sourced are being sought.</p></speech>

I am shocked that the answer to my question is that this does not happen, not only regularly but as a matter of fact in the conduct of the business of the State relative to the appointment of legal representatives.  It is not right that it would continue.  Mr. O'Daly's office should engage proactively on this issue in terms of the Government and the direction it is taking, despite that doing so might be crossing into policy areas.  The amount involved is considerable.  In the case I mentioned, &euro;267,000 of taxpayers' money involved.  There are many examples of cases like that from which the conclusion could be drawn that taxpayers' money is being squandered.</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should be far more proactive when it comes to one of the bigger costs to the State, namely, legal costs.  Not only is there a legal cost, there is a human cost.  There have been many cases where the State has wronged an individual.  While that might be proven at the end of the day, the fact is a life or a family has been destroyed in the process.  Therefore, the two gaps identified need to be addressed not only by whoever here this morning has responsibility in this area but by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Someone needs to get a handle on the cost being incurred by institutions of the State, with no reference to its ability to win a case or to get the best value for money for the taxpayer.  I say that arising from the experiences of the committee in relation to money spent that did not achieve anything while at the same time individual lives were damaged, which leaves people cynical about the State apparatus and how it is operated.</p></speech>

We need a little more than words, or what some people might term "guff", from the Department.  We need action and not guff.</p> <p>  I would like now to turn to an issue that has bothered the committee on and off in the context of different Departments, namely, the creation of leases by a Department in respect of decisions to lease properties which it owns.  In this case, is it always the Chief State Solicitor's office that draws up or examines the lease or is it, again, the case that the Department can engage a private solicitors' firm to do the work for them?  I am speaking in this regard about large property leases rather than minor ones.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, some Departments engage solicitor services elsewhere and so I cannot be adamant that no Department has gone elsewhere to get solicitor's assistance on a lease.  Ms Maria Browne, who is in charge of our property area, might have something further to add on that.</p></speech>

Has the office completed all such proposals received to date or are there proposals in the office which span years and that are not yet complete?</p></speech>

In terms of confirmation that there are leases not completed at this point in time, I cannot speak to every file that is in the State property division.  There could be cases in respect of which there are protracted negotiations with the other side.  In response to the Chairman's question, the lease is usually drafted by the party granting the lease, such that if a Department is granting a lease, it would be drawn up by our office.  In certain cases we may require the assistance of specialist counsel, including, for example, if a lease is to form the basis of a precedent for a portfolio of work.  It can be the case, if difficult terms needs to be included or a lot of instructions need to be taken, that the process can go on for some time.</p></speech>

The committee dealt recently with issues relating to harbours, during which we learned that a significant number of leases relating to harbours, dating back over a number of years, had not been completed or signed off on such that the individual attempting to lease the property, or in some cases in the leased property, did not have a lease for that property.

It may be historical but it relates to where leases have been created with no break clause, thus tying the State to millions of euro in terms of its responsibility in the context of the lease.  For example, let us suppose a lease is created for 60 years, or whatever it may be, with no break clause.  Regardless of what changes take place in the course of time, the State is tied to that lease.  Why does that happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.326" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Browne" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#Q01600"><p>Leases are drafted based on instructions received from Departments.  Departments come to a decision on how long a term it wishes to give, what the rent should be and so on.  That is an internal departmental matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015111200002#Q01700"><p>This is an interesting point.  I am sure that on the side of the Chief State Solicitor's office there is considerable intelligence about the law, how it can be applied, the implications of applying it, the responsibilities of Departments and so on.  Surely if the office received a suggestion from a Department that a given lease should be for 60 years or 20 years without a break clause or a review of the rent, the office could make the case to that Department that it would not be smart, that the Department should build in protection, including at the least a break clause, and that the Department should question whether it is a full repairing lease.  The point is that the State is not left exposed at the end of the day.  We have discovered that the State is left exposed and it all relates to the quality of the lease agreed.  Surely no Department should be allowed by the Chief State Solicitor's office or anyone else to agree a lease that ties the taxpayer into an unreasonable lease without a review.  That has happened.  We have seen it at this committee.</p></speech>

In situations where there may be long leases, tenants are more likely to have lower rent.  Normally, the tenant looks for a break clause, but the tenant pays more to get a break clause and that has an impact on the rent.</p> <p>  There are a variety of leases that we deal with for Departments.  They could be shorter-term leases of 20 or 21 years.  In any lease we work on relating to State accommodation, by and large we discuss break clauses.  The Departments are alert to these issues.  Long leases normally arise in cases other than commercial situations.</p></speech>

The best thing we can do is get the examples.  Some of them will be specific examples.  We will send them to Ms Creedon because they are of concern to me, as a member of this committee?  Rather than dance around the general issue, we should get specific examples and give them to the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  Deputy Costello is keen to come in.

If there was a case involving a fatality where a State agency was involved, for example, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or whatever, we would have always given reasons because of European human rights law.  However, in 2008 we developed a policy.</p> <p>  Part of the difficulty - it will be part of the difficulty from next Monday as well - is the question of resources.  We have limited resources and we do not know the extent to which the victims directive will impinge on those resources.  The policy since 2008, as far as I am aware, has worked reasonably satisfactorily.</p><p>I cannot say everybody who has got a letter from us is happy with the reason.  Clearly, there is a great deal of trauma involved in these cases, for the victims' families.  We have provided very detailed reasons in those cases since 2008.  We also have tried to engage with victims.  I mentioned in my opening statement that we have leaflets on how we do our work.  I also mentioned in my opening statement that the National Adult Literacy Agency is heavily involved with us and has provided us with very useful support to make sure that our communication with victims is user-friendly.</p></speech>

Victim's families do not know why the Director of Public Prosecutions has refused to prosecute.  Obviously it might seem there are very good legal reasons from the point of view of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but they are very poor reasons from the point of view of human suffering.  Now there is a European directive on the provision of reasons.  If it had not arrived then we probably never would have starting giving reasons to families of victims as to why the Director of Public Prosecutions declined to prosecute in particular cases.   Is the Garda in question given the job?  Does the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions not take any responsibility for informing the victims of families when the Director of Public Prosecutions does not prosecute?  In situations in which the Director of Public Prosecutions does not prosecute, will it be proactive in contacting a victim's family?</p></speech>

As I have said, in fatal cases the family liaison officer is given the job.</p></speech>

The Director of Public Prosecutions may well have spent thousands or tens of thousands of euro on conducting an investigation, yet to me it does not seem to take the right as seriously as the citizen would seem to want it to be taken.</p></speech>

I am unaware of any case in which the family of the victim in a fatal incident were not aware of the reasons we gave.  They have written to us on many occasions and we provide our reasons in those cases.</p></speech>

I would like a better presentation.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has recruited a couple of solicitors to carry out this work but the deputy director is unsure what the budget will be.  If this is already happening then obviously it is at a very low level.  The new European Union directive has been put into legislation and the Director of Public Prosecutions has acted upon it.  I ask Mr. Donoghue to clarify how the directive will benefit the victims of crime who now have a right to know why the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided not to prosecute a particular case.  I have come across many Director of Public Prosecutions cases over the years.  Therefore, I know that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions goes into court at the last moment makes a statement that there will be no prosecution, with no reason given.  The lack of a reason has been an issue of huge public concern for many years.  It would be valuable for the committee to know precisely how the system will operative and how proactive the Director of Public Prosecutions will be so that the citizen benefits from the new directive.</p></speech>

A young man was killed and the family of that young man wrote to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions asking for explanations.  The complaint was not just that the family were unsatisfied, but that they did not get the reasons behind the various actions in the particular case.  What the deputy director has told us now is that the Director of Public Prosecutions responds and gives reasons and that it has done so in fatal cases since 2008.</p></speech>

I think the matter has been raised during Leaders' Questions in the House.  That is just one example.

I have raised the case in the House and others have done so as well.  I refer to a notorious drug dealer who was convicted in this jurisdiction, in the United Kingdom and, I think, also on the Continent.  The case came before the courts on the last day of sittings in July and a Garda superintendent came forward - I think it was a superintendent - and said that on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions, he or she would withdraw the prosecution.  There were serious charges involved but no explanation has ever been given for the decision.  The case took place in 2006 rather than 2008.  It was a serious matter and major charges were involved, as well as a criminal record and all of the rest of it.  The whole lot was withdrawn without a reason, and the position has not changed to this day.  A number of Deputies have put the matter on the record of this House.  That is the type of situation that leads people to wonder and to be suspicious.  People need to know the reasons when the Director of Public Prosecutions decides not to prosecute, and they need to know that they have the option of reviewing the decision.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions must engage with the citizenry and explain the matter.</p><p>That is rather than leaving it second-hand, perhaps through a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That must be considered.</p></speech>

That person would deal with the family from the initial tragic death of the victim.  It seems that these would be the appropriate people to communicate directly with the victim.

We have had a number of individuals in here who have been taken to court by Departments and pursued over a long period only for the case to be dropped.  In some cases, we have been told that the individual business was damaged or ruined by the long process before the case was dropped.  There was human damage along the line with the individuals concerned and the Director of Public Prosecutions just walked away from the case.

I have a few questions in a related area.  A total of 41% of funding in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is spent on counsel fees and 37% of funding in the Director of Public Prosecution's office goes on counsel fees.  The witness indicated that this largely depends, in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions, on the duration of cases and so on.  What steps are taken to ensure cases do not drag on?  In many cases, there is a determination on the steps of the court or information is given that is subsequently ruled out of being put before the jury.  It seems that issues like this could be dealt with more expeditiously.  Counsel fees are a major issue.  As the troika stated when its representatives arrived, the major expense of litigation in this country needed to be addressed.  This again comes back to the citizen.  It is either the citizen or the relevant corporate entity that is detrimentally affected by drawn-out cases.  The taxpayer is affected by counsel fees, which are quite expensive now, if the litigation is unduly extended.  Are there procedures to examine cases and see how the length of time for them can be reduced to save money for the State and citizens?</p></speech>

A murder case 20 or 30 years ago would have been a fairly short affair but now it may run for days and weeks because much new evidence may be introduced.  There is the likes of closed-circuit television, forensic evidence and so forth.  That is part of the reason.</p> <p>  With regard to procedure, we try to ensure disclosure is done as early as possible in cases.  We have done that recently in order that information is disclosed to the defence at a much earlier stage than it may have been in the past.  Additionally, the Department of Justice and Equality has examined the efficiency of the court system.  I was a member of a group some time ago, which continued with the former chief prosecution solicitor and others, and it considered ways in which case management could be improved.  Much good work was done in that regard.  The Department of Justice and Equality proposed to introduce a procedure Bill allowing for the types of issues mentioned by the Deputy, namely, the question of exclusion of evidence and so forth, to be dealt with in advance of a trial.  Part of the difficulty is that under the current system, the jury must be empanelled before proper legal issues may be determined by the trial judge.  I know the criminal procedure Bill being considered by the Department will address that issue.</p></speech>

There was a very high-profile case recently - I will not get into the details - that went on for 64 or 65 days and the jury was there for all of it.  For the first 60 days, the matters could not go before the jury.  How can a position like that arise?  Ordinary citizens had to provide their time on a voluntary basis but only a couple of days of the hearing were relevant to them in that case.  Surely even without the new criminal justice Bill mentioned-----</p></speech>

That is done quite well currently in the Circuit Criminal Court and other courts.  In terms of admissibility of evidence, the courts refer to this as the unitary nature of the trial.  In other words, the jury must be empanelled with the judge sitting there while issues of admissibility are addressed by the court.  That is being addressed by the procedure Bill, and in the absence of the legislation, there is a limit on what one can do.</p></speech>

I know the fraud bureau found that very useful to its armoury.  Before that, if one went onto a solicitor's office where there was suspected fraud - there might have been a suspect, maybe one of the solicitors in the area - the witnesses, who would be witnesses to the fraud but not complicit in it, until 2011 did not have to engage with the Garda.

Present was a judge, a 12-person jury, five garda&iacute;, senior counsel and a solicitor for the State, a senior counsel, a junior and solicitor for the defence, and four court staff.  The individual who sent me the e-mail advised me that the accused did not show up.  This special sitting had been arranged with all these individuals present, paid by the taxpayer.

I offer apologies to witnesses and to you, a Chathaoirligh.</p> <p>  My question is for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  To whom do I direct my question?  Ms Creedon.  What is the process if a Department engages the Chief State Solicitor for advice on a particular issue?  How is a decision on whether to prosecute a case taken?</p></speech>

Let me paint the scenario and why I raise these questions.  A farmer from County Tipperary attributes 500,000 litres of milk for which he has no quota to Clongowes Wood farm, which is also a school.  The farmer concerned, as it happens, is connected to Glanbia.  In so attributing the milk in this way, he avoids superlevies of &euro;300,000.</p><p>This comes to the attention of the Department, which sets out to put things right.  According to responses to parliamentary questions, the Chief State Solicitor's office is involved in offering an opinion on this matter.  Can Ms Creedon speak about that process?</p></speech>

Agricultural prosecutions are different from others in the sense that under the legislation, the Minister can bring a prosecution if it stays at District Court level.  Once it moves to Circuit Court level and becomes an indictable offence, it becomes a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In the cases where the Department is at the beginning of a process, it writes to my office first.  If it were a minor matter going to the District Court as a ministerial prosecution, my office would have carriage of it.  However, if it were a more serious matter, if it was commenced in the District Court and the judge refused jurisdiction or if it was considered from the beginning that it should go to the Circuit Court, it would be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If the Department seeks advice on that matter, I can give it advice.  However, as this is a prosecution, it will take a certain course, depending on the seriousness of the matter.</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Creedon might clarify that it is the decision of the Department, on receipt of her opinion, whether to pursue the avenue of prosecution.  I wish to check that I am correct in that regard.</p></speech>

It would most likely be referred to the Office of the Attorney General and the advice of counsel may also be requested.  It would be a culmination.  The final advice would come from the Attorney General, perhaps based on counsel's advice, back through my office.  That would be how the advice would flow.</p></speech>

Whether it was solely from the Chief State Solicitor, although it is likely that if it was a complicated matter, it would have come to the Attorney General's office, the Department made a decision on foot of that advice that there would be no prosecution.  I will have to find out about it, but the source of the information should be from the Department.  We give legal advice to Departments.  It is their advice.

The difficulty is that Mr. O'Daly cites the Department.  The ultimate tool for questioning the Department and the Minister is parliamentary questions, but the information on this case has been sparse.  If one reads the responses, one is nearly led to believe that in this case it was, in fact, the Mr. O'Daly office that took the call on there being no prosecution.  We have established today that this is not the case.  Mr. O'Daly gives an opinion, directly or in conjunction with the Attorney General and others, but he is not in the business of calling the matter.  That is a matter for the Department and, presumably, the Minister.</p></speech>

I am simply asking questions on foot of evidence that was given here in respect of delays in cases and the conclusion of cases taken by the DPP.  I want to test such evidence against the facts by posing questions to our guests.  Perhaps we might circumvent it by not mentioning the name or whatever but I am anxious to discover whether the committee might test a complaint submitted to it - either in person or in writing - in a general way by asking our guests whether it is fact or fiction.  It is only by doing that and obtaining a general answer that we will understand whether there is an issue for the individual in question or for our guests' organisations.  Proceeding in the way I have outlined would also bring closure, so to speak, to any issue raised at this level by a particular individual.  That is what I am trying to achieve here.  I am not trying to politicise the process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015111200002#A00600"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me here this afternoon.  I welcome members from the diplomatic community and others who are joining us.  I am very pleased to address the committee in advance of next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council.  The meeting will consider five issues, the first of which is the preparation for meeting of the European Council on 17 and 18 December.  That Council will consider the migration crisis; Economic and Monetary Union and the Commission's proposals made on the basis of the five presidents' report; the Commission's roadmap for the further implementation of the Single Market; the EU-UK debate; and our relationships with Russia and the situation in Ukraine.</p> <p>  In addition to the December European Council item, the General Affairs Council will also hold a discussion on ensuring respect for the rule of law; the Inter-institutional Agreement on Better Regulation; the 2016 annual work programme of the Commission; and the European semester.</p> <p>  A separate General Affairs Council meeting will take place the following day on 18 November and I will attend that in place of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  As that is not a matter for this committee, I will not address it in my remarks today.</p> <p>  The General Affairs Council discussions on 17 November will build upon those that took place at last month's meeting and on which I have not yet had an opportunity to brief the committee, although the Taoiseach addressed the D&aacute;il both before and after the October European Council.  The October meeting was centred on preparations for the European Council that month and above all dealt with the very challenging issues of migration, Economic and Monetary Union, and, relatively briefly, the European Union and UK issue.</p> <p>  Following concerns raised by some non-euro currency member states, there was also an exchange of views on a pre-EPSCO meeting that had been convened by the Presidency for euro member states only.</p><p>In my intervention, I made the point that we are a Union of 28 member states and that we should meet and act as a group of 28, where possible.</p><p> The December European Council will discuss the issue of migration.  This issue dominates debate at EU level and it was, once again, the main item on the agenda of last month&rsquo;s Council.  Much of the exchanges built upon earlier meetings of Heads of State and Government and on progress to implement the various proposals.  There certainly have been some advances, for example in the first relocations from Greece and Italy to other EU member states, and in listing countries of safe origin.  However, challenges remain in meeting commitments, including on funding and seconding personnel.  The slow pace of progress led to President Juncker convening a mini-summit just ten days after the October European Council, for countries affected by migrants travelling along the Western Balkans route.  Discussions continued in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, including this week, and there will be further developments at the high level Valletta summit which is taking place as we speak in Malta.</p><p> There has been a particular focus on Turkey, as a key player in the EU's efforts to tackle the crisis through reinforcing co-operation with third countries.  Delivering on the action plan agreed with the Commission just before the European Council will be a significant challenge for the EU and Turkey in the period ahead.  While no one has any illusions about how difficult it will be to step up co-operation, the fact is that the European Union and Turkey simply have to work together to address the crisis of migration.  There is no possible solution which does not involve Turkey to a very significant degree. </p><p> From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we continue to respond to the migration crisis across a number of fronts, balancing the focus on longer-term solutions with the need to tackle the immediate humanitarian challenges.  The main elements of our response are as follows.  We have voluntarily opted into EU programmes where we have offered to take 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers between relocation and resettlement programmes.  We have provided six liaison officers to facilitate this work.  Everybody is aware of the assistance provided by the Naval Service vessels to the search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, where they have rescued 8,066 individuals since 1 May.</p><p> Our significant assistance to key organisations responding to the crisis including to the World Food Programme, where we have doubled our core contribution to &euro;20 million per annum for the period 2016 - 2018; to the UNHCR, where we provided &euro;5.8 million in core support in 2015, with an increase in core funding likely to be proposed for 2016; and to the UNOCHA, where we gave &euro;3.5 million in core and discretionary funding in 2015.  We will pledge &euro;3 million over the next five years to the Emergency Trust Fund to Africa.  In all likelihood, we will exceed a pledge made in March to provide &euro;12 million this year to alleviate the impact of the Syrian crisis, bringing our overall contribution to &euro;41 million by the end of 2015.</p><p> Discussions at the European Council in December will continue to focus on the EU&rsquo;s response to the migration crisis.  At this early stage, we expect that there will again be a particular emphasis on implementing agreed measures, including operational matters, such as the hotspots in Greece and Italy, providing experts and the agreement to commit funding are also likely to feature.  We expect that relations with third countries, such as Turkey, the countries of the Western Balkans, and Africa, will also be addressed.  </p><p> As the Chairman mentioned in his opening remarks, the Heads of State and Government will give further consideration to the five presidents&rsquo; report on Completing Europe&rsquo;s Economic and Monetary Union, published on 22 June, and specifically the Commission's proposals of 21 October which seeks to give effect to some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations at the December European Council.</p><p> As members know from their own hearings with Commission officials and academics, among others, the report proposes a two stage approach.  The first stage is short term, up to 2017, and focuses on boosting competitiveness, maintaining responsible fiscal policies and completing banking union.  The second stage is for post-2017 and could involve more significant changes to the EU&rsquo;s economic and institutional architecture.</p><p> The report has been discussed in various Council formats and the Commission&rsquo;s concrete proposals for stage one, which provide an anchor for further debate, have, as I said, now been published.  These include an in-depth review of the six-pack and two-pack which set out detailed fiscal rules in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, some re-organisation of the European semester and a proposal for external representation of the euro area at international financial institutions.  The Commission is expected to make further proposals, perhaps this month, and these are likely to focus on the completion of banking union.  Issues such as strengthening competitiveness in the euro area, taking an overview of its financial position and strengthening the social dimension of the euro area have also been discussed.</p><p> Like many other EU partners, Ireland believes that the focus should be on full and effective implementation of the reforms already agreed in recent years.  We should be prioritising what can be done now to build on and strengthen existing instruments and to make the best use of existing treaty provisions to develop and improve Economic and Monetary Union.  In this context, the emphasis on completing banking union in the report was welcome.  We believe this is one of the most important post-crisis reforms and, although much has been achieved, banking union needs to be completed without delay.  We also want to see progress on the capital markets union and in this context, we welcomed the capital markets union action plan launched by the Commission at the end of September.</p><p> As regards economic governance, we strongly support the streamlining and optimisation of the European semester process which has been discussed at a previous committee meeting and which we see as an important vehicle for the delivery of reforms across the European Union. </p><p> We would be cautious about the creation of new institutions which might not add value to existing processes but might instead form an additional institutional layer.  In this regard, we remain to be convinced by the proposal for a new euro system of competitiveness boards, not least because we already have the National Competitiveness Council.  We would also question the added value of the newly established European Fiscal Advisory Board when Ireland, too, already has the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The proposed composition of the new body and its operational focus both need to be studied carefully.</p><p> As regards the report&rsquo;s proposals for stage two, post-2017, there is a need to reflect on the issues raised.  The recent significant reforms to the governance of the eurozone require time to bed down.</p><p>We should not allow the focus to be diverted from our primary aim, which is to create jobs and growth which will deliver those jobs.  Our discussions must remain grounded on what is achievable and urgent.<br/><br/>The December European Council will discuss the new Single Market strategy presented by the Commission on 28 October entitled, Upgrading the Single Market: more opportunities for people and business.  It targets actions in three areas, first, creating opportunities for consumers, professionals and businesses; second, encouraging and enabling the modernisation and innovation that Europe needs; and, third, ensuring practical delivery that benefits consumers and businesses in their daily lives.  We strongly support the overall focus on practical measures helping small and medium enterprises and start-ups and encouraging start-ups to grow and expand, which promotes innovation, unlocks investment potential and empowers consumers.  Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Single European Act in 1986 and we see renewed momentum here as a crucial driver of job creation, growth and competitiveness.  This can also be concluded in the discussions in the context of the current UK debate.  There are 22 specific measures lined up for delivery by 2018, including guidance from the Commission next year on how EU law applies to the collaborative economy, as it is known, and those business models.  The key issue is pressing ahead with concrete timelines and early results.  There is no doubt that while driving ahead with the Single Market for goods, the European Union has done much less well in the Single Market for services and that this area retains considerable space for growth and job creation, particularly in peripheral countries such as ours. <br/><br/>The British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, presented his proposals for reforming the European Union by way of a letter to President Tusk last Tuesday.  The Prime Minister also delivered a speech on that day at Chatham House, in which he elaborated on the proposals made and outlined his view of how the negotiation process might proceed in the weeks ahead.  The proposals fall across four broad clusters of issues, namely, first, economic governance<i>- </i>in effect, preventing non-eurozone countries from being disadvantaged by decisions taken solely by eurozone member countries; second, competiveness, including completion of the Single Market, better regulation and expediting international trade agreements; third, sovereignty, that is, strengthening the role of national parliaments in the European Union, as well as ending Britain&rsquo;s obligation to work towards ever closer union; and, fourth,<i></i>immigration, including proposed amendments to the United Kingdom&rsquo;s welfare system and steps to address what are perceived by the United Kingdom to be abuses of freedom of movement.  While outlining his objectives in each area, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s letter made it clear that the details remained a matter for forthcoming negotiations.  We expect these to commence immediately, with a first round of bilateral consultations at senior official level getting under way late this week or early next week.  It is hard to know, therefore, what shape the December discussions might take at this stage.  However, the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, has said his priority is to get the substance right.  It is possible, therefore, that the negotiations might continue into next year.<br/><br/>As the committee knows, these are important, sensitive and complex issues which warrant careful reflection and analysis.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, acknowledges that some of the proposals, notably those around immigration and welfare reform, will present difficulties for other member states and that work will be needed to identify workable solutions.  As the Taoiseach said to the Prime Minister when they met in London on Monday, Ireland recognises the basis of British concerns and we will be open and constructive in supporting the United Kingdom in seeking reasonable adjustments to deliver a stronger, better functioning European Union.  With constructive engagement by all partners, we believe sensible measures can be agreed across the four categories identified by the Prime Minister.  Clearly, however, much remains to be done to achieve that end.  I look forward to updating the committee on how the work is progressing ahead of the next General Affairs Council in December when we will return to the issue.  As that will be in advance of the next European Council meeting, we may have more detail on the matter.<br/><br/>The President of the European Council has indicated that in December there will be a discussion of relations with Russia and the situation in Ukraine.  The current respite in violence provides an opportunity for progress to be made on the political track and full implementation of the Minsk agreements which continue to offer the only viable framework for a resolution of the conflict.  <br/><br/>The rule of law item is also on the agenda, following an agreement at the General Affairs Council last December to establish dialogue within the Council among all member states to promote and safeguard the rule of law in the framework of the treaties.  As part of the commitment to return to this issue on an annual basis, we are looking forward to the Presidency-led discussions on the rule of law.  It is incumbent on us and all EU institutions and member states alike to look carefully at this issue and how we are operating at home and abroad within a European Union of values.  Many of our European partners have had to respond to acute and, in some cases, tragic instances of anti-semitism and Islamophobia, reminders that we all need to stay vigilant about protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms while upholding the rule of law. <br/><br/>The European Commission will have much to contribute to the discussion following its first annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights in the European Union which was hosted by First Vice President Frans Timmermans and Commissioner Jourova on 1 and 2 October.  Ireland has always stood behind the European Union as a Union of values and we welcome the opportunity to look more closely at how this is operating and how we might push it forward.  The Presidency has circulated a discussion document on the rule of law in the age of digitalisation which gives a useful background to the legal framework underpinning freedom of expression, as well as other rights.  Member states have been asked to come forward with both positive and negative examples from their own experience.  I intend to draw on our experience from the Irish point of view of how we have been coming to terms with the legacy of a different and less inclusive Ireland, for example, through commissions of investigation and no-fault compensation schemes; our experience of tribunals and commissions of inquiry, for example, into corruption claims; and also with respect to failure as regards the rights of individuals, specifically the circumstances surrounding the taking into care of two Roma children in 2014 which I am sure members will remember and which was a traumatic and unacceptable event for the two families concerned.  <br/><br/>The Presidency has added an item to the General Affairs Council agenda on the inter-institutional agreement on better regulation.  Ireland has supported the Presidency&rsquo;s efforts to push forward the agreement and we have supported more generally the better regulation agenda which has moved ahead significantly under the current Commission.  The negotiations continue in trilogue format between the Presidency, the Commission and the Parliament and we are hopeful they will be concluded later this year. <br/><br/>The General Affairs Council agenda also includes a provision to discuss the Commission&rsquo;s work programme for 2016.  With other member states, in earlier discussions we welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s intention to follow the priorities identified in the strategic agenda which were agreed to by the European Council in June 2014.  We have underlined the need to prioritise the restoration of confidence and the promotion of economic growth and job creation, particularly for young people.  In that context, we welcome the Commission&rsquo;s emphasis on deepening the Single Market, in particular, the commitment to delivering on the digital Single Market strategy.  We have stressed the need for rapid progress in this area, as well as for full implementation of the services directive and maintaining a strong focus on support for small and medium enterprises which, as I have said, are the lifeblood of the European economy.</p><p>As we all know the European legislative programme has an enormous impact on citizens all over Europe.  In that light we will take particular interest in the Commission's proposals to boost jobs, growth and investment; the digital Single Market; the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP; implementing the 2030 climate and energy package and on other items of particular interest to the Irish people. </p><p> There will be two presentations to the GAC that effectively mark the beginning of the European semester 2016.  The Commission will highlight the key features of the next annual growth survey, to be published next Wednesday.  This will set out the Commission&rsquo;s key priorities for supporting growth and jobs over the period ahead.  The committee will recall that last year&rsquo;s annual growth survey developed a threefold emphasis on boosting investment, accelerating structural reforms and continuing to pursue growth-friendly fiscal consolidation.  With recovery in the European economy broadly on course I would expect to see continuity of this in the next cycle.</p><p> There will be a joint presentation by the current and incoming presidencies of the roadmap for the European semester for 2016.  I expect this to include the timelines for key council discussions on the annual growth survey publications of the Commission&rsquo;s country reports, engagement with the European Parliament and presentation of the draft country specific recommendations.  I look forward to continuing a high quality engagement with this committee.  There is a very significant workload over the next few months which necessitates my long presentation.  That concludes my statement and I look forward to answering any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

He covered many topics and I have no doubt there will be many questions.</p> <p>  I share the Minister of State&rsquo;s concerns about the Europe-wide competitiveness authority and its remit.  We have an authority of our own.  According to the five presidents&rsquo; report the Europe-wide one will have the ability to draw comparisons with economies elsewhere, such as in the United States and China, and make recommendations on matters such as wage rates or work conditions.  The worry is that there will be a race to the bottom, particularly given that we have set up a Low Pay Commission to consider issues such as the minimum wage.  I am not sure I see the need for a Europe-wide competitiveness authority.</p> <p>  A fiscal authority, however, could be quite useful because while we are lucky in this country to have an independent Fiscal Advisory Council, which gives reasoned opinions on matters such as our annual budget, some countries, such as Hungary, do not have that type of council.  A Europe-wide one would help ensure that countries which do not have an independent fiscal council would stick to the requirements of the fiscal compact. </p> <p>  In respect of the fiscal compact, Article 13 of the treaty stated there would be a conference twice a year to discuss the implementation of the treaty.  The most recent conference was held on Monday.  I was surprised at that meeting by the lack of awareness or engagement by many member states on the issue of Britain&rsquo;s potential exit from the EU.  One member state for instance proposed that we set up a parliament for eurozone members, which would fly in the face of what the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, is trying to achieve.  We could be in danger of sleepwalking into a situation where we do not reach a successful conclusion to the negotiations that would allow David Cameron make a case for staying in.  Is the Government preparing for that worst case scenario?  What will happen if Britain does vote to leave?  What measures and ideas does the Government have on how that might impact on us?  What is our plan?</p></speech>

That involved achieving support from several countries, including some where the party is in government.  It is a huge personal achievement for the Minister of State and an important one for the country and will enhance its influence within the EPP, which is a significant political force in most European countries.</p> <p>  I am very happy that the Taoiseach recently indicated in London his broad support for the Prime Minister.  The Government should give clear support to the Prime Minster to achieve the kind of reforms he wants to achieve.  Most of the reforms he wishes to achieve can only be good at an operational level.  There is merit in reducing bureaucracy and in keeping good State institutions going, as the Chairman mentioned in respect of the Competition Authority and the Fiscal Advisory Council.  While monetary and banking union are cardinal principles, progress on them should be secondary to making sure we achieve the necessary compromises to keep our good friend and ally the United Kingdom within the EU.  It is our biggest trading partner and we have ties of kinship there.  It is extremely important from my perspective as a Border representative that we do not re-establish the Border as we are normalising society there.  Good progress has been made recently on dealing with criminality around it and I hope there will be further progress there.  It is important to gradually make the Border irrelevant from a practical point of view. </p> <p>  I would like to have addressed other issues the Minister of State addressed but I am happy with his general viewpoint on them.  I am sure other members will address them.</p> <p>  I would like a clear statement from him that we are very much in the business of accommodating, and working with, the UK and providing the Prime Minister with the kind of &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; that would give him a case to keep the UK within the EU.  The EU will be a much richer place and more powerful diplomatically and politically and from all perspectives with the UK as a member.  I need to go home to the people I represent on the Border with that clear statement. </p></speech>

On the refugee crisis, I welcome the recognition of Turkey and its pivotal position, a view I have always held.  We have discussed the matter here at numerous meetings.  Turkey is the single most influential benign force in the entire region and it is good to see that its case for European Union membership is being advanced again when it had been shunned.  It is not really a great indication of the bargaining position of the European Union when it has to suddenly recognise Turkey's existence again and seek its assistance.  There are lessons to be learned from this and I hope they will be.<br/><br/>I congratulate the Naval Service on its tremendous work in the rescue operation in the area.  More than 8,000 people have been rescued since its members started their work.  It is a great commendation of their training and ability to deploy without fuss and move quickly.  In other situations throughout the European Union and <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>our neighbours, we tend to talk for a long time before any action is taken.  In this case, action was taken instantly and followed up.<br/><br/>I recognise and welcome the identification of hot spots to deal with incoming migrants.  To what extent, if any, are the European Union and the international community devising a means of dealing with the causes of the migration crisis?  The causes are obvious, namely, strife and conflict.  For example, in Libya there is no law; it is a case of anything goes.  It was unnecessary in the first place, but it is a clear indication that intervention can lead to a worse situation than anything that has happened before.  The international community, the United Nations and the European Union should be able to come to some conclusions about what might best be done to bring about peace in Libya and at least isolate the opposing groups that are causing such mayhem.  <br/><br/>I note the reference to non-eurozone and eurozone countries and the notion that eurozone countries should not take any action that might militate against the interests of non-eurozone countries.  I would have thought the reverse was an issue that also needed to be borne in mind.  As we all know, opportunities always arise for countries geographically adjacent to those with a strong currency.  They can usually play and operate this to their own advantage.  That has happened and will continue to happen.  Of course, it can also move in the reverse direction.  There is a danger that we might see non-membership of the European Union being advantageous as membership.  Allusions have been made in the debate in the United Kingdom to the fact that Switzerland and Norway have equal rights and entitlements.  They do not and that fact needs to be identified.  If that should become the cases that those countries committed to the European project will shoulder the burden of responsibility, while others enjoy the benefits.  I am concerned about this happening.<br/><br/>To what extent does the Minister of State think the semester process is working?  There was a ten-year plan which reached the end of its cycle before it was decided that it had not worked.  To what extent do cyclical reviews identify issues that might have caused problems in the past?</p></speech>

I would like to speak about a number of issues, but because there are time restraints, I will talk about the migration crisis.  It is quite obvious to many people seven or eight years ago that the problem had been completely underestimated by the European Union, when many organisations working in conflict areas were indicating that it would come upon us in a big way.  Groups such as Amnesty International and Concern had indicated that developments in countries such as Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan and particularly Syria made it inevitable that many would leave these countries and head towards the West.</p> <p>  I am a member of the Council of Europe human rights committee.  It is my opinion that the European Union has failed to deal with the origins of the migration crisis, which date back to the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and to Israel rejecting, I think, 42 UN resolutions on how to deal with the Palestinian crisis.  The emergence of many conflict groups can be traced back to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.  The European Union has failed to deal with how the crisis began and we are now reaping a whirlwind.</p> <p>  It has been acknowledged by many on the Council of Europe and within the European Union that America, Canada and other countries in the Middle East are not playing their part in dealing with the migration crisis.  It could be said America has been instrumental in creating much of the crisis in the Middle East because of its unremitting and relentless backing of Israel and its attacks on the Palestinians and its failure to recognise a Palestinian state.  What are the Minister of State's views on the conflicts?</p> <p>  We need to discuss the actual conflicts.  We have moved beyond discussing the migration crisis which is upon us.  All of the indications are that another 500,000 people may leave the conflict zone in Syria within the next few months.  There is conflict in Chad and other African countries, including Nigeria.  Are we preparing ourselves for the inevitable influx of another possibly 2 million refugees in the next two years if the conflicts are not dealt with comprehensively?</p> <p>  The European Union must come to terms with the fact that it has a part to play in bringing the conflict in Syria to an end.  It cannot be left to the Russians and the Americans who are arming both sides to decide how it will be dealt with.  We are not strong enough and are seen across the world as not being powerful enough to use our influence to deal with this awful conflict in the Middle East in which hundreds of thousands have died and millions have been disenfranchised.  Unless we step up to the plate, we will be seen as a non-entity by the Americans and the Russians, as we probably were during the conflict in Ukraine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.576" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015111200002#E00300"><p>Some might say we are living in exciting, challenging or dangerous times.  We are very proud Europeans.  The Minister of State has a very important role to play in representing Ireland, with his colleagues in Europe.  However, the backdrop in Europe is disturbing.  Britain is talking about exiting the European Union, while today Syriza is confronting a general strike in Greece which potentially is an additional destabilizer.  In the wonderful European country of Spain Catalonia is about to declare secession.  Already within the European Union there are very disturbing developments.</p> <p>  I will try to concentrate on two issues: migration and the rule of law.</p><p>I am very proud to live in Europe and to travel to Spain, Italy, France, Austria and Germany to absorb the cultural diversity that exists across Europe.  Of course I am very proud to have grown up in a liberal democracy, just as our partners in Europe have done.  Europe is a very attractive region for people who are trying to escape from poverty, war or dictatorship.  How does the Minister of State, on behalf of this State, intend to address the issue of immigration to Europe?  We are proud liberal democrats.  Huge numbers of people are moving from areas of conflict to our region of liberalism and liberal democracy.  It is wonderful that people recognise that liberal democracies are worth travelling to.</p><p> Of course we have to be, and are, sympathetic to people who are travelling to escape war.  However, I suggest that there is an undercurrent to the movement of people that we have not really addressed.  Is the Minister of State interested to note that a substantial number of Eritrean people, increasing numbers of Pakistani and Bangladeshi people and many Somalian people are travelling with that human mass?  Eritrea has been highlighted as a terrible dictatorship that people are trying to escape.  The Minister of State will be aware that Eritrea has a population of approximately 6 million.  Does he think Europe is ready for a mass movement of people from an adjoining country, Ethiopia, which has a population of 90 million?  The latest reports suggest it is almost inevitable that Ethiopia will be devastated by natural disaster.  Given that their neighbours from Eritrea have travelled such vast distances, does the Minister of State believe the knock-on effects of a natural disaster of the scale that is being prophesied would involve Ethiopians travelling and adding to the terribly sad mass movement of people who are trying to escape poverty?</p><p> Before I move on to the question of the rule of law, I would like to say that I obviously welcome the recent discussions with Africa leaders.  Maybe it is a bit too late.  I think that Ireland, which has played a great role in developmental aid, is very much to the fore in arguing that rather than having people leave their countries, we should go in there, provide the supports that are needed to make those countries attractive for employment and support the rule of law so that these countries become places where people are happy to live and work.  The Minister of State might give me his opinions on the recent discussions with the African leaders.  What was decided during those discussions?</p><p> I would like to follow up my reference to the rule of law, which is one of the issues that will be addressed.  Our neighbours in Romania would argue that they are being unfairly treated by some of our European partners in the context of allegations of corruption.  Is there an Irish position on that?</p></speech>

I can certainly continue on.  I suggest that Deputy Byrne continue his questioning until he needs to go to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I was asking the Minister of State about the allegations against Romania.  He will be aware that the Romanian Prime Minister, Victor Ponta, resigned last week.  People in Romania have alleged that elements in Europe are unfairly targeting Romania as a corrupt nation.  Does Ireland have a position on that?  Moldova, which is one of our neighbours in the Eastern Partnership, has been in a state of perpetual chaos since the last election in that country.  Does the Minister of State have a position on that?  Does he have a position on what is happening in Europe <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Spain and Catalonia?  The possibility of a British exit from the EU has been mentioned.  Does the Minister of State have a view on the difficulties being encountered by Portugal in forming a Government, and the stability of whatever Government might be formed as a result?  I ask him to hold off on answering my questions until I come back from the D&aacute;il Chamber so that I can listen to his answers.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has gives the committee a comprehensive report in advance of next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council.  This is a period of critical difficulties in Europe and throughout the world.  In light of what is happening, it is important for the EU to work together.  The summit in Malta, which will place an emphasis on Europe's links with African states, is also important.</p> <p>  The people of Turkey should be supported by the EU, which has not really honoured its promise to provide support, in the tremendous work they are doing with regard to migrants, emigration and refugees.  The difficulty is that the Balkan countries are trying to cope with the situation.  I am going to Montenegro next week in my capacity as co-rapporteur for the Council of Europe in monitoring that country.  People do not realise that Montenegro has taken in refugees from Kosovo, including a number of Roma people.  Montenegro, as a newly established democracy of just over 500,000 people, is coping extraordinarily well as it tries to deal with this refugee situation.  When I visited a refugee camp in Montenegro , I noted the work that is being done by the Montenegrin authorities with the people from Kosovo.  They would certainly be overwhelmed if they had to deal with refugees from Syria, Iraq and parts of Africa.</p> <p>  It would be preferable if we could try to keep as many as possible of the population of Syria, Iraq and Libya within the region and try to ensure they have the highest possible quality of life in the circumstances until a resolution is found, which must happen some day.  These countries have the potential to be enormously wealthy.  Syria, Iraq and Libya have substantial amounts of oil, for example.  Rather than taking in refugees, we should try to support these people in their own region from a cultural and religious - Islamic - perspective.  They need to be helped to stay within their own environments, which are very different from the environments they are going into in Sweden, Germany and elsewhere.</p> <p>  We are offering to take in 4,000 refugees, which is a reasonable number.  It is very hard for many people to comprehend that we can cope with 4,000 people at a time when we are unable to cope with the homeless people on the streets of Dublin.  It is very strange that we are in such a position.  If people looking in can see what is happening here, Ireland must not seem like a very attractive country.  Nevertheless, more support should be given to non-governmental agencies such as Goal and Concern, which are providing services within the camps on Turkey's borders with Syria and Iraq and in Libya.  Every possible support should be given to facilitate the construction of temporary housing in Ireland to be sent to assist people in refugee camps as the winter draws in.  No reference has been made today to the major difficulties that have been caused by the destabilisation of the whole population of this region by the so-called ISIS group.  It has added to the existing conflict by creating mayhem throughout the whole region.  It will certainly have to be dealt with before there is a solution in this area.</p> <p>  Generally speaking, I note and welcome the amount of funding that is being provided.  The Brexit issue and the other issues that will be considered at next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council really pale into insignificance by comparison with the migration and refugee situation.  The British negotiations are political issues which can and will be dealt with effectively.  In that context, I note the support we will be giving the British Government in the renegotiation process.  These issues will be dealt with in due course.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to what is happening overall in the Middle East.</p><p> The Minister of State did not refer in his statement to what is happening in Palestine and Israel, which is at the centre of the broader problems we are seeing.  People are being killed on both sides in that conflict.  It is a problem that must be resolved.</p><p> I wish the Minister of State well at the meeting of the General Affairs Council and thank him for briefing the committee.  All we can do is support him in his work through this difficult period.  I am sure he is working to the utmost of his ability to achieve our objectives.</p></speech>

The questions that have been put to the Minister of State cover a broad range of issues.  I invite him to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.586" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015111200002#G00300"><p>I thank members for their very knowledgeable questions.  I will begin by answering the last question, which related to the conflict in the Middle East.  It is an issue that was highlighted by the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, at the Foreign Affairs Council.  I did not refer to it in my statement but we are in full agreement with the requirement that these issues be raised and discussed.</p> <p>  On the question of preparing for the worst-case scenario in regard to Brexit, we are looking at the various potential outcomes.  It would be remiss of us not to consider what might happen if the people of the United Kingdom vote to leave the Union.  At this stage, however, it is vital that we, together with other member states, engage fully with the elements of Prime Minister Cameron's letter, which highlighted four areas in which he wishes to see changes.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, published a report recently which stated that it is in our national interest economically that the UK remain within the European Union.  Drilling down into those figures, it is important to acknowledge that the expectation of an economic difficulty for Ireland is based, in the main, on the greater economic difficulty the UK, our main trading partner, will suffer by virtue of its leaving the Union.  In other words, while we do see some difficulties for our economy, we see them as arising, in large part, because we do not consider it to be in the best economic interests of the UK to exit the Union.</p> <p>  Deputy Joe O'Reilly and others asked about how we are positioning ourselves in respect of the proposals put forward by Mr. Cameron.  We are absolutely clear that we want to support the British Government in achieving many of the measures it has set out because they are clearly in the interests of all member states.  Particularly in the area of competitiveness and in the case of reforms that are to the benefit of the Irish people and all the people of the EU, we will support such proposals in a very full manner.  We are now at the point where the detail is being discussed between European Council officials, Commission officials and member states.  There was a period of time in advance of this process starting where people were wondering when these issues would be dealt with, given they were highlighted some years ago and discussed in the course of the general election campaign in the UK.  However, we have now arrived at the substantive point.  The Government considers the approach being taken, which involves seeking the views of member states, as prudent.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked whether the proposal to establish national competitiveness boards might see a race to the bottom in terms of wages.  While I stated in my opening contribution that we are concerned about provisions which might add additional layers of bureaucracy and duplication, we are not really concerned that such bodies, if they come to pass, will undermine strong and important values such as the provision for a national minimum wage and protection for workers' rights.  The argument is that they offer a way of assessing and comparing between different jurisdictions.</p> <p>  With regard to the proposal for a European fiscal advisory board, the composition of such a body is very much at the discussion stage.  How it would operate certainly is of interest to us and the focus on the aggregate euro area fiscal stance might well be a welcome development.  However, given that the decision was published so recently, it is too early to adopt a more advanced position.  Reference was made to the fact that other countries do not have a fiscal advisory board-----</p></speech>

It is important to remember that we have other good friends in Europe and we will work to ensure reasonable ambitions are maintained.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan's observation that these are volatile times.  I agree, too, that the position and role of Turkey is now extremely important.  There is no doubt that in order for there to be any solution to this crisis, that country must have a role to play.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked whether the European semester process is working.  It is something of a subjective question but that said, we are seeing growth across the EU, which was not happening for a long time.  Employment is growing in many member states but we still have significant issues in many cases in regard to youth unemployment, which will have to be addressed.  Given that the European semester process is a relatively new format and the format itself has been amended to give more time for discussions between the various stages, it is very much a matter for us here in this committee to ensure we make the best use of the process.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan made a point about different types of EU membership.  Certainly, the Norwegian and Swiss cases are often referenced in the debate in the UK.  While Norway contributes very significant moneys, it does not have the same powers as member states.  It is a different type of membership.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked what is being done to address the causes of migration.  As I said, discussions are ongoing today in Malta.  There is absolute acceptance by everybody that the effects and consequences for member states and the people in transit must be mirrored by attempts to ensure the causes of migration are addressed.  UN Special Representative Bernardino Le&oacute;n has presented a political agreement for a government of national accord in Libya, as referred to by the Deputy.  Indications are that this is the final option for all parties.  Unfortunately, the deadline passed without the two main factions agreeing but the discussions will continue.  Ireland has strongly supported this being a UN-led process and we continue to urge all parties to seize the opportunity to endorse the peace agreements as soon as possible.</p><p>We will continue to play our part in contributing to state-building assistance measures and supporting people on the ground.  Deputy Eric Byrne returned at an opportune moment.</p></speech>

I hope he does not lose the Whip as a result.</p> <p>  I hope the predictions of humanitarian and weather-related crises in Ethiopia and Eritrea do not come to pass.  Unfortunately, there will always be crises, whether climate or conflict related, on the borders of the European Union.  We must work much harder to mitigate and, where possible, prevent such crises, as well as building states.  </p> <p>  Deputy Halligan made a similar point and noted the many reasons for, and causes of, the migration crisis.  We are working actively in this area.  While the issue tends to be discussed more at the Foreign Affairs Council, there is no question that the consequences of developments in many Middle East countries are a significant contributory factor.</p> <p>  We are closely monitoring developments in Moldova.  These relationships are monitored through the eastern partnership configuration.  We will continue to work with Moldova and other eastern partnership countries with a view to encouraging political and economic development.  This highlights again the issue of the rule of law.</p> <p>  Deputy Eric Byrne correctly stated that asylum seekers are coming from a broad range of countries.  Each application for refugee status is assessed on its merits.  The principal reason for the so-called "hotspot" solution is to expedite the application process.  It may be in order for me to circulate to the joint committee the report of the Valletta talks, which are discussing, as we speak, the specific issues the Deputy raised.  I am sure we will have a report in the next day or two and we will forward it when it is received.   Deputy Halligan noted correctly that we must address both the sources and consequences of conflict. </p> <p>  On the issue of political developments in Portugal and Spain, as members will be aware, a general election will be held in Spain on 20 December and Portugal held a general election in the past month.  We will respect the democratic decisions taken in both countries, first as Portugal deals with the effects of its election and, second, as Spain prepares for its election.  We may find ourselves preparing for a general election in early 2016.</p></speech>

Much stronger supports are available for countries of origin.  Countries of transit outside the European Union must also receive the support they need.  At the most recent meetings of the General Affairs Council, commitments were given and agreements made.  At this point, the discussions are focused on delivering on these commitments, particularly with respect to hotspots for applicants in the European Union.  We must also ensure people are in place on the ground.  We must implement the commitments given by member states and work as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  The Senator stated that this issue stands head and shoulders above all other issues.  That is without question correct and this is accepted.  I attended some Justice and Home Affairs Council formations and, on occasion, Foreign Affairs Council formations, as well as the General Affairs Council meetings.  If one adds the European Council meetings attended by Heads of State and Government, it is clear that the migration issue attracts the vast majority of discussion, as is appropriate, at all four Council formations I cited.  European leaders will have to continue to focus on this matter until we start seeing significant improvements in the months ahead. </p></speech>

While we could have availed of an opt-out mechanism, Ireland instead chose to opt into the measures for relocation and resettlement of refugees.  This reflects the humanitarian spirit of Irish people who know better than people in most countries that, from time to time, people have to leave their country of origin, whether as victims of war or famine.  All of us look forward to welcoming people to this country, some of whom have arrived, while others will arrive soon.  It is crucial that we ensure these people are properly integrated into Irish life and can play a full role in society, as Irish people have done around the world.</p></speech>

Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  I feel especially privileged to be here to discuss some of the research in which my colleagues and I have been engaged for the past 35 years or so at Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Harvard Medical School and that of colleagues both here and abroad.  I am particularly grateful as a researcher to be talking to policy makers because there is often a wide gap between research and public policy.  It is very gratifying for me to be able to share these ideas with the committee.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  My focus is on the youngest members of society, those who literally do not have a voice - infants and toddlers.  Committee members perhaps assume they have very little to say because they cannot say much, as I once assumed.  We understood very little about their minds, hearts and brains.  The foundations of sound mental health are built in the first three years or 1,000 days of life.  These early years provide the essential foundations of stability for all other aspects of human development, the capacity to face adversity, to have friendships, to have success and happiness in school, the community and work.  They are crucial for the long-term health of any society.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  I wish to cover five key points: brain development in the first three years, or 1,000 days, of life; the influence of early experiences on brain development; the importance of prevention rather than treatment for children in adverse environments; the need for professional training in infant mental health and indications for public policy.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  For much of the 20th century, many people, including many scientists, severely underestimated the mental and social capacities of infants.  We assumed, for example, that newborns could not see, that infants could not think or that if they could, their thought processes were concrete, immediate and extremely limited.  We also assumed that infants were fragile and had a narrow emotional range.  We failed to be convinced that babies could grieve, be sad or even traumatised.</font></p><p>We &ndash; nurses, doctors, psychologists, therapists and teachers - tended or perhaps wanted to believe young children did not quite understand what was happening around them, or were so resilient that they would simply grow out of the problems they were facing.  That infants and toddlers could have mental health problems was beyond our ken.  The field of infant mental health had not yet emerged.  However, all that has changed.  In the past 30 years there has been a revolution in our understanding of the capacities and inner lives of babies and toddlers and, in particular, the workings of the infant brain.  Brain development in the first three years of life is more extensive and vulnerable to environmental influences than in any other period in one's lifespan and has a longer term impact than was previously thought.  We now know that the brain doubles in size in the first year of life.  By age three, the brain is at 80% to 90% of its adult volume.  Even more importantly, the synapses - the connections between neurons and brain cells - are formed at a faster rate during these years than at any other time in life.  In the first years of life between 700 and 1,000 new neural connections are formed every second, as the brain builds synapses.  If any member of the committee goes home tonight and meets someone under three years, he or she should look at that little girl or boy in the eye and realise this is happening.  All of the synaptic connections in the child's brain are being stimulated and the adults around him or her are contributing to his or her well-being as he or she is building up his or her brain architecture.<br/><br/><b></b>The environment influences brain development; the process of building the brain is not genetically determined.  Between birth and the age of three years, children's brains are malleable and more plastic than at any other time in their lifespan.  Sensitive and responsive caregiving is a requirement for the healthy neurophysiological and psychological development of a child.  It even mediates lifelong outcomes.  We know that during the first three years children&rsquo;s long-term capacities to think, understand, trust, empathise and feel concern for others are being fundamentally shaped.  By age three years, the child's orientation towards life is very firmly established.  This means that the relationship between parents, caregivers and all who make up the child's network are critical in shaping that little brain.  The people mentioned set up the child's expectations for life.  On the other hand, strong, prolonged adverse experiences such as extreme deprivation, abuse, neglect, exposure to violence or the absence of supportive adult relationships can lead to changes in the physical structure and functioning of the brain.  Such changes include chemical responses, impaired cell growth, changes in the proteins and other molecules produced by the brain, the death of neurons and interference with the formation of healthy neural networks.  The strength and quality of the child's relationships are critical.  <br/><br/>The importance of prevention rather than treatment must be emphasised in this regard.  By preventing problems from developing in the first place, not just treating them after they have occurred, we can undo the effects of these early adverse experiences.  The earliest years of life present the greatest opportunity for preventing and mitigating harm from trauma and setting the course for optimal development.  In the case of child maltreatment, for example, there is a shift towards a prevention promotion framework rather than just addressing it when it actually occurs.  Our aim is to strengthen the capacity of parents and communities to care for children in ways that promote optimal health and well-being.  The research paradigms have shifted our focus towards strengths-based approaches to prevention and towards valuing what parents bring to the table in the first place rather than labelling them or taking a pathological approach.  Our approaches should allow parents to dig deep and we should be looking at the social and cultural capital within communities on which parents can draw in bringing the best out of their young children.<br/><br/><b></b>The need for professional training in infant mental health is also significant.  Physicians, nurses, psychologists, teachers, providers of early care and education, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, speech pathologists, social workers &ndash; anyone who has responsibility for the care of infants and toddlers &ndash; should be required to seek professional training in infant mental health to better understand and appreciate the inner world of infants and their parents.  Anybody who comes in touch with a baby and its family and who has responsibility for the care of infants and toddlers should be required to receive this training as it enables them to have a sympathetic understanding of what is happening in the child's life, as well as a non-judgmental approach towards parents.  Nothing can really replace an informed and sympathetic understanding of the needs of infants and families or a non-judgmental and culturally respectful approach to parents and their families.  <br/><br/>In Ireland we have the Irish Association of Infant Mental Health which provides training for professionals from a range of disciplines to prepare them to promote early social and emotional development in babies and toddlers and the establishment of healthy and secure attachment relationships.  Having a new cadre of professionals trained in infant mental health will undoubtedly reduce the burden of mental health problems for future generations and allow for the full development of vulnerable children.<br/><br/><b></b>On the implications for public policy, early disadvantage such as the impact of poverty, ill health and other adversities such as homelessness can have a significant influence on children's future progress.  More often than not, such disadvantages are beyond the control of individual families.  That is why I am grateful to be before the committee.  Policies that support families and communities are critical, as the strength and quality of the relationship between caregivers, families and their children are fundamental to the effective development of children&rsquo;s brain functions and capacity.  Besides, as James J. Heckman who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2000, pointed out, early interventions with infants and toddlers result in much higher economic returns than later interventions.  Although early intervention is never too late, at age three years, just before school, it is very late.  Initiating programmes that meet the developmental needs of children from birth to age three years is as much about building a strong foundation for lifelong physical and mental health as it is about enhancing readiness to succeed in school.  This approach puts families and children at the centre of a multifaceted model that includes building protective practice for families, reducing risk factors for children, strengthening local communities and connecting all this through systems change and policy.  <br/><br/>I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to address it.  I feel very privileged.</p></speech>

We circulated copies of our report, Meeting the Mental Health Support Needs of Children and Adolescents: A Children&rsquo;s Mental Health Coalition View, to members in advance.  I am co-ordinator of the coalition and policy and research officer at Mental Health Reform which provides the secretariat for the coalition.  I am accompanied by Ms Lara Kelly, our communications and campaigns officer.  The coalition consists of more than 50 member organisations and concerned individuals from a range of backgrounds and sectors, including children&rsquo;s rights, human rights, education and mental health services.  Its key objective is to advocate for improvements in child and adolescent mental health services and supports.</p> <p>  The coalition acknowledges that there have been positive developments in child and adolescent mental health services and supports in recent years.  Such developments include the expansion of Jigsaw direct access supports; an increase of 153 clinical staff in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, between 2008 and 2015, from 352 to 505; and a decrease in the number on waiting lists from 3,117 in 2008 to 2,240 in August 2015, despite increases in the level of service demand.  The number of children and adolescents waiting more than 12 months to be seen by CAMHS has also decreased, from 897 in 2008 to 241 in August 2015.</p><p>Additional developments include the publication of the standard operating procedures, both inpatient and community, for CAMHS, the roll-out of the <i>yourmentalhealth.ie </i>campaign, publication of the national guidelines on mental health promotion and well-being for both primary and post-primary schools and the establishment of the ACT service in Oberstown national children&rsquo;s detention facility. <br/><br/>Despite recent Government efforts, the reality is that significant challenges continue to exist for a wide range of families and children who require mental health supports across the country.  These challenges concern prevention, access to supports, effective co-ordination between agencies and ensuring the voice of the child is heard.  In terms of early intervention, it is now widely accepted that the foundation for healthy, psychological, social and emotional health across the life span is developed in infancy and early childhood.  Gaps that exist in the area of infant mental health include the absence of clinical psychology and-or parent-child psychotherapists in maternity hospitals, a lack of training on infant mental health among staff working in maternity hospitals and the absence of child specific public health nursing posts.  These gaps in services should be addressed through allocated funding.  Furthermore, while the publication of the national guidelines on mental health promotion and well-being is positive, there is a need for a clear implementation plan and effective resourcing to ensure the guidelines translate into action.  Training and support for schools is needed in order to implement a whole-school approach.<br/><br/>Access to mental health services and supports is often difficult for children and families.  The coalition attributes such difficulties to a number of factors, including inadequate capacity in primary care, restrictive referral criteria for access to community-based CAMHS, a lack of specialist services, the low number of child and adolescent inpatient beds, lengthy waiting periods, a lack of information about what to do during the waiting period as well as difficulties in navigating the child and adolescent mental health system.  The HSE has reported that between January and August 2015, 29% of all child and adolescent admissions to acute units were to adult inpatients wards.  This is only a marginal decrease, approximately 5%, on the proportion of child admissions to adult inpatient units when A Vision for Change was first published in 2006.  It is well evidenced that adult inpatient units are not appropriate, safe environments for children and adolescents and that care in such settings may be ineffective.<br/><br/>The Ombudsman for Children recently reported that a number of complaints submitted to his office were about children being inappropriately placed in adult inpatient facilities, in particular children at risk of suicide or self-harm, and that these situations appeared to be due to a lack of suitable emergency placements.  The Children&rsquo;s Mental Health Coalition has also identified that a key challenge to providing high quality, accessible mental health services and supports is inadequate inter-agency communication and collaboration.  A small survey conducted by the coalition in two areas identified 24 different agencies involved in supporting the mental health of children.  Co-ordination is a challenge between CAMHS and adult mental health services, mental health and primary care services, mental health services and Tusla, and between schools and mental health services. <br/><br/>Particular groups of children, such as children in the care of the State, children with a co-morbid diagnosis of mental health and intellectual disability, homeless children and children and adolescents with a dual diagnosis of mental health difficulties and substance misuse have seen little development of services to meet their needs.  The gaps in child and adolescent mental health services and supports extend further, including a lack of capacity at primary care level to appropriately detect, refer and care for children with mental health difficulties and the absence of a national counselling service for children.<br/><br/>The Children&rsquo;s Mental Health Coalition believes that measures can be taken to improve mental health supports for children and adolescents.  The coalition is of the view that in order to improve access to child and adolescent mental health services a national-level approach to inter-agency collaboration is required between Government Departments and agencies.  This is particularly relevant for CAMHS and Tusla, as reflected in the report of the task force on the Child and Family Support Agency. <br/><br/>Better systems of co-ordination are also needed between schools and primary care and specialist mental health services.  The coalition has consistently heard of difficulties that teachers face when they are concerned about the mental health of one of their students in terms of getting advice from CAMHS, referral into services and follow-up after the student has received mental health services.  Specialist services for at-risk groups of children and adolescents, including those groups just mentioned, must be developed as a matter of priority.  Given that figures for suicide in Ireland among young males aged 15 to 19 years are particularly high by international comparisons and that rates of self-harm in Ireland are highest among the younger population, it is imperative that appropriate crisis services are made available throughout the country for children and adolescents.  The coalition has previously called on the HSE to ensure that all community child and adolescent mental health services provide a specialist out of hours and crisis service that is well publicised, fully staffed and resourced to provide a rapid response. <br/><br/><i></i>A Vision for Change recommends that children and their families are provided with appropriate opportunities to give feedback on their experiences and to influence developments within the mental health services.  At present, guidance for CAMHS on enabling children to participate in decisions regarding their mental health has been included in the recently published standard operating procedures.  In keeping with A Vision for Change and with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, such guidance must be implemented as a matter of priority across all services <br/><br/>The absence of a national advocacy service for children and adolescents accessing mental health services is also of fundamental concern.  Advocacy supports must be made available to all such children as a matter of priority to ensure that some of our most vulnerable children can have their voice heard.  There is no doubt that the lack of staffing in CAMHS has contributed to many of the shortfalls in service provision.  Information provided by the HSE to the Children&rsquo;s Mental Health Coalition last week confirms that the number of clinical staff in post in community child and adolescent mental health services is 505.  This represents only 50% of the staffing level recommended in A Vision for Change.  It also represents a decrease of 16 clinical staff in community CAMHS since December 2014. <br/><br/>In May 2015, the CAMHS in Waterford stopped taking referrals and appointments due to the absence of a consultant psychiatrist and difficulties in recruiting a consultant to the vacant post.  Despite efforts by the HSE to recruit staff to CAMHS, this is proving largely unsuccessful to date.  Additional measures must be put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure that child and adolescent mental health services are adequately staffed and to look at creative ways of using existing staff to enable prompt access to CAMHS. <br/><br/>Despite positive developments, there are still huge challenges to bringing about the type of mental health care for children and adolescents that fulfils national policy and international human rights obligations.  These challenges reflect the continued vulnerability of child and adolescent mental health services across the country and the need to have sustained political will in order to improve the mental health outcomes of Ireland&rsquo;s children and young people. </p></speech>

It was inspired to combine a strong medical aspect and a process aspect in the discussion.  It was an important mix.  What jumped out at me in Ms Mitchell's presentation was the issue of gaps in services.  It appears that the current policy, A Vision for Change, which will be ten years old next year, was not resourced adequately to achieve the transition from acute, long-term care in institutions with high walls and lock-up keys to the virtual ward in the community.  The policy of filling those gaps based on natural wastage was retrograde.  We have a transition from long-term residential care, during which we are waiting for a whole time equivalent, whether it be a domestic security man or woman or a gardener that will not be recruited to underpin the transition into the primary care team until someone reaches the age of 65.  A policy, A Vision for Change, which provides for primary care - the virtual ward in the community - was rolled out, but it will not be resourced adequately until someone retires from the old system, at which point someone is recruited into the new system.  It is at that point that there will be targeted investment into the team.</p><p>A total of &euro;35 million was provided for it in the programme for Government.  We will not go there because from the previous comment on the investment in primary care, the team itself would appear to be significantly short of what was set out in the policy.</p><p> I thought Professor Nugent's contribution was wonderful.</p></speech>

Does he believe there is a role for the introduction into the education curriculum, either at preschool or in the early school years for cognitive behaviour therapy, CBT?  That would be one area to develop in terms of some self awareness for children to recognise the source of issues that arise.  Professor Nugent's description of the early influence of external factors point to the significant role of the economy, job insecurity, quality of home and community.  That has an important role to play in this country, which is a perfect example of a relatively small society that has had a significant impact from the collapse of the international market and its impact on the individual and the community.</p> <p>  My final point relates to the chronic lack of an appropriate, acute residential unit for children experiencing self harm or a holistic safe location for mental health supports.  When children are placed on adult wards it becomes a lifelong stigma for the child.  Could Ms Mitchell provide a progressive analysis of the shortcomings in the service, where we need to provide more, what the policy is and whether it is being fully implemented?</p> <p>  It is very difficult to measure or benchmark key performance indicators in the area of child and adolescent mental health services.  It is also difficult to say, in the context of the provision of &euro;35 million to secure transparency on per annum current expenditure in that area, that it is not a case of &euro;35 million, as the amount builds every year in current expenditure.  In year 2 it is &euro;70 million and in year 3 it is &euro;105 million.  If the money is not spent at all it is not just a case of &euro;35 million that is not being spent.  What is the consequence, in particular in the area of capital expenditure of the chronic lack of child and adolescent mental health beds in an acute residential setting?  How many beds do we need and what is the level of urgency in the area?</p></speech>

I might be a little bit provocative in teasing out some of the points made by Professor Nugent.  I very much appreciate the thrust of all that has been outlined both by Professor Nugent and Ms Mitchell.  However, what strikes me is that it is almost like a fire brigade response.  It is a case of focussing where the problem presents, and setting out the responses we need and that we must develop and provide rather than trying to address the problems before they might even present.</p> <p>  I scribbled a note for myself.  I cannot speak for other churches as the only one of which I have personal experience is the Catholic Church.  It insists on pre-marriage courses.  I have no doubt that is verified, but surely pre-parenting courses in whatever setting would be at least of equal importance, and in my opinion of even greater importance.  It is not a part of any of the preparation.  I speak as a parent of five children.  Listening to both speakers and all they have outlined made me think back on what prepared me for the role of becoming a parent.  It was almost just a case of it being something that would happen, yet before the church would even permit access it insisted that we would hear its views on how we might cope with the stresses and strains of the compromise of married life.  I am not different to anybody else; I am sure becoming a parent has been one of the most challenging, new realities in the life of any young adult.</p> <p>  Professor Nugent said that during the first three years of life children's long term capacity to think, understand and solve problems, etc., are in their most crucial developmental stages.  He spoke of "we".  As a public representative and parent I am trying to say I am sorry, I just did not know.  I thought Deputy Keaveney would touch on the issue when he spoke about the education system, but more than just in terms of the point he made, I do not know of any other structure that will address future parents, the most important role anybody could be entrusted with in life other than through the school system.  This is at least as important as any other academic course that might present either in primary, secondary or even third level education.  I am trying to tease out the subject with the witnesses to find out if they have a view.  Do they think the knowledge that has been imparted to us in the short opportunity both witnesses have had should be made more widespread?  That is not happening in the school system.  Nobody is saying what we know.  Expert opinion must become societal knowledge.  There needs to be a critical understanding and awareness.  I am not responding specifically to the points that were made; I am trying to look beyond that and to broaden out the platform of responsibility because we need to get to a point where all young children are given the maximum prospect of a fulfilling life.</p></speech>

I will leave that point with Professor Nugent.  I am very interested to hear how he will address it.</p> <p>  I will move on to Ms Mitchell's contribution.  I am sorry to have been a little long on the first point.  I wish to focus on the gaps that exist within the infant mental health area.  The incidence of stopping referrals and appointments in CAMHS in Waterford, the inability to recruit in Sligo and Leitrim and the fact that current staffing is only 50% of what was recommended in A Vision for Change are all serious issues.  The Waterford and Sligo and Leitrim situations seem to both be hung on the hook of the absence of a consultant psychiatrist.  My understanding is that Dr. D'Alton is not a psychiatrist, he is a psychologist.  Are we locked into the need for the medical and psychiatric area?  Is it a fault line in the system that such experts cannot be recruited?  I have met many eminent psychologists and they have been of much more help to me and many others than those in the field of psychiatry.</p><p>I mean no disrespect but is there a way of dealing with this?  The witness is talking about additional measures and a more creative way of using existing staff but what I am trying to explore is whether there are perhaps other answers that would allow us to bring the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, up to the level that we clearly need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.623" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111200002#G00200"><p>I will reflect Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comments, as parenting is all there, even before a person has a baby.  There are prenatal classes and one person in the organisation can really help, which is the district nurse.  District nurses go to families after the birth of babies.  I have spoken to district nurses and they tell me they can see the problems immediately.  We need to get back to that.  I am speaking from the experience of being a school principal in charge of 620 children from age four upwards.  Correct me if I am wrong but there seems to be more children presenting with issues than there have been in the past.  Is that because of the pressures of life?  I do not know.</p> <p>  I had the experience of helping a young person admitted to a psychiatric service well known in Dublin.  It was a residential service and every night I went to visit the young adult, different staff were working.  I was the liaison person but I could not speak to the same person one night after another.  There would be round-table family conferences and they would always involve different staff.  I found it very difficult to sit and watch what I thought was a service that was not good enough.  This occurred in the past and it was not during this Government's tenure.</p> <p>  I visited a school principal recently in my constituency in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to discuss cyberbullying in a girls' school.  While attending the meeting, the principal told me it was not cyberbullying at all but self-harm.  At the end of the contribution, the witness indicated that 147 girls in the 15-year-old to 19-year-old age group presented to hospital as a consequence of self-harm.  I know the parents of some girls whose children seemed to be capable, with everything fine in the home, but they were affected by this.  Will the witnesses tell us what is going on in society?  Will they advise parents on the first port of call in such an instance?  There is no point giving out and criticising as when parents want help, where can they go and what is the best advice?  Perhaps sometimes it will not involve psychiatric services and a parent should be able to sit down and advise a child.  Perhaps it might involve a sibling, aunt or uncle.  What is the best approach?  I am not so sure the best action is to run off and look for a psychologist or psychiatrist; sometimes, a solution rests within a family.  Parents - like many of our parents - might sit down and talk children through their issues and problems.</p></speech>

With regard to investment, we have been informed that &euro;35 million extra has been invested each year, except for one year when &euro;25 million was put in, over the past five years.  That represents an increase next year of &euro;165 million extra every year, as recruited people must be paid every year and introduced services must be provided every year.  It is not as simple as having &euro;35 million and giving another &euro;35 million.  There will have been &euro;165 million put in after the last budget.  Every time we ask questions on the number of people recruited, we are told there are difficulties relating to access.  We want to recruit approximately 1,100 people into the area, including CAMHS.  People have mentioned that some of the investment has gone into CAMHS so perhaps we can get a handle on what developments have taken place because of the investment.</p> <p>  There is a difficulty in that beds are vacant while children are in adult facilities.  It is a real difficulty.  I come from Limerick and if somebody there needs child inpatient care, the family must go outside the area.  Parents are often inclined to say that they want to visit their child every day and cannot do it if the child is in Dublin, Cork or Galway.  The same applies for Donegal.  How does somebody in Donegal visit a child of four, five, six, eight, ten or 12 in a hospital when a parent feels his or her presence is very important to the child's recovery because of their relationship?</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about out-of-hours services but going back ten years, there were no out-of-hours services for anybody.  There is a level of service now.  Is it still confined to 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays?  There are certain areas that have expanded the service to weekends.  What level of out-of-hours services are there now for child and adolescent psychiatric services?  With regard to self-harm, we know the largest cohort of females is in those aged 15 to 20, and for men it is for those aged between 20 and 25.  It is a young person's issue.  Each year, there are approximately 1,100 admissions to accident and emergency services related to this.  Two eminent people are involved in the area, Professor Ella Arensman, president of the International Association for Suicide Prevention and director of the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork and Professor Keith Hawton in Oxford, and they have stated that for every person who attends a psychiatric unit having self-harmed, there are at least eight who do not attend.  Those people either go to their doctor or, because of stigma, which is another issue, conceal it within the family.  Some do not even report it.  If we are to extrapolate from those expert figures, it means more than 60,000 people of all ages are self-harming every year although it is predominantly a young person's issue.</p> <p>  We are still severely under-resourced in mental health services, going back decades or perhaps centuries.  We still have less than 6% of the total health budget going to mental health services.  England and Scotland put 13% of the budget into these services and Wales puts in 18% of its budget.  We have a big hill to climb in providing proper mental health services for children and adults in this country.</p></speech>

Many of the points I wished to mention have already been raised and I will not go over them.  Ms Mitchell gave a very comprehensive presentation on staff shortages and the difficulty with recruitment, .  Is information available as to why we are finding it so difficult to recruit?  Is it a shortage of people with qualifications or is there a problem with salaries or structure?  What issues have been identified in the difficulty in recruiting?  This takes in medical practitioners, consultants, junior doctors, nursing staff and social workers.</p><p>Have the reasons for these difficulties been identified?  It has been suggested that we have met just 50% of our staff target.  What would happen if we wanted to recruit the other 50% in the morning?  Obviously, we would have difficulties in certain areas.  The witnesses might refer to the key areas where we are having difficulties.</p><p> Do we have difficulties in different areas because of management structures?  Is there a problem with the management and with who is in charge?  Has that been identified?  This is very important.  The Chairman and I are aware that great progress has been made in one part of a health area, but there is significant resistance to change in the adjoining area.  The issue of change is relevant because we are changing our approach to many areas.  Have the witnesses found that there is resistance to change from people who are already in the service?  Have we identified a way of dealing with that issue?  I am raising this issue because I do not think we can provide a service unless the necessary personnel are available.  If we are having difficulty in getting personnel, we should look at the reasons this problem is arising.</p><p> The committee received a presentation on young people earlier.  Professor Nugent spoke about the need to support children at a very young age.  When we speak about supporting young children, we are usually talking about the mother and the father.  If a mother who is on her own is not getting any support from her immediate family, does that have a knock-on effect on the child?  Has any research shown that there is a knock-on effect?  How can we work to provide support to a mother who finds herself on her own?  How can we help her to give her child the same support and the same chances as any other child who has full backing and full financial support?  It is an interesting issue that Professor Nugent might touch on.</p></speech>

My perspective is that everybody who comes into contact with the child - the dentist, the carer, the teacher or the occupational therapist - should be informed by mental health philosophy and understanding.  We need an informed but compassionate understanding of the needs of children and families.  I think it was Deputy Neville who spoke about the importance of parent education.  It is really a question of supporting parents more than anything else.  The issue of isolation is a key one in this context.  This is also relevant to the last question I was asked.  As far as I can see, our target is not to give parents brain-based programmes to make their children smarter or better.  It is far from that.  It is all about relationships.  If the relationship is not there, nothing will happen.  Learning cannot take place outside the context of a relationship in which the child feels safe, secure and loved.  Only then will a child go into the world, explore it intrepidly and be ready to learn with a sense of openness.  Regardless of whether we are talking about a school setting or a community setting, our feeling is that the key issue in the first three years is parent support.  People who work with families need to be non-judgmental and culturally inclusive.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, this is not happening in the school system.  I want to pull out the cultural capital that exists within families, regardless of their cultural backgrounds, by giving them a chance to express themselves with their children.  All parents want the best for their children.</p> <p>  I agree with the point that nurses have a key role from a cultural perspective.  I was delivered by a midwife.  These people have a marvellous role to play, and it is a role that has been attached to them for many years.  All of us need to acknowledge that children can be helped.  I will give an example.  I saw a six week old baby with all the symptoms of depression.  It was a remarkable case because when I met this baby on the first day of her life in a hospital not far from here, she was responsive and available.  I said to the medic who was with me that the baby was having such a good start in life.  She was bright as a button.  She was tracking and looking around.  She was ready for action.  When I saw her again six weeks later as she was being placed for adoption, she was unrecognisable because of whatever had happened in the meantime.  She had really lost her zest for life.  She had poor tone and she was crying all the time.  She was almost inconsolable.  Of course this is absolutely reversible.  The key thing for the child was to find a relationship with somebody who unconditionally loves her.  That allowed the child to reclaim her initial zest for life and her biological expectation that her needs for food and love will be met.</p> <p>  It is certainly true that the earlier we can get there, the better.  We feel that these interventions should involve supporting parents more than anything else.  They should be family-centred and community-based.  As many members have pointed out, the focus should not be on the individual parent.  Isolation is really the enemy.  Senator Burke asked whether there is any data in this regard.  There is data all over the place.  For example, a premature baby who is isolated is more likely to have all sorts of issues.  Isolation is even more important than social class.  The absence of support can be a problem.  It has been mentioned that it is important for mothers to have other women to talk to.  I really want to support that whole issue.  My focus is on prevention.  Ms Mitchell is dealing with critical things like young people self-harming.  I am saying that we should be seeing the signs right at the beginning.  We should look at whether there are mental health issues in the first three years.  Luckily, people like Dr. D'Alton are looking at this.  The Irish Association for Infant Mental Health is training professionals to be aware of this.  One needs to have very good eyes to see that children are showing the signs of trauma, but it can be done.  We do not want to believe that very young children notice what is going on.  I used to say that they do not notice, but I know now that they notice everything.  The six week old who was mentioned noticed that the world was not there for him.  He was fed, but he already realised that his biological expectation and need to be cared for was not being met.  By that time, he had internalised a model of the world as a world that is not there for him.  Our goal is to support the development of trust and of the expectation that the world is going to be there for children and is going to support children.</p> <p>  I will conclude by summarising what I have said.  I hope I can address all of the concerns of members by saying that this is an issue of prevention at an earlier stage.  The human brain is at its most malleable in first three years.  I remind the committee that this is a case of "use it or lose it".  If a child gets positive reinforcement from his or her parents, all the architecture of his or her brain will be framed by that.  By the time he or she goes into school, he or she will be ready to learn by virtue of what happened before his or her third birthday.  If a child is secure, he or she will not have to prove anything and he or she will be ready to explore.  By contrast, the anxious child who does not feel a sense of being valued and loved in the early years will have great difficulty in school.  All I will say, following the work of Dr. D'Alton and others, is that we should be there at the very beginning.  If we were to ensure all professionals are given mental health training when they enter the profession, we would deal with one of the key issues that presents itself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.630" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Mitchell" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111200002#H00500"><p>I will do my best to try to answer the committee's questions as comprehensively as I can.  If I miss anything or if members have any follow-up questions, I ask them to come back to me.</p> <p>  Deputy Keaveney asked where we are at, and where we are going, with regard to A Vision for Change and its resourcing.  The first thing we need to address is the huge challenge that is being faced in the recruitment of mental health staff.  I refer particularly to child and adolescent mental health services.  We know the HSE has been driving international recruitment campaigns.  The number of people applying for nurse and consultant mental health positions, including child and adolescent mental health positions, on foot of those campaigns is relatively low.  I will say a little more about that when I respond to Senator Burke's questions.</p><p> Another matter we need to look at is the recognition of some underdeveloped areas since the publication of A Vision for Change.  There have been commitments to invest in the area of eating disorders for children and adolescents.  We know this service will be part of the new children's hospital and that training for mental health staff in the area of eating disorders for children and adolescents has progressed this year.  However, other areas of need have been somewhat overlooked, including, for example, mental health and intellectual disability.  In A Vision for Change, approximately 15 teams were recommended to be dedicated for mental health of intellectual disability and yet we only have approximately four MHID posts in place.  That is a significant issue.  There is also the question of children and adolescents presenting with issues of dual diagnosis of mental health difficulties and substance misuse.  Anecdotally, we hear stories from organisations and families to the effect that they experience major difficulty in accessing the mental health supports that children and adolescents require.  A Vision for Change recommended that there would be two dedicated teams to address these issues but we have not seen the establishment of those teams.  We still have a way to go in terms of developing specialist services, some of which have received little attention since the publication of A Vision for Change.</p><p> There is also the issue of developing capacity in other areas such as primary care.  At the moment, there are major concerns to the effect that the capacity simply does not exist to detect mental health difficulties and refer patients appropriately.  This even extends to concerns over awareness of other community mental health supports that may be of benefit to children and adolescents.  The area needs significant investment and attention, as do other areas such as out-of-hours crisis services.</p><p> Members referred to the monitoring of what is happening in terms of service provision relating to mental health outcomes for children and young people.  The standard operating procedures for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, was published some months ago.  These were developed for inpatient and community CAMHS.  This was a major step forward in trying to standardise service provision for children and adolescents.  We know that one of the bigger concerns is the variation in service provision for children and adolescents in accessing services throughout the country.</p><p> One of the questions is what should happen next.  There needs to be implementation of these standard operating procedures throughout the country in all mental health services for children and adolescents.  This is something the Children's Mental Health Coalition and Mental Health Reform will be keeping a close eye on.  There is also a need for a system of monitoring appropriate outcomes.  This has been recommended by the World Health Organization and is in line with international good practice.  This is something the Children's Mental Health Coalition has been advocating.  It is most important.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked a question about early intervention.  The area based childhood programme is funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It contains elements of mental health promotion and at a local level specific ABC programmes in certain areas have specific mental health programmes within them.  However, we recommend that there should be a national roll-out of these.  Moreover, there needs to be clear recognition of mental health components within early intervention programmes.</p></speech>

Anyone who wishes to get married in a particular church has to do a pre-marriage course.  However, as far as I am aware, there is no stipulation for a couple to go to pre-parenting classes.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made a good point.  Sometimes when people are presented with a gift, they have no skills to manage.  We can have all the programmes we like.  Is that not the case?  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor made reference to this as well.</p></speech>

It is a very positive programme.  Certainly, we advocate that there should be a national roll-out of such programmes and that programmes should be made more widely available.</p> <p>  I referred to the national guidance on promoting mental health promotion and well-being.  Guidance has been published for primary and post-primary schools.  The Children's Mental Health Coalition very much welcomes the guidelines.  We are concerned about their implementation.  To ensure the translation of the guidelines into action, there needs to be appropriate resourcing and training of teachers.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the absence of a psychiatrist within CAMHS teams and how, at times, this can lead to new referrals not being made as a result.  Dr. D'Alton may be able to answer the question better but it seems that in the majority of teams, the psychiatrist remains the clinical lead.  We know of some CAMHS teams where that is not the case.  In those cases the lead may be a nurse or a professional from a different discipline.  Anyway, that needs to be looked at.  The question is whether the psychiatrist should be the lead and how to integrate other professionals into the role.  We have heard of cases where children who access CAMHS may need referral to a psychiatrist later.  There are concerns over referring or admitting a child when, it transpires later, the child requires psychiatric input.  That issue needs to be examined for future reference as well.</p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor raised the question of where parents need to go for support.  From the bottom up, we advocate the one-good-parent or one-good-adult model.  This is something Headstrong strongly advocates and recommends.  The ethos is that every child or adolescent should have one good parent or one good adult who he or she can talk to and for that person to listen to his or her concerns.</p> <p>  There is also an issue over having capacity built up across the mental health system.  A Vision for Change recommended the need for capacity across the continuum of mental health care from primary care level to specialist support services.  This goes back to what Professor Nugent said.  He referred to the need to capture mental health difficulties before they develop.  There is a place for mental health promotion at the earliest stages from perinatal and infant mental health right up to child and adolescent stages.  There is also the question of building capacity at each level through primary care.  If a family member, child or adolescent goes to the doctor, then the doctor has the capacity to refer the patient or intervene or provide care.  However, there must also be clear referral points into specialist services as well.</p> <p>  We need to see the development of lower level community mental health supports.  We have seen the establishment of Jigsaw programmes and the benefits they bring to a number of children and adolescents.  This is something the Children's Mental Health Coalition strongly advocates for.  We need to see development of more lower-level community mental health supports and alternative supports to specialist services.</p></speech>

Deputy Neville referred to vacant beds and a lack of inpatient beds for children and adolescents.</p><p>We know that from March 2015, there were 58 child and adolescent inpatient beds available out of a total bed complement of 66 but A Vision for Change recommended 108 inpatient beds.  This is something about which we are very concerned.  As I mentioned previously, there is a need to develop capacity along the continuum of mental health care for children and adolescents, including through primary care and lower level community supports.  However, it is also very important to recognise that there is a need for specialist inpatient services.  The recent annual report from the Ombudsman for Children highlighted this a key concern and argued that the provision of such inpatient beds is extremely important. </p><p> Senator Burke mentioned recruitment and as I pointed out to Deputy Keaveney, there are enormous difficulties in the recruitment of staff, particularly for CAMHS, despite efforts by the HSE, including international recruitment campaigns.  One of the main issues in that regard is that we cannot compete with our international competitors.  Overseas recruitment packages seem to be much more attractive and we may need to examine the remuneration packages we are offering.  Another issue is that mental health professionals do not want to take up a position within a team when they already know that the team is under-resourced and underdeveloped and that they are going to be under significant pressure and may not be able to deliver the type of service they want to deliver in order to support children and young people appropriately.  There is also an issue around training for CAMHS staff.  Such training must be adequate because of the complexity of the area.  Staff are dealing with individuals who have mental health difficulties and who are particularly vulnerable by virtue of the fact that they are under 18 years of age.  Appropriate training is extremely important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.643" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111200002#K00300"><p>I apologise but I had to go to the Chamber to speak on a particular matter.  I read Professor Nugent's submission at length last night and in all of my time as a member of this committee, I have not read a more interesting or moving presentation.  It highlighted our responsibilities as citizens but, more particularly, as parents and grandparents to children.  I was reminded of my own mother, who was my mentor in many ways.  She always said that children are like sponges and that we must be very careful about what we say in front of them because they absorb so much.  She also had a very common sense approach to many issues, similar to that of Professor Nugent, including how we look at children's lives, the environment in which they live and how they are reared.</p> <p>  I took part in a parenting course in the school attended by my children not because I felt that I was a bad parent but because I hoped it would enable me to work with other parents and learn about how they dealt with difficulties.  Being a mother for the first time can be very stressful.  A lot of issues arise, some medical and some more basic like having a baby who is very cross at night and so forth.  It was wonderful for me to be able to avail of that parenting course.  However, often parenting courses do not reach the people who really need them.  Some parents started the course I was on but only stayed for a week or two before dropping out.  In my opinion, they were the parents who needed it most.  I am not saying I was perfect but there were others who definitely needed it more than me.</p> <p>  The professor spoke about stability, which is so important.  A gynaecologist once told me that babies in the womb can hear and feel.  They can also feel anger and aggression.  Babies in the womb are not isolated from what is happening in the world but are very much part of it.  Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world or in perfect communities.  A lot of children do not live in perfect families, which is what this document is all about.  As public representatives, we must deal with that.  </p> <p>  I firmly believe that sometimes the only way to deal with people who cannot be the parents they need to be is to deal with them first.  A lot of people who have babies are not prepared for parenthood.  That can be as a result of their own family background.  When I was pregnant I knew that I could reach out to my best friend, parents, husband and extended family but some women do not have that support and that is where early childhood problems start.  We must focus on this if we want to deal with many of the issues raised by Ms Mitchell.</p> <p>  Ms Mitchell said that the figure of 870 clients, or children, was reduced to 241.  Does that figure represent children caught up in the mental health system for more than 12 months?  Ms Mitchell also referred to an inability to keep staff or to get staff to come on board.  Will she outline the reasons for this, other than emigration?  I know of a case involving a beautiful young man who has an intellectual disability.  He has Asperger's syndrome, autism and is non-verbal with violent tendencies.  His parents are at their wits' end.  They are jumping through hoops and I am jumping with them, to be honest.  Sadly, the only thing that has been offered is a long-term care placement in Monaghan but his family lives in Dublin.  His mother does not drive and would have to travel by bus to visit him.  His father is self-employed and cannot take much time off.  </p> <p>  We need to take children's mental health seriously, from the womb right through to secondary school, because if we do not do so, the consequences can be dire.  Deputy Dan Neville has been a strong advocate for suicide prevention.  If we do not address mental illness in children and adolescents, our suicide figures will not decrease but will increase.  The Government and all public representatives must ensure that the next generation of children in this country do not end up in the current mental health system.  I give the witnesses a commitment that I will do anything that I can to highlight these issues within my own party.</p></speech>

Unfortunately I was otherwise engaged.  I welcome the presentations and like Deputy Byrne, I found Professor Nugent's presentation one of the most striking and informative I have ever read.  The professor puts huge emphasis on early intervention, family support and community support during the first three years of a child's life.  He refers to the difficulties arising from isolation and the absence of support.  Could Professor Nugent outline the practical steps that can be taken in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.646" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Kevin Nugent" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111200002#K00600"><p>If it is not a bit self-promoting, one of the things I did with some of my colleagues was to develop an approach to working with new mothers and fathers in the perinatal period.  Even though I have spoken of the importance of the first three years, we have found that the first three months are critical in the formation of a family.  If we intervene at that point, we can help parents to understand their own child as an individual and to realise that their baby can be a therapeutic agent in their own recovery in, for example, the case of a single mother who is on drugs.  There is a chance for a psychological rebirth and the baby becomes the key person.</p><p>My research over the years is that one is giving the baby a voice through reading the baby's cues as a way of getting an assessment of who this baby is.<br/><br/>Prenatally, we have had many groups and I felt my contribution was actually minimal.  People want to talk to each other and to normalise the experience of pregnancy.  Isolation is very often the enemy.  In the first three months, for example, the goal is to be there with them through home visiting, such as the visiting nurse Deputy Mitchell O'Connor talked about, and being there with them over the first three months to develop the foundation during this huge family transition when, in all cultures, the boundaries are quite permeable.  People can enter and one can be part of the family story, as a nurse, professional, a home visitor or early intervention provider, by being there to support the parents at that time.  That is just one example, but it is very strength based.  There is never an attempt, even in the case of the 15 year old single mother on drugs, to label her, but to try to give her the support she needs to become a mother for this child.  As I said, often the baby becomes the catalyst for change.<br/><br/>The same applies to the high risk infant, the baby who was born prematurely and the expectation that a high risk baby brings.  How do we support parents with that?  One of the initiatives we have, and I am happy we developed it, was to have an infant focused but family centred model of care that is embedded within the community.  Again, understanding the inner life of the baby becomes the catalyst for change and then there is fostering the relationship along the way.  The basic belief is that there must be a secure relationship, whether it is the mother <i>per se</i>or any alternative care giver.  The key thing is the child must feel valued, worthy of trust and worthy of love, so that by the end of the second year of life the child has that individual sense of self and a sense of being valued as a person.  That would be our goal, to create a sense of trust and a secure attachment relationship over the first two years of life.<br/><br/>Our approach has been, and there are many ways one can do it, to begin in pregnancy but around the perinatal time of transition to becoming a parent to be available there, supporting that and having the baby as our catalyst for change.<br/><br/>I hope that was helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul D'Alton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111200002#L00200"><p>Briefly, reflecting on the conversation we had this morning, Kate mentioned the concept of one good adult.  We can summarise decades of good scientific research and say that a child will do okay if there is one good adult in their life.  It is our job as mental health experts and as citizens to ensure that each child has one good adult in their life.  This is a systemic problem and it requires a systemic response.  Professor Nugent presented the biological evidence for what we all know and for what is common sense, that it is the start of our lives that matters.  My mother says it constantly: "Sure he did not have a great start".  We know this and we have the evidence to support it.</p> <p>  It is also important to point out that we must be very careful about the message we give to parents.  I constantly say to parents that it is the 70:30 rule.  If one is getting it right 70% of the time, that is good enough.  We are not looking for perfect parenting.  The 70:30 rule is good enough.</p> <p>  The other important point, and several speakers raised this question, is the impact of austerity and disadvantage.  Professor Nugent and I have talked several times and summarised it many times by saying that equality is the best therapy and the best intervention we can provide to ensure a stable and flourishing society, beginning with the infant mental health of our youngest.  Infant mental health is everyone's business.  I have said this about palliative care.  Palliative or end-of-life care is everyone's business, and infant mental health is everyone's business.  It is not the business of a psychiatrist, psychologist or a nurse.  It is everyone's business.  If we do not get that right we will cause untold damage and suffering for generations to come.  It is everyone's business.</p> <p>  This can be actualised and implemented through a programme we developed on palliative care.  We developed a palliative care competency programme, which is a competency based programme for the training of health professionals across the board.  This sets out what health professionals need to know about palliative care.  We can do the same thing with infant mental health.  The important thing about that is that it feeds directly into undergraduate and postgraduate training.</p></speech>

After more than four decades of providing a unique and successful type of support to people with special needs, Camphill Communities of Ireland is facing the real prospect of having to cut its services for the first time.  There is even a question mark hanging over the future of the organisation's operations.  Camphill Communities of Ireland serves more than 275 people across a range of ages, most of whom are full-time residents in 17 locations.  Funding issues with the Health Service Executive, which remains unresolved despite negotiations dating back to 2004, threatens the sustainability of the Camphill model under which the organisation provides secure home environments for residents in its urban, suburban and rural locations nationwide.  If these issues are not resolved, there is a real prospect that many of the 275 people served by the organisation will have to transfer to care organisations that are considerably more expensive to the State and do not provide the unique volunteer-based, life-sharing model of Camphill.</p><p> Camphill Communities of Ireland is now very frustrated at what it sees as a stonewalling attitude in the HSE towards dealing with this ongoing and protracted situation.  At a national level meeting in December of last year, between the HSE and a delegation of a number of people from Camphill Communities of Ireland, it was stated bluntly that one community simply could not survive past 2015 without additional funding.  To date, very little has changed.  In that particular example of an urban Camphill community which supports 20 people with special needs, 16 of those who live there are full-time residents.  The recommended funding, according to the HSE's target rates and published in its own value-for-money review of disability services, is in the region of &euro;1.2 million.  The funding received is between 49% and 58% of the value-for-money figures.  The differences arise depending on whether the recommendations are assessed on an estimation of support need or on staffing levels, each relating to the residents.   There is also a variation when a calculation is made, taking into account a contribution from the disability allowance of the residents.  In the example community, when compared with the funding provided by the State in 2008 - which more or less met the needs of the operation - there has been the equivalent of between a  8% to 14% cut in funding since 2009.  Camphill is not necessarily asking for the full recommended assumed rates according to the HSE's value-for-money report.  It would likely be able to sustain the community at a funding level of between 65% to 70% of the target funding levels highlighted in that report.</p><p> The Camphill Communities of Ireland operation is a relatively small component of the matrix of service providers for approximately 8,000 people with special needs in residential services in Ireland.  Its principles also differ in that the concept is based on the principles of Rudolf Steiner and are underpinned by the acceptance of the spiritual uniqueness of each human being.   When the organisation was established in Gorey, County Wexford, in 1972, almost all of its workers were long-term vocational volunteers known as "co-workers".  My colleague, Mr. John O'Connor, is seated to my right and is a vocational volunteer co-worker.  Such co-workers lived as part of the community and provided 24-7, family-type care for residents.  Modest living expenses are shared and many co-workers have raised their own families within these Camphill communities.  They have traditionally been helped by short-term co-workers or volunteers such as students from Ireland and abroad who take the equivalent of a gap year to work with the organisation.  Small numbers of local volunteers are also involved.  In all three elements there is a large component of altruism.  The culture and diversity, not to mention friendship and companionship, that co-workers bring to the lives of people with special needs cannot and should not be underestimated.  The vocational volunteers provide a vital and fundamental role within Camphill but sadly long-term volunteers are diminishing.</p><p> With 505 people now in the total workforce, the organisation has seen a 9% increase in worker numbers in the past two years while funding has decreased significantly over the same period.  Within the total, the number of paid employees in the past six years has increased by 25% and between 2009-2013 wage costs for those employees have increased from &euro;2.4  million to &euro;4.2 million which has placed severe pressure on financial resources that are diminishing.</p><p> Virtually all of organisation's income is from the public purse.  When the operation was established, it was paid in the form of initial block grants to meet minimum estimated needs, to be topped up if necessary.  In the early-1990s the system was changed to a capitation fee basis, which is a more transparent way of funding.  Initially, new funding worked out well even though Camphill communities were typically receiving capitation fees of approximately 50% of those paid to other organisations in the same field.  The high altruistic nature and element of those who work in Camphill communities means that the wage element of community can be as low as 45% of total costs when compared with a typical 80% in more mainstream organisations.  It is accepted that the savings to the State from the activities of Camphill communities are currently in the region of &euro;5 million annually.</p><p> At present there are 274 co-workers.  The number of co-workers has remained fairly constant though the proportion of short-term volunteers in the total is rising.  This is partly because it has become more difficult to attract long-term co-workers to the Camphill lifestyle.  The situation is exacerbated by the increasing number of long-term co-workers now reaching retirement age for whom a small top-up provision to their State pension has also to be made.  On the other hand, the numbers of fully paid employees in the communities has risen steadily.  The declining number of long-term co-workers is part of the reason as employees will only work more conventional hours compared with the 24-7 input of co-workers. </p><p> Camphill welcomes the efforts to improve the quality of residential care and actively engaged with HIQA throughout the inspection and registration processes which, although challenging, has been a positive experience.  In fact, a HIQA inspector commented off the record that if he or she had a child with an intellectual disability that he or she would choose Camphill as the preferred model of service.  However, Camphill is also meeting greater financial pressures as the regulatory process for residential disability services requires a substantial amount of administrative work, as well as more stringent fire and other safety and infrastructure changes.  A significant element of its residential accommodation is now 30 years old or more, which brings extra financial burdens.  All of this has also meant that long-term co-workers are increasingly pulled into administrative tasks rather than the life-sharing ethos of the Camphill ideal.   In order to address this issue, Camphill has had to support these roles through employment which has led to increased costs.</p><p> When the HSE conducted a value for money pilot study, it invited Camphill to participate so that it could address the funding issues.  The study found very large discrepancies between the costs involved in the various agencies.  Camphill was very much at the bottom end of the list on a cost per resident basis, so much so that it was in part nearly considered an outlier in statistical terms.  The pilot has subsequently been rolled into a report on value for money and policy review for disability services.  This report came up with a programme to achieve a 5% reduction in annual funding per placement from the 2009 level.  Instead of the value-for-money review being used to address the huge discrepancies in the system, Camphill's funding was targeted to achieve the same cost savings as everyone else without the increases in funding that larger service providers had been granted in the Celtic tiger years.</p><p> Following many meetings with the HSE, at both local and national level, the delegates of Camphill say that they now feel absolutely frustrated at being ping-ponged from one level of the HSE to another with no movement on the funding issues.  Camphill has been informed that the HSE may at some point in the future develop a needs assessment tool to work out the support needs of individual residents.  Camphill supports the move as it would bring equity into what is a very skewed system at some unspecified point in the future.</p><p> Camphill says it has simply been blocked at almost every turn and, most recently, by the suggestion that a service improvement team led by the HSE, that would consist of individuals seconded from larger service providers, could inspect the way Camphill delivers its services with a view to highlighting how further cost savings could be achieved.  Some co-workers have reached the conclusion that they must simply walk away from their vocation.  If that happens, the resultant costs per resident will inevitably balloon compared with the very low cost of the Camphill model, even in a modern context of some employed supports.  These are swollen costs that the Irish taxpayer will have to pick up.  Such a scenario would be detrimental to the individual residents who consider their current Camphill placements as home.  Equally, the 17 urban, suburban and rural locations in which Camphill operates would also lose out because, in each case, residents and co-workers have integrated into their local towns and villages.  Camphill's ethos has invariably resulted in extensive mutual support in those locations and communities have adopted the residents.  Integration in a very real and progressive way that clearly belies the tokenism of some institutional models.</p><p> In the face of the current programme of avoidance, Camphill has been forced to undertake a political lobbying exercise to try and bring some pressure to bear on the situation and to break an 11-year logjam.  If lobbying does not succeed then a major shift looks inevitable.  Such a shift would mean increased costs for the taxpayer and an undeserved end to four decades of hard work, goodwill and obvious achievements by thousands of voluntary co-workers who are sharing, and have shared, their lives with people with intellectual disabilities.  Worst of all, however, is the fact that 275 people who have lived much more successfully than they or their families could ever have expected will face an unknown future and be wrenched from the love and care they have today.  Camphill seeks real engagement with the HSE to redress the appallingly low capitation fees that have persisted at Camphill over the past two decades.  In fiscal terms three of our communities are close to the edge and soon they will have to commence arrangements to transfer residents to the care of the HSE if a solution is not found in the very short term.</p><p> In addition, the rigours of the new regime imposed by the national standards for residential disability services need to be addressed in a very concrete way.  Simply ignoring the problem will not aid the safe care of people with special needs.  The HSE asked for costings for fire upgrades and other works.  The costings were supplied more than 12 months ago.</p><p>To date, HIQA has inspected all but two of Camphill's communities.  The issues identified require substantial funding to meet the requirements of the inspections.  To date, no funding has become available.  Ongoing maintenance of a huge raft of buildings is not currently included in any funding stream from the HSE.  This also does not take account of the financial cost of purchases of new vehicles.  A funding mechanism must be found to ensure safe homes and safe vehicles for the people we care for.</p></speech>

That is disappointing.  I have tremendous time for the work of Camphill Communities of Ireland and what it achieves.  From talking to people who use the service, I know it is fantastic.  I was hoping that this morning we could shine a light on the great work of Camphill Communities of Ireland.  In fact, I hope we can do that during the question-and-answer session.  However, it is why I am disappointed about the presentation.  I am annoyed at the fact that there has not been contact with the HSE.  I do not want to pre-empt the discussion, but I hope members will agree to write formally to the HSE after the meeting.  I am disappointed from the perspective of Camphill Communities of Ireland because I was hoping we would have an opportunity for the organisation to tell the world listening and watching about the great work it is doing rather than having to come here and, as it is perfectly entitled to do, give a presentation on the issue with the HSE.  It is disappointing because Camphill Communities of Ireland does great work.</p></speech>

I have had the opportunity to engage with Mr. Joe Lynch previously, including at Ballybay, and I know personally and from my own attendance on  a number of occasions at the special days that it is a fantastic facility.  I pay tribute to all who give service there and throughout the Camphill communities throughout the country.  I have met people whose commitment is a vocational one.  I hope Mr. John O'Connor will accept that I see it in those terms and the role as a vocation.  There is no other way to describe what is involved and the people I have met tick that box in the most honourable and finest understanding of that idea of vocation.  That said, I am sure the situation in Ballybay is replicated throughout all of the Camphill communities and it would be unforgivable if our health system failed to the point that any of these communities were lost.</p> <p>  In his presentation, Mr. Lynch talked about a funding issue with the HSE which has remained unresolved and now threatens the sustainability of the Camphill model.  There can be no doubt that if the situation is as bad as that sentence suggests, it is unacceptable.  It is not only in terms of the actual prospective loss of any entity within the Camphill communities network; the fact that the threat even exists is unacceptable.  I note that Camphill has been told by the HSE that it may at some point in the future develop a needs assessment tool.  I do not for a moment believe that is Mr. Lynch's language.  The HSE has a great deal to clarify.  What does it mean by "may at some point in the future"?  It is either going to do it or it is not.  It is something that would be more than useful, and I note that Camphill would support that approach.  That is one of the questions.  I want to record support for and to second if necessary the Chairman's proposal that we write directly to the HSE on the back of this engagement.  That is one of the questions that should be incorporated in the list of questions that we need to put.</p></speech>

He said that individual residents consider Camphill as home.  There can be no question about that.  Among those whom I have met, there is no doubt of that.  We are talking about the homes of people with special needs.  What that would mean in terms of the individual human beings is inconceivable.  We talk about homes and housing in the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly of late, across a whole range of different situations that have presented.  This is just another of those, and these are the homes of people under threat.  The alternative is that the HSE would have to take responsibility for the provision of the care settings for the 225 current residents, if I have the number correct.  The HSE needs to wake up to what is involved here.</p> <p>  Mr. Joe Lynch has imparted so much information in what he has said.  The questions from me are not really back to the panel; they are for the HSE at this point.  That said, there are just some points I would like to tease out.  Camphill Communities of Ireland was getting capitation fees of approximately 50% of those paid to other organisations in the same field.  Would Mr. Lynch like to expand on that?  Why has that been the case?  What explanation does Mr. Lynch think there is for why Camphill would be treated differently to other organisations providing services in the same field?</p> <p>  To date, HIQA has inspected all of the sites except two.  The issues identified required substantial funding.  That is the case as the HIQA inspections have been done and the recommendations are there in terms of care settings for older people.  This has required significant investment.  Dormitory-style provision is no longer acceptable.  At best, one might have a twin-room facility.  Most often, people should have individual space and all the ancillary services.  An effort is being made, albeit not a mighty one, to meet those recommendations in a number of other care settings.  To date, however, no funding has become available.  HIQA is not out there doing its work just to tick the box.  If there are recommendations in relation to specific works that need to be carried out to modernise and upgrade facilities, that is no less the entitlement of the residents in the Camphill Community of Ireland facility.  However, the responsibility for funding the works must rest with the Health Service Executive.</p><p>That is a very important issue, as the HSE cannot ignore recommendations from HIQA.  One of the faults in the system is that HIQA does not have the wherewithal to enforce implementation of its recommendations, and Camphill certainly cannot undertake the financial outlay for capital works.  It is just not within its gift, and it is the HSE's responsibility.  That is another point that needs to be strongly reflected in the communication that I hope we all agree needs to issue from this meeting.  I thank Mr. Lynch and his colleagues once again and I wish Camphill every success in its continued service to a very deserving cohort of citizens.</p></speech>

I know it does absolutely excellent work in the two centres in south Tipperary, in Carrick-on-Suir and Grangemockler, and I have family connections with some individuals who have availed of Camphill services over the years and found them to be very impressive.</p> <p>  I agree that we should write immediately to the HSE and the Minister, but we should go further and advise both that this issue will be on the agenda of this committee for our next meeting with the Minister and the HSE, which will be reasonably shortly.  This is an urgent issue and I am disappointed that nothing has happened.  As Mr. Lynch has said, this has been going on since 2004.  Last year, following the presentation given by the witnesses in the AV room, which I and most members here would have attended, we made representations to the Minister and the HSE.  I hoped there would have been movement on proper funding for Camphill as a result, but disappointment has been felt - both by the representatives of Camphill and by the committee members - that this has not come about.  It is difficult to understand the reason.  As Mr. Lynch has indicated, Camphill is providing services at approximately 50% the rate of other providers; it is at a discount to the State.  If the Camphill centres were to close, the additional cost falling on the HSE and therefore on the State would be significant.  That cannot be allowed to happen and I know members will do their utmost to ensure nothing like that happens and that instead there can be real engagement between the HSE, Camphill and the Department, if necessary, to ensure reasonable funding levels are made available.</p> <p>  There are key questions arising from HIQA reports, including the upgrading and maintenance of buildings, the question of new vehicles and funding for the workforce.  We have heard about the co-worker element, which is an integral part of the Camphill process.  There are probably not as many co-workers or volunteers nowadays as there have been in the past, but we cannot have a position in which the sword of Damocles is hovering over Camphill.</p> <p>  I have a general question for Mr. Lynch.  I cannot think why the Camphill communities would be treated in this fashion, but is there any indication of the thinking behind the lack of funding for and engagement with Camphill by the HSE?  I support the case made by Camphill and the Chairman for taking up the matter with the HSE and the Minister.  I hope we can do this in time for our next meeting with them.</p></speech>

I seek clarification on a few issues as I am trying to get a clear picture of the HSE's involvement.  Please do not take this the wrong way, but I need clarification.  It was indicated that the number of employees is approximately 500, but I presume not all of these work on a full-time basis.  I have done a quick calculation on the money being expended, and all of those people could not work full-time.  It was indicated that the number of staff had increased, but will the witness tell us why that happened and the reason the cost factor seems to have increased?  There is obviously an explanation for that.</p> <p>  It appears from the figures presented that costs are way under what they would be if this was a HSE-run facility, so will the witness expand a little on the differences between them, as they could be very relevant?  The witness spoke about capital costs for the facilities.  Have we any idea, if we were to upgrade the facilities, what the total cost would be?  Perhaps we could get an example of one or two facilities, as the costs for all of them are probably not to hand.  With regard to long-term planning, do the witnesses see additional increased costs occurring on a year-to-year basis from now on?  It was mentioned that costs have risen from &euro;2.4 million to &euro;4.2 million, which is a substantial increase.  Is that rate of increase likely to continue or will it level off?  The witness indicated that wage costs are only approximately 50% of the overall cost, but in a similar HSE facility wage costs would be approximately 80% of total cost, so could he expand on that as well?</p> <p>  This information would be very useful.  The HSE might tell us it is not engaging for reason A, B or C, but that does not seem logical if Camphill is providing a service at a far lower cost base than an equivalent HSE service.  Will the witness expand on that so we can have some answers when the HSE responds?  It might argue that the cost is too great, which does not seem to be the case.  I thank the delegation for the presentation and the work being done by Camphill.  All of the people involved are very committed to it, so it is important that it gets the support it requires.</p></speech>

I also have constituents who are involved with the Camphill in Hollywood, County Down.  I thank the organisation for its work, although these may seem like empty words on this side, as empty words will not pay Camphill's bills.</p> <p>  I have examined the numbers supplied from the HSE.  Taking the number of residents and dividing it into the &euro;12 million contributed by the public purse, it amounts to approximately &euro;60,000 per person, and that excludes day patients and others from consideration.  We incarcerate people in prison, and I hear it costs multiples of that money to keep people in prisons.</p><p>It goes to show where the focus is in Ireland that people with disabilities and mental health issues are always at the end of the queue.  We do our best here.  Reference was made to a pilot value for money study.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on the value for money per patient at Camphill versus other agencies.  I am aware that there are different types of disability and, therefore, different types of supports required but perhaps the witnesses would outline for the committee how the Camphill Communities of Ireland approaches service provision and the cost per patient in that regard.</p></speech>

Working backwards, we were omitted from the value for money study because we were considered an outlier.  In terms of statistics, capitation fees in respect of the provision of residential care, which is provided on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 52 weeks of the year basis, for 9.4% of our residents is between &euro;20,000 to &euro;30,000 per annum.  Capitation fees in respect of 41.9% of residents, which is the largest cohort, are between &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 per annum and a for further 16.7% fees are between &euro;41,000 to &euro;50,000 per annum.  The remainder are above that but they would have serious complex needs.  Capitation fees in respect of more than 50% of people within Camphill are less than &euro;40,000 per annum.  In terms of the eight agencies reviewed in the context of the value for money study, we would be at the bottom end of the scale compared to all of those agencies.</p></speech>

While needs assessments are carried out in respect of people at the top end of the scale who have very complex needs, such that the correct fees are applied to them, this does not happen in relation to people on the bottom of the scale.  Camphill has to hold its hands in that at the time when it was seeking capitation fees, it sought only what it needed at that time rather than what was required in relation to the top end of the scale.  Strategically that was a bad move.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-12a.683" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Lynch" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015111200002#T00700"><p>Yes.  We were hit twice.  I will try to put that in context.  Capitation fees are paid by the HSE on a monthly basis to each of the communities.  On top of that, Camphill receives a top-up payment in recognition by the HSE that Camphill was not properly funded.  The top-up fee in 2008 was &euro;2.5 million.  In 2009, it was &euro;1.9 million.  It then dropped to &euro;900,000 in 2010 and it dropped further in 2011 to &euro;525,000.  While other organisations have been hit by cuts of 2%, 3% and 1.5%, Camphill has had its top-up payment reduced from &euro;2.5 million to &euro;500,000 per annum and has also been hit by the 1.5% to 3% cuts across the board, which seriously impacts our ability to provide services going forward.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned the HIQA recommendations.  HIQA can order that an agency acquire more staff, upgrade its bannisters, fire services and so on, which must be completed within a specific timeframe.  There was a bit of fudge in this regard between last year and this year.  Obviously, people within the HSE must have had the conversation with HIQA in relation to funding for these upgrades, such that fire service upgrades were not deemed an essential part of the registration process.  While these services must upgraded, there was a willingness to allow them to be placed on the back burner because of the amount of money involved.  In regard to Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor's question in this regard, we need north of &euro;2 million in relation to fire upgrades and so on.</p> <p>  The second recommendation provides that HIQA be permitted to issue an immediate action notice such that agencies will have no choice but to do whatever it says.  An agency would generally have 24 to 72 hours to complete the necessary work.  Immediate action notices would be served in situations of potential danger to persons.  One would have no choice but to find the money to do that work or one could be deregistered or face a fine in court.  I will ask Ms Moffitt to elaborate further on fees within Camphill.</p></speech>

In the community she is in, there are 24 people.  The fee in respect of 18 of those 24 people is &euro;38,000 per annum or less.

I have run a business for years.  It is good business practice to keep reserves of two to three months.  The figure provided by the HSE relates to our reserves.  A huge amount of that money has been spent on upgrades ordered by HIQA.  The figure which the Chairman has given is no longer relevant in that it has reduced significantly because we have been paying wages out of our reserves.  We will not be able to do that for much longer.  Camphill is operating on heritage funding.  For people like my daughter, whose name is Karen, funding has not been increased.  There are people who have been in Camphill for the past 20 to 30 years.  People with intellectual disabilities often progress into dementia and Alzheimer's much earlier than mainstream people such that we have people whose needs have increased but in respect of whom funding, because they have been in the facility long-term, is very low.  Our people with the highest needs who are longest in the facility are costing a fortune in terms of delivery of care.  We are not getting anywhere near the amount of funding required in this regard.  At this point in time, we have to consider whether we can offer a safe service and a safe environment for these people.  The answer is that we are nearing the end of our capability in that regard.</p> <p>  In regard to whether the sword of Damocles is hanging over us, it is dangling by a very fragile thread.  We were able to keep the show on the road but our reserves have been depleted owing to our having to fund wages, upgrade services and meet the increased needs of our residents from those reserves.</p><p>People with Down's syndrome begin to suffer from dementia as they head into their 50s, which is 20 years earlier than other people.  Camphill has been in Ireland approximately 30 years.  We have a serious cohort of people who are heading in that direction.  It cannot go on.</p></speech>

The question on assessments is a very important one because it is one of the things at the heart of the problem.  It is also part of the solution to the problem.  I was involved in Camphill in Northern Ireland for a number of years.  We had a similar situation in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  We dealt with the situation by finding a good robust assessment framework which we rolled out in the communities.  An objective figure for individuals  was found and their needs were able to be met on foot of those figures.  We have been using the clinical indemnity scheme, CIS, assessment, which was introduced by the HSE in Kilkenny and is an effective assessment framework.  It works quite well and can be verified externally by a clinical psychologist.  It is a good mechanism for identifying the true costs of an individual's support needs.</p> <p>  There is no perfect assessment framework.  Every body or group requires a different type of assessment framework, but this one works well for us.  It is recognised nationally and can arrive at a very objective figure for support needs which can be verified.  It is an available solution and one that we have been using.  We have made some inroads in certain areas using it.  In other HSE areas, it has been more difficult to make inroads using it.  It is one thing that would be very good as part of the mechanism for addressing these problems.  The assessment is there and we are very open to working with the HSE on it.  </p> <p>  The other problem we have at the moment is that the face of social care has changed dramatically in the past seven to ten years.  We have been working with what we in Camphill call a life-sharing model.  We have vocational co-workers.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to them, as did Deputy O'Connor and Deputy Healy.  They have experienced that model through visiting the communities.  It has worked very well and has served Camphill across the world, and in Ireland since the early 1970s, very well.  However, the model is now changing for a number of reasons.  The number of long-term co-workers is decreasing.  Every year we have fewer long-term co-workers.  When a long-term co-worker is living in a community it means there is not a complete shift system in place.  There is an extended family situation in the residential setting.  This works very well as there is continuity of relationships and familiarity grows over years.  It is the closest thing to a home environment.  This is changing because of the change to the face of social care and the pressures placed on the co-worker cohort over recent years.  People are being asked to work an extraordinary amount of hours every week, which is not sustainable.  People get burnt out.  They realise it is not sustainable and that they cannot continue.  These issues are eroding the co-worker cohort, which has been at the heart of Camphill.  If we could do something in the very short term we would have some chance of addressing some of those issues, but the longer it continues the more people say this is something they cannot sign up to any longer.  </p> <p>  Co-workers who are involved in Camphill are involved because they are interested in social care, but they also recognise that there is a richness of life available to those living in a Camphill community.  It is a residential setting, but it is a home and not an institution.  Anyone who visits a Camphill community recognises quickly that it is based on healthy relationships and recognising the humanity of the people who are living there.  A culture develops and this is recognised by families.  Families appreciate the culture and individuals who come to Camphill feel recognised and appreciated.  Local HSE staff and administrators, social workers and liaison nurses notice the benefits of sending someone to Camphill.  It ticks a lot of boxes.  </p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier on that two or three of the communities are in serious jeopardy.  If something is not done in the short term, we will see serious crisis situations in these communities.  They are at crisis point already but they will be in serious crisis situations when the question of closure arises.  It would make a huge difference if we could get an assessment mechanism in place and some kind of funding mechanism established that would address short-term issues in under-funding.  Even hearing that it was in the pipeline would make a huge difference to morale in the communities.</p> <p>  We welcome HIQA's involvement in Camphill and that of other agencies, and we feel it is a positive thing.  There is an increased amount of work and increased costs associated with this involvement but the standard of accommodation in Camphill is well above average.  However, we are now required to meet nursing home standards on fire safety in what was a home environment.  This sort of thing drives up costs.  When a facility is underfunded, items such as maintenance are left on the long finger because we do not want to affect care.  Care is the primary concern.  We not want to erode the quality of care, so maintenance issues are left unattended.  This includes vehicles.  It can be sustained for a certain amount of time but after three to five years - this has been going on since 2007 - we get to the point where it becomes unsafe.  This is one of the core problems at the heart of the issue. </p></speech>

We set it ourselves and we advertise it.  We do not link ourselves to HSE pay rates or models.  For example, on average a personal care assistant will get &euro;14.21 per hour.  It is hardly a fortune.  It is quite a poor rate, but most of our people would not leave because of the money.  They like working in Camphill and with our residents and day attendees.  We have stated on the record of the Committee of Public Accounts that nobody in Camphill is on the HSE level 8 salary scale, which is &euro;64,000 a year, or above.  We have nobody on &euro;64,000 a year in Camphill.  The national governance co-ordinator role and a role such as mine in any other organisation would certainly attract higher pay.  I am quite happy to work in Camphill at the rate of pay I am receiving because I love the organisation.  It does good work and it is work worth doing.  Camphill does not have high rates of pay.</p> <p>  I have an information pack for everyone-----</p></speech>

We have a very low-cost model and we intend to keep it that way - we do not intend to run away with ourselves.  This year alone we have spent &euro;787,000 of our reserve on infrastructural and fire issues within Camphill.  The reserve the HSE mentioned as being over &euro;4 million is now certainly below &euro;2 million.  That puts us in danger with the Charities regulator because the Charities Regulatory Authority tells us we should have between three months' and six months' running costs in the bank and that would bring the figure up to &euro;6 million.  We are caught between a rock and a hard place in that respect.</p> <p>  One of the three communities will run out of cash in the next four to six weeks.  We do not have any more money and there is no more money from within Camphill to spread around to all areas. We have already had a cash injection of some &euro;30,000 from central funds but these are down to &euro;88,000 in total so there is no more money to give.  The community in question will run into the sand in the next few weeks.  We are not sitting on our hands and we have done some fundraising.  We applied, using the Camphill banner, for an overdraft facility from the Bank of Ireland and the response from the bank was that it would not approve permanent overdrafts for HSE-funded bodies so there is no money there either.  We do not have many options other than to issue protective notices to our staff and ask the HSE to come and collect the 25 people.</p></speech>

We had a meeting with the local HSE yesterday morning and it is saying pretty much what the banks are saying.  It comes back to Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's point.  At local level the HSE says exactly what a bank says, namely, that it is a business case and will have to go to the unit in Dublin.  The unit in Dublin then says it cannot give us the money.

If there is a trust with a resident in it and the trust wants to provide money to buy, for example, a vehicle we are now advised that, because other people in the facility get the benefit of that vehicle, Camphill cannot accept the funding.  This has arrived on my desk recently and I have raised it with the Minister in the Seanad in connection with the Bill which is being considered there.  We need clarification on this point because many organisations such as Camphill have a problem with residents whose parents have died and left funding for them in a trust but where the money is left sitting in that trust.

If they donate to buy a vehicle for Camphill Communities Ireland that is not an issue but if they donate a vehicle for Colm Burke in Camphill Communities, and only Colm Burke can use it, that is ring-fenced.  One can, however, make donations and we have received donations from families and friends who have given &euro;50 or &euro;100 to Camphill for any purpose, including paying wages,.

It invited over a group from America to organise training for a number of senior agency people.  They rolled out that training - it is known as "supports intensity scale assessment".  It can be linked to value for money and is a very comprehensive assessment framework.  We have used it in a number of communities as it gives a very accurate picture of the support scales people need and is an effective way of coming to a figure which can be verified externally if people need it to be, by means of inviting a clinical psychologist to come in and look over the figures.  We have done that in a number of situations and the clinical psychologist has often rated the costs higher than the supports intensity scale.  It is accurate but we have used it in a way that brings in a realistic fee for people while covering all their support needs.  We have recently developed an internal comprehensive assessment tool and we are rolling it out in a number of communities.  There are numerous assessment possibilities which could be adopted.</p></speech>

There was an engagement in August, at which Ms Moffitt was present, on the development of a strategic plan but we have not engaged with the HSE on looking through the model as it has not yet come back to us.</p></speech>

I managed to catch bits of the presentation.  I have read the statement and one thing jumped off the page, namely, the life-sharing ethos.  I know that means a lot to Camphill and it means a lot to us too.</p><p>Many groups have taken on the challenges in regard to people with intellectual disabilities, long before the health services have done so.  Groups like Camphill Communities of Ireland have been working in every little town here.</p><p>Sadly, as the report presented here states, volunteerism is diminishing.  While it is not diminishing in every area, the problem is significant in high dependency areas like Camphill's, where people face challenging issues.  Also, because of all the rules and regulations that have been introduced for those working with people, volunteers do not find it as easy to volunteer as they did in the past.  This probably adds to the decrease in the numbers of volunteers.</p><p> I wish to thank Camphill Communities of Ireland.  I have visited a number of groups around the country that like, Camphill communities, have a spiritual ethos about them also.  This ethos is very much part of how we look at our lives and at individuals who have learning difficulties or mental illness.  I thank Camphill communities for what they do in that regard.  The Chairman spoke about funding and I will discuss that with him after this meeting.  Again, I apologise for coming late to this meeting, but I was otherwise delayed. </p></speech>

The life-sharing model is diminishing a little, but we have quite a lot of short-term volunteers.  We do not have a problem getting short-term volunteers, who come from all over the world to assist and befriend people here with special needs.  They are fantastic and we could not do our work without them.</p></speech>

To be honest, we have a fantastic working relationship with most of these people, but the situation was very difficult because, unfortunately, she was looking across the table at me telling me she does not have any more money for us and would have to kick the can up the road to the business unit in Dublin.  We have been hearing that same response for many years and the business unit in Dublin seems to be very deaf to anything to do with Camphill and funding arrangements.</p></speech>

This puts them in a precarious and vulnerable position as they cannot access a service.  Is the HSE, at the higher level, aware of the implications of not engaging or of the likelihood that Camphill will not be able to provide a service?</p></speech>

I can only assume she has done that.  At our end, we will do that today, but we wanted to meet with this committee first.</p></speech>
