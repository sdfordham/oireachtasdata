It would be helpful at the outset of this debate on the Finance Bill, which enacts the budget, if the Minister could briefly comment on the current economic backdrop.  There seems to be a lot of uncertainty at the moment.  There is the most recent report from his Department and the ESRI on the impact of Brexit, whether it be a hard or soft Brexit; the public sector pay issue, which is evolving very quickly; the election overnight of Donald Trump in the United States; the issue of the public finances generally; and the unusual warning by the Department of Finance which accompanied the October Exchequer returns that the November-December figures will need to be quite strong.  It seems to me there is a lot of uncertainty at the moment.  Before we embark on enacting this Bill to give effect to the budget, I ask that the Minister give us his sense of the current position of the Irish economy.  It is completely at the discretion of the Chairman but it would be very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#B01500"><p>I echo that call.  It is important that we frame the discussion we will have this week and next week on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in the economic context we are in.  As Deputy McGrath said, we are all aware of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the Exchequer figures, but last night's victory for the Trump campaign has created further uncertainty, which the Minister himself referred to previously when speaking of the uncertainty of that campaign.  One of the commitments the President-elect has made is to cut corporation tax from 35% to 15% and try to relocate American companies back to his own shore.  I have been on the record of the D&aacute;il on many occasions talking about the potential volatility of our corporation tax receipts and the fact that 40% of those receipts are paid by ten companies.  It would not take a huge amount of movement to create a very unstable tax scenario for this country.  While we will not be able to pre-empt what will happen either in Congress or the Senate at any time in the future, we must be conscious of the fact that a major political pledge has been made, and that pledge has now become more real as a result of the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States of America.  Therefore, it is important that we have that brief discussion that frames and sets out what we are looking into as we discuss the issues in the Finance Bill, whether we should cut taxes or increase them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#B01600"><p>I concur with the two Deputies.  It would be very helpful if we had such a debate or conversation, formal or informal, whichever way the Chairman wants to go with it.  We are in a new dynamic.  Deputy Doherty is correct about the pledge, but I remind him that George W. Bush made the same pledge during his campaign and did not fulfil it in an eight-year period.  The economic cycle is having an enormous impact upon the political cycle.  It is the first time anybody has been elected to the presidency of the United States who has not served before in government, executive office or the military.  It would be a very good open opportunity for all of us to kick these matters about because there is a volatility.  It comes not just from what happened in the United States last night, but also from Brexit, Northern Ireland considering reducing its corporation tax rate to the same level as ours and the UK saying it would do likewise, although it then pulled back.  We do not know what other jurisdictions' options are, but they have options, and our options will have to be flexible as well.  We should take the opportunity to discuss these matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#B01700"><p>First, I will give some context about the overall cost of the measures we propose in the Finance Bill.  They net out at about &euro;350 million out of a budget of just north of &euro;58 billion.  Therefore, what we are discussing here is very marginal in quantum terms, even though it is significant in policy terms.  We should keep that in mind.  The expenditure side of the budget has a more significant impact, and in terms of public service pay and so on the impact is more on the expenditure side than on anything we are doing here today.</p> <p>  Secondly, regarding the Exchequer figures running towards the last two months of the year, the point I was making when I designed that comment on the October figures was that there was not a big pool of money to be spent on anything because even though the forecasts were running at around &euro;600 million, the revenue flow was around &euro;600 million ahead of forecast.  The point being made was that there was not a big pool of money to be spent because all this expenditure was pre-committed.  The committee will recall that last June there was a commitment to spend about &euro;500 million extra on health; to spend about &euro;40 million extra on justice; to spend extra money to repair flood damage, particularly on roads, and to put in flood defences and so on; and to restore the summer schools programme, which is the repair programme carried out in schools during the school holidays.  All of that amounted to around &euro;750 million.  Then there was a commitment to restore the Christmas bonus as well.  The point being made was that the Exchequer would need to exceed forecast again in the last two months of the year to ensure that there was sufficient money to cover what was committed beyond the figures in last year's budget.  However, my expectation is that there will be sufficient money to do that without increasing the deficit.  The point being made was that this was not net additional money available for further expenditure but that it had already been pre-committed.</p> <p>  On Brexit, members are all following the debate.  They see what is happening in the United Kingdom and they see that the court case decision has added another complication to the triggering of Article 50 by the British authorities.  However, in so far as there is new information here, the committee will recall that in generating the figures on which we based the 2017 budget, we took 0.5% off forecasted growth rates, and consequential buoyancy of taxation was reduced accordingly.  This is accounted for in the figures, and we stand over that.  That is the way it looks as if it will run out for 2017.  The additional information arises from work done by the ESRI and the Department of Finance.  They have taken three scenarios of the effect on the Irish economy if, first, an arrangement analogous to what Norway got with the European Union was the end result for the UK.  The second scenario is what would happen if an arrangement analogous to Switzerland's were more or less the conclusion of the negotiations with the UK.</p><p>The final scenario is what would happen in the event of no resolution and no negotiated settlement, with the UK having to revert to World Trade Organization rules as a most favoured nation.  In those three scenarios, different percentages of a reduction in growth and employment in the Irish economy are promulgated.</p><p> First of all, this would be ten years after the exit of the UK, so we are looking maybe 12 or 13 years down the line.  Second, the base is that these would be the reductions from the position if Britain had retained membership.  For the next five years, we expect to grow at approximately 3.5%, which is the sustainable rate of growth in the Irish economy.  If one assumes we will grow by north of 3% for the next 12 years, which in present circumstances is a reasonable enough forecasting assumption - although it is very hard to know what will happen as one goes further out on the timeline - it would be 36%.  If that is compounded, it goes into the 40% range.  In the worst-case scenario, we are talking about a reduction of 3.75% off some figure in the early 40s when one thinks of it as against the baseline.  Other figures for the other positions are then built in as well.  There are also figures for employment reductions and I assume unemployment increases are also built in.</p><p> The other assumption, apart from the baseline, is that Irish authorities would do nothing in response to whatever arrangement would occur between the UK and the European Union.  Again, that is a theoretical assumption as an Irish Government or Governments over 12 years, for better or worse, will take action.  We assume the actions taken will be beneficial, reducing the damaging effect.  For example, if we introduced export guarantees for our vulnerable exporting industries, which is common enough across the OECD, it would mitigate damage that would occur.  That is not built into the model.</p><p> The third issue raised by Deputy Michael McGrath is the position in the United States.  The Taoiseach will be making a statement later in the day and I will leave it to him.  It is very early to make any conclusions about what a new Administration in the United States might do.  There is a change in the presidency but there is such a change every four or eight years in the United States.  The composition of other elements of the US political system also change.  I understand that going into the election the Republicans had control of the House of Representatives and the Senate.  They have approximately two thirds of the governorships.  Apart from the presidency, if one considers the pattern of governance across the United States, the Republicans are the party of government at state and local level.  I do not know what will happen any more than the Deputies.  I have followed the debate like any professional politician would in a country as powerful and as friendly with Ireland as the United States but I cannot estimate the fallout.  There are changes in the presidency but the other elements appear to be where they were before the election.</p><p> The Taoiseach will make a statement later in the day and our relationships with the United States have been very strong.  I have no doubt they will continue to be very strong but with regard to being precise about possible economic impacts, I cannot help Deputies any further than in what I have said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#C00200"><p>There are projections underpinning this budget related to economic growth, specifically 3.5% in gross domestic product and 3.3% in gross national product next year, as well as all the other fiscal projections.  Does the Department and Minister still stand over those projections for 2017?  Could we have that confirmation before we embark on this process?  Will the Minister address the issue of public sector pay?  It falls within the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but the Minister has overall responsibility for the public finances, achieving our targets and so on.  There is &euro;290 million factored in for 2017 for additional expenditure on the Lansdowne Road agreement but there is nothing else there.  Given how quickly there have been developments on the public sector pay front, what are the ramifications for the public finances for budgetary policy in respect of 2017?  The Lansdowne Road agreement, notionally, is meant to be there until September 2018 and it is important the backdrop be dealt with upfront.  This is a train that is coming at us very quickly and it shows no sign of stopping.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#C00300"><p>On the prospects and outlook for the economy, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said of the deal struck on Garda pay - I assume it would apply to any additional costs arising from other negotiations - that the cost of approximately &euro;40 million would have to come from existing resources.  It would be helpful if the Minister would indicate if this means an axe will be taken to the capital programme to the tune of approximately &euro;40 million.  In a developmental model of the Irish economy over the next ten to 15 years, one critical area that suffered significantly during the collapse, kind of like a feeble patient slowly recovering, is capital expenditure.</p> <p>  I heard the American ambassador on RTE this morning stating the obvious.  While our corporate tax rate is attractive, President-elect Trump has certainly indicated on various platforms that he will introduce a reform of American corporate taxes, bringing them down to approximately 15%.  As the ambassador stated on radio this morning, American companies do not just come here for the tax rate.  They come for the standards and levels of education of people, their employability and the fact that we speak English.  There is also the significant issue of us being part of the European Union.  However, the Minister knows from discussions - as I know from my constituency experience and discussions as a Minister with many companies - that the constant complaint is around public infrastructure, particularly in areas like transport and broadband.  All of us from Ireland know we have major infrastructural challenges such as those on the education front, as has been mentioned, at third level as well as primary and secondary level.  There are also challenges in health.</p> <p>  The Minister's colleague indicated the &euro;40 million for the Garda settlement would be found from resources.  Does the Minister have a sense at this point what those resources will be?  Will it come from the Department of Justice and Equality or different Departments?  On many occasions I gave very significant amounts from the Department of Social Protection budget to the Department of Health.  Will this be the same kind of approach?</p><p>I saw the Minister for Social Protection saying he would not give an inch.  Will the Minister tell us where that money will come from, as well as any further moneys that may arise?  I note that &euro;290 million, a significant amount of money, has been set aside for the Lansdowne Road process.</p><p> My second question relates to changes in the European Union in 2017.  I was happy to see the Minister for Finance for once being very critical, at the most recent ECOFIN meeting, of the failure to reform the fiscal rules in Europe.  They were made a long time ago by the Germans and, as we are all aware, they are quite Germanic.  They have not been revised significantly since then.  In the context of this discussion, will the Minister say if he has made any progress with his fellow Ministers for Finance in getting the fiscal rules reviewed?  If we are facing into a period of deep uncertainty, it would make sense to amend the fiscal rules in a way that takes account of small open economies such as Ireland's.  We are not yet able to benefit from the Juncker plan.  We do not have very large companies based in Ireland to take up the Juncker plan in the way the Italians, French and Germans can, and indeed the English if they stayed in the European Union.</p><p> In the context of the budget catering for both capital and current expenditure, I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us the actual plans and where the extra &euro;40 million, for a start, will be found.</p></speech>

I welcome the acknowledgement from the Labour Party, as we have heard from other parties, that it was wrong in its approach to the fiscal rules and that it should not have supported putting legally binding rules into our Constitution which are strangling our potential.  The penny has finally dropped, but that is for another day.</p></speech>

We pointed this out in the first place.  We cannot spend capital because of the fiscal rules which the Deputy argued and campaigned for and which the people voted for.  That is democracy.</p> <p>  My question follows on from the valid question Deputy Burton raised.  I previously asked the Minister about the fact the budget does not provide for the continued suspension or abolition of water charges after the first quarter of 2017.  The Minister's answer was that the &euro;53 million that would be required is not a huge amount of money in the context of the overall budget.  That sum of &euro;53 million will have to be found as, without pre-empting the decision of the House, that is likely to be its decision.  Now we are told there is another &euro;40 million on top of that.  That is close to &euro;100 million.  As the Minister with responsibility to ensure we are complying with the fiscal rules, regardless of whether we like them, is it the Minister's view that this money will come from the expenditure side as opposed to looking at other sources of revenue which could accommodate the increased demands that have been agreed by the Cabinet for Garda pay and to provide for the abolition of water charges, in the event that the D&aacute;il decides to abolish them after 31 March 2017?  That question must be answered.  Obviously, if some of that should be absorbed on the taxation side, we must have an understanding on that.  If the Minister and his Cabinet colleague have another source for that money, we also have to know that.  The debate we are taking part in today must be genuine and we must know that the figures will add up in the end.</p> <p>  That brings me to my second point, although I am eager to get to the meat of the amendments.  I have sent an e-mail to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and copied it to you, Chairman, and the clerk to the committee.  I am not happy with the rulings that have been made on the amendments.  They are made under your signature, Chairman, under advisement.  I can see that there is a basis for some of the rulings, but other rulings that amendments are out of order make no sense.  I am asking the committee to seek proper advice on this, even if that requires us consulting the Office of Parliamentary Legal Adviser, OPLA, to give legal advice as to why some amendments tabled by Deputies are ruled out of order.  I have seen amendments from Deputies Burton and Donnelly that have been ruled out of order and I have seen other amendments that have been allowed and there is no logic to why this has happened.  It is frustrating Committee Stage.</p> <p>  One example is my amendment No. 105, which seeks to delete five lines relating to funds that would be exempt from paying capital gains tax, CGT.  We are told that we cannot introduce that amendment or delete those lines because it would be a burden on the Exchequer.  This law or measure does not exist at this point in time.  It is not as if we are changing an existing measure.  This is an idea that is being put forward to the committee, so there is no change to existing law as a result of the amendment.  Another amendment tabled by Deputy Michael McGrath would extend the fishers tax credit indefinitely.  Some could argue that this would have a potential cost to the Exchequer.  The ruling is that it does not, yet Deputy Burton's amendment, which would restrict a timeframe relating to another scheme, has been ruled out of order.  There is no logic to the rulings that have been made.  It is crucial that the committee gets the opinion from those who made these decisions.  With regard to amendment No. 105, in particular, I am requesting that the OPLA provide legal advice to Deputies as to whether that amendment should have been ruled out of order.</p></speech>

Most of the amendments I have tabled have been ruled out of order on the grounds Deputy Doherty mentioned.  The amendments oppose proposed changes to the tax law so, by definition, they cannot impose a charge on the State.  They are unambiguously in order.  This ruling has been applied to most of my amendments.  Some of my amendments that have been ruled out of order will not be reached by the committee for several hours.  Is there a way to revert to the Ceann Comhairle's office or to whoever is the deciding officer?  The ruling out of order of very legitimate amendments is unambiguously incorrect.  The salient point Deputy Doherty made is that the reason given for my amendments being ruled out of order is that my amendments would incur additional taxation on people or businesses.  However, the amendments are opposing proposed changes, so they are not proposing any change to the law.  They are opposing changes to the law.  Therefore, by definition, they cannot impose a charge.  Is there any way we can seek to have some of these decisions reviewed in light of the fact that they are clearly wrong?</p></speech>

The economic forecasts announced on budget day are also the economic forecasts that underpin the Finance Bill.  We are proposing no change at present and we envisage no change.  On the public service pay situation, the view of the Government is that the Lansdowne Road agreement provisions are still the agreement we have with the public services.  We knew at the time of the budget that there were outstanding matters relating to pay in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the pay of Garda inspectors and sergeants.  We also knew that one teachers' union, the ASTI, was in potential dispute at that time, even though settlements had been made with the TUI and INTO.</p><p>It is also true to say, as I did in Brussels on Monday, that the Labour Court's ruling in respect of Garda pay was more generous than the Government had anticipated.  The possible extra charge there needs to be quantified in addition to any moneys that are envisaged as going to garda&iacute; from the &euro;290 million provision for pay increases that is included in the budget.  According to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the total estimated cost of the proposed Garda settlement is &euro;40 million.  In the context of a budget of &euro;58 billion, this is within the normal swings and roundabouts of a budget.  As Deputies will be aware, when we announce the monthly expenditure figures, tax returns and Exchequer returns, there are variations from what was forecast each month.  Those variations are sometimes positive and sometimes negative.  We do not envisage making any changes to the budget forecasts.  I believe everyone in the House is familiar with those forecasts at this stage.  We are still of the view that the deficit for this year will end up at 0.9% of GDP and the deficit for next year will be 0.4% of GDP.  In addition, the debt ratios, etc., remain the same.  Unexpected events that have not been allowed for occur in any budgetary cycle.  They have to be allowed for as the year goes by.  So far, the amounts of money in question are not huge in the context of a &euro;58 billion budget.<br/><br/>Deputy Burton asked about capital.  Given that she acted as T&aacute;naiste when the budget for 2016 was designed, she will be familiar with the amounts for capital expenditure that are included right up to the end of this calendar year.  Of course we would like to have additional capital expenditure for economic and social infrastructure.  We are working towards this.  The former T&aacute;naiste will be aware that we took issue with EUROSTAT's <i>post facto</i>interpretation of rules, particularly in respect of public private partnerships.  Matters we thought would be off the balance sheet were put on the balance sheet.  A helpful circular that came out from EUROSTAT in September has changed the position and, at least, will give us forecasting certainty in respect of what is on and off the balance sheet for the purposes of public private partnerships.  In addition, the smoothing arrangement that applies to capital expenditure, as distinct from current expenditure, provides that just 25% of the fiscal space is reckonable in the first year.  This smooths out over a four-year cycle, thereby providing an opportunity to have extra capital expenditure as well.  This year, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's fiscal space was approximately &euro;660 million, but because of the smoothing effect of capital, the Minister's total current and capital expenditure increased to approximately &euro;860 million.  That is an example of the smoothing effect.<br/><br/>Now that we are out of the corrective arm of the fiscal rules and we are below the 3% rule, some flexibility is allowable in capital expenditure for reasons of structural change or strategic investment.  We are not yet in a position to avail of that because of the intricacy of the rules, but we have the potential to avail of it as we go forward.  As a general principle, the bigger countries seem to get more flexibility under the fiscal rules than the smaller countries.  This is something I am not silent on.  Sometimes it is more effective to protest quietly and privately and sometimes it is more effective to protest publicly as I have done.  When Deputy Burton referred to what I said recently, I assume she was talking about my comments at the Tatra conference in Bratislava when I was invited to talk about the fiscal rules.  I expressed my views on this issue pretty strongly on the record.  If one examines the assessments of the budgets in France and Italy, as distinct from the assessments of budgets in smaller countries, one will find that the rules are applied with greater flexibility in the larger jurisdictions.  I think that has to change if we want our people to comply with the fiscal rules.  If we are to support Governments in complying with fiscal rules, it stands to reason that those rules must be fairly applied.<br/><br/>As a general principle, I agree with Deputy Burton that the economy is now at a point where additional capital expenditure is desirable and is needed to provide the necessary economic and social infrastructure.  I believe this could be done without overheating the economy.  I am sure the Government will evaluate that position in the course of next year with a view to enhancing capital expenditure in a variety of ways as we plan for the 2018 budget.<br/><br/>I think I have dealt with the points made by Deputy Doherty.  I do not rule anything out of order.  I do not have a role in making determinations on questions like what is in order and what is out of order, or what is acceptable as an amendment.  Under the guidance of the Chairman, an amendment that is ruled out of order cannot be discussed.  However, the points that Deputies would have made on that amendment, if it had been in order, can be made during the discussion on the relevant section.  When we are discussing sections, I have no problem discussing proposals that would have been set out in amendments if they had not been ruled out of order.</p></speech>

This amendment is pretty clear.  We are calling for a study to &quot;be carried out on introducing a millionaire&rsquo;s tax on net assets exceeding &euro;1 million&quot;.  We estimate, on the basis of the wealth figures from the Central Bank distributed according to the Central Statistics Office's household finance and consumption survey, that a millionaire's tax rate of 2% could raise &euro;2.92 billion.  In this amendment, we are calling for a study to be carried out so that we can see the figures involved and make choices about the kind of tax regime we should have.</p></speech>

When I raise this issue every year, I am told that the data are not available and that it is hoped they will be available the following year or at some future point.  It is important to recognise that the Department of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute have worked on the CSO data and are apparently going to make a presentation in this regard at a tax policy conference later this month.  Will that actually be the case?  Will the work of the Department and the ESRI on the location of wealth in the State be presented to the tax policy conference?  The model I am proposing differs from that proposed by Deputy Murphy.  We have rehearsed these issues in the House previously.  Legislation has been drafted and an explanatory guide has been produced to show what a net wealth asset tax might possibly look like.  The model we are advocating is based on the French model, which excludes the likes of businesses and family farms, etc.  There are other exemptions as well.</p> <p>  I have proposed amendment No. 65 because we need a report so we can start looking at whether this is possible.  Some data have been collected and are to be presented.  Work has been done by the Department and the ESRI.  We need to look at the options now, regardless of whether we decide to execute them at a later stage.  We need to examine whether it is possible to introduce a net wealth tax of the type that is in place in other countries.  This type of taxation has been proposed by Members of this House, certain trade unions and other think tanks.</p><p>It is being proposed by certain trade unions and other think tanks.  Each proposal is very different and contains different types of exemptions and rates, and it is not right to group them together.  There is a need, at a departmental level, to examine options and the possibilities, whether it is possible, in the Department's view, and what it would look like, if it were to take place.  We talk about the new reform that is yet to take place, given that the budgetary committee has not had the chance to get its teeth into the process.  If it is to be serious and genuine, these are the issues we need to explore.  We need to have debates based on clear facts, not based on my assumption interpreting CSO data as to what I think could possibly accrue.  Our debates must be based on the economists in the Department of Finance working with the data that exists and publishing it so it can be tested robustly by others in the sector.  Then, we can make a call on whether it is possible and whether the data can be collected.</p><p> My amendment refers to six months to examine a report and the options available for the introduction of a comprehensive asset tax, otherwise known as a wealth tax.  I have sought that the report should include options for the collation of data necessary for the assessment of such a tax, the definitions of categories of wealth to be included in such a tax, proposals for the assessment and collection of the tax proposed, and estimates of potential revenue at various taxation rates.  This is not alien to us.  Ireland used to have a wealth tax.  We got rid of it.  It was costing us nearly as much to collect the tax as we were bringing in.  This was before we had online systems and the Internet, when everything was done by pen and paper.  It was possible and definitely desirable that we follow this direction.  All we are asking is that the Department's resources be deployed to follow on from the work it has done with the ESRI, which follows on from the work the CSO has done regarding identifying the location or concentration of wealth in Irish society.</p></speech>

Wealth can be taxed in a variety of ways, some of which are already in place.  Capital gains tax, CGT, and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, are, in effect, taxes on wealth, given that they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset in the case of CGT or the acquisition of an asset through a gift of inheritance in the case of CAT.  Deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, along with similar taxes on the income from financial investments, is charged at 41% with some limited exemptions.  It is intended to reduce DIRT to 33% over a four year period in the Finance Bill.  There is a stamp duty levy on the transfer of shares which yielded &euro;424 million in 2015.  The local property tax, LPT, which was introduced in 2013 is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.  I note in this context the report by the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, published on 4 November 2016, which stated:</p><blockquote>An annual property tax is a tax on capital/wealth and as such contributes to social equity.  The new Irish property tax has generous thresholds but is also a very stable tax.  It is hard to avoid and so is a sound source of revenue for the State.  Taxes on property in Ireland are about the average in OECD34, but are below average for English speaking countries.</blockquote> <p>The domicile levy introduced in 2010 also constitutes a form of wealth tax.  It is aimed at high wealth individuals with a substantial connection to Ireland, whether or not they are tax resident, to ensure they make a tax contribution to the country in a year of at least &euro;200,000.  In 2014, 12 individuals paid the levy, yielding &euro;1,986,858.</p><p>Comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland includes assets and liabilities.  It was published for the first time in 2015 by the CSO.  The data was collected across the eurozone according to a standardised methodology and indicate that wealth inequality in Ireland for 2013, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is lower than the eurozone average.  The results also show wealth is less concentrated at the top of the distribution here than the European average.  Central Bank analysis of the data also indicates that while wealth inequality has increased since 2011, it is lower than in 2006, the earliest period for which data are available.  Data gathered by the CSO as part of the Household Finance and Consumption Network, HFCN, were not calculated for the purpose of calculating the potential yield from a wealth tax but to collect general information on the financial situation and behaviour of households.  As part of the joint research programme agreed by my Department and the ESRI covering macroeconomic and taxation issues, a research project involving detailed analysis of household wealth distribution and taxation has been undertaken.  This project, based on the household finance and consumption survey published by the CSO, is nearing completion and the results are to be presented at the annual tax policy conference hosted by my Department.  This is the point the Deputy raised in particular and the commitment in my speaking note is that it will be done at the tax policy conference.</p><p>This year's conference is being held in Dublin Castle on 23 November.  I expect all interested parties would attend the conference and engage in the debate.  My Department will monitor and consider any additional information and data that comes to light and will continue to examine potential taxation sources on an ongoing basis.  There is no doubt in my mind that there will be significant difficulties in determining the base, the types of assets to be included, the potential yield and, most important, broad acceptance for such a tax from the wider public.  As the Deputies will appreciate, while it is easy to propose the introduction of new taxes, it is often more difficult to achieve wider acceptance for the introduction and operation of such taxes.  Given that research on wealth tax is being carried out by my Department and the ESRI, I do not consider it is necessary or appropriate to have another parallel stream of work, as suggested by Deputies in terms of the preparation of an additional report.  I am not disposed to accept the amendment, and Deputies will understand that the commitment given previously will be fulfilled and the report along the lines being sought will be presented at the tax conference at Dublin Castle two weeks from now.</p></speech>

I presume the Minister has seen the report, which is being worked on by his Department and the ESRI.  We are asking for a net wealth tax.  Every year, we have this discussion on local property tax, CGT and CAT.  The Minister is reducing the latter two.  The local property tax is not a net wealth tax.  Let us not rehash the whole debate.  If I had a mortgage of &euro;200,000 and my house was worth &euro;100,000, I would still have to pay the property tax.  It is the opposite of a net wealth tax.  People are paying tax on a debt that they have.  It is not an asset but a liability.  The question is whether the report will be on a net wealth tax.  We have proposed a very particular type of net wealth tax that could be introduced.</p><p>The Minister mentioned TASC.  We could be here until tonight selectively quoting TASC and what it has said about a property tax.  Tom McDonnell, the author of a TASC-NERI, Nevin Economic Research Institute, working paper in 2013, proposed a model of wealth tax.  The TASC website states:</p><blockquote>The proposed model of wealth tax would only affect those with over &euro;1 million in assets (the top one or two per cent of the population) and would have ceiling provisions to protect people with low incomes.  Based on cautious estimates such a tax could raise hundreds of millions annually and would have less damaging impact on society and the economy than many other budget adjustments being considered.</blockquote><p>While the Minister can quote TASC on property tax, this is about a net wealth tax.  Can the Minister give an indication to the committee how comprehensive the paper will be?  Will it address the possibility or the options available for the introduction of a comprehensive asset tax or a net wealth tax such as I have proposed?  I have written legislation but cannot table it in the House because of the constitutional prohibition on Opposition Members bringing forward proposals that could incur a cost on the Exchequer or a cost on the population.  The legislation is there and can be viewed by anybody.  There is also the proposal that has been put forward by Tom McDonnell and TASC in the working paper. <font color="#FF22FF"></font>Is the paper on a net wealth tax or a wealth tax, as the Minister would define it, that is, CGT or CAT?<font color="#FF22FF"></font>I do not dispute that they are forms of wealth tax but they are not the type of wealth tax it is proposed to introduce.</p></speech>

I do not favour a wealth tax.  There are, as I outlined in my initial reply, various taxes that apply to wealth already in the Irish tax code and I am not proposing to change those either.  The paper, which will be presented in Dublin Castle on 23 November, is a joint paper between the ESRI and the Department of Finance.  It will aim to provide an analysis of the wealth holdings of Irish households and the potential impact a wealth tax would have if applied on the existing structure and household composition.  The objective is not to propose any particular tax model or design but rather to inform the debate on the taxation of household wealth.  The joint ESRI-Department of Finance paper will use the comprehensive survey data collected by the CSO in 2013 as part of its household finance and consumption survey.  This survey provides, for the first time, comprehensive data on household ownership of assets and liabilities.  Assets include such items as property, self-employed business values and financial assets.  Liabilities include mortgages and short-term debt.  The survey also provides more general information on income, employment and household composition.  That is the nature of it and it will be available in a couple of weeks' time.  It is there as a source for the formation of any particular policy by any Deputy or any group.</p></speech>

I believe it is a mistake by Government.  I acknowledge the reductions in the universal social charge are very small and that people, particularly low and middle-income earners, are feeling the pinch and have been for many years as a result of both this Government's policies and the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government's policies.  There are better ways to relieve the burden on them by getting rid of some socially unjust taxes such as property tax, the household charge tax and water charges, which would give the same benefit, more or less, to all income earners.  The Minister notes that the proposal before us will have a partial-year effect of about &euro;335 million net in tax.  The full year effect is &euro;380 million.  We need to have this debate in the context of the Government's policy of abolishing the USC at a point in time and that it follows on from the reduction of USC last year.  The policy, which has been more or less supported by the majority of parties in here, including parties on the left, is the wrong policy.  I am saying this very clearly.  I sat on the banking inquiry and one of the clear things in terms of the banking inquiry was that we had a banking crash that was the result of reckless lending and practices.  As a result of other actions, however, which we will not go into here because they have been well rehearsed, there was also a financial crash and the State's revenues were of a very precarious nature.  During the Charlie McCreevy period, income taxes were reduced but the overall level of taxation did not reduce.  One can see in a very clear graph that while direct income taxes were reduced, they were replaced with indirect taxes or property taxes and stamp duty taxes.  I made the point earlier that at the height of the boom, stamp duty was equivalent to the amount of corporation tax we have brought in.  We have seen a bonanza in terms of the amount of corporation tax this State has seen in the last number of years; it has increased by over 50% in a very short period of time.  We have had a huge increase in corporation tax.  Every single additional cent paid in corporation tax is welcome and we need to grab it with both hands but it would be folly to think it is a very stable form of taxation because it is not.  When there is such a dramatic increase, there can also be a reversal.  It is not just that there can be a reversal, there is also a potential volatility because of the concentration of that tax.  To rehearse the statistics, 40% of corporation tax in 2015 was paid by ten companies.  That is the equivalent of something like &euro;3 billion.  Ten CEOs could decide to strip away 40% of our corporation tax base in the morning.  Please God, that does not happen.  Please God, foreign direct investment continues to stay here and that companies continue to invest here, create jobs here and pay their taxes that are due here.  We have to be very conscious that we have concentrated a large part of our revenue income in a small number of companies that are obviously very profitable and therefore pay a large amount of tax.  Regardless of what political pledges there were in the past, the potential for change at an international level, particularly at American level, is now greater than ever before because of Donald Trump's commitment.  The reality is that for the first time ever, the Republican Party holds the presidency - which was able to block proposals in the past - in addition to a majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, which leads to the likelihood of them being able to effect this type of change.  It is change that has to happen in the House of Representatives and Senate but with the support of the President, there is greater potential of this type of change taking place.  Not only that, we have other issues in terms of trade agreements on which the President-elect was very vociferous.  There is the potential for this little country of ours being caught in the perfect storm.  To our right, we have Britain, which is exiting the European Union, with massive uncertainty about what will happen there.</p><p>Britain is one of our largest trading partners and we are unsure whether tariffs will be imposed, whether there will be a hard Brexit and what is the impact for Border communities.  To our left, across the Atlantic, we will have a Republican President who has made very clear commitments.  A central part of his election campaign is to bring American companies that are located here back to his own country and to do that through a very lucrative tax incentive package.</p><p> Some of those things are outside our control.  We could sit here with our hands on our faces and lament how these things have happened, but they are outside our control.  The one thing we must do is to be conscious that this perfect storm could be emerging.  In two years time, when Britain exits the European Union and tax changes have potentially taken place in the US, we could be caught in that perfect storm.  Therefore, we need to make sure we do not erode our tax base in the way the Minister is proposing.  What he is proposing in this year's Finance Bill is stripping away &euro;390 million of income tax and USC, but he has made the commitment that he will continue to do that year after year.  Let us be clear about this.  If we leave USC as it is, by 2021 it will bring in &euro;5.6 billion every year.  When we look at an election cycle of five years, we are talking about &euro;27 billion or &euro;28 billion over that period.  This is money we may need to inject into capital expenditure to try to get our country back up, if we are caught in this perfect storm, or to spend on tax measures in order to give incentives to people who are exporting or to entrepreneurs who want to create jobs, given we may lose jobs in this country due to issues which are outside our control.  On that basis, I believe section 2 should be opposed.</p><p> While I am sure the Minister will say how small this is, and all the rest, the point is that if he keeps on chipping away at the wall, the wall disappears in the end.  That is what is happening.  The Minister is taking away the most stable form of taxation and one of the fairest forms of taxation, which actually applies tax on the basis of income.  We have argued in the past that when the USC was introduced, it replaced two existing taxes, the health levy and the income levy.  When it was introduced, it brought in &euro;400 million of net additional taxes because we got rid of two other taxes at the time.  The complete unfairness of the USC at that time, when it replaced those two taxes, was that it was introduced under the Fianna F&aacute;il Government at a level where it kicked in when a person earned just over &euro;4,000.  That is where the unfairness lay.</p><p> I acknowledge the fact that this Government, very much as a result of the pressure we have continued to put on it, moved significantly to bring those workers, who are the lowest income earners in the State, out of the USC tax net, and in each Finance Bill we have seen a gradual increase in that threshold from &euro;4,000 to the current threshold of &euro;13,000.  We argued it should go up to the minimum wage and that it would only involve a small amount of money to bring individuals on the minimum wage out of the USC tax net.</p><p> This is the wrong decision; it is the wrong policy.  There are variants of that policy being argued by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party.  Their two policies argue that we should get rid of over &euro;2 billion of taxes every year.  We cannot afford that.  The risk is far too great.  I ask the Minister to pull back from this and not to continue with the stated intention, which he mentioned on budget day and a number of times before that, to continue to get rid of USC.  That would leave our country exposed to external elements outside our control, not least the fact that we potentially have very volatile corporation tax receipts in the coming years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.62" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#H00200"><p>To give the Fianna F&aacute;il perspective on this issue, I disagree with Deputy Doherty's assessment.  It is important to point out the cost in 2017 of the USC reductions is &euro;335 million and is more in a full year, but the cost to taxpayers of not indexing the income tax system in 2017 is &euro;385 million.  If we were to do nothing whatsoever in respect of income tax reductions in this budget, then working people paying income tax would collectively be paying an additional &euro;385 million in 2017.  At a time when we have an economic recovery of some form, I do not believe that is an acceptable situation.</p> <p>  This measure is very modest.  It is not even bringing this to a position where we are standing still overall because some people are enjoying salary increases and so forth, and more and more of people's income will creep into the higher rate band.  If their salary goes above &euro;33,800, for example, then more money is being captured through the non-indexation of the system.  This is a very modest measure.  It brings the marginal rate of tax on income up to &euro;70,000 down to 49%.</p> <p>  I put on the record on budget day that we disagree with the Government's overall strategy on USC.  We do not believe it is right or sustainable to seek to abolish the USC over the lifetime of this Government and our view on that is copper-fastened by more recent events and the economic uncertainty we spoke about earlier.  I believe it will be unavoidable over the coming years to address the entry point issue to the higher rate of income tax, which is exceptionally low in Ireland compared to other OECD countries.  However, it is important to put this reduction in context.  The real context is that, before the crisis, the amount of the overall tax take accounted for by income tax was under 30%; it is now over 40%.  Therefore, we have seen an enormous increase in the burden of income tax put on the shoulders of taxpayers.  The fact that there is a policy decision not to index tax bands and tax credits means the Government would be collecting almost &euro;400 million more anyway next year.  This goes a long way to offsetting that but it does not even fully do that.  If the Government was not to do this, there would in real terms be a very significant increase in income tax for workers in 2017.  That is not a position we believe could be defended.  The overall gain is capped at some &euro;350 for an individual.  It is quite modest and, in our view, it should be supported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#H00300"><p>I also disagree with Deputy Doherty.  I want to put on record that the USC was also reduced in last year's budget.  The objective was that the significant burden of income tax would be reduced so people would have more spending power, and that proved to be correct.  The USC rates were reduced, people spent more and we got more people back into work.  To put this in context, at the peak of the recession the income tax take was over &euro;13 billion whereas the expectation is for income tax in 2017 to be over &euro;20 billion.  That is the level of increase in income tax for taxpayers.</p> <p>  Four of us who are present sat through the banking inquiry, which was long and tortuous.  There is some merit in what Deputy Doherty said about not eroding the tax base but there comes a time when people have to be given the opportunity not to be paying all of the tax.  As Deputy McGrath said, the amount here is modest at &euro;300 million plus - it is not billions.  I am one of those who does not want to see the tax base eroded.  Nobody wants to go back to the insanity of what happened from 2008 to 2011.  However, at some stage, the people who are paying income tax have to be given the opportunity of a break.  This is a small, modest break.  Deputy McGrath noted that people hit the higher rate at &euro;33,800.  That is one of the lowest points at which a higher rate applies in the OECD.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#H00400"><p>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Certainly, high marginal tax rates have an effect on employment.  If one taxes something, one tends to get less of it, and if one reduces taxes on something, one tends to get more of it.</p><p>We tax tobacco products because we want people to smoke less.  We tax alcohol because we want people to be more moderate in their use of alcohol.  If one puts penal taxes on employment, I cannot see why there would be any other economic effect than one gets less of it.  Once the marginal tax rate goes over 50%, it begins to affect employment levels, it begins to affect the propensity of emigrants to return home to Ireland etc.  We have recited all these arguments previously.</p><p> I do not seen much difference between bringing down income tax rates and removing USC.  This is the third year that we have made some reductions in USC.  I started there because USC was brought in as an emergency tax to top up the take from personal taxes during the crisis and, because it was the "last in" as an emergency tax, it should be the "first out" in terms of reductions.</p><p> Of course, the Deputies are quite correct.  This is a very small reduction because we did not have many resources on this occasion.  The resources we had available on budget day were used by and large to improve public services by increasing the budgets and the allocations for the public services with which the Deputies are all familiar.</p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath is correct that the cost of these measures are &euro;379 million in the first year and &euro;462 million in a full year.  Non-indexation accounts for &euro;345 million on the first year and &euro;400 million on a full-year basis.  There is a match between the two on this occasion.</p><p> It is the third year of reductions and we would hope that there will be further reductions in future years.  In addition, I have always said that the Government's plan to continue to phase out USC will be dependent on having the necessary fiscal resources.  We have them this year and I hope we will have them next year.</p><p> Deputy D'Arcy is correct.  Income tax and USC are expected to raise over &euro;20 billion in 2017, that is, following the impact of these changes, from the position of &euro;13 million in the year that he referenced.  It is quite a big tax take.</p><p> On the issue of the over-dependence on corporation tax, once we introduced the changes in our corporation tax regime in the Finance Bills in 2013 and 2014, there has been a step change.  The Revenue is of a different view now.  Last year, the advice from Revenue was that a portion of the corporation tax take was once off and possibly transitory.  It is of the view now that it is a new base and that we will continue to enjoy this flow of corporation tax in future years.</p><p> The base is broadening and some of the additional tax is from smaller companies paying corporation tax because their trading position has been quite good in recent years and profits have been quite good.  Of course, the international changes in corporation taxes have enhanced the tax take in Ireland.  We have to be cautious of any particular tax.  We have to react if there are any signs of fragility in any particular major tax but so far there is not such a sign of fragility.</p><p> On the impact of whatever changes might be made in the United States, we will have to wait and see.  I have spent all my life listening to United States election campaigns where there was a commitment always to reform corporation tax and I have yet to see tangible measures.  It has been so dating back as long as I have been in politics, and I was first elected to a local authority in 1974.  It goes back a bit.</p><p> If one looks at the commitment President-elect Trump has made to reduce corporation tax to 15% from the 35% on average that is now applied in the United States and how that might impact on the multinational sector, the repatriation of profits is the primary issue with foreign direct investment in Ireland or elsewhere in the world or elsewhere in Europe or in the UK.  At present, the disincentive is that in setting up overseas, if one repatriates profits one pays 35%.  If one reduces that to 15%, it seems that is not a disincentive for setting up abroad.  As a matter of fact, it could work the other way because one would pay much less tax if one repatriates profits from Ireland in the future.  We will see.  I do not know what the particular mix is.  US corporate tax, like a lot of corporate tax codes, is quite complex and when one looks at the various legitimate reductions that can be made, it becomes even more complex.  Then they have special zones as well where different tax regimes apply.</p><p> We will have to wait and see.  The Revenue will constantly evaluate these matters.  So far, there seems to be no great anxiety among foreign direct investors here from the United States and IDA Ireland states the pipeline is extremely strong at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#J00200"><p>The Minister mentioned that high marginal tax rates have an affect on employment yet there is no data to suggest that is the case.  Indeed, the ESRI, which, I am sure the Minister will acknowledge, is a reputable body and does not have a political axe to grind, has stated before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that this notion should be tested and made a follow-up point that sufficient investment in child care would have a bigger affect on employment than reducing marginal tax rates.  This is what frustrates me.  The Minister can make statements as if they are true to suit the narrative that he wants to peddle at any point in time but he must test that and tell me, if he does not mind, why the ESRI is wrong in its view that this notion needs to be tested.  The ESRI is not saying the Minister is correct in this regard.  This is, in my view, a narrative that has been created by Government, and, indeed, by some parties in opposition, to suit their agenda of reducing the tax base in terms of direct income tax.</p> <p>  When the Minister talks about reducing the USC, we know the effect of that.  We know who benefits most from such chipping away, whether it is the Minister's policy, Fianna F&aacute;il's policy or the Labour Party's policy.  The way to do this, obviously, is to give a bit now and a bit there.  One does not see the quantum of it but after a couple of years it is no longer &euro;400 million but a couple of billion euro that the Minister has stripped away from the tax base.  We can see from the Department of Finance's paper presented to the Minister that it will narrow the tax base, that it will be regressive, that it will have limited benefits and that those who will benefit the most are those with the highest incomes.</p> <p>  The Minister also makes comments repeatedly.  The Minister will not address the fact that he has made different comments to suit other narratives in the past.  He states that this is an emergency tax.  He tells us again today that it is an emergency tax.  Then why did the Minister mislead the House on previous occasions when he stated that this was never introduced as an emergency tax?  The Minister is on the record of the House as saying that.  The Minister said that at a time when he believed that the USC should not be reduced.  The Minister has completely flip-flopped and now he says that this is an emergency tax, but he will not deal with the facts of this here, which is that this measure which, as I said, brings in &euro;4 billion now and which will bring in &euro;5.6 billion each year by 2021, replaced two other taxes.</p> <p>  The rationale behind the introduction of this tax at the time by the late Brian Lenihan was twofold.  First, it was to capture those on very low incomes.  He genuinely believed in the principle that regardless of one's income one should pay some amount of tax despite the fact, we would argue, that they do pay some amount of tax through indirect taxation in VAT etc.  However, that was the late Brian Lenihan's notion at that time and that is why he introduced it at a level of &euro;4,004.</p> <p>  The second part of the rationale behind the introduction of the USC, which led to the progressivity of the USC, is that it captured all incomes.</p><p>There was no way of sheltering income from the USC.  That is why the wealthiest in society like the idea of getting rid of the USC because it was a vehicle where they actually got taxed on their income regardless of where it was and they had no ability to write that income down through different tax expenditures.  That is where the USC was very progressive and why we should hold onto a part of it.</p><p> The Minister creates a narrative to suit his own agenda.  He told the Seanad and it is on the record that this was never introduced as emergency tax.  Can he tell me now, if we are to take his word today that it is an emergency tax, why he misled the Seanad at that point in time?  Can he tell me why his view of the ESRI statement made to the budgetary committee is that high marginal taxes have an impact on employment?  The arguments he is putting forward today could have been played in an episode of "Reeling in the Years".  They are the exact same arguments that Charlie McCreevy put forward - they are taken completely from his script.  At that time, I am sure the Minister for Finance believed that was the right thing to do.  Unfortunately, history has told us, and our recent past has told us, that it was the wrong thing to do.  With the benefit of hindsight, we know it was wrong.</p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il rightly points out that taxation levels at a certain point were 30% of overall tax and are now 40%.  It wants to hark back to the time of McCreevy and forget that the time of McCreevy bust the bloody country.  We had a major fiscal deficit outside of the banking deficit and outside the fact that billions of euro from the National Pensions Reserve Fund were pumped in to rescue banks.  There was a major hole in our public finances because of the unsustainability of our tax base.</p><p> Regardless of what Donald Trump, the US Congress or the US Senate do in the future, and whether they do anything with corporation tax, we need to be conscious of something, namely, at this time, 40% of our corporation tax is paid by ten companies.  In 2009 21% was paid by ten companies but by 2015 this had become 40%.  We have seen a dramatic increase in concentration in corporation tax receipts.  For any Minister for Finance, that should be a warning shot across the bow.  Please God they do not leave, and please God some other country does not decide to engage in a race to the bottom and draw these companies out of our country.  However, we need to be conscious there is a risk.  The point I am making is that those ten companies make up the same amount of tax revenue as stamp duty did at the height of the boom.  If this goes belly up, we will be asked time and again by people in the media and elsewhere why we did not see the warning signals.  We saw this with the financial crash in the past, where we had a concentration of tax receipts from what was potentially an unsustainable source.  We have the same thing at this time.  When 7% of the overall tax base is located in ten companies, that is a warning shot.</p><p> The presentation that is being provided by Government and Fianna F&aacute;il is that this is minor.  It is minor in terms of the benefit that people will receive, which will mean a couple of euro extra in their pocket.  However, in terms of the overall figures, the Minister referred to over &euro;440 million per year that will be stripped out of the tax base.  Yet, we will hear week after week, month after month, over the next year that we do not have enough money to pay for additional consultants or nurses to deal with the fact we have  more than 400 people on hospital trolleys.  The Minister will tell us he does not have the extra few euro to pay our teachers for the supervision of our children in secondary level schools-----</p></speech>

This would be somehow justifiable if we did not have a crisis in health, a crisis in housing and a crisis in homelessness, and if we did not have workers out on strike and balloting for industrial action because the Government will not pay them for work they are doing.  This is despite the vulnerability in the concentration of corporation tax, despite the fact Brexit has thrown up serious challenges and despite the fact that what the American Administration may do could erode a substantial part of our tax base.</p></speech>

The Minister has presented as facts what are not facts.  He has changed his argument to suit a political narrative and to suit some type of person in the Fine Gael headquarters who decided, "This is a good idea.  Let us print up some election posters saying 'Abolish the USC', and the country is somehow going to be fine despite getting rid of &euro;5.6 billion from our tax base every year".  It is not.  It is wrong.  The Minister is wrong and he should withdraw from this.  Please God the vulnerabilities I have talked about do not materialise but it is our job to make sure we manage the public finances in a prudent way.  We need to be conscious of the risks that are there.</p> <p>  The last point I will mention-----</p></speech>

The hypocrisy of the position of Sinn F&eacute;in is amazing.  I will read from an article on the Sinn F&eacute;in website.  The headline reads, "Sinn F&eacute;in publish D&aacute;il motion calling for the abolition of Universal Social Charge".  I know that positions change depending on circumstances, but this is purely populism and nothing else.  At that stage, it looked like that was the thing for Sinn F&eacute;in to do.  Now, it is water charges and, next week, it will be something else.  It is all for Sinn F&eacute;in to continue its populism.  I will read out another point from the article, "The Universal Social Charge breaches the fundamental principle of progressive taxation - that those who have more should pay more".  Our income tax system is based upon a progressive system.  I will read out another point, "Sinn F&eacute;in is calling on the Government to abolish the Universal Social Charge and to ensure that all taxes and social insurance contributions are raised progressively so that those who have the most pay the most".  Again, all of the OECD analysis of the Irish taxation system shows that that is already the case.</p> <p>  I ask Deputy Doherty not to be as blatantly political.  There are 130 or 140 proposed amendments to this Bill.  We will be here for six or eight weeks if we keep going like this.  We have dealt with one amendment in three hours.  There is work to be done and I want to get on with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#AA00300"><p>I would have appreciated if Deputy D'Arcy had addressed the motion in full.  If he wanted to give full information for accuracy, and I have made this point in the D&aacute;il Chamber, what it actually called for was the abolition of the USC and the reinstatement of the health levy and the income levy.  The point I made earlier is that when the previous Government of Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the USC, it kicked in at a level of &euro;4,004.  That is the reason behind the statement that Deputy D'Arcy read out in terms of the USC's lack of progressivity, because what it replaced were taxes that did not kick in at that lower level.  That is why we opposed it and wanted to reintroduce the existing measures.  That is just a point of accuracy.  That being said, it is interesting that when we argue that &euro;462 million worth of tax should be imposed or maintained on the populace, we are accused of being populist.  Usually, a person is accused of being populist when he or she is trying to cut taxes or do something that is very popular.  We know that abolishing the USC was a popular issue with many people.  However, in the debate that took place, people realised that it was not affordable.</p> <p>  The last point I was going to make before the suspension was about the suggestion that has been put forward that abolishing this measure in the Finance Bill is better than the non-indexation of tax bands, and that if we did not do anything in the Finance Bill, people would be worse off.  That is not true.  Again, let us be accurate.  We would have to introduce a measure in the Finance Bill to index taxation bands.  If we did nothing in the Finance Bill, then we would have &euro;462 million of revenue in a full year which we as a State could decide whether to inject into vital public services.  It is not a case of either-or.  Again, this is a presentation of statistics or comments being suggested that they are facts, and they are not.  Deputy D'Arcy said that we have spent a lot of time on this.  That time has not been spent on this section as a whole.  Let me be clear.  This section costs the Irish State &euro;462 million every single year from here on in.  How many minutes have we spent on it?  About 20 or 30 minutes.  If the Deputy does not want to spend ample time discussing nearly half a billion euro of tax cuts in a full year every year, I would suggest that he is in the wrong job.  That is what happened in previous Governments when we cut taxes to an unsustainable level without due regard to the consequences that would flow from it.</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke about the facts earlier this morning.  The fact is that for the past three years, the USC was cut and the people had the opportunity to spend the money as they got it back.  That brought in more money.  The Sinn F&eacute;in position is tax, tax, tax, and spend, spend, spend.  It ignores the impact that has on the economy.  The Deputy talks about money and numbers.  He is able to ignore the wealth taxes that are there that the Minister spoke about earlier, and will ignore the fact that the property tax is a wealth tax and that capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, bring in nearly &euro;1 billion.</p><p>The Deputy wants to ignore that those are wealth taxes.  It is as if we will forget that amount of almost &euro;1 billion.  The Sinn F&eacute;in position on taxing wealth is it should only apply to the "wealthy", the evil people over there with properties worth more than &euro;1 million etc.  It wants to bring in a wealth tax but ignore the facts.  Sinn F&eacute;in's policy equates to cloud cuckoo land economics.  It is nuts.</p></speech>

We can keep going over and back, if Deputies wish, or we can try to get through our business.  The point I make about non-indexation is correct.  If the universal social charge, USC, reduction was not in the Finance Bill and we did not provide for the indexation of the system, the Exchequer would have more than &euro;400 million extra by way of revenue and it could make whatever decision it wished on that but it would effectively represent a tax increase on people's income.  That is the point I was making.  There is no policy decision to index the tax system.  It would be an increase by stealth.  It is the broad point I am making.  The reduction in USC in overall terms negates the non-indexation of the system.  One could argue there would be winners and losers and there would be the question of who is benefiting from indexation and the USC reduction.  That is in the round and one more or less cancels out the other.  Otherwise it is a hefty tax increase that will give the Government and the Oireachtas more scope for choices, which I accept, but the fundamental point holds true.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#BB00400"><p>I am not sure I can shed much light on the discussion but I might add a little heat.  I was asked if there was economic evidence to support the theory that high marginal tax rates have an adverse effect on growth and employment.  The large body of economic literature documents the evidence on the responses of different groups to the tax schedule and, in particular, the marginal tax rate.  The main point that emerges from the literature and which is summarised very comprehensively in the Mirrlees review of 2011 is that taxes reduce labour supply.  With regard to particular groups, the response to the tax rate is largest for women with school-age children and older workers.  High marginal tax rates may also discourage low earners from taking up employment.  There is documentary evidence in the literature assessing the impact of different levels of tax on the labour market.</p><p>Deputy Doherty asked if it is semantically correct to call the USC an emergency tax.  It was certainly a tax introduced in response to an emergency, so it is legitimate to call it an emergency tax in that respect.  Additionally, it replaced the income levy, which was certainly introduced as an emergency tax.  It was introduced in response to an emergency and replaced an emergency tax, so I am within my rights to describe it as an emergency tax when I discuss it on occasions such as this.</p><p>Everybody is entitled to change his or her mind and there has been a major change of mind from Deputy Doherty.  As Deputy D'Arcy referenced, there was a Private Members' motion on 29 March and 30 March 2011, approximately three weeks after a new Government had taken office in the second week of March 2011, and in the usual way it proposed:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:recognises that:<blockquote>the universal social charge is an unjust and regressive tax, bearing down most heavily on those least able to afford it;</blockquote></blockquote> <p>The motion recites all the evils perceived by Sinn F&eacute;in of the universal social charge and, in the usual format, it calls on the Government to &quot;abolish the universal social charge&quot; and, as the Deputy rightly states, to reinstate the health and income levies in place of the charge.  In 2011, the Deputy and his colleagues regarded the universal social charge as unjust and regressive, calling on the Government to abolish it.  The party wanted to do it in one fell swoop and overnight, which was fairly ambitious at the time.  Not only did the Deputy sign the motion himself but it is signed by Deputies Gerry Adams, Michael Colreavy, Se&aacute;n Crowe, Dessie Ellis, Martin Ferris, Sandra McLellan, Mary Lou McDonald, P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, Jonathan O'Brien, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, Brian Stanley and Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  The Deputy is entitled to change his mind and they say consistency is the hobgoblin of the small-minded.  All I want is for the Deputy to admit he has changed his mind and that when the Government has now progressively decided to reduce the universal social charge with a view to eventually abolishing it, we are not 100 miles away from the position he adopted in 2011 and which his party has now moved away from.</p><p>While we are on the discussion about inconsistency, I remember in those days the Deputy was a very strong advocate of wealth taxes but it was dropped from the second last draft budget introduced by his party.  Now he is back to talking about it again but it was not in the draft budget.  Will the Deputy clarify if he is for or against a wealth tax?  Is he for it on some days of the week and against it on other days of the week?  There is an inconsistency about the party's tax position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#BB00500"><p>I will respond to that without looking to lengthen the debate, as I want to get into it.  This is a very substantial issue and it is very clear from the Government's replies that it is coming under some pressure to justify why it is getting rid of &euro;462 million of our tax base, given the crises we have in this area.  I stand over the motion we put before the D&aacute;il.  To suggest the motion we put before the D&aacute;il is in any way similar to what the Government plans to do with the USC stretches credulity to the limits.  As the Minister rightly stated, we proposed to reinstate the income and health levies, bringing in &euro;3.6 billion.  The USC took in an additional &euro;400 million because it was levied on individuals with incomes as low as &euro;4,004.  I acknowledged earlier, as we raised the issue and the Government decided it was unjust, that the threshold has been moved to &euro;13,000.  It was done at an expense to the Exchequer that ran into hundreds of millions of euro.  That is why the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal at that point was unjust.  That is why we wanted to revert to the system that was there.</p> <p>  We have now seen progress in moving it to that level and that was Sinn F&eacute;in's intention in the first place.  One of the next amendments I have is to move the threshold further so that everybody earning below the minimum wage would be taken out of the USC tax net.  Crucially, over &euro;5 billion of income from the USC would be retained by 2021.  The Government's proposal is to get rid of the vast amount of that income and not replace it with anything else.  That is the position and Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent in that regard.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the "semantics" of it being emergency tax because it was introduced at a time of emergency.  I will quote the Minister directly.  He stated "I should point out that it was never intended that the USC would be a temporary measure".  That is a reference to a "temporary" rather than "emergency" measure.  The point I made earlier is that the narrative of the Government has changed to suggesting somehow that the USC was always supposed to be a temporary measure or it was introduced in an emergency; it was just to get us out of the difficulty we were in, it is suggested.  The USC and its level of tax base was required to fix the problems arising from reducing taxation, which happened during the McCreevy era and left us with an unsustainable base.</p> <p>  We are discussing a large quantum of money at &euro;462 million in a fell swoop and the Government plans to repeat this next year and for two subsequent years.  This is all about options and I appreciate what Deputy D'Arcy has said in that it will put some money in people's pockets that could go into the cash registers of businesses in the community.  I believe there are better and fairer ways to put money in people's pockets.  The Minister mentioned the high marginal tax rates and the impact being felt most acutely by mothers of school-going age.</p><p>The point made by the ESRI was that we need to challenge the idea that marginal tax rates are a barrier to employment.  The view is that proper substantial investment in child care would have a greater impact in terms of employment.</p><p> Now, the Government is moving in terms of child care and that is to be welcomed.  However, the Government is not spending &euro;462 million on child care.  We need to ask ourselves certain questions as legislators.  If our desire is to create more employment, then which would have a greater effect, a &euro;462 million child care package to help people to get back to work and reduce the cost of living or &euro;462 million as part of a process of eradicating tax breaks?  I believe it is wrong.</p><p> I call on the Minister to directly answer the point I made earlier.  The Minister said: "I should point out that it was never intended that the USC would be a temporary measure."  Does the Minister stand over those comments made in the Houses?</p></speech>

I will quote from the income tax reform plan from the Department of Finance.  It states:</p><blockquote>Up to Budget 2008, Government policy with regard to income tax was to increase tax credits and bands to the point where 40% of income earners were exempt from income tax, and only 20% of earners were liable to the higher rate of income tax. This progressive narrowing of the income tax base in the years leading up to the crash, followed by falls in income and rising unemployment as a result of the financial crisis, resulted in over 45% of income earners being exempt from income tax in 2010 and just over 13% being liable to the higher rate of income tax.<br /><br />A range of measures have been taken since 2009 to correct this narrowing of the income tax base, including reductions in tax credits and bands, the restriction or abolition of many reliefs, and the introduction of the broad-based Universal Social Charge. A list of these base broadening measures is attached in Appendix 1.</blockquote> <p>That is in the document from July 2016, a document with which the Deputy is familiar.  That sets the discussion in context.  I am willing to stay here all day arguing the point, but I believe it would be more productive if we moved on at this stage.  The matter is reasonably well aired on both sides.</p></speech>

His position is well known.  I know the Minister's response but I believe it is worth mentioning.</p> <p>  I take the Minister's point that people believed the USC was coming in as an emergency measure or to replace a number of taxes as an emergency measure.  However, it is probably fair to say that was mis-sold as an emergency measure.  The Minister has stated as much, and we all know, that it was brought in because other taxes collapsed, in particular, stamp duty, which will not be coming back.  It was brought in to replace other tax revenues.</p> <p>  The USC may well have been described as an emergency measure, but it was not.  The purpose was to replace an unsustainable tax, that is to say, stamp duty.  This is relevant because we are talking about an amount of approximately &euro;400 million but in fact this is part of a policy of abolition which will take approximately &euro;4 billion from the tax base.</p> <p>  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight spent a good deal of time on this.  We got testimony from a variety of sources, including the ESRI.  The points that emerged are relevant to the USC.  I will set out the context of the conversation.  Public spending pressures are going to increase with demographics.  We have a rapidly growing population.  We have an ageing population.  Therefore, public funding for public services will increase quickly.  There was broad agreement, cross-party agreement, that additional money would be required for infrastructure.  The point made to the committee, specifically in response to questions on whether abolishing the USC was a sensible thing to do, was that taxes are going to have to go up to maintain public services, based on demographics.  Furthermore, taxes would also need to go up to deal with the infrastructure deficit.  Therefore, abolishing a multi-billion euro tax was not sensible because, inevitably, it or some other tax would have to be reintroduced.  I am keen to put these points to the Minister.</p> <p>  My next point is a political point.  Obviously, the Minister has a different view.  Anyway, for what it is worth, I am one of several Deputies who, during the last election, campaigned on retention, that is to say, the non-erosion of the tax base.  Many Deputies in the corridors told me I was out of my mind to go into a general election campaign with a manifesto of retaining the USC.  For what it is worth, I spoke to many people in Wicklow and throughout the country during the election.  The majority said they were okay with retaining the USC.  They realised we did not have enough teachers in our schools, that we needed more investment in infrastructure and that we needed investment in health care and so forth.  They were willing to accept the retention of the USC, but they wanted to see better use of public moneys.  Obviously, the Minister is free to disagree with that.  My experience during the last election was that the vast majority of people to whom I spoke were okay with retaining it and did not have an issue with the fact that it may have been sold to them as an emergency tax.</p> <p>  I am keen to challenge the idea that the marginal rate of tax is stopping employment.  For people working in Ireland, that is not true.  For it to be true, we would have to believe that there are people sitting on social welfare who could be earning &euro;50,000 if they chose to do so.  I am using that amount because a taxpayer has to be earning over the marginal rate at some decent amount in order for the marginal rate to matter.  For the assertion to be true, we would have to believe there is a large cohort of people in Ireland who are choosing not to work.  Moreover, for the idea to hold these people would have to be watching the marginal tax rate and reasoning that if it drops from 50% to 48%, or whatever the rate is, then they would go back to work.  I do not think that stacks up.  I do not think such people exist.</p> <p>  The second explanation was that there are people abroad who have emigrated from Ireland and who want to come back, but who are not coming back because of the high marginal tax rate.  A serious example would include clinicians, nurses and doctors.</p><p>Ireland is, <i>per capita</i>, the highest exporter and the highest importer of doctors in the world and clearly something is going wrong.  If one talks to Irish doctors working in the US, Australia or the UK, they do not mention the marginal tax rate, they refer to working conditions.  It is the same with nurses and teachers - they talk about working conditions.  Similarly, in my experience of living abroad and of working with many people who work all over the world, never once did I hear anybody in a discussion on moving to Ireland, America, Sweden, the Cayman Islands or wherever say that any part of his or her consideration was driven by whatever was the marginal tax rate in the given country.<br/><br/>Deputy Pearse Doherty has asked for data and I have asked for it too.  I have heard it asserted on many occasions and I have heard the Minister mention the Laffer curve as the theoretical underpinning of it.  However, does the Minister have any data to back it up?  In my experience, it simply is not the case that if we move the marginal tax rate from 50% to even 45%, Irish lawyers, doctors, nurses, teachers or whoever would suddenly return to this country.  That is the final point I wish to make.</p></speech>

While the gross figures might be attractive, the bottom line, when one allows for the tax take in Ireland, is an influence and sometimes they cannot afford to come home.  This is true for young Irish people in London and in the United States.  The decision point, according to IDA Ireland, is usually when the first child is about to reach primary school age.  That is when Irish emigrants abroad begin to decide about coming home, and it is a factor.  It is also a factor - we hear this quite frequently - in comparisons being made between those who work in Northern Ireland and those who work in the Republic.</p> <p>  To take Deputy Donnelly's argument to its logical conclusion, one would have to agree that tax rates do not matter and that regardless of the level of tax rate, it does not have an affect on decision-making in respect of whether to come back to Ireland or whether to go to work in the first instance.  Deputy Donnelly is correct on the generality of cases that if one is unemployed and a job comes up, taking the job is the first consideration and one might not like the tax rate that one would have to pay but one needs the job and one takes it.  However, where it hits on the labour market domestically is the second income in the house.  If the spouse or partner has an offer of a second job, then the marginal rate of tax becomes an issue because, effectively, the assessment is whether it is worth the spouse or partner's while going back and whether is it worthwhile going back for the resulting net increase in family income when one takes all the other expenses of returning to work into account.  That is an issue.</p> <p>  The first question the Deputy asked related to whether I would agree that extra taxes have to be paid because of demographics and the fact that additional services are needed.  Extra taxes have to be collected but that does not mean that tax rates have to increase.  For example, between the estimated outturn for this year's budget in 2016, which is &euro;48.135 billion, and the estimated tax take for 2017, which is &euro;50.62 billion, there is a difference of &euro;2.5 billion.  Apart from an increase of 50 cent in the price of cigarettes, the rest of it is due to the buoyancy from a growing economy, extra people at work and extra spending power.  My argument is that as the tax take from the growing economy increases, as it will by &euro;2.5 billion year on year between 2016 and 2017 - as well as acknowledging the fact that extra services are required for demographic reasons but also as a result of the damage that was done to the services during the eight years of recession - taxpayers have to be looked after as well.  At a minimum, to take Deputy Michael McGrath's point, taxpayers have to be compensated for inflation so that the purchasing power of their incomes is maintained.  That would be the minimum position.  Ultimately, it is principally the 2 million people at work who drive the economy and one just cannot keep piling taxes on them.</p> <p>  I do not disagree with the Deputy's general proposition that there was a mood at election time which put great emphasis on improving services -I refer, for example, to better educational and health services, etc. - but the electorate is not homogeneous either.  There was a cohort of people who wanted lower marginal tax rates as well.  There is not a straight cross-match between the policies the parties put forward and the results they got in elections.  If there were, there might have been a different result.  My party got the biggest vote in the election and the largest number of seats and we were identified more with the USC reductions than with the improvement in services.  However, we took the message that was delivered by the electorate.  In the negotiations for Government, we agreed that the available resources - the &euro;2.5 billion or so that is available year on year - would favour expenditure rather than tax reductions in proportions of at least 2:1.  That is what is written into the confidence-and-supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il and into the programme for Government.  If one measures this budget, it is actually approximately three to one rather than two to one.  For the management of the economy and the labour force and for the incentivisation of people - and keeping the 2 million individuals at work reasonably happy - it is important that we move on the tax side as well.  I am not saying what should be the exact figure.  That is all I am saying.</p> <p>  The bottom line is that the worker getting his or her weekly wage on a Thursday or Friday evening and looking at the piece of paper that accompanies it, does not really make a lot of distinction between whether the deduction relates to USC or income tax.  It is personal taxation and it is a deduction from the gross to bring about the net amount.  I would maintain that while, from a tax collection point of view, USC is very efficient, from a taxpayer's point of view it is a less fair tax than income tax because it is flat-rated in its percentages.  In terms of making some modifications to reduce the impact of personal taxation, we decided to approach it through USC.  I am open to the argument that it could be done in a different way but with reasonably similar economic results if it was done through income tax.  Why have two different personal tax regimes, however, particularly when PRSI is thrown in as a kind of third leg and the marginal tax rate is the sum of the three?</p> <p>  That is my position.  It is not that I disagree with the Deputy.  It is just I have a difference of emphasis.  There was an election.  Often it is difficult to interpret results of elections into precise policies, but there certainly was a general tendency to the effect that many people wanted public services repaired and funded more adequately than was the case at the time.  We have taken that on board.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister on the simplification of the taxes.  Having line after line on one's payslip is unhelpful.  The example the Minister provided relates to the second parent going back to work and whether this is worth doing.</p><p>The main argument I have heard relates to child care costs, as that is what stops people going back to work.  I agree that for people coming back to Ireland, it is when kids get to approximately four years old that they think about returning.  As somebody with three young kids, the main argument I hear is about child care.  It is not about marginal tax.  Therefore, I propose an impact assessment of work activation, that is, spending the money either in reduced taxation via the USC or putting the equivalent amount of money into reducing the cost of child care.  I would very much like to see the analysis but my hunch is we would see significant benefit in investing the money in affordable, high-quality child care over a straightforward tax reduction.  Is that something the Minister would consider tasking the Department to have a look at?</p></speech>

We do not reduce personal taxes purely so more women will go back to work.  We can see it would be a consequence of the reduction and that not to do it would be an obstacle to entry into the labour force.  However, there is a generality of the workforce and it simply needs a reduction in personal taxes.  It is a very strong motivation for doing it.</p></speech>

As we all know, we recognise the cost of other adults who are partners or spouses and we recognise the dependency cost, perhaps, of somebody with a specific medical condition or disability.  When it comes to recognising the cost of rearing children, the main element is child benefit.  From an activation perspective, the key issue with child benefit is that it does not penalise a person if he or she takes up work.  The vast bulk of child benefit is paid to women, although there is now a relatively small proportion of men who are the carers for children and receive the benefit.</p> <p>  In any kind of examination, I strongly suggest that the UK system of tax credits is unbelievably complicated and pretty much almost broke the UK Revenue and Customs in its efforts to bring in what was due.  We should do this in the context of activation, particularly with respect to secondary incomes.  The shift to a tax credit model must be examined thoroughly.  Where it has been done, there must be a real-time system, especially if there are varying hours or if a person has two jobs, neither of which is a full-time job.  A person might work in two schools, for example.  I have no problem with an evaluation of the proposal but I would like the significance of child benefit to be recognised, as well as the fact that it covers children up to 18, provided that from 16 to 18 they remain in school or a form of education.  That allows much flexibility and choice to different families.</p> <p>  I know Deputies might argue it is not enough.  It stands at &euro;140 per month and it is a pity it was not increased in this budget.  I assume the &euro;31 million given to the child care initiative in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for the last quarter of the year is in lieu of some kind of child benefit, but that only goes to children who are quite young.  We are not clear about a portion of it that goes to older children.  Any studies on tax are welcome if they give more information.  It is important there would not be the implication that if we did it a certain way, we could do away with child benefit.</p> <p>  In one of the Minister's earlier comments he referred to rates.  With the people I meet, the critical issue in the Irish tax system, which is significant for both single and married couples, is that when a person goes to about &euro;35,000 or &euro;36,000 while single, he or she is into the top rate.  There is a little extra if a couple is involved.  To be honest, that is an area where we are at a disadvantage, for example, compared with the UK.  In that country, the relative levels at which one moves to the top rates are much higher.  Consequently, we need to examine the USC.  I have always favoured that it be incorporated into pay related social insurance, PRSI.  In the long term, as a country, we must provide pensions in retirement for people so contributions must be enough to cover that.</p></speech>

Will the Deputy move the amendment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#FF00400"><p>I move amendment No. 3:</p><blockquote>In page 6, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:&quot;<b>3</b>. The Minister shall, within one month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on options available for removing the USC liability for all workers earning less than &euro;19,752 a year.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>We touched on this earlier.  It is about Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal to remove those earning below &euro;19,752, which we believe should be the new level of minimum wage, from the USC tax net.  This measure would cost in the region of &euro;78 million as opposed to the &euro;335 million the Government's proposal in section 2 would cost.  We believe it would remove, as I mentioned earlier, the unfairness in the USC, while acknowledging there has been significant movement during the years since it was first introduced at a level of &euro;4,004.  It is now at a level of &euro;13,000.  We believe further progress should be made and that the level should be increased to &euro;19,752.  I also point out to the Minister, in case he missed it when he read our alternative budget this year, that - as is the case every year - a wealth tax proposal was included.  We discussed the need for a report earlier when we met in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#FF00500"><p>It would appear from the wording of the proposed amendment that it is the Deputy's intention that all those earning up to &euro;380 per week - somewhat above the earnings of a full-time worker on the new minimum wage of approximately &euro;361 per week - would be exempt from the charge of USC entirely.  It is unclear whether the Deputy also intends that this amendment would consider all income earners with incomes of less than &euro;19,752 rather than just workers.  Such a group would also include pensioners and people with income from their investments.  The current exemption threshold for USC is &euro;13,000 per annum and it is now estimated that over 745,000 individuals - 30% of all income earners - will not be liable for USC from next year.  To further increase this to &euro;19,752 would exempt 42% of income earners, which is more than the 37% estimated to be exempt from income tax in 2017, and would, therefore, considerably narrow the income tax base.  During the economic crisis, it reached a point where 45% of all income earners were exempt from income tax.  That was unsustainable and it placed an unfair burden on earners who were contributing to the income tax base and exposed the vulnerability of the income tax system to economic shocks.</p> <p>  It is my view that a broad-based progressive income tax system where the majority of income earners make some contribution according to their means is the most fair and sustainable model in the long term.  In 2017, following the passage of this Bill and the USC reductions it contains, a single PAYE employee on &euro;19,752 will pay about 9% of their gross income in income tax, USC and PRSI.  I consider this to be an appropriate contribution toward social and public services bearing in mind that a similar employee earning &euro;35,000 will pay about 18% of gross income and an employee earning &euro;70,000 will pay approximately 34% of gross income.  The Deputy will be aware that in this budget I retain the current USC threshold of &euro;13,000 to maintain the existing USC base.  However, I have reduced the three lowest rates of USC by 0.5% each, thereby ensuring that all individuals currently paying USC will see a reduction in their liability next year.  Options regarding the future of USC need to be considered in the context of the reform of the wider income tax system.  In A Programme for a Partnership Government, there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out USC as part of a wider, medium-term income tax reform plan that will keep the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners and limits the benefits for high earners.</p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's request for a report, he will be aware that when the Government considers options for a budgetary tax package, it must take account of the cumulative effect of all parts of the package and, therefore, single measures should not be contemplated in isolation.  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that in July my Department published an income tax reform plan that provides detailed information on the distribution of the USC charge, as well as potential pathways towards its phasing out along with the analysis of many other aspects of the income tax system.</p><p>Taking these factors into account, I am not minded to expend resources on the production of the report requested by the Deputy.  In such circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

He has just told the committee that no longer obliging those who earn just above the minimum wage to pay the USC, which would cost the State &euro;78 million, would leave us vulnerable to external shocks and narrow the tax base.  This is madness.  The Minister is going to get rid of it entirely, not just for these individuals but for everybody.  He has spent the past hour rubbishing my suggestion that the policy the Government has agreed of eroding &euro;462 million of USC tax receipts each year will not leave us vulnerable to external shocks.  However, the Minister is committed to doing not only what I want, namely, removing the lowest earners out of the USC tax net, but also all the removing other earners as well.  Can the Minister explain how my proposal, which involves tens of millions of euro, leaves us vulnerable, while his, which involves billions of euro, would not leave us vulnerable and would broaden the tax base?</p></speech>

Now, the Deputy wants to narrow the tax base.  The same arguments which he made against what I was saying would apply to him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#GG00400"><p>The Minister is making the argument I made.  The point I made earlier is that his proposal this year cost &euro;462 million. The proposal I suggested, which should be the sum total of what we do with USC, is to bring those earning up to the minimum wage out of the net, which would cost &euro;78 million.  While I have acknowledged that this would narrow the tax base, in the context of USC bringing in &euro;5.6 billion by 2021, it is affordable.  How can the Minister, legitimately and with a straight face, say that a proposal to take these people out of the USC tax net at a cost of &euro;78 million would leave us vulnerable to external shocks and narrow the tax base?  How can he also state that he believes in the principle that people should pay a certain amount of income, particularly in light of the debate we have had and his commitment to continue what he is doing this area in the next number of finance Bills.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#GG00500"><p>I am arguing, as the Deputy agreed earlier, that a narrowing of the tax base over a period - where significant amounts of money would be involved - would leave us open to the kind of shocks we were open to when the previous Government but one narrowed the tax base during the Celtic tiger era.  Although that Government thought it had the resources to do so, transactional taxes, particularly those from the building industry, such as VAT, income tax from 250,000 workers and stamp duty, disappeared from the Exchequer when the shock came.  This tax income had to be replaced, which was one of the reasons the USC was introduced.  I am saying that, as a general principle, this is what happens when we narrow the tax base.  I am replying to the Deputy's amendment to have a report and giving him the view on what would be the nature of the report that a narrowing of the tax base can have adverse results.  When we come to particular instances, such as what I proposed in the section we have just disposed of, it is affordable in a particular year but must be seen in the context of a progressive movement towards tax reform over five or six years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#GG00600"><p>I agree with the script the Minister's officials wrote for him and it is in line with the briefing note they gave him when he was re-elected and took office.  However, it is completely out of step with the political position of his party to get rid of the USC.  What the Minister said is accurate.  The abolition of the USC to the scale the Minister is talking about would leave us vulnerable to external shocks.  That is the point I made this morning in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  It would narrow the tax base and, as the Minister just said, leave us vulnerable to other tax receipts falling off, as history has shown us.  How could a proposal which limits the abolition of the USC to &euro;78 million, in the context of the billions of euro it brings in, leave us more vulnerable or exposed or reduce the tax base any more than what the Government proposes?</p> <p>  I expected that the Government would not accept our amendment.  I am glad the Minister has put his position on the record, particularly as he has flip-flopped from what he said this morning.  I can only suspect it is what his Department officials have advised him to do.  These are not departmental decisions but political decisions, and this is the problem.  It has been politically led without any real basis except that somebody thought it was a good idea in the run up to the election.  It is not a good idea; it is a bad idea.  The election is over and we need to figure out what is the most sustainable thing to do for the economy.  The proposal is about ensuring the lowest income earners are taken out of the USC tax net, which would increase their spending power.  They need that pressure to be relieved.  It is a small amount of money in the overall context.  The Minister has talked about this year's measure being affordable.  Based on the fiscal space and the Minister's split of spending and tax - not that I agree with it - &euro;78 million of tax reductions is affordable next year and this report could potentially tee it up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1308" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#GG00700"><p>I support Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment as a limited step with which we would agree in terms of taking low paid workers out of the USC net.  The Minister's response is disingenuous in two ways.  First, he referred to a progressive taxation system and the elements of income tax, despite the reality that these low-paid workers pay a substantial proportion of their income through indirect taxation, which makes up a substantial portion of the country's tax take.  These workers are probably paying close to 30% of their incomes in tax, similar to what the top 10% of income earners pay.  Theirs happens to be largely through regressive indirect taxation measures.  Second, despite all his talk of broadening it, the Minister will not substantially broaden the tax base just by making low-paid workers pay the USC and he will not substantially narrow the tax base by removing such workers from the USC net.  The measures that would contribute to a broadening of the tax base are those which the Government is most dead set against, namely, going after wealth and corporation profits.  The Government is committed to maintaining our corporation tax at a level lower than even that to which Donald Trump has promised to bring US corporation tax.</p> <p>  We do not accept the argument that the USC is a progressive tax which the left should support.  We favour the abolition of the USC.  It is rightly seen by workers as a punitive tax that was supposedly an emergency measure.  We support the replacement of the USC with an equivalent tax that applies to incomes above &euro;90,000, which would be called a high income social charge.  It would hit those on significant incomes as opposed to low-paid workers or medium-paid workers as is currently the case.</p></speech>

Different figures have been put forward.  The budget day booklet stated that the 2017 cost would be &euro;335 million, whereas the answer I received to a parliamentary question stated the full year cost would be &euro;390 million.  Could the Minister clarify whether those are the figures or whether there are different figures?  The Minister read into the record that if the amendment were adopted and implemented as a policy decision, a certain percentage of income earners would be outside the USC net.  What percentage did he say?  For now, the priority should be gradual and affordable reductions that place an emphasis on low and middle-income earners rather than significantly increasing the exemption limit.</p><p>That would be our perspective at this time.  </p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy's approach.  The Government's approach is that as the economy grows, there is extra tax buoyancy.  Between 2016 and 2017, this amounts to about &euro;2.5 billion.  This will be used to improve public services and reduce personal taxes.  By and large, that is what the Government's intention is.  More will be allocated to improve public services.  The commitment in the programme for Government is that at least two to one will be for the improvement of services.  There will then be a residual amount which will be about one third of what is available in any given year and this will be available for reform of taxation.  That principally will be used for, among other things, reduction of personal taxes.  The approach we are taking is that in reducing personal taxes, while not excluding the possibility of varying the income tax code, we will progressively reduce the incidence of USC.  This year, we had very little money so we are doing what we agreed in the last section, which we disposed of.  Next year, we will move on.  As a general principle, I would like to keep the tax base broad.  At present, &euro;13,000 is a good entry point into USC because it is important that everybody who earns contributes something.</p></speech>

This is one of the proposals I have been bringing before this committee year and after.  We must acknowledge that there has been some progress in respect of this matter.  There has been an improvement in the data and types of tables presented in the budget itself and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has done some good work in this regard.  I am sure that, along with others, the committee's report focuses on this issue.</p><p>I am sure the Minister is aware that the committee has agreed the broad principles relating to equality budgeting, which includes the following statement that budgetary changes should be progressive and proofed for equality, anti-poverty and regional impact.  The amendment challenges the Minister to carry out that report within three months, setting out the equality impact for this year.  I am mindful that part of this does not fall under his remit but the aim is to get a Government response.  This is an opportunity for that to happen.  Hopefully, next year, when the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has bedded down more, there will be a more formal way to for this to be done for next year's budget.  In the mean time, there is a gap and the Department, working in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which will be led by the Department of Finance, should agree to carry out this report.  It is in keeping with the spirit of what the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has agreed to do.  It was not possible to do it this year because of the timeframe involved.  It would be a welcome first step and something that could input into our discussions in the other committee, which members of this committee belong to.  For the Department to do this would be a good and genuine step.</p></speech>

This week, the Department of Social Protection will publish the social impact assessment of the welfare and income tax measures in budget 2017, presenting the overall distributional impact of the budget by income group and family type.  It will also examine the impact of the budget on the at-risk-of-poverty rate and work incentives as well as the impact of the change in the minimum wage.  The social impact assessment is being completed in consultation with my Department in respect of the income tax elements of the budget and is consistent with my Department's analysis of the impact of the budget package.</p><p>Deputies will also be aware that the programme for a partnership Government sets out a commitment to develop a process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  The programme undertakes that the institutional arrangements for the independent fiscal and budget office will support equality and gender proofing and draw on the expertise of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  </p><p>In this light, I draw members' attention to a number of new innovations and improved features of this year's budget documentation.  First, section 5.2 of the budget book, which deals with social impact and equality analysis, sets out the stages in the budget process at which equality and distributional issues are explicitly addressed and outlines recent developments in these areas.  This section also describes in detail the process adopted by the tax strategy group, including the pre-budget publication of the tax strategy group papers for the first time this year.  It also details some of the annexes featured in the budget book which focus on equality and distributional issues.  These include Annex A, which presents information illustrating the effects of the budget measures on different examples of income earners and household types across a range of income levels.  Also presented here are tables showing the development over time of the average effective tax rate for different household types across a range of incomes from a variety of sources.  Furthermore, Annex B, which deals with progressivity and income tax issues, analyses the role the income tax system plays in the distribution of income, which is an important factor in assessing the fairness of the budgetary process.  </p><p>Finally, the new social impact assessment framework developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of budgetary policies on household living standards is described in the 2017 expenditure report and accompanying papers.  This new framework will complement the established Department of Social Protection social impact assessment, which focuses on the effect of income tax and welfare measures using the ESRI's SWITCH model.  The new framework expands the assessment to consider the effects of expenditure on public services.  The first of the new social impact assessment papers examining the general medical services scheme and the targeted child care scheme also accompany the expenditure report published on budget day.  All the materials from budget 2017 can be accessed on the budget website at <i></i>.  </p><p>Therefore, on the basis that the analysis proposed in the amendment is already available or soon to be published, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

We called for it last year and the Government began that process then.  We see the second stage of it this year.  However, it falls short of what was expected and what could reasonably be delivered upon.  It should have been equalised on a three-year basis, with the second year coming up to &euro;1,100.  The question is really about the pace through which we deliver the equalisation process.  I want to also mention that the tax credit should not apply to higher income earners.</p><p>We have had an amendment ruled out of order but I will put forward a different version of it on Report Stage.  The amendment should state that we would begin to taper out the tax credit at income of &euro;100,000 at a rate of 5% per &euro;1,000 earned above that level with no credit being available to those who earn incomes in excess of &euro;120,000.  The tax credit would begin to taper out, losing 5% for each &euro;1,000, which means there would be no tax credit at all when one's income is &euro;120,000.  This is a system I am sure the Minister is familiar with; the eradication, phasing out or tapering of tax credits at the higher level was introduced in Britain a number of years ago.  It was introduced by the Labour Party when it was last in office.  It is a way of clawing back revenue.</p><p>We have these debates in Ireland that frustrate me.  We all know how we can use data.  We talk about high marginal rates of tax.  If we were to taper out personal tax credits for incomes above &euro;100,000, our proposal is that we should increase personal tax rates at a rate of 7% on income above &euro;100,000. <font color="#C0007F"> </font>The exact same objective could be achieved by eradicating personal income tax credits by tapering them out above that level, which would mean that marginal tax rates would not have increased, yet individuals would have<font color="#FF0080"> </font>paid more tax, the same way it happens in Britain.  That is why when we compare marginal tax rates, it is important that we look at what is in the system - the types of pension tax relief, the fact that personal tax credit are tapered out and so on.  That is another debate for another time.  The issue here is that the tax credit should be introduced at &euro;1,100.  It was wrong for the Government to take a &euro;950 approach.  The Government should consider the tapering out of this tax credit starting at &euro;100,000 and tapering it out at 5% for each &euro;1,000 earned above that amount.</p></speech>

We would like to have seen the full part two - the additional &euro;550 - provided this year and for it to be fully equalised next year.  I assume it came down to an affordability issue in the end but this improvement has to be seen alongside the partial extension of social welfare benefits to the self-employed.  It was an important breakthrough.  Not all social welfare schemes have been extended to those paying class S PRSI, but it was very important progress for people who are self-employed.  We welcome the increase.  We certainly would have liked it to be more but obviously it was not possible this year.</p> <p>  While we are on this amendment, can we clarify the issue of amendments being ruled in and out of order?  In this case, the amendment proposes to increase a tax credit, which is a charge on the Exchequer.  It is favourable for the taxpayer so it is allowed.  Can that be explained to me?</p></speech>

I have asked that as we go through this there would be some clarification.  I sat with the clerk who has given time to try to explain this and I have suggested a guide for Deputies.  I imagine there are very few people in the House who understand the rulings.  The clerk has to go on existing rulings and precedent and all the rest but, for the life of me, I do not understand how there have been certain rulings made today.  The problem here is we got notification of what was ruled out of order either this morning or late last night.  We have no opportunity to contact the clerk.  There is no time available for us to do this because we are going through the Finance Bill all the way through.  I am not happy that there will be a position where we cannot vote on amendments that I believe should be in order.  Deputy McGrath raises a genuine question.  The two rules that rule an amendment out of order are that it places a cost on the people or a cost on the Exchequer.  My amendment, like Deputy Donnelly's amendment, increases the cost on the Exchequer - we know that for a fact - yet it is allowed to be tabled and we are allowed to debate it.  If a vote is called on it, it will be voted upon.  There are other amendments that do exactly the same but they are ruled out of order.  I do not think anybody in this committee knows these rules.</p></speech>

It has to do with Standing Orders.  The suggestion has been made, because I raised the issue, that the Deputy would take it up at clerk level because we will not be able to resolve it here.  It has been recommended that members do that and, if necessary, table the amendment on Report Stage, if that is possible.</p></speech>

The schedule is to go through this until 9 o'clock tonight.  I think it would be unfair to ask the clerk to sit back and for us to go into his office one by one to discuss this.  We are back early tomorrow morning.  We should set out half an hour and ask the clerk to come in to explain some of the rulings so that we have a better understanding of them.  I have also questioned whether we can get legal advice.  I do not want to call into question the ruling or interpretation of the clerk.  I have signalled amendment No. 105, which deals with the capital gains tax for the funds industry, and I want to be able to press the amendment if it comes to that point.  As parliamentarians, we have to have a clear, legal view on whether that amendment is disallowed or not.  That is why we need to have that discussion.</p></speech>

My amendments that are in the same grouping we are discussing now should be out of order but they are not.  Amendments that propose to stop something that currently does not exist have absolutely no basis under Standing Orders for being ruled out of order in my opinion and yet they are out of order.  I support the Deputy's call to set aside a few minutes for the clerk to come in and explain it to us because these are material issues.  I have tabled similar amendments to the one Deputy Doherty raises on the five-year capital gains tax.  They are material issues.  Is that something we could do?</p></speech>

When we get to the issue of vulture fund tax avoidance, I will demonstrate to the Minister where plenty of additional discretionary taxes could be applied.  The figure in last year's budget document was &euro;33 million.  These figures are first order effects; therefore, when the impact is factored in, the rule of thumb is to reduce the cost to the Exchequer by approximately one third.  If the Minister went one third of the way last year and the net tax hit for the Exchequer was &euro;22 million, it is reasonable to assume that the cost of going the full way would be &euro;44 million.  He has gone a further third of the way, but for the sake of the additional &euro;20 million or so, it would send a strong signal to the self-employed who have endured a great deal of insecurity and difficulty during the recession.  If we could find the additional &euro;20 million, it would make a strong statement to the self-employed all over the country that they would be treated equally from a tax credit perspective to PAYE workers.</p></speech>

The &euro;400 increase gives a benefit of more than &euro;7 a week to those eligible for the credit, in addition to the benefits they receive from other elements of the budget package such as the USC reductions.  In view of the limited resources available in budget 2017 and all of the competing demands for amendments to the tax system, it was not possible to increase the earned income credit by &euro;1,100 to &euro;1,650 as proposed by Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly, or by &euro;550 to &euro;1,100 as proposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  Such increases would have given a more disproportionate benefit to the self-employed as a result of the budget when compared to all other individuals, including PAYE workers, pensioners and welfare recipients  An increase of &euro;1,100 would have resulted in a single self-employed individual earning &euro;25,000 gaining more than &euro;23 per week as a result of the budget package, while a PAYE employee on the same income would only gain &euro;2 per week.  Similarly, a &euro;550 increase would have provided an additional benefit of more than &euro;10 per week for the self-employed.  The increase of &euro;400 contained in the section allows for an additional benefit of almost &euro;7.70 per week, over and above the benefits received by employees in the budget.  This was an appropriate balance in view of the resources available in the budget.</p> <p>  I accept that significant differences remain in the taxation of employees and the self-employed.  However, it must be acknowledged that some of the differences are to the benefit of the self-employed.  For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to those who are self-assessed but not to PAYE workers.  The self-employed also continue to benefit from a broader expense deduction regime than that available to employees.  Deputies will be aware that there is a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the earned income credit to &euro;1,650.  The budget 2017 increase of &euro;400 in the existing &euro;550 credit introduced last year is a significant step in this direction.  For the reasons outlined, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

The tax credit is worth &euro;1,270 and available to active fishers which I understand is a new gender neutral word to describe fishermen and fisherwomen who spend at least 80 days a year at sea engaged in fishing for wild fish or wild shellfish.  The amendment seeks to delete the sunset clause for this tax credit which stipulates that it will cease to be available after 2021.  It is good tax practice to insert sunset clauses into tax legislation, particularly in the case of tax reliefs.  Such clauses, while not required to instigate a review of a particular tax relief, prompt such reviews as and when a sunset clause is due to be triggered.  The Department of Finance guidelines on tax expenditure evaluation set out a five year time limit for reviews of tax reliefs that cost between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million per annum.  It is in this regard that the sunset clause to the end of 2021 was set.  Reviews of tax reliefs allow us to consider whether they are meeting the objectives set for them, whether they are still relevant and required and whether changes might be warranted.  That is the argument for including the clause, but, of course, the Department can always conduct a review after five years without a sunset clause.  If the Deputy is particularly concerned about the issue, I can agree to the amendment.</p></speech>

I will begin by discussing the fisher tax credit.  We should perhaps give it its Irish name, which has always been gender neutral, an iascaire.  There are issues in terms of state aid in respect of the seafarer allowance being proposed under the Indecon report.  It was made clear that there were state aid issues.  No such state aid issues apply to the tax credit.  Is that correct?  I am referring to the tax credit as opposed to the allowance suggested under the Indecon report.</p></speech>

This refers to the state aid guidelines, which hold that if a tax relief is below a certain limit, it does not require approval in advance.  The de minimis limit for the fisheries sector per undertaking is &euro;30,000 over any period of three fiscal years.  This compares to the de minimis limit of &euro;15,000 over three years for agriculture.  This relief will be monitored by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure it does not breach the relevant thresholds.  It will be done through a grant management system that Bord Iascaigh Mhara is developing.  Then, on the basis of the commitment given to Deputy McGrath now, the Department of Finance will carry out a review after five years.  Given that it is treated as a de minimis measure, it does not fall within the scope of exclusion because of state aid guidelines.</p></speech>

It followed from a budget day announcement from the previous year.  I welcome the assessment of the potential of the so-called blue economy and the different elements of the marine sector, which has far more potential.</p><p>Overall, the report found that employment in the marine sector numbers approximately 18,500 people and turnover is approximately &euro;4.5 billion.  The report acknowledges that other countries have a more supportive tax environment generally for the marine sector.  The issue I am seeking to highlight is around the seafarer tax allowance.  I note that in 2013 the cost of the tax foregone in respect of that allowance was only &euro;400,000.  A total of 315 seafarers availed of it.  The combined cost of that tax allowance and the PRSI refund scheme - I realise that does not come under the Department of Finance - was a little over &euro;800,000.  The quantified benefits, according to this report, were &euro;1.4 million.  Indecon arrived at the conclusion that there was a net benefit of &euro;360,000.</p><p>The purpose of the amendment is to elicit the response of the Department to the report.  It is a substantial report.  There are recommendations in terms of changes to the taxation regime across different elements of the marine sector.  To my knowledge, there has been no Department of Finance response to the report.  I am keen for the Department to offer a response because this is an important part of our economy and could become even more important in the years ahead.</p><p>The issues raised with me relate in particular to the seafarer tax allowance and the comparison between the regime in Ireland and other countries.  I am not seeking any commitment on that from the Minister at the moment, but I am keen to hear an assessment from the Department on the report and for the Department to set out its intention in terms of whether we are accepting the recommendations or otherwise.</p></speech>

The report comes up with good recommendations, although I am not supportive of all of them.  The reported has rightly flagged that there are issues in respect of state aid rules applying in this case.  For example, the report has made a recommendation in respect of the tax tonnage regime to allow us to compete with Malta.  Currently, the Malta regime is under investigation for state aid.  Therefore, we need to ensure that anything we bring forward is robust enough.  Some of the proposals, for example, those relating to more capital investment in our ports, would be most welcome, as would tax relief for fishermen.  There is a need for a comprehensive response.</p> <p>  I am also keen to hear the overall estimate of the cost of the recommendations as per section 8.8 of the report.  There is a reference to a cost of between &euro;10 million and &euro;15 million.  The Department of Finance has estimated that the seafarer allowance alone would cost &euro;11 million.  That is in excess of the total cost of the 30 measures proposed, albeit at the lower end, as per the Indecon report.  I am keen to hear the view of the Department of Finance.  It seems one of the measures will cost &euro;11 million.  However, Indecon has suggested that the entire cost of the proposals could be as little as &euro;10 million.  There are obviously some issues with report itself.</p></speech>

This has already been referenced by a number of Deputes.  The report was submitted to the Departments of Finance; Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The review followed from the agri-tax review that was completed the previous year and proved to be a successful assessment of the agri-tax situation.  It led to considerable reform.</p> <p>  Deputy McGrath's amendment seeks to insert a requirement for a report on the Department of Finance response to the recommendations set out in the marine taxation review.  As I have stated before, following the publication of the review, the officials of the Department of Finance were asked to consider the recommendations in conjunction with the other relevant Departments.  Some of the recommendations made were found to be erroneous.  Certain existing tax incentives are already available to the marine sector while others have significant state aid implications that need to be considered carefully, as Deputy Doherty has suggested.</p> <p>  I have brought forward provisions in the Bill to provide for three of the recommendations, namely the tax credit for fishers, the appropriate tax treatment for the fishing vessel decommissioning scheme and the extension of accelerated capital allowances in respect of energy-efficient equipment for sole traders.  It is generally not the case that all recommendations arising from a review would be implemented, and I do not propose to bring forward any additional measures at the moment.  However, that does not mean other recommendations in the review do not have merit.  As state aid rules evolve, we may be able to make more progress in respect of some of the other recommendations.</p> <p>  For these reasons, I am not in favour of setting out in a report the Government response to the individual recommendations.  I am not in favour of accepting this amendment.  On the other hand, the Department has evaluated almost all of the recommendations.  It would not be difficult for us to put the Department's assessment of the individual proposals together in a format.  If Deputy McGrath was disposed to withdraw his amendment such that there was no legislative compulsion on us, we would agree to bring forward such a report at the earliest possible date.  We probably need a window of approximately three months, but we could do it.  I will commit to doing it within three months.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#MM00700"><p>I am a little concerned about this measure.  While we should be supportive of sport and Irish athletes, there are provisions in place to deal with income accrued from sporting activities, including fees and earnings.  Provision has already been made to allow, for example, a golfer who wins the Ryder Cup to treat income from the win as non-taxable.  The proposal in this section goes too far by breaking the link between pension contributions and taxable income.  Sportspersons will be allowed to claim tax exemption on pension contributions made from non-taxable income derived from sporting activities.  The relief available here is far in excess of the relief available to any other individual.</p> <p>  An argument can be made for sportspersons such as badminton players, boxers, cyclists, footballers, jockeys and others named in the Bill, for example, motor racing drivers, rugby players, squash players, swimmers and tennis players.  Currently, only the percentage of their income derived from sponsorship or advertising fees on which they claim relief can be put into their pension.  Under this proposal, they will be allowed to use other income, namely, fees, when calculating the percentage.  That is my understanding and if it is correct, it is unfair.  If I am incorrect, I ask the Minister to explain the position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#MM00800"><p>The general position is that these special provisions for sportspersons are related to the short period during which a sportsperson is active.  The reliefs available would not apply to taxpayers in general who have a full working career of 35 or 40 years.  According to the note provided to me, the sportsperson's relief is based on ten previous years of earnings, during which the sportsperson will have been paying into a pension.  Sportsperson's relief essentially ring-fences any tax relief claimed on contributions paid to retirement annuity contracts, RACs, by professional sportspeople from a later reduction in income arising from a claim under this relief.  However, this is not the case for personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs.  As a result, a sportsperson who takes out a PRSA could be disadvantaged over a sportsperson who takes out a retirement annuity contract.</p> <p>  The amendment provides that PRSAs are afforded equal treatment with retirement annuity contracts such that any relief awarded for contributions to a PRSA will not affect the amount of sportsperson's relief available to the sportsperson.  As a result of this legislation, the relief received for pension payments is excluded when calculating the relief an individual receives under the sportsperson's scheme.  If this relief was not excluded, the person would receive much less relief.  As such, the measure provides for equalisation of RACs with PRSAs and applies to sportspersons who, by definition, have a short earning career from their sport.  Its purpose is to remove an inconsistency in the scheme.</p> <p>  The initial contact on this issue came from the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, or persons associated with that organisation.  It was not made to me personally but was made officially to the Department. </p></speech>

Is it the case under the current scenario that for certain sportspersons, earnings derived directly from participation in sport, namely, prize money, performance fees, etc., as opposed to income from sponsorship, advertisements or endorsements, are subject to relief under section 480A of the Taxes Consolidation Act.

If, however, the person paid the equivalent amount into a personal retirement savings account, PRSA, he or she did not get the relief.  It is to give the same relief to people who contribute to PRSAs as to sportspersons who contribute to RACs.  That is the only change.  It does not change the amounts subject to relief.  It equalises the relief available under a PRSA with that available under a RAC, which I do not fully understand.</p></speech>

The cost would be relatively modest but it would address an anomaly which I do not believe it was the Minister's intention to create when the scheme was created.  The scheme has been very successful for people renovating their homes and it has had the effect from the Revenue Commissioners' point of view of being done by registered contractors, cutting down on the grey economy.  It is not available to people in local authority homes.  There is a large stock of local authority houses, many of which could do with being insulated and the replacement of windows and fireplaces.  Many tenants do that in a situation where for a couple of decades local authorities have done very few repairs.  If tenants are in employment, they may well plan, often with the help of a credit union loan, to refurbish the house but because they are tenants rather than mortgage holders or landlords, the two specified groups who can take advantage of a really popular scheme which has generated employment and improved the housing stock, they cannot avail of it.  I have congratulated the Minister on the scheme on several occasions and support it strongly but it would be helpful to make it available to tenants, especially where significant work is being done such as building work, or a new bathroom or porch, and allow them to recover the VAT in due course in the same way as owners are able to do.</p></speech>

A total of 47,000 homes have been improved under this scheme and approximately &euro;1 million worth of work has been carried out, involving 8,500 contractors.  It is quite significant.  It came into operation in October 2013 with the aim of stimulating the legitimate tax compliant construction sector and assisting home owners to make enhancements to their properties.  In budget 2015, I also extended it to landlords in order to assist them with making improvements to rental accommodation and to potentially increase supply by bringing units that are no longer in use back into the rental market.</p> <p>  The home renovation incentive, HRI, scheme applies to the owners of the property only, and does not apply to private residential tenants.  Extending the HRI scheme in the manner in which the Deputy is suggesting would provide a difference of operation or application in respect of local authority tenants over those renting in the private rental sector.  In any event, I understand that local authorities bear responsibility for the maintenance of housing that is rented to tenants, in the first instance.  If, however, we were disposed to do it we could overcome that particular objection and line of argument. </p> <p>  More seriously, to qualify for HRI, works must meet a minimum spend of at least &euro;5,000, including VAT.  This could represent a significant outlay for tenants of a local authority property who might not obtain any long-term financial benefit from such an investment in their home.  Furthermore, I understand that some local authorities assess rent liability based on the income and assets, including savings of an individual.  In such cases, where an individual wishes to spend significant sums on refurbishments, an application to the local authority for approval could trigger a reassessment and a potential increase in the rent liability of that individual.  We have consulted with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government which has pointed out that it might have a knock-on effect on rent and I do not want to operate blindly.  If it could be done I would be disposed to do it because I agree with the Deputy that some long-standing tenants, especially, are disposed to improve their homes without waiting for the local authority to do it when the wait can sometimes be very long.  I would be subject to the advice of the committee and we could consider it between now and Report Stage but I would be relying on the advice of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on the rent issue before I could move on it. </p></speech>

Deputy Burton's proposal has merit.  The Minister has mentioned problems related to the amendment and its uptake, but they have to be addressed within the scheme.</p><p>Interestingly, when one delves into the figures, one sees that 23% of the works are window replacements, 18% are kitchen renovations and so on.  I support the scheme and its extension, but nearly one quarter of the works are window replacements.  This scheme concerns labour intensive work, but the figure for home extensions is less than 10% and general repairs account for 13%.</p><p> The Government had two proposals at the time.  One was to get many of those in the construction sector back to work, including window fitters.  The other was to address black market activity.  Going by what I have heard around the place, people do not take this option because the value of the work must be &euro;4,405, excluding VAT.  The uptake in the overall scheme is healthy, but let us take one county as an example.  I could point to any, but there have only been 185 properties in Monaghan.  In Wicklow, the number is ten times that.  What is the reason for this?  Is it because of lower incomes?  Uptake is not evenly spread, and one would not imagine it would be, but it is heavily concentrated in Dublin and Cork, where the populations and higher value work are, for example, extensions and so on.  There has been a relatively low uptake in certain counties: 175 properties in Longford; 162 in Leitrim, which is a small county; and 361 in my county of Donegal.  This is over a period of three years.  The threshold is still a barrier and should be reduced.</p><p> The scheme has worked well to date, but a cost-benefit analysis of it must be undertaken because we need to know the criteria on which it will be extended.  My feeling is that it is going well and it is a good idea, but I would love to see more hard facts and data, for example, a cost-benefit analysis.  I am concerned about the spread, though.  It is not being taken up in many counties.  In the past three years in Donegal, Monaghan and Leitrim, properties have been extended, windows have been replaced and doors have been done, but their uptake rates are being affected for some reason.  Perhaps it is a lack of awareness of the scheme, a belief that it was not in the owners' interests or the fact that they have no tax liability.</p><p> The Government should consider reducing the threshold.  I make this point in light of Deputy Burton's amendment.  If the Minister is disposed to her amendment and given the fact that local authority tenants are improving houses that belong to the State, the threshold should be reduced for a start.  We all know people who, having grown fed up with trying to get their local councils to fix leaky windows, front doors or whatever, have taken out credit union loans and done the work themselves.  It does not cost &euro;4,500, excluding VAT, but it does cost a certain amount, and a reduced threshold as a starting point would be one way of addressing this matter.</p><p> The number of contractors who have benefited from the scheme is interesting.  While the number of works is 68,453, the number of contractors is 8,545.  Repeat work is going to contractors.  That is good, but one of the objectives was to try to get those involved in black market activity into the system.  The figures are telling a bit of a story and the threshold is one of the problem's causes.</p></speech>

A choice is being given to tenants, but it should be given to everyone, including council tenants.  We support the amendment and I am open to listening to Deputy Burton on how to deal with this issue now or on Report Stage.  As a basic principle, the scheme should be open to council tenants.</p></speech>

The key measure of its success is whether it results in works being done that would not otherwise have happened.  Undoubtedly, that has been the case.  To take Deputy Doherty's point, any form of home improvement is welcome because it improves the living environment.  Changing doors and windows can help with energy efficiency, for example, and these works generate economic activity.  The scheme is positive in that sense.</p> <p>  If he can, I would like the Minister to accommodate Deputy Burton's amendment.  The key difference between local authority tenants and private tenants is that council tenants have security of tenure and get a credit for any work they do on their houses if they become purchasers under the tenant purchase scheme.  The amendment can be accommodated and formalised in that way.  People wait a long time to get improvements funded through the general local authority system.  If the amendment can be accepted and the barriers overcome, it would be a positive step.</p></speech>

Consider the history of housing in recent decades.  Twenty-five years ago, the local authority carried out many of the repairs and improvements.  That practice died away during the collapse and because people often did not like what the local authority did.  I grew up in a rented house and lived there until my 20s.  I know what I am talking about when it comes to having no autonomy over one's own house.  Deputies who handle many local authority cases and meet many people in local authority areas will be familiar with the fact that, when tenants give up a local authority house, they ask whether they will see the fireplace, floors or windows they installed being thrown into skips courtesy of some council or other.  Deputy McGrath is familiar with this issue.  Everything is just sitting in a skip.  In Cork, it takes two years for a local authority to redo the voided house.  In recent years, Dublin local authorities have lowered that to less than one year.  People want to put their own stamps on their houses.</p> <p>  I will cite the example of a couple who approached me recently.  One member of the couple is working.  Their local authority, which is a Dublin one, has not made any housing available for sale to tenants for reasons that we all understand.  There are approximately 3,500 current and former local authority houses in my constituency.  They are nice, but they are poorly insulated.  The original windows are desperate.  Normally, the houses are occupied by people who, for example, have been widowed.  Even if they can make repairs, perhaps with their children's help, the scheme will not be taken up by everyone, but it will be by a certain group of people who would value investing in their houses to make them more comfortable.  The notion that local authorities would vary the rent differential in estates of hundreds of houses can be taken into account, but many of the Deputies present have been council members.</p><p>Why would Limerick City and County Council do so?  It would just cause an incredible strain.  If the Minister so wishes, we can come back to the matter on Report Stage, but there should be some degree of equity to the scheme.</p><p> Deputy Doherty made a very important point about bringing people out of the grey economy and registering them for VAT and other tax purposes, which is at the heart of the scheme.  Once people register, they generally become legitimate, they and their employees ultimately enter into the PRSI system and we secure their pensions, futures and so on.  I accept what Deputy Doherty said about rural areas.  Maybe there could even be a variation whereby a local authority has a slight possibility of, say, varying the bands, bringing them down to &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000.  However, if major work is carried out on a house, the local authority would have to agree to it but it would take a big worry off its back that its stock of housing is deteriorating.  If the towns are prepared to do it properly and get the VAT back, as other people are getting it back, it is a win-win for everybody.  On that basis, I strongly commend the amendment to the Minister.</p></speech>

It was introduced in the first instance not only to improve housing stock, but also to try to get the building industry off the ground.  At the time it was introduced, one could travel 100 miles of road without seeing a JCB at work or a bit of scaffolding around a house.  The scheme achieved its objectives.  I do not see it as a permanent feature of the tax code or incentives to building as the industry is recovering and re-establishing itself now.  The scheme was scheduled to finish at the end of 2016.  We are letting it go forward for a further two years, but I do not see it as a permanent feature.  I am not sure whether the threshold is too high.  It may be that people are not aware that a number of jobs can be accumulated over a period to the &euro;5,000 level and that the scheme applies not only to the house, but also the cartilage.  The laying of a concrete path down the back of a house or the landscaping of the front are eligible.  Three or four jobs can be done to get to the &euro;5,000 limit on the scheme.  Maybe the local authorities or the Department need to explain it a little further to people.  It depends on payment of income tax as well.  While the rebate is calculated on VAT paid, the rebate is the income tax rebate to the level of VAT paid on the work.  Maybe in different counties or parts of the country, people do not have the income tax liability to see in the scheme a significant benefit or any benefit.</p> <p>  Regarding local authority houses, again, the implication would be that the tenant in a local authority house is an income taxpayer who can avail of the scheme.  However, I can see the incentive from the long delays in many local authorities while people await what would be regarded as necessary home improvements.  Separately, there are also energy efficiency grants available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  It would not be possible to draw the two together for the same amount of money.  One would not get one's tax rebate on the grant, which stands to reason.  A grant can be received for windows and doors as well.  I will consider the matter between now and Report Stage.  However, if we were disposed to do it, we would need to bring it in at a lower threshold for local authority houses without changing the general threshold.  I will have to check if that is sustainable under the tax Acts of differentiating a scheme on threshold levels between different users.  On the face of it, there does not seem to be any reason we would not do it that way.  Maybe the Deputies could check with their local authorities to find out what their policies would be in terms of rent increases if this were introduced.  I do not think there would be massive take-up of it, but it might be significant for a small number of people.</p></speech>

Unless something extraordinary was done, such as the conversion of a small local authority house into some kind of mansion, I would not be aware of any case in which the quality of work done by a tenant to a house would be taken into account in assessing a differential rent.  The imposition on local authorities to assess that would be very difficult.  In my experience, differential rents are calculated on incomes and the number of people in the house rather than on work the tenants may have done to improve the quality of the house.  As far as almost every local authority is concerned, the more tenants do up their houses, the better for the whole estate, the quality of life for everybody on the estate and the desirability of the estate.</p></speech>

What would be taken into account was the assumption that the tenant had in excess of &euro;5,000 in savings to carry out the work in the first instance, which should have been part of a means assessment for rent.</p></speech>

I urge him again to consider the issue.  The figures for the scheme tell us a very clear story.  When one considers it overall, it works out at &euro;1 billion of works.  When one drills down into the detail of it, 70% of that &euro;1 billion of works is being carried out between Dublin and Cork.  This is not working the way it should in rural communities.  The other 30% is heavily concentrated around the counties surrounding Dublin.  There are issues such as the fact that the tenant may not have taxable income.  Not every tenant in such communities does.  The value of the works in these communities is less than what the value of the works would be in the cities because of different price pressures.  It is not a question of awareness; the threshold is an issue.  If it is to be extended for two years, it is worth considering this issue because we have enough data over three years.  For counties only to have 200 or 300 properties under a scheme that has operated for three years now shows that it is not working.  The works are taking place but they are either falling outside of the threshold or the tenants believe they do not have the taxable income to benefit from it.</p></speech>

We are trying to encourage people to carry out works, but the threshold one must reach is quite significant.  While changes were made to the scheme to allow one to roll it over and build up the &euro;5,000, many people do not think like that.  They think they must get the windows or doors done, which can come in at &euro;2,500, so they just get a contractor in to do that, and sometimes the contractor may be unregistered.  They do not think about what else they can do.  Sometimes they do not have the money.  The figures tell us a story.  The scheme is not working in the rural communities as it should.  There is a disproportion in the value of the works carried out.  They are mostly being carried out in Dublin and Cork, outside of which, counties such as Kildare and Wicklow are the ones that have the high uptake.  Again, Limerick has quite a large uptake as well.  However, Longford saw 175 properties come under the scheme in three years and Monaghan saw 185 over three years.  That is fewer than 60 properties per year.</p><p>There is an issue and it is worth examining whether the threshold is the issue.</p></speech>

Certainly, under the differential rent schemes that I am aware of in both local authorities in Cork, it is based on income.  One can argue that interest income would be included but there is no conversion of capital to income under those differential rent schemes.  I do not believe that argument is valid, unless it applies elsewhere in the country.  In my experience, it is certainly not.</p></speech>

I will outline briefly the main substantive revisions.</p><p>Amendment No. 14 introduces a revision to the definition of &quot;qualifying loan&quot; to make it clear that the inclusion of a guarantor as a party to a loan agreement will not prevent the loan from being a qualifying loan for the purposes of the scheme.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 17 and 23 introduce the concept of a &quot;relevant tax year&quot; into the section.  The reason for this is to allow first-time buyers flexibility as to the years in respect of which they can claim the rebate.  With this amendment, claimants will be allowed choose any or all of the tax years within the four tax years immediately preceding the year in which they make their application.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 introduce greater flexibility around the obligation on PAYE taxpayers to submit a tax return.  As currently framed, all claimants would be required to submit a tax return and pay any income tax and USC payable in respect of each of the four preceding tax years, if they have not already done so.  However, as taxpayers whose income is solely taxed under PAYE are not obliged to make an annual tax return, unless required to do so by the Revenue Commissioners, I am amending the obligation on PAYE taxpayers so that they will not necessarily be required to submit a tax return for each of the four tax years preceding their application.  Under these amendments, they will only be required to submit a return for the tax year or years which they consider necessary to allow them to maximise their rebate.</p><p>For example, if a PAYE first-time buyer is satisfied that he or she has paid sufficient tax in 2016 to get the maximum rebate of &euro;20,000, the he or she would only be required to make a tax return for 2016.  If another PAYE first-time buyer is satisfied that he or she has paid sufficient tax in 2014 and 2016 to get the maximum rebate of &euro;20,000, he or she need only make a tax return for 2014 and 2016.  However, if a PAYE first-time buyer needs to draw on tax paid in all of the four years, 2013 to 2016, inclusive, to get a &euro;20,000 refund, then tax returns would be required for each of those four years.</p><p>Amendment No. 26 introduces a revision to the tax clearance requirement on applicants.  The obligation to have a tax clearance certificate will only apply to self assessed taxpayers.  Amendment No. 30 introduces a revision to subsection (7) in order to ensure that certain applicants do not suffer as a result of the four-year limit that applies to the making of a tax refund by Revenue.  For the purposes of defining the four tax years from which income tax and DIRT are to be taken for the refund, subsection (7) allows in certain circumstances for an application which is made in 2017 to be deemed to have been made in 2016.  Paragraph (a)(i) provides that the 19 July to 31 December 2016 cohort may elect to have their application deemed to have been made in 2016, provided the application is made on or before 31 March 2017.</p><p>Paragraph (a)(ii) provides that the 1 January to 31 March 2017 cohort may elect to have their application deemed to have been made in 2016, provided the application is made on or before 31 May 2017.  In order to ensure that such applicants do not breach the four year limit that applies to the making of a tax refund by Revenue, it is necessary to amend this subsection to say that a claim on foot of such an application will also be deemed to have been made in the tax year 2016.  The reason for this is because the four years which will apply for the purposes of the refund will be 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.  In 2017, making a refund from the tax year 2011 would be outside the four year time limit.</p><p>Amendment No. 35 inserts a new paragraph (c) into subsection (8) which deals with the validity of applications and when they cease to be valid.  An amendment is necessary to make it clear that no claim can be made on foot of an application which ceases to be valid.  Amendment No. 41 introduces a minor revision to subsection (17).  This subsection sets out the clawback provisions which will apply where a claimant ceases to occupy a qualifying residence within a five-year period.  The amendment simply adds an obligation on a claimant to notify Revenue when they cease occupation.</p><p>Amendment No. 42 simply involves a rewording of paragraph (a) of subsection (18).  This paragraph provides for a clawback of the refund from a claimant where the claimant is not actually entitled to a tax refund under the terms of the section.  That could arise, for example, where it emerges that the claimant was not a first-time buyer.  The wording of the paragraph has been amended to a minor extent to ensure that it fully reflects what is intended.  Amendment No. 44 involves a minor rewording of subsection (20)(c) to ensure that the collection and recovery provisions in Part 42 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 apply to the clawback provisions governing the scheme.</p><p>I commend all of these amendments to the committee.</p></speech>

That has been a fundamental principle which has been advocated by many Members in the D&aacute;il but also by others, such as the tax strategy groups.  It is proposed that this scheme would run until December 2019.</p><p>The purpose of the Labour Party's amendment was that it would be terminated by a sunset clause at the end of December 2017.  This would ensure there would be an opportunity to assess the impact of the scheme on the market.  The Minister is aware a significant amount of commentary suggests the consequences of this scheme will be basically to help developers and push up the price of housing.  A small group of people who are in a position to benefit from the scheme immediately may do so.  However, for others, who will be purchasing in the next period of time, it will actually drive property prices up, so there will be no net gain.  In a certain sense, it is a distraction.</p><p> I do not know the argument behind it.  The Minister may feel it is a confidence-building measure for developers and builders, who in many cases are on strike, and for banks, which in many cases are on strike as regards giving credit to small and medium-sized developers and builders.  This is partly because the builders and developers either have an impaired credit record from the crash or lack equity.  The banks, as people who deal with them know, are keen on people looking for loans to be able to show equity in a project.  The Minister may be trying to address the specific issue that there are not sufficient lines of credit available, particularly for small and medium-sized developers.  However, the NAMA-style developers or international investors, by and large, have lines of credit available to them.</p><p> I do not see why this scheme should be in place up to 31 December.  The Minister rightly said on amendment No. 12 that when one puts a scheme in place, it is relatively difficult to withdraw it, particularly when it is successful.  In this particular case, however, a serious cost-benefit analysis needs to be done.  Accordingly, I do not think it is right to allow such a long period for a scheme when there is no requirement to produce any evidence upfront.  A wide range of observers of the property market, as well as the institutions which spoke at the new budgetary oversight committee, have said this scheme is not going to contribute very much to the housing crisis, other than pushing the price of houses up.  In effect, it is a subsidy to the developer.  It would be much better if the Minister devoted the work and the energy to trying to sort out lines of credit for those developers and resolved the equity issues which are a particular problem for the banks.</p></speech>

If I could, I will also do the same.</p> <p>  When we went through this with the Minister at the budget oversight committee, he agreed it would be a demand-side policy measure and, in increasing profits to developers of new homes, it would fuel development of new homes, even though it would obviously increase the price.  On the day it was introduced in the budget, probably as he was reading it out in the Chamber, prices went up.  There is a development a few hundred metres from where I live.  Prices there went up within hours of the Budget Statement.  This will swallow the entire amount of the relief.  I know Deputy Michael McGrath has cited other anecdotal evidence from around the country.  It has already done, in limited cases, what Deputy Joan Burton described.</p> <p>  A potential house buyer might have had access to &euro;300,000.  They get a free &euro;10,000 from the State from the scheme.  Suddenly, the property goes up by &euro;10,000.  They are no better off.  When we discussed this with the Minister at the budget committee, my sense was that it would take a little bit of time to do this.  As Deputy Joan Burton said, maybe the first few first-time buyers might get some sort of help.  However, it has happened instantly.</p> <p>  Everyone accepts this scheme is going to drive up the price of new homes.  The Minister himself accepted that at the last budgetary committee.  It will probably lead to some new homes being built.  A supply-side approach would also lead to new homes being built but would drive down the purchase price.  One of the lessons we should have learned from the crash, which many people are living through and will for the rest of their lives, is being overleveraged.  Increasing house prices is essentially overleveraging people.  A fantastic analysis by Senator Elizabeth Warren showed how in the US over the past several decades, the majority of additional household income, which has come about through better technology, better education and women moving from unpaid to paid work, has gone into higher mortgages.  They are not living in bigger houses; they are the same houses.  The same has happened in Ireland.   What the Minister is proposing will make it worse.  The first few first-time buyers may get some relief from this scheme.  The rest will not because it will be priced in straight away.  Indeed, it was being priced in as the Minister was reading it out in the Budget Statement in the Chamber.</p> <p>  It makes everyone else worse off, but particularly the negative equity generation.  We have a large cohort of people who bought apartments and small homes between 2004 and 2008.  They paid massive stamp duty, property taxes and second home taxes.  Many of them ended up accidental landlords.  They might have moved out of an apartment to raise kids and are renting it out while they rent somewhere else themselves.  They have been hit with massive tax bills as a result.  It makes them worse off.  Take the example of two couples.  One could be first-time buyers in their late 20s and the other could be a negative equity couple as I described.  They both could be trying to get the same house.  The first-time buyer has no legacy debts, may have no children and, chances are, their household costs are lower.  We are giving them free money to buy this house.  We are not, however, going to give the free money to the couple beside them in the line, who are in a much worse situation because they have legacy debts and are starting from minus &euro;100,000.  Ahead of the measure being introduced, what I and other committee members suggested would happen, happened instantly, thereby making the first-time buyers no better off and, critically, making the negative equity generation, who are stuck, even worse off.  It just is not a sensible measure.</p> <p>  It is not like there are not any other options.  There are plenty of supply-side options.  As the Minister knows, the residual value is going to the owners of the land.  It costs approximately &euro;150,000 to build a semi-detached house in Dublin but it sells for &euro;450,000.  Up to &euro;300,000 is floating around from the purchase price not going into the cost of build.  Some of it goes to the builder's margin but the majority of it is going to whoever owns the land.  What we have is not a market failure but a regulatory failure.  There is no shortage of bricks, wire, glass or roofing slates.</p><p>Let us take a house near here and state it costs &euro;150,000 to build it but someone will pay &euro;450,000 for it and the extra &euro;350,000 will go into the land.  In all of the places where there is a high demand for people to live, the zonable land is either constrained or there is no incentive on those who may be hoarding it to develop it for residential use.  This policy is ineffective and unfair on that negative equity generation.  It will make things worse for most people.  We need to incentivise residential development, but there are many available supply side measures, including zoning more land and investing in infrastructure to make that land available for development or applying a tax to zoned land in strategic areas to incentivise development.</p></speech>

The measure is being introduced as one part, and indeed a small part, of many actions to develop a fully functioning housing market that responds adequately to the needs of our citizens.  They are all included in Rebuilding Ireland, the action plan for housing and homelessness which was launched last July.  Every Deputy in the House knows the importance of repairing the construction sector and taking across the board action to increase the supply of houses.  It was identified at the housing committee of the D&aacute;il that this should be a priority, and it is a priority in the programme for Government.</p> <p>  Implementation of the plan is being led by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  There is cross-departmental support for this.  It is a huge issue.  It is probably the biggest issue facing modern Ireland at this point in time despite all of the other difficulties around.  The comprehensive action plan takes an holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the action plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.  It is in this context the help to buy scheme should be considered.  Its role will be to complement the other measures in the action plan.</p> <p>  As to the extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices, there may be an increase but it very much depends on the speed and efficiency with which the industry responds.  My background was as a teacher.  When I got married at 26 years of age I was able to raise the money to buy a house, as were people in my peer group such as young nurses, garda&iacute; and civil servants.  This was the pattern.  It was a long time ago, when salaries and real purchasing power were much less than they are now, even after the corrections done through the recession.  The situation now is that while people of my generation were able to afford to buy houses the generation now cannot afford to buy houses.  The principal reason is they cannot put the deposit together.  This is the big constraint.  They can get the mortgage; it varies depending on the prudential rules of the Central Bank, but by and large it can be raised.</p> <p>  The big constraint now is that frequently young people and young couples pay more money on rent then they would pay on a mortgage.  As a result of the inability of the type of couples I am describing in the public and private sectors to come up with the deposit required, these houses are not being built.  The point on the price of a three-bedroom house in a typical residential estate, which was commonplace 25, 30 or 40 years ago and which was the starter home for Ireland at the time, is an unproved assertion, because these houses are not being built in the cities any more.  If we look at the recovery in the housing market, it is in more expensive houses in the &euro;400,000 to &euro;600,000 category.  This is what is being built.  Very few three-bedroom semi-detached houses are being built, which were the typical starter homes.  The prudential regulation has aggravated this somewhat.  People are caught in a trap where they pay heavy rents and rents are increasing because the supply is restricted.  Because they pay so much on rent they cannot put together a deposit.  We must try to break this vicious circle.</p> <p>  This is only one initiative, but it is an initiative to allow people who are working, paying rent and paying income tax to get a rebate of income tax to help them make the deposit.  As the Deputy knows from the scheme now because it has been well discussed, for people paying &euro;300,000 for a house, which is approximately the price of a starter home in Dublin in particular, the deposit will be 10%, which is &euro;30,000, and they will be able to get &euro;15,000 under the scheme so now they must save &euro;15,000.  If a house costs &euro;400,000, which is the limit in the scheme, the deposit is &euro;40,000 and people can get &euro;20,000 a rebate on taxes if they have paid that much over the previous four tax years cumulatively.  If it is a couple this can be doubled, as it is the combined tax payment of the couple.  We must do something to crack this.  It is a huge problem.  We can do all of the supply side measures we like, but if we cannot address the issue of people not being able to put together a deposit the builders will not supply because the demand will not be there.</p> <p>  I fundamentally disagree with something Deputy Donnelly said previously and implied again today.  In our previous discussion on this, he told me a leaving certificate student in his or her first month in economics would know that if we are addressing supply we can only do it through the supply side and not through the demand side.  This is not true.  Supply always in a proper market responds to demand.  He may remember something we did years ago.  It was not I who did it, it was Ruair&iacute; Quinn, which was the car scrappage scheme.  How did this work?  Bad cars were taken off the road by giving people &pound;1,000 at the time, with which they bought new cars.  What happened on the supply side?  Cars were imported to serve the demand and supply responded to cater for demand.  It happens all over the place.  If there is a new money demand for something supply responds.  It either responds in the domestic market or it supplies by the need being addressed by imports.  It will happen here as well.  Whether it increases the price of houses or not is a moot enough point, because the type of house we are speaking about is not on the market.  It is not being constructed at present except for very isolated places.</p> <p>  I was as surprised as Deputy Donnelly was when, on the day we first introduced the scheme a developer, and supposedly a reputable developer, in Wicklow announced an increase in prices.  I was so annoyed about it I went to the former Minister, Tom Parlon, and asked him to explain it.  He addressed it and told me it was a coincidental announcement.  It was not as a result of anything we did.  It was something that was going to be done anyway with a second phase of houses because the first phase had been built.  I do not know whether or not this is true, but I accepted the explanation because I have a certain regard for the man and I believe his heart is in the right place in trying to do the right thing by the Irish people on this issue.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's argument that this discriminates against people in negative equity, I believe it does the opposite.  If the Deputy's first argument is correct and this drives up the price of houses, it will reduce the negative equity element of people who have negative equity because the value of their property will increase.  It seems to me the Deputy can sustain one of the arguments but not both because they cannot both be correct at the same time.  Will it work?  I believe it is right and it is there for a three year period.  We did not do an impact study because within the time available we did not have time, but two amendments have been tabled, one in the name of Deputy Michael McGrath and one in the name of Deputy Joan Burton, on impact assessments.  When we come to these amendments I will deal with it.  I am not adverse to doing impact assessments, it is just we could not do them up front and introduce the scheme when it needed to be introduced.  We are dealing with an emergency.</p><p>When I discussed it with the Governor, the Central Bank agreed that it would be taken within the prudential rules and that it would be deemed to be an adequate contribution to a deposit to qualify under the prudential rules as enunciated by the bank.  Of course, I did not get into crossing the t's and dotting the i's because the only piece that was relevant to the Central Bank was if it would be acceptable under the prudential rules.  </p><p> The other thing to remember, if Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly's argument is correct, is that it would increase the price of houses and that, as a consequence, there would be no long-term benefit.  If the price of houses was to increase, it would increase the mortgage liability over a 25 year period, but it would not necessarily increase the deposit required, or it would only increase it marginally.  If the issue is the availability of a deposit, as long as we can contribute seriously to a young couple producing a deposit - while I do not agree that it should trigger house price increases -  if there was to be an increase in house prices, the liability would be spread over the period of the mortgage.  In doing it this way the key issue is still being addressed in providing assistance in seeking a mortgage.  It may not work.  I have spent six years listening to celebrity economists tell me that things will not work.  They said we would have to default, that we would all be ruined, that nothing would work, that there was no point in cutting the rate of VAT for the hospitality industry and abolishing travel tax as it would not work.  There are people who are against everything, but there is no point in being a Minister if you do not try things when there are problems.  The Minister has to move to try to address issues.  Conventional wisdom does not always address them.  This is that kind of scheme to address the lack of supply due to the inability of young couples to come up with an adequate deposit for the purpose of purchasing a starter home which is typically a three-bedroom semi-detached house in an estate.  It also addresses the issue of single houses in rural Ireland, where a couple may be given a site on which to build by their parents, parents-in-law or relatives.  Slightly different arrangements would have to be made in that instance because such couples do not always use a contractor to carry out the work.  Where a mortgage to the value of 70% of the house is raised, the issue can be addressed.  </p><p> I know that I will not convince everybody - actually I am not trying to convince anyone - I am trying to outline my thought process in putting the scheme together and explain why we did it.  We have listened to advice and are introducing some amendments in order that it will work effectively.  We will talk about the impact assessment study when we come to the relevant amendments.</p></speech>

I wish to inform members that the clerk and I met departmental officials during the break to discuss the decision to rule some of the proposed amendments out of order.  It is part of Standing Orders and we do not have control over it.  The decision was made based on the amendments having the potential to impose a charge on the people from a particular date.  If it is a date in the future, then that is different and that is why some of the amendments in Deputy Stephen Donnelly's name were allowed.  Other than that, the amendments are out of order and I cannot change that because of Standing Orders.  The Deputies will have to take it up directly with the officials.</p> <p>  We are on section 8, with amendment No. 16 to be moved.  I ask the Minister to move the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#ZZ00200"><p>Before we come to amendment No. 16, I want to take issue with some of the Minister's comments on the section.  Before the break the Minister gave his view as to why the scheme is necessary and the relevant sections are necessary in the Finance Bill.  He made the point very clearly that this was related to the inability of individuals to amass the necessary down payment or deposit to meet the Central Bank mortgage rules.  However, what the Minister is putting before us does not just address that issue but goes much further.  What the Minister is putting forward in this section, allowing for a loan to value ratio of 70% and allowing for the purchase of a house to the value of &euro;500,000, means that someone who has a deposit of &euro;150,000, which is double what is required under the Central Bank rules, is being provided with a &euro;20,000 tax rebate.  That does not make any sense.  Individuals who already have a deposit in excess of what is required under the Central Bank rules will still be eligible for the &euro;20,000 rebate.  That is an extreme example, involving a 70% loan to value ratio and a purchase price of &euro;500,000 but there is still a problem with other scenarios.  Even someone with &euro;80,000 who wants to purchase a lower priced house would, because of the loan to value ratio, have in excess of what is required to draw down a mortgage and yet the State is going to benefit him or her with a tax rebate of &euro;20,000.  The Minister has said that the issue is not about an increase in house prices.  However, as sure as night follows day, house prices will go up.  We are already seeing evidence of that as a result of this measure.</p> <p>  The Minister also referred to the fact that this will be drawn out over a 25 or 30 year period but unless he decides to keep this going indefinitely, there will be an issue at some point when the tap is turned off.  The Minister also made the point that the issue is supply and argued that the way to address the supply side problem is to increase demand.  However, evidence suggests that demand already exists and that people can reach the loan to value ratios.  Indeed, in the Central Bank's letter to the Minister, myself and others, the Governor points out that the average loan to value ratio for mortgages issued by the financial institutions is less than 80%, which is lower than what is required under the macroprudential rules.  The Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland has produced figures on first-time buyers here.  The data that I have in front of me on mortgage approvals, which comes from a report published in September 2016, shows a year on year increase in mortgage approvals for first time buyers of 24.9% and in mortgage draw downs of 11%.  The approvals are happening at a faster rate than the draw downs, which raises an obvious question.  If so many people are being approved for mortgages, why are they not drawing them down?  The Minister has argued that the problem is that they cannot get mortgages in the first place but that is not accurate.  The Central Bank pointed out that the average loan being issued by the financial institutions is below the macroprudential rules, which is why the Minister changed the loan to value ratio.  The Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland has shown that the rate mortgage approvals is exceeding by almost 50% the rate of mortgage draw downs.  </p> <p>  The issue is supply and this scheme is a very bad idea.  I understand why Mr. Tom Parlon supports the scheme because it will put money into the pockets of developers.  I do not believe that developers are not building because there is not enough demand.  Demand does exist.  If developers are not building because there is not enough profit, because they are not able to make a return of 10% to 15%, that is a whole different argument and we must have an honest debate on that issue.  There are two ways to address it on behalf of developers.  The first is to provide this grant, in the form of a tax rebate to individuals, which will push up house prices and improve the profit margins for developers.  The second way to address it, which is what we should be doing here, is to determine ways to reduce the cost of building.  We should be looking for ways to bring down the cost of building houses which will benefit not only builders, but also those who want to purchase a home.  We must bear in mind that when a person takes out a &euro;300,000 mortgage over a 30 year period at today's interest rates, he or she will pay back about twice that amount.</p><p>As such, the Minister's scheme is fatally flawed and the idea that we should introduce an analysis post the fact is barmy and bonkers.  This was mooted months ago by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance would have had an idea about it.  That no analysis has been carried out by the Department of Finance of the impact on house prices and other sectors, as well as on supply and demand, is unacceptable and the wrong way to propose policy.  This will have long-term consequences, which is why I am recording some of the facts from the Central Bank on mortgage drawdowns and mortgage availability as they completely destroy the arguments the Minister has made for this type of initiative.  I have no doubt that it comes from a desire by the Government to address the issue, but while reference was made to celebrity economists, I have heard no one, celebrity or otherwise, outside the Construction Industry Federation and the Government say this is the way to address the housing crisis.  We can call them whatever we want, but across the divide it is being said this is not the way to deal with it.  The Minister, rightly, called it an emergency, but this is tackling it at the wrong end.  The amount of money being spent on this type of solution should be invested in other ways to ensure the price of starter homes will come down.  The Minister said the scheme was aimed at starter homes.  If that was true, he would not be allowing for houses to the value of &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 to the end of the year.  That is the reality.  He said the cost of a starter home - a three-bedroom, semi-detached house - was &euro;300,000, although it is probably in excess of that figure.  If this was about starter homes, he would have gone with that limit.  However, what he is allowing for in the scheme is for individuals to buy houses up to a value of &euro;500,000, which is not the type of starter home he suggested.</p></speech>

The <i>Daft.ie</i>report published yesterday which showed a massive increase in rents included as an example the cost of a mortgage to buy in Dublin 5 as being &euro;1,287, whereas the rent on the same house would be &euro;1,500 per month.  There is a sector of people who are renting and may have very good jobs.  The Minister spoke about the Central Bank.  I made a submission to it in which I strongly proposed that it take into account those persons who were renting for a significant period, perhaps two or three years, in assessing their financial discipline and ability to pay in identifying the deposit needed by them.  People who had been working for ten or 12 years but did not buy because it was too expensive at the tail-end of the Celtic tiger period rented as many celebrity economists had advised them to do at the time.  Initially, there were a lot of rental properties available, but those families are now stuck.  If someone has two or three kids and rent payments of &euro;1,500 to &euro;1,800 per month, his or her capacity to save for a deposit is much more limited than someone who lives at home.  I am sure the Governor of the Central Bank heartily approves of the latter, but there are other things that have to be done to enable people to purchase a home.  People are paying extraordinarily high rents in Dublin, Cork and Limerick as mentioned in the <i>Daft.ie</i>report.  The monthly mortgage repayment on the house mentioned would be &euro;1,287, but the rent would be &euro;1,500 and the landlord would probably come back to say there were others who would be willing to add another &euro;200 or &euro;300 to the rent because they were so anxious to secure the property.  That is a real problem and it requires rent regulation.  However, that is a separate issue which I will not raise now.  In identifying areas where one could help people who need to be able to buy a house and who have the wherewithal to do so one would be much better placed in requesting the Central Bank to look at this issue.  Many of the local authorities in the Dublin area, in particular my local authority of Fingal County Council, have always looked at people's financial commitments.  If they were paying rent for a significant period, with all of the discipline that involved, they were allowed to include this in the assessment in respect of a mortgage to rent property, a low-rise mortgage or a local authority SDA loan.</p><p>Other than the flashy publicity the scheme has generated, I am not sure of the point of it.  The Minister's feeling may be that generating that publicity will, in some way, kick start the market, but I do not think that will happen.  At this time having serious house price rises is counterintuitive to everything about the market.  The problem for developers who cannot build is that they do not have the credit lines and equity the banks now require in order to obtain credit.  The purpose of the amendment is to reduce significantly the time period for which the scheme would extend to provide in real time for an actual assessment of its impact.  This goes against everything that has been said about introducing new tax breaks and incentives.  They should be costed and evaluated and there should be a cost-benefit analysis and an impact assessment, with decisions being made on that basis thereafter.</p></speech>

We both agree that supply must increase and that people need access to the market.  I agree fully that many first-time buyers cannot raise &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.  Where we might differ is that I believe the access argument applies both to first-time buyers and the negative equity generation.  While I do not agree with what it is doing, I ask that the Minister at least consider before Report Stage including that group too.  The measure is obviously going to go through.  I take the Minister's point that increasing prices reduce the net liability of somebody in negative equity, but the argument he made about first-time buyers not being able to save the deposit applies to the negative equity group.  Even if prices go up and their liability goes down, they are at best still dealing with debt the first-time buyer does not yet have, but they are trying to buy the same homes and cannot save the deposit.  If the Minister is going ahead with this measure, as he obviously is, I ask him to consider on Report Stage extending it to the negative equity generation.  He is literally talking about the same people standing in the same queues to try to buy the same houses.  He is introducing something that will help first-time buyers to save a deposit, on which I take his point, but the men and women standing beside them cannot save a deposit either.  He might take this into consideration.</p> <p>  The Minister made a point about supply and demand.</p><p>I agree that if the Minister changes the demand curve, which is what this will do, supply will be affected.  I never suggested that would not be the case.  My point was that if one tries to increase the number of houses being built, which is the equilibrium between supply and demand in any given area, by moving supply through rezoning land, site value taxes and other supply side measures, the supply will increase but, critically, at the same time, the average price of a house will reduce, which is important.  While I accept if demand is fuelled, the number of houses that are built will increase, the problem I have is the price will also increase.  It is my contention that higher property prices in general are bad for society because we end up further in debt.</p><p> The Minister presented a reasonable argument in terms of this being a policy to help first-time buyers save a deposit because they are caught in a trap.  If there were some other way of achieving that, which did not potentially push up prices, such as the Central Bank saying it will retain the income ratio of 3.5 but reduce the size of the deposit because it is causing all sorts of unintended consequences and is locking people out - the affordability point is the income multiplier - would the Minister scrap this scheme?</p></speech>

The alternative is to do nothing and we cannot go down that road.  People need assistance to get a mortgage.  On 23 October, Mr. Brian Keegan, a director of taxation at the Institute of Chartered Accountants, wrote an interesting article.  He said behaviour following schemes that have been introduced on foot of various tax incentives does not always follow the route classic economics dictates that it should.  He pointed out a number of examples where behaviour did not follow suit.  We should take note of that.  This scheme addresses a cohort that cannot access supply at the moment and it is not targeted at all homes.  If it applied to all homes, price increases would result.  This is a good article, which is written subjectively and goes all through all aspects of the scheme.  Pension relief is another example of the benefit being disproportionate to the incentive provided.  We can quote different economic indicators, economists and classical economics but it does not always follow and there are loads of examples in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#BBB00300"><p>We made our views on this known during the budget debate and I will not repeat them at length.  Our view is this is not the right intervention.  It is a supply problem primarily and to stimulate supply, the Minister faces a few choices aside from the bottleneck issues of land availability, zoning, serviced land and so forth.  The fundamental choice is to increase prices or to reduce the cost of delivering new homes.  This measure will place upward pressure on prices.  There is anecdotal evidence of that, which may not be proven categorically, but it is inevitable that there will be upward pressure on prices in certain sections of the market and I believe that the Minister believes that is not such a bad thing because there are benefits for builders.  It will certainly help to improve supply.  There are also benefits for banks in respect of strengthening their balance sheets but it will have an impact on the indebtedness faced by borrowers.  As Deputy Doherty said, with any intervention, there is an end date and whether one accepts or not that there is a distortion when the intervention is made, there will certainly be one when it is ended.  How will it be possible to phase this out, given it is currently proposed to be in place for a number of years?</p> <p>  An independent impact assessment should have been conducted before the decision was made.  That could have been done quietly.  This was mooted back in July when the Rebuilding Ireland programme was first announced.  There was time, therefore, to conduct an impact assessment.  The predominant problem is supply and the focus should be on examining the cost of delivering new homes.  We will go through the amendments later that deal with that issue, the issue of the impact assessment and some changes we propose relating to self-builds and non-self-builds and so forth.</p> <p>  The reality of the situation we are in is Fianna F&aacute;il has a confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael.  It does not provide for this intervention in the property market.  We are committed to facilitating the passage of budgets provided they are consistent with principles in the agreement.  It would not be reasonable for us to say the Government cannot bring forward measures in its own right that we may not agree with fully.  We do not agree with this but we will not block it.  We will seek to shape it and to insist on an impact assessment at an early opportunity.</p></speech>

This is a new variation on an old and failed theme when the supply of housing in whatever form it takes that people can afford based on their incomes needs to be increased.  The Government is instead returning to an old theme, which is to incentivise developers with tax breaks relating to property.  The tax break in this case is hoped to increase supply and to incentivise the private sector to deliver housing.  We have been down this road previously and it just does not work.  It led to disastrous consequences.  The evidence is clear that this proposal is driving up prices and, therefore, the benefit, if any, to the target group of first-time buyers is highly dubious but, in any event, it is completely the wrong way of approaching the problem.  It smacks of the addiction that seems to exist of looking to the private sector to deal with this problem and trying to incentivise developers and bankers rather than the State directly providing the low cost housing that is needed.  I do not understand why the Government does not grasp that fact.  One does not have to be a radical left winger to understand this.  Large scale provision of low cost housing was directly provided by the State previously.  It is cheaper, more effective and quicker, but, instead, we have these round the houses approaches and the circuitous route to trying to solve the problem always goes via the bankers and the developers rather than going directly at it.  We absolutely reject this as a solution and think it will add to the problems rather than solve them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#BBB00500"><p>I thank all members for their contributions and I would like to tease this out further to see if there is any agreement across the House on this.  Everybody agrees that not enough houses are being built at the moment to meet the potential demand, especially from first-time buyers, and analogous to that, rents are increasing because there is not a sufficient supply for apartments and houses to rent.  It is all part of the same market failure in the housing and development sector.  We are where we are, which is the clich&eacute; that is always used to describe these circumstances but we know how we arrived there as well.  As I said previously, as well as implementing the troika plan that was negotiated principally with Fianna F&aacute;il back in 2010, the Government from 2011 on brought in a parallel plan to repair the economy sector by sector.</p><p>I have no hesitation in saying that building and development was the sector that was most difficult to deal with.  There are still huge residual problems in that sector even though we have restored agrifood, farming, tourism, foreign direct investment, financial services and so on.  This is the residual sector and a lot of it is for the reasons that members will know.  As well as that, the sector got into such a state of disrepair that it became the scapegoat, probably rightly.  Bankers and developers were blamed for the crisis.  As a result of it becoming a scapegoat, it was very difficult to repair it or to do anything to lift it off the ground, and we have the residue.  Everybody, I think, agrees that there is a problem in the sector of supply.  Whether it is for purchase or for rental or whether it is apartments or houses, there is a supply side problem.  That problem is most acute at the starter home and apartment rental level, particularly in a city like Dublin.  I think there is agreement on that.</p><p> The approach of the new Government, after discussions with everybody who supported the Government, has been that there must be a major new housing programme and it must be given priority.  That was published by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in July.  Much of the supply side measures that members have advocated are in that.  Direct supply side measures are in that programme.  What we are doing here is we are taking out one small segment of the building and development sector where there is a particular problem with first-time buyer's getting deposits for mortgages.  We are addressing that singularly in this particular scheme.  We are not saying it is a cure-all for the sector.  It is anything but.  One could go through all the other problems in the sector, for example, the release of land onto the market, although there is some release of land happening now.  However, in respect of the kind of use it or lose it provisions we want to put into the tax code or, to be more precise, use it or we will tax it provisions, I shared previously with members, and I am sure the Minister, Deputy Coveney, did so as well, the Attorney General's advice that due notice had to be given before a tax can be imposed on unused land or else the legislation would be deemed unconstitutional.  The former T&aacute;naiste knows quite well that the previous Government decided on doing that and it is going to come into effect in the form of a heavy tax on unused land from 2018.  I can check the date for members but that is in place.</p><p> There is a lot of work done on the cost of building houses.  Deputy Doherty's idea is that we should address the cost of houses and reduce the cost.  There are two things I would like to say about that.  First, policy is moving in the opposite direction because of the climate change agenda and because of the increase in building standards in houses.  The regulations promulgated some years ago by the former Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on better quality houses after the various scandals we had on defective builds and inadequate regulation is putting about &euro;50,000 onto the price of a three-bedroom house.  The movement is in the opposite direction. When account is taken of the climate change agenda, the need to ensure houses require very little fossil fuel heating and the very big insulation requirements under the regulations, they all have an effect on price as well.  It is a very pious aspiration to say that we can solve the problem by bringing in measures that reduce the price of houses.  We can do that to a certain extent, in terms of Deputy Donnelly's point about releasing more land on to the market.  That would have an effect because there is no doubt that there is a premium being added on, not to the builders of houses but to the owners of the land on which the houses are built.  That is a problem but that is being worked on as well and, as I say, the tax will be one such measure.</p><p> The other thing is that large tranches of land have been released now such as that at Cherrywood.  Cairn Homes, the United States builders, have bought land at Cherrywood.  Planning permission was granted for 11,800 units and it is developing it.  That land has been released now.  Ulster Bank sold its whole property portfolio in west Dublin to Cairn Homes.  It has sites for several thousand houses and it is proceeding to construct.</p><p> Deputy Burton spoke about the inability of small builders.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund has made money available for small developers through the banks.  It would allow them to borrow up to 90% of the cost of a scheme and the interest rates are around 12% or maybe a bit lower.  The ISIF has found that the builders are restoring their capacity to borrow again and they are not looking for the 90% but taking up between 70% and 75%.  The fund is able to give them a reduced interest rate because the take-up is lower and, consequently, the risk is lower.  The market is correcting itself.  Intervention in the market under this scheme is a small area being addressed in the context of the generality of the scheme.</p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett advocated very strongly for the provision of social houses through the local authorities or housing agencies.  I agree with him.  The commitment by the Minister with responsibility for housing is something like &euro;5.5 billion for that purpose over the next five or six years.  There is an enormous sum of money going into that and the local authorities are beginning to respond.  It is a multifaceted crisis.</p><p> The other issue is about whether price will go up.  One of the big problems over recent years has been that the market price for a house down the road was less than the cost of building a new house up the road.  We cannot run a market that way.  If it costs a person &euro;250,000 to build a three-bedroom house and one can buy the equivalent house on the other side of the street for &euro;200,000, who is going to build?  The market was virtually closed after the crisis because house prices collapsed to the point where they were well below their replacement cost, especially starter homes, three and four-bedroom semi-detached houses and four-bedroom detached houses in typical housing estates where most people start their lives.  These are the facts of it and they are all being addressed now.  This is one part of it.</p><p> A couple of issues arose.  Deputy Burton spoke about the cost of housing and agreed with me about the lack of starter homes.  Deputy Doherty spoke about the statistics for mortgages and the average being below 80%, which is where we pitched this Bill first until we got the information from the Central Bank and then took it down to 70%.  The reason for that is not because people do not have a problem in raising mortgages.  The principal reason for that is their well-off parents who are putting up the cash.  We all know that in our constituencies.  The parents are chipping in for the deposits.  The people who are really caught are the people who do not have parents with money.  They have to try to put it together themselves and the two people are working.  In the case of a young couple who go out to work every morning and pay &euro;1,500 a month in rent, as quoted by Deputy Burton, how will they put &euro;20,000 together?  The effect of this measure is that they will only have to put &euro;10,000 together.  The benefit of the rent that they are paying is not being taken into account by the Central Bank and the Central Bank will not take it into account under the prudential rules.  The lenders take it into account, however, because what the lenders or whoever is giving out the mortgage are measuring is the capacity to pay.  When they are measuring the capacity to pay, one of the first questions is what a person is paying in rent and how long he or she has been paying it.  If the reply is &euro;1,500 a month for the past four years, that shows that person can afford a mortgage that costs &euro;1,200 a month.  That is the way it works but the Central Bank is not going to move position on giving allowances for rent because that allowance is being given by the mortgage provider.</p><p> The Central Bank is looking at the prudential rules.  It is not going to abolish them or anything but it will move on them at the end of this month.  It is taking seriously the submissions made by the parties in this House and by Members of this House who made individual submissions.  The bank wants to avoid a situation where people borrow more than they can afford to service and we have another crash in the next downturn and a whole lot of people facing the threat of their houses being taken from them because they cannot afford their mortgage and so on.</p><p>I support the prudential rules, but they were introduced in a form that can now be nuanced.  Now that the experience is in place they can be adjusted and targeted a little better, and that will be done.  However, we cannot get away from the fact that many young couples at present cannot put a deposit together.  The Deputy asked if alternatives were considered.  They were.  We considered a grant scheme.  For all my life up to ten or 15 years ago there were grants available.  There were two grants when I bought a house, one from the local authority and a national grant under certain circumstances.  One could put the two together.  They were abolished at some stage on the grounds that they were going into the builder's pocket.  This time we directed the provision to the purchaser, not the builder.  That is the reason it is on the demand side, not the supply side.  We could have put it on the supply side if we gave the money to the builder, but that would not have worked.  It would have gone straight onto the price or into profit.</p><p> We could have done it through a grant system.  We examined it and I discussed it with officials in the Department of Finance.  If we did it by way of a grant of, for example, &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 per three-bedroom house, the Department with responsibility for the environment would have had to be geared up to administer it.  With all due respect to that Department, it is fairly heavy on staff demands when it comes to administering schemes.  Then, every local authority would have matched it and it would have been necessary to have some type of inspection system for every house.  We were able to deliver what we discussed previously, the help to buy scheme and home improvements, through the Revenue Commissioners more or less online.  The applicant registers online and the builder registers online.  Nobody is in the black economy and it is done by means of tax rebate.  That does not mean that nobody administers it and it is done automatically, but the Revenue Commissioners assure me that they can handle the scheme with their current cohort of staff and without the additional cost of gearing up the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the local authorities.  It goes straight to the purchaser and gives them the opportunity to use their extra capacity.</p><p> Finally, there is a misunderstanding about what demand is.  Demand is not a couple of hundred thousand people who would like to have a house.  That is social demand, not economic demand.</p></speech>

I am trying to turn putative demand into actual financial demand, and that will drive supply.  The financial demand is being driven by giving people the wherewithal to put the deposit together.  I hear anecdotally, although I cannot prove it, that it is beginning to move already.  Planning permission is being sought for extra houses and sites are being opened that were not opened even at the end of the summer, particularly in Dublin.  The problem arises around the country as well.  We will tease it out further when discussing amendments and so forth.  Self-builds in rural areas are a different matter.  People still have the financial problem and they still have to finance the houses, but the triggers for getting the money will have to be modulated differently.  Not everybody who builds a one-off house in rural Ireland hires a contractor.  Many houses in rural areas are built by direct labour.  Direct labour works.  It will apply to those houses as well.</p> <p>  I believe the housing market is correcting.  This year 16,000 houses might be built and next year it will be 20,000.  The target, if one were to flat-line it, is 25,000 per year but obviously we will have to go beyond that to make up for the under-achievement over the last number of years.  The market is correcting.  It is not a desperate case, but I believe this scheme is worth trying.  I am not saying there will not be some dead weight in it.  There is dead weight in most tax schemes, but we try to keep the dead weight to a minimum and hope we get the maximum effect.  I believe we will house many young couples through this.</p> <p>  That is my case and I would like to have the members' support.</p></speech>

I do not wish to rehash the points I made earlier.  First, the Minister should carry out the assessment beforehand.  There is no reason for not carrying it out.  We are now going on a hunch or a feeling and what the CIF is telling us.  That is not good enough.  Second, I accept that the Minister must take risks and see how things work, but this is a risk without any analysis carried out.  The evidence points to the fact that there will be house price increases as a result of this.  That is definitely not the scenario we wish to have.  We must try to suppress house prices increasing  A number of years ago, somebody in a very senior position in a body responsible for the sale of houses - auctioneers or a body of that nature - appeared before the finance committee and told us that once many of the residual properties were sold we would begin to see an increase in house prices.  The point made to the committee was that it was possible to purchase houses on the market for prices that would not cover the cost of building them.  We all knew where they were.  Apartments were being sold for &euro;50,000.  People were in serious distress, the banks took ownership and the properties were sold.  The point is that once that started to disappear we were told house prices would start to increase, and that is what happened.  House prices have increased incrementally over the last number of months.</p> <p>  When representatives of the Central Bank under the previous Governor appeared before the finance committee and, indeed, in the written documentation provided to the committee, on the need to introduce the macroprudential rules, one of their arguments was that if house prices were not curtailed they would be out of reach and people would be forced to borrow substantial amounts of money.  One of the reasons for the introduction of those rules was to try to suppress house prices.  I realise the Minister knows all of this, but I say it to make the argument that the acceptance that this scheme may lead to house price increases and that this is somehow acceptable is simply not good enough.</p> <p>  I refer the Minister to the statistics.  In the period since last March there has been an increase in the number of mortgage draw-downs or people applying for mortgages from the financial institutions.  Young couples are looking at the prices and wondering when is the right time to get into the market.  They were seeing the prices continue to drop but now they are starting to increase, so they decide they must get on the ladder and get into the market now.  That is what is happening.  There is a build-up in the number of people who want to purchase houses and that is starting to move at present.</p> <p>  My concern, aside from the fact that this will lead to price increases and is targeted at the wrong end of the spectrum, is that the statistics from Banking and Payments Federation Ireland show that in September 2016 there were 1,605 first-time buyer mortgages approved by the institutions.  The total number of mortgages approved that month was 3,399.  It was the same the previous month and similar in the preceding month.  There is a steady pattern.  The number has been increasing incrementally each month but the figure is generally approximately 3,400 mortgages approved, with 1,600 of them for first-time buyers.  Let us say that all of those first-time buyers bought new properties, which means they would all be eligible for this scheme, and that they bought the new properties for &euro;400,000.  That would mean the 1,605 first-time buyers whose mortgages are approved every month can get a tax rebate up to a maximum of &euro;20,000.  Do the sums.  That would cost the State &euro;32.1 million per month.  Extending that over the year, it would cost the State &euro;385 million.  That is the potential amount of money.  The Minister has given us his estimate of what it will cost but if not one additional person was to draw down a mortgage and if the current trend was maintained over a period of years, first-time buyer approvals in a calendar year would be 19,260 mortgages.</p><p>The reason I am pointing that out is to show that there is demand there.  The figures do not lie.</p></speech>

I am talking about the demand that is out there.  I have stripped away first-time buyers.  If we look at the overall number of mortgages that are being approved every month, it is 3,400.  That is about 40,788 per year.  In terms of first-time buyers, there will be about 19,000 mortgage approvals if the current trend stays static.  Without this idea the Minister has, there would be a total of about 19,000 approvals.</p></speech>

Some of the other 20,000 people, who are movers and second-time buyers, will buy new homes as well.  The point I am making is that when there are 40,000 approvals of mortgages and we are building 16,000 houses or 20,000 houses next year, the problem is not in demand, it is in supply.  I do not know what I need to do to convince the Minister that this is the problem.  The Minister makes the argument that the issue is that people cannot get mortgages, or the deposit together for a mortgage, despite the fact that the Central Bank has told the Minister that the average loan-to-value ratio is less than what the Central Bank has said is required to meet its rules.  The average loan-to-value is below 80%.  The Central Bank's rules are all above 80%.  I appreciate the difficulties as I know individuals who have to save.  It is very difficult to get that deposit together.  However, the problem is that the Minister is using a very blunt instrument which is targeting a large cohort of people.  In the morning, those 19,000 first-time buyers could potentially decide to buy new houses.  If they buy new houses and if they cost &euro;400,000 each, the Minister will have to write a cheque to them to the value of &euro;385 million per year.  That is what he is saying.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that there are 1,605 first-time buyers getting mortgage approvals every single month.  I made the point earlier on that they are not buying new homes.  The reality is that they are buying second-hand homes.  The Central Bank provided figures from last year that showed that first-time buyers only bought 756 homes.  I know that.  However, the Minister is now introducing an incentive for them to buy new homes.  The point I am making is that if those 19,000 decide to follow the Minister's lead, the cost to the State will be &euro;385 million.  Outside the cost to the State of this, the Banking and Payments Federation are telling us is that there are 3,400 individuals getting mortgage approval every single month and 1,600 of them are first-time buyers.  That blows a massive hole in the Minister's argument that the people out there do not have a capacity to get a mortgage.  They do have that capacity and the number of mortgages that are being approved is in excess of the stock that is available to buy.</p> <p>  I will finish on this.  The Minister asked me why there are not any new houses being built.  The reason is because of the trend that house prices will continue to rise.  Developers are waiting.  Whether there is an argument of legitimacy here or not, developers are waiting for house prices to rise further in order that their profit margins increase.  We have heard this from the likes of NAMA, for example, which told us that it is only now appropriate for it to start building because house prices have risen to a certain level.  Developers are waiting for house prices to rise in order that it becomes profitable enough for them to start building.  That is the argument I put to the Minister.  Let us look at the issue from the other side of it, in terms of the cost of building a house.  It is a recommendation that came from the housing committee that the Government has not acted upon.  It was universally agreed by all political parties that the Minister should bring forward a report on the cost of building a house in this State.  The figures out there are different.  There are different figures from the housing associations, the Housing Agency, Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and all the rest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1230" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016110900002#EEE02800"><p>The Minister has put forward a very reasonable argument.  I agree with some of it and disagree with some of it.  That is fine.  I believe it is reasonable, I just disagree with the price aspect of it.  The Minister's position is clearly a well-considered position and an intervention targeted at a group that is trapped.  They are trapped by the 3.5% household income ratio that might allow them to buy a house, but nobody who is paying &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,500 in rent every month is able to save &euro;20,000 to &euro;40,000.  This is a targeted intervention to help those people.  I will repeat the last question I asked the Minister.  Would he consider an amendment on Report Stage applying exactly the same logic to the negative equity generation?  Everything I heard him say applies to that generation as well.  This is a group who have already paid a huge amount of property tax.  They have all paid the high stamp duties, the property tax and the second home tax, if they were renting and renting and so forth.  They are trapped in the same way the Minister described first-time buyers as being trapped.  Essentially, they are trapped by a new Central Bank rule.  It is a work-around or a policy intervention to deal with what is hopefully an unintended consequence of the deposit rule of the Central Bank.</p> <p>  I will give three examples I have dealt with this weekend.  One family has left the country.  They have moved to the Middle East to try to earn some money tax free and save, not even for a deposit, but to try to pay down some of the negative equity, and maybe in time, to own a house.  The second couple have two young boys.  They are renting and renting.  They bought a one-bedroom apartment and have now moved out of it.  They are in a two-bedroom semi-detached house with two children.  They are trapped because they are paying &euro;1,500 per month or whatever is the inflated rent.  They are also paying the second-highest child care costs in the world.  They both work very hard and they are trapped for exactly the reason the Minister said the first-time buyers are trapped.  They are never going to be able to save up &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 in order to buy a home.  They are trapped.  These are all couples I have met in the past few days.  The third couple bought a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Dublin.  They also have two children.  They cannot move out because they have calculated that they would be taxed on the rental income on the apartment in Dublin were they to move out to Wicklow and rent a two-bedroom house.  Their tax bill would go up by about &euro;5,000.  They had a choice.  They could either do it and hope that they never get caught by Revenue or not do it and be tax compliant.  That is what they have decided to do.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to consider for Report Stage that if an individual or a couple can prove that they are in negative equity or at zero equity, which is relatively easy to prove, they may also avail of the scheme.  The Minister was talking about people who are trying to buy a home, cannot save the deposit but do qualify on the income multiple.</p><p>If the Minister wants to apply this as a targeted intervention, I ask him to do it for those people who are equally trapped, or in most cases more trapped, than the first-time buyers he is trying to help.</p></speech>

By definition, anybody in negative equity has a new house or apartment already.  The Deputy is asking me to use the scheme for the purchasers of second homes.  I do not think this is the scheme for that, although I appreciate the problem the Deputy has identified.  We have had some discussions with the Central Bank about this and it has changed the prudential rules.  In the context of financial regulations the Central Bank has a prudential and consumer protection remit through the provision of new lending to borrowers in negative equity.  The programme for Government included a commitment to support the Central Bank's regulation of negative equity mortgage products that allow home owners to move house while still in negative equity.  In practice, the Central Bank has removed some of the conditions from the prudential rules for persons in negative equity to allow them to borrow in excess of the guidelines.  It is in that space that assistance can be given to persons in negative equity to allow them to purchase.  We can discuss that further but the Central Bank has taken the first steps to doing it.  It might be a better avenue than trying to adapt this particular scheme, which is for first-time buyers of new homes, to second-time buyers who have negative equity difficulties, which they undoubtedly have.</p></speech>

The multiple is a major problem for people.  The Minister said that in some cases parents and family members were helping people with their deposits.  They get over the deposit hurdle but then run into another hurdle and there is no way around the ratios that are applied there.  There are two major hurdles.</p></speech>

I would have thought there was a huge problem with effective demand, not just in the ability to gather together a deposit but with regard to the multiples.  The evidence for this was very apparent to me when I went to the teachers' protest.  It would be the same on the nurses' protest.  Their income is not enough for them to even dream of buying a house or renting.  A person came to me the other day who is a tenured lecturer in a university.  The person broke down in front of me because she believes she may be homeless in a couple of months.  She has children but is separated.  She lives on a tenured university salary in south Dublin but rents are more than half her net salary.  It is unsustainable but she will not be able to afford to buy on the Cherrywood development either.  She cannot afford the rents and will not be able to buy unless prices, either for renting or buying, are brought significantly down.  I do not see how anything the Minister is talking about will achieve that.  A hard lid is being kept on salaries and incomes and any increases are not much against a background in which rents and property prices are going through the roof.  All the signs are that this measure is actually already putting up prices further.  Unless we get prices to affordable levels by controlling prices and controlling rents I do not see how this problem is going to be solved.</p> <p>  Cherrywood could help solve the problem in south Dublin because it is a big site with capacity for 11,000 homes.  However, if the vulture fund dictates the prices of most of the properties, and maybe even the 10% to which reference was made, which it will probably lease back to the local authority rather than the authority or an approved housing body taking ownership of it, it will control the speed at which it is all built.  It will decide whether a property is for purchase or for rent and will do so on the basis of whatever gives the best price for it.  I do not see how it helps.  It may make the situation worse but it certainly will not address the problem of the woman who came to see me.  I was shocked in that if this could happen to somebody on &euro;70,000 a year, what is the situation for others?  In fact, I know what it is because such people walk through the door of my clinic every single week.  It is totally impossible for them.  Anybody who finds themselves without accommodation in the greater D&uacute;n Laoghaire-south Dublin area are in the housing crisis.  They are in an emergency situation.</p> <p>  One does not have to be a radical to see things this way.  In the 1970s there was the Kenny report, which concluded that we had to control all building land.  We had to control prices and supply or we would not meet social need and social demand.  Is that not now obviously the case?  If the 10% that has been set aside in the Cherrywood development was 50%, would that not bring down the price of rents and so on?  Would it not be even better if it was 100%?  We would then control the prices.  What guarantee can the Minister give that the vulture fund to which he sold the stuff will not just charge whatever it likes and price most people out of the market?  I do not think the Minister can give any such guarantee.  We have recent experience of this because, before 2008 when there was a large amount of supply, prices were unaffordable and the only way people could afford a house was to take out an unsustainable loan.  The only way to resolve the problem of people not having enough income to pay inflated prices is to borrow money, and we know how dangerous that is.  People would be borrowing money they could not afford to pay back.</p></speech>

The point I make is the other portion of the 1,600 getting mortgage approvals who are buying second-hand homes.  We can accept that.  The Minister has introduced a &euro;20,000 tax incentive, which is an enticement to purchase new builds.  It is what the measure is aimed at, thus increasing supply at that end.  The point I make is that if a significant cohort follow that direction, or if all of them did so, it would cost the State &euro;385 million per year.  I am not suggesting they will all buy new builds but there is now an incentive of &euro;20,000 for that.</p> <p>  The figures referred to by the Minister indicate the value is in the second property market.  We all know that and I mentioned earlier that although I do not know the date of the figures stated by the Minister, one can see with mortgage approvals and drawdowns that from March this year, there has been a significant increase in those numbers.  The value may no longer be in the second home market but rather the new property market because of this incentive.  How did the Department arrive at the figure of &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million, given that if the number of first-time buyers getting mortgage approval bought new houses in one month, it would cost &euro;32 million if they were valued at &euro;400,000 each?</p></speech>

Taking the sentence I read to the Deputy, the current trend of first-time buyers buying new houses is approximately 150 per month.  I regard that as dead weight on the scheme as they are buying them anyway.  That does not have an impact on the scheme being designed to drive supply.  In that case we are looking, effectively, at no or very few new houses being built in the category we are aiming at, which is starter homes.  We look at planning permission and the capacity of the industry, along with what is likely to happen, and the Revenue Commissioners have come up with a figure.  The backdating to 19 July will cost &euro;10 million and going forward from the date of implementation in the budget, the cost will be &euro;40 million for the remainder of the year.  I would regard it as a great success if it goes beyond that.  This is to drive supply so unless the take-up-----</p></speech>

When the Central Bank introduced the macroprudential rules, it is indicated in the question-and-answer document it released to the public that one of the reasons for the introduction of the rules, including the loan-to-value ratio, was that it wanted to ensure we did not have a spiral in house prices.  There are only two rules dealing with loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios.

The first purpose of the macroprudential rules introduced by the Central Bank was to ensure that individuals did not repeat the cycle and get into unaffordable debt by incurring mortgages they could not service.  Part of this was the idea that people are more likely to take on mortgages they cannot afford if house prices increase beyond the capacity to service the mortgage that would buy such houses.  That is where price enters into it.  It was not the primary purpose of the rules.</p> <p>  This scheme does not run against or circumvent the macroprudential rules but rather it assists them.  If somebody can get assistance with the deposit, they would not do what many young couples are doing, which is saving half the deposit and trying to borrow the other half from the credit union or another source.  It reduces the amount of indebtedness of couples who are putting a deposit together in some circumstances.  As a consequence, it makes their mortgages more affordable and they are less likely to get into subsequent trouble.  The Central Bank realises this and that is why I did not have a difficulty with the Governor of the Central Bank in agreeing that this was a good scheme for putting a deposit together.  It helps the rules rather than running counter to them.</p></speech>

The amendment introduces two important changes to the definition of &quot;qualifying residence&quot;.  The first change will ensure that the conversion of buildings which were not previously used as a dwelling will be accommodated under the help-to-buy scheme.  Such new living accommodation would constitute additional supply, in a similar manner to the more traditional new builds envisaged for the scheme.  For example, it is not uncommon for older industrial buildings such as warehouses to be converted into apartments and the legislation, as published, would not have permitted such conversions to qualify for the help-to-buy scheme.</p><p>The second change within the definition of &quot;qualifying residence&quot; is in response to calls to reduce the upper price or value threshold that can qualify for tax relief under the scheme.  Having listened carefully to the comments of my parliamentary colleagues on the scheme, I am proposing a change such that, from 1 January 2017, the upper limit for the purposes of the scheme will be reduced to &euro;500,000.  Given the legitimate expectations of those who may have made purchasing decisions or entered into commitments to self-build following the announcement of the scheme in the budget, I propose to allow the original cap of &euro;600,000, as announced, to remain applicable in respect of relevant qualifying homes up to 31 December 2016. </p><p>I will explain the reasons I do not propose to reduce the upper limit for qualifying under the scheme from &euro;600,000 to &euro;400,000.  If I were to reduce the cap to &euro;400,000, a person who bought a house for &euro;400,000 would receive &euro;20,000, whereas a person who bought a house for &euro;410,000 would not receive any benefit under the scheme.  This would create a cliff effect above the &euro;400,000 cap.  It was necessary, therefore, to have some margin in place above &euro;400,000 to make the scheme operable.  One can argue about how far would one go in this respect. </p><p>A second issue also arises.  When grants applied and a limit was imposed on the price of houses to which a grant applied, a lump of money was paid under the table when the limit was exceeded.  If a cut-off point is applied close to the figure of &euro;400,000, people would make up the difference in cash and the real price of the house could be &euro;500,000.  This would incentivise a black economy in house prices.  Nobody will receive 10% of &euro;500,000.  Instead, a person paying &euro;500,000 for a house will receive 10% of &euro;400,000, provided the price paid for the house is less than &euro;500,000.  I took advice on this matter from colleagues more than from anybody in the trade.  Many of my colleagues believed that a &euro;600,000 ceiling was too high.  That is fair enough and we have proposed to reduce it to &euro;600,000.  Nevertheless, where people have entered into commitments under the understanding that the ceiling would be &euro;600,000, this must be honoured.  As a result, I am proposing that the change to &euro;500,000 will take effect on 1 January next. </p></speech>

These rules were introduced to try to suppress house prices, which is one of the Central Bank's objectives.</p></speech>

Beyond the price issue, a consequence of this was that if prices increased too much, the risk of not being able to service the mortgage also increased.</p></speech>

It refers to the emergence of a credit fuelled property bubble, trying to control house prices, etc.  This is clearly spelled out.  Suppressing house prices was not a consequence of the rules but one of their objectives.</p> <p>  On the amendment, this change is obviously an example of new politics.  The Fine Gael Party wanted a ceiling of &euro;600,000, Fianna F&aacute;il wanted it set at &euro;400,000 and a figure of &euro;500,000 has emerged in the Bill.  I note Deputy Michael McGrath acknowledged that this was the wrong proposal.  It is important to place on record that the only proposal from Fianna F&aacute;il, other than its call for an independent review, was to widen the scheme.</p> <p>  On the new &euro;500,000 limit provided for in the amendment, an individual who purchases a house in Dublin or elsewhere at a cost of &euro;500,000 would be required under the macro-prudential rules on loan-to-value ratio to have a deposit of &euro;78,000.  However, because the scheme permits a loan-to-value ratio of 70%, the purchaser will already have a deposit of &euro;150,000 in his or her back pocket or bank account.  If somebody has already acquired twice what is required under the macro-prudential rules and has been able to save &euro;158,000, from whatever source, why should citizens provide him or her with a tax rebate of &euro;20,000 to buy a property worth &euro;500,000?</p></speech>

I have explained the reason the cut-off point could not be pitched at &euro;400,000.  Given current house prices in Dublin, &euro;400,000 was a reasonable point at which to draw the line and there had to be some headroom allowed above this threshold to avoid a cliff effect and a black economy effect.  That is the reason.</p></speech>

While I agree with his point on the black economy, one could argue that the scheme will encourage a black economy in certain areas where property prices exceed the new threshold.  One could also argue that people are being incentivised to borrow more money.  The key issue is that the ostensible purpose of the scheme is to increase the supply of starter homes.  The Minister referred earlier to three-bedroom semi-detached starter homes costing &euro;300,000.  Now, in trying to justify his arrangement with Fianna F&aacute;il, he is stating that starter homes in Dublin cost &euro;500,000.</p></speech>

What the Minister is doing in legislation is basically setting a ceiling for starter home prices across the State by allowing people to benefit by up to &euro;20,000 when buying a property costing below the ceiling.  This means prices can rise to the level of the ceiling, which is wrong because it will encourage a faster rate of increase in house prices.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il supports the amendment, which is an improvement on the current position.  The property market in Dublin is crazy, with people buying homes of less than 1,500 sq. ft. at prices of up to &euro;500,000, or higher in some cases depending on location.  The position is different in Cork, Donegal and other areas outside Dublin but that is the reality of the market in the capital.  For this reason, the focus must be on affordability issues and supply.  We have tabled an amendment to address the cost of new homes.  Deputy Doherty is correct that the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government made a recommendation on that issue, which I will discuss when we reach the relevant amendment.</p> <p>  On the suggestion that we are seeking to expand the scheme, unfortunately the two key amendments we have tabled on the scheme have been ruled out order, although I intend to discuss them when we debate the section.  These amendments relate to what I regard as an inherent unfairness, depending on when a contract is signed and a mortgage drawn down.</p><p>Deputy Doherty can characterise that as expanding the scheme, but I suggest that bringing the cap down to a lower level is restricting the scheme.  It is not being restricted as far as the Deputy would like, but I argue that the proposals relating to the contract issue and the drawdown of mortgages are quite specific and would cover a relatively small number of cases.  I will address them when I talk about the section.</p></speech>

As a result of this amendment, claimants will be allowed choose any or all of the tax years within the four tax years immediately preceding the year in which they make their application.  Some people may have paid sufficient tax in one year or two years to qualify for the rebate.  Rather than having to make the case for the four tax years, if that is not necessary, they can make it for one year, two years, three years or four years.</p></speech>

I understand the Government has a plan to entice 70,000 of them to return home.  Given that they might not have a tax liability in the four years prior to their purchase of a new home, are any amending provisions being made to accommodate them?</p></speech>

If they have already used their tax credits for the four-year period in question, will an additional use of that tax credit be available - a double usage, in effect?</p></speech>

I would argue that it is a substantive change, regardless of whether that is what was originally intended.  The existing section within the legislation would mean that this would only apply in the case of a contractor who was proposing to build new-builds and thereby increase supply.  This amendment will change that by including a reference to proposals to offer existing stock "for sale".  Existing housing will now come under the remit of this section and will therefore be deemed as qualifying premises or residences for tax rebate purposes.  If the Government was not proposing this significant change, qualifying persons would be able to get tax rebates in respect of newly-constructed houses or apartments only.</p></speech>

As currently framed, all claimants would be required to submit a tax return and pay any income tax and USC payable in respect of each of the four preceding tax years, if they have not already done so.  However, given that taxpayers whose income is solely taxed under PAYE are not obliged to make an annual tax return, unless required to do so by the Revenue Commissioners, I am amending the obligation on PAYE taxpayers so that they will not necessarily be required to submit a tax return for each of the four tax years preceding their application.  Under these amendments, they will be required to submit a return only for the tax year or years which they consider necessary to allow them to maximise their rebate.  For example, if a PAYE first-time buyer is satisfied he or she has paid sufficient tax in 2016 to get the maximum rebate of &euro;20,000, he or she would be required to make a tax return only for 2016.</p><p>If another PAYE first-time buyer is satisfied that he or she has paid sufficient tax in 2014 and 2016 to get the maximum rebate of &euro;20,000, he or she only needs to make a tax return for those years.

It should assess whether the objectives on the supply of new homes as set out by the Minister are being met, what impact the scheme is having on new and second-hand house prices and what impact the scheme is having generally on the residential property market.  I opted for the end of September 2017 because the suggestion of a tax rebate scheme was first mooted this summer, was formally announced in the October budget, has influenced activity in recent weeks, if not recent months, and will be enacted in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Under it, this section would not have commenced until such a study had been undertaken.  Deputy McGrath's proposal is better than nothing, but it is not for us to say that we should just give this a go and introduce a tax rebate despite the fact that many of us believe it will increase house prices and most observers who have appeared before committees or made public utterances on it claim that it will increase house prices and will not address the real need.  A period of 11 or 12 months in which to carry out an independent impact assessment is not required.  Rather, that assessment should be done before this section takes effect.  Deputy McGrath rightly stated that this should have been done already.  I made the same comment earlier.  The assessment should have been undertaken in the time between the scheme's announcement by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in July and the announcement of its details on budget day.  If we believe that such an independent assessment could have been done within that period, the date should not be 11 months later after damage could have already been done in terms of house prices.</p><p>I very much suggest that if the independent impact assessment suggests it is having little effect on supply outside what would have normally happened in the market but has led to an increase in house prices, even if the tap were to be turned off at that point, house prices would not come down.  This should not happen.  We should not wait for an independent assessment to be carried out until 30 December 2017.  It should be carried out by the Department and concluded within a number of weeks.  It should not take officials in the Department 11 months to carry out an independent assessment.</p><p> We should learn the lessons of the past in introducing tax rebate schemes or other property schemes.  We have learned a very hard lesson.  To state we will see how this goes and that in 12 months time we will have a report telling us whether it has worked is not good enough.  Will the Minister address the reason the assessment could not be made prior to the end of the year?  If the result of the independent evaluation is that it is worth the risk, obviously the scheme should be reviewed, as any scheme would be, after one year when there would be more data available.  The assessment that should have been made prior to the scheme being announced needs to be carried out now and the outcome published before the end of the year.</p></speech>

When we look at the cranes on the Dublin skyline, we can see that the commercial property construction and development market has been restored to reasonable health in the past two years or so, but, as we all agree, the residential property construction and development market is still very fragile.  It is well short of supplying the needs of citizens.  If I were to accept Deputy Pearse Doherty's proposal, I would stop property development stone dead from this evening and nothing would be built until we received the report.  I am not prepared to do that.  The property construction and development markets are moving along and being repaired.  More houses will be built this year than last year and there will be significantly more built next year.  I hope the scheme we are discussing will contribute to the construction of extra new homes for first-time buyers.  I am not prepared to introduce an evaluation now which would stop all activity.</p></speech>

I can understand the reason the Minister's arguments for not agreeing to it, but what I do not understand because he did not respond to the question I put to him directly is what is preventing his officials from carrying out the type of assessment sought in a number of months instead of having to wait a year.  If the assessment turns up the scenario that it was a terrible idea and has been counterproductive, we will have to turn off the tap in the next budget.  The Minister is convinced that it is not a bad idea, but if it is, as legislators, we should have as quickly as possible the type of assessment that should have been carried out prior to the scheme being announced in order that we will be able to introduce an amendment to the Finance Bill to turn off the tap.  What is to prevent this from being done in the next three months instead of the next 11?</p></speech>

Houses are not constructed in three months.  The scheme has been designed to increase the supply of new houses and we must give it at least 12 months to see whether it has had an effect.</p></speech>

Therefore, the argument does not stack up.  That is one of the big problems with the scheme in the first place.  Obtaining planning permission for development takes a number of years, more than likely two years on average.  The Minister has announced a scheme that will last for three years, but the reality is that it will have little impact on new builds because by the time developers who turn around today and state they agree with the Minister that there will be more demand and that, therefore, more houses should be built obtain planning permission and finance and begin construction the tax rebate period will have exppired.  My view is that while the Minister has inserted a three year end date, the scheme will not end in three years.  That is the reality.  What is the last tax rebate scheme that ended when it was supposed to end?</p></speech>

It sought a report on the cost of delivering a new home in Ireland and the options available to reduce the cost without compromising the quality of a home.  The Minister may argue that it is not a matter for the Department, but I seek a commitment that the issue will be tackled.  If he looks at the report of the all-party housing committee, he will see that it sought to have the Housing Agency carry out an annual audit of private construction costs and compare them to costs in other jurisdictions, with a view to making recommendations to the Government aimed at making private houses more affordable.  In making its recommendations the agency would look at the cost of construction, the cost of financing, development levies, the cost of compliance, levels of VAT and other issues that might be deemed relevant in reducing the cost of housing.</p><p>In the <i>daft.ie</i>quarter three report on rents released yesterday Mr. Ronan Lyons makes the point which he has made consistently that there is no more urgent task facing the Minister with responsibility for housing, his Department and advisers, the Housing Agency and others involved in Rebuilding Ireland than understanding the reasons the cost of building, apartments in particular, is so dramatically out of line with incomes and the cost in other countries.  I would like the Minister to respond to this point and put some process in place whereby we could make a detailed analysis of all of the inputs in the cost of delivering new homes in Ireland, whether they be construction costs, levies, VAT and taxation levels generally.</p><p>The next issue I want to raise concerns the block of amendments which have been ruled out of order dealing with the cut-off dates that apply to eligibility for the scheme.  In the case of self-builds, if any element of the mortgage was drawn down before 19 July, the prospective buyer or the person building the home will not be able to benefit from the scheme.  This is very unfair, particularly in view of the change we have just made to ensure completed housing stock in housing estates will be eligible for a tax rebate for the purchaser.  With regard to non-self-builds, the Bill states people buying homes in housing estates must have entered into a contract after 19 July.</p><p>People who enter into the contract before that date but do not draw down the mortgage until afterwards should be accommodated.  We are talking about a small number of transactions.</p></speech>

While I have no doubt that such a report would be of interest, I would suggest that this is an overly simplistic approach to the complex issue of why construction has slowed.</p> <p>  A report by the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland highlighted that the cost to build a house is approximately half the overall cost of providing a house.  This report highlights that non-construction factors, such as the cost of acquisition and development finance, design, sales and marketing, margin, including profit, and elements such as levies and VAT, are all important elements influencing the economic and sustainable cost of a new house.</p> <p>  Officials in my Department previously looked at this issue, and highlighted that issues affecting the profitability of construction include a wide range of factors and cost elements, including labour costs, taxes, development contributions, building regulations, land price and financing costs.  These considerations fed into the Government response to this matter, namely, the number of measures and actions being taken to lead to a fully functioning housing market that responds adequately to the needs of our citizens.  These are included in Rebuilding Ireland - The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which was launched last July.  Implementation of the plan is being led by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, with cross-departmental support.</p> <p>  This comprehensive action plan takes a holistic approach to addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the action plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p> <p>  I do not consider the completion of such a report, as sought by the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment as being appropriate for inclusion in the Finance Bill, as the matter is in the first instance more appropriate to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  There is, however, merit in the amendment and I would be prepared to raise the issue with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Quite frankly, my Department would not have the capacity to do this alone because it would not have access to the information.</p></speech>

Given the significance of this public policy issue there should be a State-commissioned analysis of the cost of delivering new homes.  The amendment was ruled out of order but I will consider another way of raising it on Report Stage.  In the meantime, could the Minister take up the issue with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and secure agreement that such a report would be prepared and come back to the committee?</p></speech>

The amendments would mean that the tax relief would only become available when a mortgage was drawn down or in the case of a self-build, when the last tranche of the relevant mortgage is drawn down.  They would basically have the effect of altering the timing at which the rebate would be paid.  This issue was raised by the Deputy in his contribution to the Second Stage debate.</p> <p>  The principal aim of the help to buy scheme is to help first-time buyers with obtaining the deposit required under the Central Bank&rsquo;s macroprudential rules and if these amendments were to be accepted, they would change the whole purpose of the scheme.  It would no longer be of any assistance to individuals in obtaining a mortgage but would instead provide a tax rebate after a mortgage has been sourced, drawn down and the home purchase, or self-build, was effectively completed.</p> <p>  If I were to accept these amendments, the scheme would not help those struggling to meet the deposit requirements of the macroprudential rules and thus might never be in a position to draw down a resulting mortgage.  Consequently, these changes would do little to help individuals obtain a mortgage, especially where they are renting and finding it difficult to save the required deposit.  It would also focus the relief entirely on those who are already in a position to obtain a mortgage and are therefore not in need of the assistance of the Exchequer.</p> <p>  The changes proposed would also result in the scheme bringing in a large amount of deadweight and retrospectivity, by providing relief to those who were in a position to put down a deposit before 19 July, as well as to those who have been building a house, possibly for several years, long before the help to buy scheme was considered.</p> <p>  The amended scheme therefore would not have the desired supply effect, as it would no longer have the result which was noted by the Central Bank, namely, that developers who had been struggling to raise funds to build houses would be better able to do so, as many first-time buyers who want to buy new starter homes would be in a better position to place deposits and obtain approval for mortgages.  It should be highlighted that several banks currently offer cash back, which consists of a percentage of the mortgage which is received when a mortgage is drawn down.  If these changes were accepted, they would effectively provide a rebate from two sources at that time, while still providing no support for individuals to obtain a deposit in the first place.  For all these reasons I cannot accept the amendments proposed.</p></speech>

That is unfair.  In respect of a housing estate house if people have signed a contract prior to 19 July but the house has not been started and it could be another 12 months before it is delivered, they will not be eligible to benefit from that scheme.  I understand that with any new scheme there will be a cut off point and there will be winners and losers on either side of that but the fact that the Minister is accommodating houses completed before 19 July but not those who are building their own house or have bought a house that has not yet been built, is unfair.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath referred specifically to the cost in the private sector but I think we need to know the cost of the State building housing too.  I have tabled several parliamentary questions on this in recent years and the figures I get vary significantly.  We need to compare the costs of public sector and private sector building to either further delineate the different types of housing that could be built and by whom they might be built.</p><p>We should examine the relative cost of housing units built by direct labour by the State as against public housing built by contractors brought in to deliver it.  The Minister referred to profit-taking, marketing is another cost to which he referred, and there are other costs which add to the cost of building, which we would not have if housing units were built by direct labour.  Obviously, the cost of land is an issue.  Any study needs to examine that and also co-operative housing, of which there are various schemes in development.  A good scheme has been proposed in my area where there is a plan to build four high specification, environmentally advanced houses, the projected cost of which is &euro;360,000 for four houses.</p></speech>

It is not difficult to establish the price of a social housing unit built by local authorities.  It is a matter of simply taking the final settled contract price and dividing the number of units into it, but a local authority usually builds on its own land and quite often it is land it has held historically.  The actual cost of building is simply the unit cost divided into the contractual price.  On the private sector side, we are not quite sure what is happening there at times.  I can see the validity in the Deputy Michael McGrath's proposal.</p></speech>

That was one of the factors that fed into the former Minister, Noel Dempsey's decision around 2004 to move from local authorities building social housing to providing money to local authorities to purchase houses in private housing estates.  There were also social integration issues involved, which I always thought was a pretty good idea.  The costs of council built houses were dearer right across the local authorities than the cost of private houses.</p></speech>

God help the many people who were forced to buy properties in many of the developments built during the Celtic tiger period because many of the properties that were built were not up to standard and were not overseen in the way that they should have been.  We know of the consequences of that in some of the bigger developments.  The same was the case in many smaller developments.  Many apartments and houses in Dublin were built with breeze blocks.  It is unbelievable that was allowed under the regulations.  That would not be in the case in local authorities where standards were different.  I acknowledge this is a matter for the Minister with responsibility for housing.  However, he has rejected the suggestion put forward in the Deputy McGrath's amendment to carry out such a study.  That recommendation was made by the all-party Committee on Housing and the Homelessness but it has not been actioned and it should be.  </p> <p>  In the context of a review of this scheme, we should have that information when we examine the overall data on how much it costs to build a private house in certain areas in this State.  The issue Deputy Boyd Barrett raised should be added to that.  It is not a question of how much it costs to build a social housing unit or scheme.  The real question is the net cost of that to the State.  It may cost a developer &euro;220,000 to build a house but with money going out on the one hand and coming in on the other, what would be the real cost for the State to build a social housing unit across the road today?  The labour costs may be &euro;50,000 but &euro;20,000 of that would come back to the State through income tax.  The materials may cost another &euro;40,000 but that can be reclaimed in VAT.  The net cost of building a social housing unit in the State has never been provided and that should be considered.  I will move on from that issue because it is not the Minister's area of responsibility but at Cabinet there is a requirement to try to influence the Minister with responsibility for housing to make sure that this type of all-party recommendation is executed as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  On the section, with which financial institutions did the Minister engage when he consulted on the help to buy scheme?  Will he explain to the committee the nature of those consultations, who he met and the response to them?  Was it the Minister or his officials who engaged in that process and how were they chosen?</p></speech>

We were inquiring as to how mortgages operated in practice and how this could fit into their practice of lending as part of the deposit in accordance with the prudential requirements of the Central Bank.  Again, the advice of the Central Bank to move the mortgage threshold from 80% down to 70% was to widen it.  The arguments used were that the Central Bank did not want to incentivise unnecessary borrowing on behalf of borrowers because it formed the opinion that if it was left at 80% people who did not require that level of mortgage would borrow at that level of mortgage simply to avail of the tax rebate.  Since the average was lower, 70% was more appropriate, but it has the effect, as the Deputy said, of widening the scheme, not of narrowing it.</p></speech>

The Central Bank's rules on the loan-to-value ratio are such that, even if one were purchasing a house worth &euro;1 million, one would need a deposit of less than 20% of the value.  When the Minister decides to reduce the percentage to 70%, it means people who did not have a problem meeting the rules are now able to get the tax rebate.  Was it the Central Bank that suggested 70%?  How was that arrived at by the Department or Minister?</p></speech>

The figure for the average mortgage was 78.7%.  The argument was presented to me that it would incentivise unnecessary borrowing and that it was in the pruential interest to keep the level of mortgages, as a percentage, down.</p></speech>

The Governor of the Central Bank rightly pointed out to the Minister that the average mortgage drawdown in this State was below the 80%, which means it was possible to have a deposit in excess of what the Central Bank required in terms of averages, and that the Minister was effectively requiring one to borrow more to reach the figure of 80% in order to qualify for the &euro;20,000 tax rebate.</p></speech>

I would like the committee members to consider a report within a reasonable timeframe to see what is happening in terms of building.  The second part of the previous discussion was concerned with costs.  In the work of the committee, this could be shared jointly with the finance committee.  However, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight had the services of DKM, which had access to the different Departments.</p><p>The Minister has made a reasonable point that much of the information on housing costs and so on that we are discussing is really located in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government rather than being held in any great detail in the Department of Finance.  If, by Report Stage, we had worked out a framework in which to conduct this study, it could be an important contribution.</p><p>I looked at some websites detailing house prices in parts of Dublin.  In Castleknock there are three-bedroom houses priced at &euro;500,000.  They are very insulated.  In some cases four-bedroom houses are selling at &euro;620,000.  On the western side of Dublin 15 there is a large area of land which is a special development zone.  It has had planning permission for long period of time and has scope for 3,000 homes, which is the equivalent of two small new towns or villages.</p><p>There is a critical issue that relates to the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform which may be relevant to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  While the previous Government gave a capital allocation to effectively allow for the development of the necessary infrastructure such as roads and so on before the sites could be developed, the funding made available to Fingal is nowhere near enough to provide for all the possible developments that could happen, which are ready to go and are beside existing developed areas.  Carrickmines could be the same; I do not know the area as well.  This is a real problem.  The Fingal county manager has advised that until there is access into the land and certain key features are developed, we will not get the houses built.</p><p>I know this is not directly the subject of the Finance Bill.  However, if we are trying to get this thing kick-started and follow on from all the very good work the housing committee did, it should be possible to use a group of external consultants and use the Committee on Budgetary Oversight or the finance committee to actually do it.  I make that proposal; the Minister will have to give it some thought.</p><p>I am not sure if I heard the Minister correctly.  I believe he spoke about the strategic investment bank.  Did I hear him suggest that the borrowing rate for the medium-sized developers, I mentioned earlier, was 12%?  Is that given by way of preference loans, equity-type loans, with a lower risk factor?  In the context of where interest rates are at the moment, 12% is very high.  I am very aware that Deputy Michael McGrath has raised that issue on a number of occasions.  If we want builders to build, we also need to address that matter.  A rate of 12% is very high and certainly much higher than comparative rates of interest throughout Europe.</p><p>Various information-gathering studies are necessary.  Doing them and getting genuine comparators on the cost of new homes would be extremely helpful in identifying where we can get stuff to go.</p></speech>

I have been asked to comment on areas on which I have no expertise.</p> <p>  In talking about 10% or 12% I was referring to the equity piece.  The traditional model for a small builder building 70 or 80 houses was bank finance for about 60% to two-thirds, with the rest provided by the builder from the profits from the previous 70 or 80 houses he built and it was rolled over into the next housing estate.  After the collapse, there was no one to provide the equity piece.  The equity piece is being provided again and some of the funds are being provided by the Strategic Investment Fund through the banks.</p> <p>  The rate started out at about 14%, but as I understand it, it is between 10% and 12% now, but that was on the basis of financing 90% of it.  As the sector repairs, the averages for what the small builders require have now gone down to 70% or 75%.  Because the percentage is not so big, the risk has diminished and the interest rate is now going down closer to about 8%.  The Deputy should not tie me hard to any of these numbers; I am giving her indicators.</p> <p>  It would be entirely different with, for example, Cairn in Cherrywood.  It develops the town centres across the United States in big tranches of land and then it develops the facilities, the roads, power lines, gas lines, sewerage, water etc.  Then it sells on to the small builder who might want to build 100 houses, but all the infrastructure is already in place.  It is public quoted and it is getting money at 2%.  The people in west Dublin that the Deputy knows, Cairns, is publicly quoted-----</p></speech>

It can be discussed to develop it further.</p></speech>

However, I have made a commitment to Deputy Michael McGrath that I will commission an independent impact assessment of the help-to-buy scheme with a view to examining the general impact under the headings he has suggested.  That will be done in September 2017.  On that basis he dropped his amendments and is accepting the commitment I made.</p> <p>  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett proposed that there be a more extensive assessment of the cost of building local authority houses and that a comparison be made with the cost of building private houses.  That matter should be referred to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p> <p>  The third proposal is that the committee, together with the budgetary committee, make a combined intervention through a general assessment of further difficulties in housing supply along the lines the suggested by the Deputy.  I would have no objection to this, but it is a matter for the committees to organise their work and for Parliament to organise its work.</p></speech>

Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred to an addendum to the commitment given by the Minister to talk to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government about the State commissioning an analysis of the cost of delivering new houses.  That principally relates to the supply of new private homes, while the Deputy was referring to the public supply of social housing.  There are only two issues involved - they concern the assessment of the impact of the help-to-buy scheme and the cost of delivering homes.  One relates to the Minister's Department, while he has committed to speaking to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government about the other.</p></speech>

I welcome our visitors, the members of the committee and those who are watching the committee's proceedings online.</p><p>During this morning's session, we will examine how we can move towards an integrated model of health and social care.  We have decided to focus in this discussion on two important pillars of community and social care: mental health services and social supports for older people.  To reflect on these themes, we are having two sessions this morning with stakeholders who made submissions to the committee.  Representatives of St. Patrick's mental health services are present to discuss mental health and community services.  We will meet representatives of Mental Health Reform, the Forum on Long-Term Care for Older People and Family Carers Ireland at approximately 11 a.m.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Paul Gilligan, who is the chief executive officer of St. Patrick's mental health services, SPMHS.  He is accompanied by Professor Jim Lucey, who is the medical director of SPMHS, and Mr. Tom Maher, who is the director of services of SPMHS.  This long-standing and well-respected institution has over 700 staff members, who deliver 12% of the country's total inpatient mental health care at two inpatient campuses: St. Patrick's University Hospital in Dublin 8 and St. Edmundsbury Hospital in Lucan.  It offers a range of services for adults with mood disorders, psychosis, addictions, anxiety disorders and eating disorders.  Adolescent mental health services are catered for at the Willow Grove facility on the grounds of St. Patrick's University Hospital.  A wellness and recovery centre offers day service programmes and community clinics in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  There are also some other national services.</p><p>I want to go through the formalities in respect of privilege.  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Gilligan to make the opening presentation.  He is very welcome.</p></speech>

It is committed to providing the highest quality of mental health care, promoting mental health and advocating for the rights of people experiencing mental health difficulties.  In 2015, the service had over 3,000 inpatient admissions, over 14,300 day-care attendances and over 14,600 visits to its Dean clinics.  The organisation runs an extensive advocacy programme, the highlights of which are the Walk in My Shoes and Mind Your Selfie campaigns.  It also runs a comprehensive service user involvement and training and research programme.  We welcome the opportunity to make a submission to the development of the new health strategy.  We would like to thank the Oireachtas committee for the opportunity to make this presentation.  We are eager to work in partnership with the Government and all key stakeholders to form and deliver on a new mental health care strategy.  The prevalence of mental health problems in Ireland is well documented, with one in seven adults experiencing a mental health difficulty in the past year.  Recent studies suggest that young people in Ireland may have a higher rate of mental health problems than similarly aged young people in other countries.</p> <p>  St. Patrick's mental health services believes Ireland should be committed to the establishment of a world-class mental health service.  Such a service should be built on human rights principles, with a core emphasis on service user participation.  In our view, the right to be given the opportunity to live a mentally healthy life should be enshrined in legislation.  Everyone should have access to basic mental health care services as a right.  The exact services to which people should be entitled to access should be set out in law so that it is clear to service providers and service users that legal obligations exist, and that a right of remedy exists where these obligations are not met.  It is essential for any new mental health care strategy to be grounded in a recovery model in which service user empowerment and choice is paramount.  These principles pertain particularly to young people, whose existing constitutional rights to appropriate mental health care need to be recognised and realised.  The funding model for any new strategy needs to be grounded in principles of value, which we define as outcomes per euro spent.  No strategy will be successful unless the existing stigma surrounding mental health within Irish society is acknowledged and tackled.  This cannot be achieved unless all stakeholders work together.</p></speech>

The comparable budget for mental health care as a percentage of overall health spend is 12% in Britain and Canada and 11% in New Zealand.  St. Patrick's mental health services recommends the implementation of the recommendation in A Vision for Change that the mental health budget should represent at least 8.24% of the overall health budget.  The future health strategy must be informed by and include all stakeholders and must be conducted in a way that ensures buy-in from service users and their families.  It is essential that we find a way to actively include families in the care system while protecting the rights of service users.  We note that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its concluding observations at the start of 2016, urged consideration of the establishment of a national specialist independent advocacy service for children under the age of 18 who are in receipt of and engaging with mental health services in Ireland.  We are recommending the establishment of such a service.</p> <p>  There is no definitive model of an integrated health care system that ensures patients have access to high-quality and efficient care.  However, enough research is available to indicate that a number of principles are associated with the successful integration of such services.</p><p>These include issues such as maintenance of a patient focus when integrating services, providing standardised care delivery through inter-professional teams, the implementation of performance management systems across all employees, the availability of information systems that fully support the integration of services, strong organisational culture and leadership, strong clinical and corporate governance structures and sound financial management.  St. Patrick's suggests that any proposals to integrate primary, secondary, tertiary and community health care services be informed by these key principles.</p><p> St. Patrick's has worked with health insurers to develop a funding model for all ambulant care in ambulatory care settings.  This model should be considered and included in any new strategy.  The independent sector has an essential role to play in the delivery of a world-class health service and it is therefore vital that any strategy includes involvement of this sector.</p></speech>

Service development must be aware of the social determinants of ill-health; these are the real determinants.  Groups of society on the margin who are homeless or disabled need more access to health services, not less.</p> <p>  There is a need for greater support for family members, in particular for family members caring for persons with mental health difficulties or disability.</p> <p>  Future developments in health care need to be evidence-based and new technologies introduced that are efficient and cost-effective and appropriate to an Irish context.  This development will need the establishment of a continuing commitment to research into health care service implementation.  We should begin this research by looking at the services required to address the mental health needs of our increasingly aging population.</p> <p>  We must identify the challenges present in recruiting and retaining staff to health services, and in particular to mental health services, and take steps to address the shortfalls that exist.  To do that we should start by consulting with health care staff on the proposed changes we need to make and ensure they are sufficiently supported to allow them carry out their new and challenging roles.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.598" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1281" speakername="Mick Barry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#G00500"><p>I thank the three speakers for their interesting contributions today but also in terms of the overall work of the committee.  I have three questions.  First, I would like to focus on a sentence in Mr. Gilligan's statement in which he states, &quot;The exact services to which people should be entitled to access should be set out in law so that it is clear to both service providers and service users that legal obligations exist&quot;.  That is an interesting and important statement.  It seems to me that it is not possible to do that unless services are free at the point of use.  Otherwise, people will have an entitlement but they will not have the wherewithal in their pocket to follow through on the entitlement.  I do not see how that can be done without having a health service that is free at the point of use.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that.  It seems to me that such an approach is very much in sync with the idea of a national health service-type model for a health service.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  If we had such a system, the witnesses might comment on how they would see St. Patrick's mental health services fitting in or its relationship as part of that.</p><p>Second, Mr. Maher made interesting points about overall health spend.  It is ironic that at a time when consciousness in society about the importance of good mental health and mental health services is probably at a higher level than ever before, although there is still a long way to go, the percentage of health spend is at an all-time low or close to it.  To be blunt, the expectations of ordinary people are in conflict with what the political establishment has put in place, but we know that.  What I would like to learn from the witnesses is the position on the ground on a day-to-day basis.  What does that mean in terms of the type of services they would like to provide, and that should be provided, and the type of services that exist for people with mental health challenges?  What kind of problems is that low spend causing?</p><p>The last question is on the relationship of pharmaceutical companies with the health services in general on which the witnesses might comment.  For example, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>recently reported that the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland has banned donations from pharmaceutical companies because of evidence that it influences prescribing.  This position was also endorsed by Dr. John Hillery, who is governor of St. Patrick's.  My question is whether it has been adopted by St. Patrick's and by all medical staff who work in the hospital.</p></speech>

We appreciate it.  I have had many clients going through St. Patrick Hospital and I know the work it does.  I spoke on the issue of mental health in the D&aacute;il.  It is an issue I feel very strongly about.  I did not see the word "addiction" in the submission.  How many people in St. Patrick's Hospital have addiction problems?  In my humble layperson's view I believe there is a close link between mental health and addictions, whether it is alcohol or drugs but particularly alcohol, and particularly for young people.  It also is becoming more prevalent in the middle-aged and aging population.  What programmes does St. Patrick's Hospital have for people with addictions, and what else would the witnesses like to see provided to help those families?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1279" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#G00700"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  The previous speaker touched on the issue of addiction or the dual diagnosis, as we call it, which appears to be a major problem in this country.  Having met many people in recent weeks and months I am aware that accessing help within the system seems to be a stumbling block for many people.  Could the witnesses point us in the right direction in that regard?  Is that about leadership and responsibility on the part of the individuals who have been elected by the people to take on that responsibility or do we need to set out rules on it?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned staffing, which is a major issue that arises in almost every meeting of this committee.  Would the witnesses consider a new wages package for staff?  Do we have to start paying big bucks to get the required number of nurses for the health services?</p> <p>  The witnesses stated that the budget for mental health services is extremely low.  We are well aware of that.  Would they recommend a doubling of the mental health budget for the specific services?  Mr. Maher stated that the budget for mental health care was 6.2%.  Should that figure be 12% or 13%?  It is not rocket science.  We have to spend the money on the services to get what we want out of them.</p> <p>  Mention was made of A Vision for Change.  This is a broad question.  If any section of A Vision for Change was implemented, do the witnesses believe it would still work?</p><p>My strong view is that it will but I wanted the opinion of the experts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.602" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#H00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Members asked a wide range of questions.  Will the witnesses respond to them please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gilligan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#H00300"><p>There is the issue of the legal requirement.  A rights-based model of mental health care would have four key components, namely, availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality.  The issue of payment is very much a decision that would need to be made by the Government around what services it believes should be available free to any individual at any given time.  We should remember that there is no such thing as a free service.  In the view of St. Patrick's mental health services, people pay for their health care through their taxes.  The question is what services should be made available to people as a result of them paying those taxes.</p> <p>  The issue of a national service is very important.  St. Patrick's mental health services believes that all the key players need to form partnerships and there must be a partnership approach.  For too long we have debated the role of the private, voluntary, independent and statutory sectors.  Any future health strategy must include a role for all those people.  That, combined with a rights-based approach, will effectively help us shape the financial model that will fund such an approach.  There are inconsistencies in the system now.  Where mental health care is concerned, it is difficult to argue against people being entitled to basic, high-quality care because it has such an impact on all the rest of their lives, not just their physical well-being but that of their families, as well as employment and schooling.  It would be hard for any strategy to not consider making an extensive, high-quality mental health care service available to people.  The State should effectively be paying for that, regardless of how it is structured.</p> <p>  Mr. Maher will speak about spending and Professor Lucey will comment on the pharmaceutical aspect.  I will pick up on A Vision for Change.  We believe the strategy is good and robust, although there are some shortfalls.  When the strategy was put together, perhaps the role of the independent sector was not envisaged.  Any development of that strategy should include an active role for the voluntary and independent sectors.  The key principles of A Vision for Change are nonetheless robust.  There are some difficulties around the interpretation of A Vision for Change and at times it is interpreted as amounting to the closing of all inpatient care and the opening community services.  A Vision for Change discusses a comprehensive care model that involves all those key components.  If we delivered A Vision for Change, there is no doubt we would have the highest quality mental health service.  I will come back to staffing and salaries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.604" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Maher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#H00400"><p>With regard to a national or single service, the National Health Service, NHS, in the UK is an interesting example.  It is a single service but many of the authorities within the NHS are becoming commissioning agents for services.  Those services are accessed through any number of different providers.  In terms of the mental and physical health infrastructure that exists at present, there is enough there to provide for that single health service.  It is more about how those providers are used, as opposed to subdividing the health infrastructure into state, independent, voluntary and private.  The NHS model of commissioning would work well.</p> <p>  Members asked about the implications of a relatively low health spend with regard to the overall health spend.  There are three impacts in this regard.  The first has been mentioned briefly already.  Staffing levels are a difficulty in the context of providing a high-quality service.  I refer specifically to recruiting and retaining high-quality staff.  The other major impact on a low spend or relatively low spend is access.  People do not have access and with mental health care, there are sociological barriers to accessing mental health care in the first place arising from stigma.  This arises where people simply will not access services because of the stigma associated with mental illnesses.  Where services are not available it is an additional barrier.  If people do not access services, particularly with mental health, over a long period - the research we have done suggests some people wait up to ten years to access quality care - it will only disimprove a person's mental health.  That will then lead to a longer recovery time.  Lack of investment will reduce the quality of services generally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.605" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Jim Lucey" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#H00500"><p>To respond to Deputy Barry, I will pick out the issue of the relationship with pharmaceuticals before taking on the questions from Deputies Madigan and Buckley on alcohol.  The pharmaceuticals issue is something on which we welcome discussion.  We also support entirely the position outlined by Dr. John Hillery and the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  The committee may be interested to know that we introduced this policy more than ten years ago and we were the first in the nation to introduce a comprehensive policy with regard to the pharma industry that sets out very clearly the limits that need to be placed between prescribers and the industry.  We did so in a policy we published and that was commended by the then inspector of mental hospitals from the Mental Health Commission, Dr. Pat Devitt.  In his report in 2010, he indicated this should be the industry standard for health services as a whole and recommended that it should be adopted.  We can give the committee that information.</p> <p>  The facts are that all human beings are influenced by a variety of inputs, including the market.  We need to ensure that the highest possible standards determine how physicians and clinicians prescribe and determine care for patients.  This is really the unifying theme of our presentation.  It is about human beings and a holistic service that is centred around the patient, person, service user and citizen.  That is where the issue about addiction comes in as we have a national problem with addiction.  We cannot deny that are in many ways dominated and distracted by it all the time.  Our service, historically, has been associated with a commitment to those with addictions.  Many believe our service is primarily associated with that but of course addiction is not our only mental health agenda.  We are leaders in the delivery of addiction services, with the understanding that addiction is part of a mental health problem.  Most often a dual diagnosis, as has been described, is a better term.  It is a part of a journey for many people.  Very few people take their lives in this country without having alcohol involved with that process, which is so tragic.  From the beginning to the end, recovery that denies the place of substance use is probably mistaking and misunderstanding the needs of people.</p> <p>  We have introduced dual diagnosis services and approximately 12% of inpatient services relates directly to alcohol and dual diagnosis.  We have a consciousness of this right across the services.  As the Chairman stated, we have over 700 staff but we have hundreds of highly qualified therapists and trained staff who are aware of the duality.  We have a coherent delivery.  We also recognise that the delivery of mental health services must be a population health system, community-based in the sense that it returns people to the community and to where they live, work and love.  We were the first centre in Europe to introduce Alcoholics Anonymous in the 1950s and we have just celebrated the 70th anniversary of its arrival.</p> <p>  We have a long-standing commitment to supporting people struggling with addiction where it matters and where they are in the community.  We are about delivering those services and returning people there.  I hope our contribution can help the committee's vision, which should be about returning people to wellness where they are and providing them with excellent services.  The question of cost is really important, and as Mr Gilligan has stated, cost can never be taken out of the issue.  There are also questions about standards, commitment and vision, which need to be addressed as well.  We believe in the provision of excellent services to people in the community.</p></speech>

At least 8%, if not 9%, of the health budget should be spent on mental health.  That is what is recommended in A Vision for Change.  It is possible that more is needed but we are miles away from that now at approximately 6%.</p><p> In terms of staffing, salaries is one issue.  There is also a belief in what people are doing.  Having a commitment to an overall strategic vision for an organisation and support are also key because working in the health sector is extremely stressful.  If one feels one does not have the supports and that one is not working in a worthwhile organisation then one will leave, which is one of the reasons we lose people.  Our competition is Australia, New Zealand and the NHS.  We have got to address the issue of losing staff as a priority.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.608" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Maher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#J00200"><p>Deputy Buckley asked how can we enhance services for people with a dual diagnosis.  As Professor Lucey has said, it is important not to separate the mental health service from the addictions and dual diagnosis service.  Addiction issues and problems are mental health problems and, therefore, should be under the remit of mental health service and not disaggregated or separated from the mental health services.  That specific point is quite important.</p></speech>

The following simplistic scenario seems to have been prevalent with people with whom I have dealt directly over the years on this issue.  An individual presents himself or herself at the accident and emergency department in a highly intoxicated state and threatens to take his or her life.  The health care staff cannot touch the person because he or she is drunk and so the person is advised to go home.  Can a system be put in place in the health service where a person is accountable and takes responsibility in cases where a person presents himself or herself at an accident and emergency department or wherever?  We need a person to take responsibility for the person presenting and to address the system on both sides.  First, the addiction in the form of either drugs or drink must be addressed.  Second, when the person is back on a level playing field an effort should be made to discover the underlying mental health issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.610" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Jim Lucey" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#J00400"><p>The answer includes a number of complex things.  The Deputy is right that one cannot put up barriers to care for people who need that care.  The way to tackle the issue is to make a commitment to holistic care and seeing these problems as integral to each other at a human level.  The policy document entitled A Vision for Change radically separates addiction services in a way that we had fundamental difficulties with at the time.  Our service has not made that separation in the same way.  We see the duality and holistic nature as being primary.</p> <p>  One can deliver accountability and being responsible by agreeing to integrate addiction and mental health in a much more meaningful way.  One must start by agreeing that and we would argue that in the Irish context it makes no sense to separate these issues.  </p></speech>

In any process-driven industry, and mental health care is one of those industries, the key to continual quality improvement is standardisation.   We believe it is strategically imperative to develop standards for situations when persons present themselves at an accident and emergency department.  There should be a clear clinical pathway with an infrastructural basis available that does not involve saying to a person: "Go home until you're sober."  If we standardise the approaches to care, which is what the strategy should consider doing, it will lead to improved access to care and people getting the care that they need much quicker.  The notion of standardisation and developing care pathways for a variety of different presentations should be key in a mental health strategy.</p></speech>

Was money directed elsewhere when the Victorian institutions were shut down?  Did expenditure not keep pace with the population?  I know why funding decreased but I want to know what happened operationally.  Where did the percentage of moneys go?</p><p>I would like to hear the views of the delegation on cross referral, especially by allied health professionals.  Nurses today hold honours degrees and very often they have masters and PhDs.  Public health nurses work out in the community and can spot something in a person they see regularly.  At the moment all referrals must be made by GPs.  I would like to hear the views of the delegation on allied health professionals referring a person for help and support.</p><p>I wish to ask about the witnesses' experience.  By the time people with mental health issues present at emergency departments, they often have physical problems, for example, they may have attempted to take their own lives.  The physical issues need to be treated as much as the mental health ones.  These people are often known to the system, but the system is shut down except between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  Should 24-7 services be prioritised in emergency departments or in the community systems of which these people avail?  Is there a moment before they get to that stage at which they might access supports but those supports are not there?  This is a question on priorities, although we would ideally want both.<b></b></p></speech>

My first question relates to staff.  Having represented staff at St. Patrick's for many years, I am familiar with its set-up, but will the witnesses tell us about the skill mix?  This committee is debating a ten-year vision.  What is the extent to which the skill mix is utilised?  I understand that it is utilised at St. Patrick's.  Is there potential to broaden that utilisation within the current staff cohort?</p> <p>  I would be interested to hear more of the witnesses' views on staff recruitment and retention already, not just of nurses, but of all staff.  My understanding is that we are short staffed.  One reason that was cited &ndash; it is not a reason that I accept &ndash; for some of the mental health budget not being spent in previous years was that there was a difficulty in recruiting staff.  Do the witnesses believe that this committee has a role in providing that vision?  If this is the reason for losing staff, would a detailed vision for the health service help the staff retention issues?</p> <p>  My last question relates to the commissioning.</p><p>I think it was Mr. Maher who said that it might be good for the committee to explore the way commissioning is handled by the NHS.  I would be interested in hearing the views of witnesses on how to commission services.  We all know how to commission a bed, which is relatively simple.<br/><br/>We know the silo nature of access to services,<b></b>where addiction services are kept separate from mental health services.  People with multi-morbidity need to access a range of services.  In a model in which we focus on commissioning beds or commissioning services, will the witnesses give us some insight on how we can commission the type of services that will make a real and meaningful difference for people in a mental health setting?<br/><br/>My understanding is that St. Patrick's Mental Health Services is a not-for-profit group.  It is not a private hospital in the strictest sense of the word.  When we discuss private and voluntary health services, I would see St. Patrick's as being more in the voluntary sector than in the private sector.  When we talk about a role for the independent sector, I am not endorsing the for-profit companies in any way.  I think that should be made clear.</p></speech>

Stigma and the obstacles it causes for people accessing care have been mentioned.  How are we doing in regard to stigma and are we making significant progress in breaking down the stigma of mental health issues?</p> <p>  From my experience in the constituency, alcohol is the number one substance of abuse and benzodiazepines are number two right across the spectrum.  What is the experience in that regard?  What treatment options are available to people?</p></speech>

We are eager to ensure people do not have any misunderstanding about the nature of our organisation.  We are a not-for-profit organisation, so there are no shareholders and nobody is taking money out of the organisation.  In that sense, one could describe us as a voluntary institution <i>per se</i>.  There is a group of organisations that provide health care where money is paid to investors.  All of the money we generate is reinvested into the organisation and those who serve on the board do so voluntarily.  To describe St. Patrick's Mental Health Services as voluntary raises difficulties because 90% of the people who use our services have health insurance.  That is something we have tried to address in the past ten years.  We want our services to be available to everybody.  It is quite simply that if the HSE does service level agreements with us, we are then in a position to provide care to people through the HSE system.  Without that we cannot provide care.  We have a small philanthropic fund whereby we try to ensure people who could not otherwise access help can access it.<br/><br/>In the past eight years, we have developed our community clinics, our dean clinics, and as part of our philanthropic purpose we have introduced the concept of free assessment.  The difficulty is that it needs to be linked to a care pathway and it can be perceived as cynical.  We have done it as a genuine gesture.  This initiative has been protected by our board in order that people can get a free assessment in our dean clinics, but we need to generate a care pathway from that because otherwise we are providing something that is irrelevant.  This is something we grapple with all the time.  We want our services to be available to more people and we want to provide our services to everybody.<br/><br/>In response to some of the other questions that have been raised, the key issue is staffing.  We strongly believe that salary is an issue.  There is a problem with the salary levels in the health services.  Nobody can dispute that.  At our salary levels, we have to try to compete with the jobs on offer in Australia, the UK and so on.  Job satisfaction and support are equally important.  We find ourselves going into a downward spiral.  When there the required number of staff is not on a particular team, the staff on the team lose heart as they feel they are carrying responsibility at weekends and on evenings when there is no backup.  That causes burnout.  It is not just about salaries.<br/><br/>There are also difficulties around the number of staff available.  We are not training sufficient numbers.  As part of the cutback measures, we reduced the number of training places and this is having a significant impact on professionals such as nurses and doctors.  In St. Patrick's Mental Health Services, our approach is to have a multidisciplinary team service.  One of our core aims is to meet the Mental Health Commission's regulations and standards and we therefore employ multidisciplinary teams.  The team comprises consultant psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, dietitians in some cases, depending on the service we are talking about, and numerous different types of counsellors, addiction counsellors and cognitive behavioural therapists.  We pride ourselves on ensuring we take a multidisciplinary team approach because that is best practice.</p></speech>

We absolutely agree that is necessary.  We would have trained nurses to become clinical nurse specialists and advanced practitioners.  The same applies to occupational therapists, social workers, clinical psychologists, speech and language therapists and dietitians.  We have the full range in St. Patrick's.  We use them to the best of their ability.  We have approximately 350 clinical staff, of whom 30 to 35 are doctors.  There is multidisciplinarity across the entire service.  As we train people to higher levels, we use their skills in tasks such as referring between teams and doing specialist assessments.  We see the value of enhancing people's roles and not relying on a GP, a consultant psychiatrist or a nurse.  We use the broad spectrum of disciplines.  We have to.  The Mental Health Commission specifies exactly what should comprise a multidisciplinary team.  It includes as a core team a consultant psychiatrist, nurse, psychologist, occupational therapist and social worker.  However, we would include on enhanced teams cognitive behavioural psychotherapists, psychodynamic psychotherapists, family therapists, speech and language therapists and dietitians because we realise that mental health is a continuum into physical health.</p> <p>  In response to the question on how we look after somebody's physical health, we have established in St. Patrick's in our approved centre, which is the name given to our inpatient services, a primary care service, in other words a GP service for our inpatients in order that they get adequate physical health care at a sufficiently high quality rather than having to transfer people out to other services in accident and emergency departments.  We take advantage of other disciplines and we realise their importance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.637" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Jim Lucey" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#K00500"><p>I would like to add to Mr. Maher's response to Deputy Browne's question about physical ill health.  The figures are striking in the mental health agenda for the nation.  People with enduring mental health disorder have a life expectancy that is significantly shorter than their neighbours by more than a decade, and perhaps two decades in terms of some of the enduring mental health difficulties.  This is a significant shock.  What people may not realise is that the deficit in life expectancy arises from physical ill health.  It is remarkable that the theme throughout all of what we said today is about removing barriers.  One of the barriers that has existed for centuries is the barrier between mind and body.  The Deputy asked how should we look at things, we need to look at our services in order that we cease to divide mind and body in this way in our structure.  We could do that.  In many ways presentation at an emergency department is probably an end event.</p><p>It is obviously an emergency but it is not where we want to be in terms of prevention, health of population and well-being.  We need to address these at an earlier stage.  However, we need to do it with a mindset that already integrates mental health with physical health and does so where it really matters.  In the case of 70% of adults with mental health difficulties the issues emerge before the age of 25 years.  One of the key things the committee needs to be aware of is the need to get in early and young and to target the part of the population where it matters, in other words, young people.  Physical and mental health problems co-exist but overwhelmingly it is mental health problems that matter until the age of 50 years.  That is the truth in terms of actual outcomes.</p><p> The barrier idea unifies the three areas I wish to comment on in response to the questions from Deputy O'Reilly and the Chairman.  It is important for the committee to examine ways of reducing the barriers between allied professionals, the independent sector and the public sector.  It is important to place the burden at standard levels.  The idea is to set standards.  We should relish the opportunity to meet the standards set by the Mental Health Commission.  It corresponds to standard setting as set by the body politic of the State, and everyone must rise to it.  This is how we unify the service.  Such a change would mean the committee could do exactly what it has sought to do, that is to say, to ensure no barriers between the professionals.</p><p> Reference was made to general practice.  Less than a quarter of general practitioners have postgraduate medical health training of any description.  This is extraordinarily important.  This is a seriously burdened group and yet they do not have the skill set.  When it comes to training and education, the body of staff who work in mental health are not motivated primarily by a desire to get higher earnings - I am saying this carefully.  They need decent, sustainable and respectable returns, of course.  However, they are motivated by many other things that can be captured by a culture and a commitment to their development throughout their careers.  They also have to overcome the tremendous challenge of burnout.  Education is a factor.  This is one of the reasons for the deep commitment in St Patrick's Hospital to education.  One of the problems with other providers of mental health is that they do not provide training in the way we do.  We have an extraordinary dedication with a dependent department in terms of research and training.  This fosters the development of staff in all our disciplines, including psychologists, social workers, occupational health staff and mental health and psychiatry staff.  We will end up eating our seed corn unless we train and deliver the people who can flourish and deliver the integrated services of the future.  That is what people need.  There is not necessarily one particular barrier to take down.  We need to take down all the barriers by recognising that allied staff, so-called professionals, patients and their issues can no longer be divided by the various sectional groups.</p></speech>

We are looking at the issue of skill mix and the way in which we can best utilise the skills that exist.  Professor Lucey has referred to training and its importance.  This is relevant specifically in respect of the introduction of health care assistants and the way this grade can integrate in the mental health sector.  I realise those responsible have moved faster in terms of the acute hospital setting and the introduction health care assistants.

I am always in favour of prevention rather than cure.  There is a wealth of experience among the three members of the deputation in dealing with thousands of people coming through the doors of St. Patrick's Hospital annually over many years.  What are we doing wrong?  I will re-phrase the question in less general terms.  What can we do that has not been done already and that we could be doing?</p> <p>  Society has a great deal to answer for in terms of addiction and mental health, bearing in mind what Professor Lucey said earlier about those under the age of 25 years.  Many of these issues stem from home, families and parents.  What can we do that we are not doing?  I am keen to know.

It is important for us that our multidisciplinary teams are considered to include everyone who works in our organisation, including household staff, porters and catering staff.  All play a key part in creating a recovery ethos.  The health care assistant development has been important for us.  We envisage that in future this will be even more important.</p> <p>  Naturally, there are delicacies around introducing a new role.  It has been particularly successful for us and we see it having a strong future.  The way to develop it appropriately will stem from discussions with the other professions to enable us to maintain the multidisciplinary team approach.</p> <p>  Earlier, a question was asked about funding models.  We are strongly of the view that a bundled care model is the only way forward.  The difficulty is that the separation of services is reflected often in the separation of the types of experience to which a person is subject.  Parts of a person's care transfers from one person to another.  It would take years to resolve this unless we follow the money.  When a bundled care approach is introduced, the system is informed that for a given amount of money a given patient needs to be treated from illness to recovery.  The way the components of care are provided is down to the service provider.</p> <p>  This model is the only way that we will be able to develop an integrated service model and to ensure real outcomes for people.  At the moment, the itemised service delivery is not working.  It creates real difficulties.</p> <p>  The issue of stigma is important.  We have taken two steps forward and one step back.  There is far more awareness around mental health at the moment in Ireland.  Certainly, there is more acceptance but there are deeply ingrained beliefs and misunderstandings around mental health that will take a long time to resolve.  It all comes back to the issue of education.  Indeed, education and prevention are key in the area of alcohol usage and mental health.  Most young people begin using alcohol because of social pressure, anxiety or depression.  That is the reality.  We need to educate and help our young people to understand the dangers.  Moreover, we need to educate them around their emotional awareness and how they learn to understand their emotions and deal with them.  Such an approach would have an impact on their alcohol and drug usage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Jim Lucey" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#L01100"><p>The Chairman asked a question about benzodiazepines.  This is relevant to us.  We have introduced a major initiative around benzodiazepine reduction.  We have published it and it is available on our website.  It has been striking how successful the initiative has been.  Since benzodiazepines are prescribed, we need to address the standards around prescribing practice and manage them.  When an organisation does that, it can bring about dramatic reductions in the volume of benzodiazepines dispensed.  We have evidence to show that this works.  This is something to which we are deeply committed.</p> <p>  This also speaks to the question of what we can do about addiction.  As a society, we need to make choices and set goals for ourselves which we can then standardise with regard to services.  If we, as a society, decide to make alcohol cheaper and more readily available or ubiquitous, then we will get the consumption of cheap alcohol everywhere.  However, we can make a decision to make the choice in a balanced way in a free society and still protect those who are made vulnerable by having ubiquitous access to this substance.  We must support the legislation to realise that aim.  I take the Chairman's point.  We very much support the legislation to which she referred.  Indeed, we are keen to enhance it as a statement of where we should be going in terms of the health of the population.  We are mental health specialists and advocates.  We are interested in the health of the population.  There is no health without mental health.</p></speech>

It would be inadvisable to go down the route of simply concentrating on beds, especially where mental health is concerned.  It is a simple and easy approach to take.  We have moved the clinical model within mental health care in the past 20 years from what was a bed-based or inpatient approach across to what we have now, whereby most of the services we provide are either in day services or in the community.</p><p>The committee's role in developing a strategy over the next ten years should include a way in which we can develop a funding model, particularly for mental health care, but I imagine it applies across the entire spectrum of health, whereby we fund care and treatment rather than the commissioning of beds.  As I said, the latter is a very simple trap into which to fall because of the very simple <i>per diem</i>rate.  We have worked with the insurers to try to get to a stage at which we have a proper funding model that matches the clinical model, that is, care across the entire continuum from one's home to the most acute inpatient facility.  The continuum would range across the entire facility and the entire spectrum.  This is difficult but it can be done.</p></speech>

Our dean clinics are our first port of call.  Since we established them, approximately 50% or 60% of the people who come to us have come through the clinics directly.  Accessibility in the first instance is, therefore, through dean clinics.  They offer free assessment so they is pretty much available to anybody.  However, there is no point in our seeing people at dean clinics for free assessment if there is no identifiable care pathway for them.  That is where service level agreements become an issue.  We have had some very successful service level agreements whereby we have done work for the HSE.  We have helped clear child and adolescent waiting lists in some areas but, as an overall philosophy or strategy, the service level agreement is difficult to negotiate.  Quite rightly, the HSE wants to build its own services, but that is the core reason we are here today: partnership and all of us playing a role is the way forward.  The HSE on its own cannot build a world-class mental health service; neither can any of the independent providers.  Therefore, we all need to work together to break that barrier.  There is a need to try to get all of us around the table talking about how we would best do that.</p></speech>

From Mental Health Reform, I welcome Dr. Shari McDaid, director, and Ms Kate Mitchell, policy and research officer.  Mental Health Reform is an umbrella group that represents more than 50 organisations working and advocating in the area of mental health.  It promotes improved and prioritised mental health services in Ireland and best practice in all aspects of service provision to people experiencing mental health difficulties.  I thank Dr. McDaid for making herself available.  She had other commitments this morning, so we very much appreciate her coming in.</p><p>I will deal with some formalities first.  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now ask Dr. McDaid to make her presentation.</p></speech>

Mental health is a cross-cutting issue that is deeply entrenched in every aspect of Irish society.  In 2015, the European Joint Action on Mental Health and Well-being, to which Ireland is a party, stated, "mental health is more crucial today than it has ever been" due in part to its impact on every domain of life.  This effect is compounded by the growing recognition of mental health difficulties and, as a consequence, the increasing demand on mental health services that are already under-resourced and overstretched.</p> <p>  Mental health difficulties currently constitute one third of the disease burden in Europe and, according to the World Health Organization, depression is expected to be the largest contributor to disease burden by 2030.  The Healthy Ireland survey reports that 9% of the Irish population over the age of 15 has a "probable mental health problem", which equates to approximately 325,000 people on the basis of the 2011 census.  Almost 20% of young people aged 19 to 24 and 15% of children aged 11 to 13 in Ireland have had a mental health disorder, according to research conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  According to a survey conducted by the 3Ts organisation, suicide is the leading cause of death in young males, exceeding road traffic accidents and cancer.  More recently, new research published by the Economic and Social Research Institute identified the two most common types of work-related illness, one of which is work-related stress, anxiety and depression and stated that stress, anxiety and depression account for 20% of work-related illness.</p> <p>  The costs relating to mental health difficulties in Ireland are significant.  There is a strong correlation between physical and mental health difficulties.  All together, when the NHS studied this, it stated that the extra physical health care caused by mental health difficulties was estimated to cost the NHS at least &pound;10 billion per annum.  Adults aged 18 or older with any type of mental disorder or major depressive episode in the past year are more likely than adults without these conditions to suffer high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, heart disease and stroke.  Regarding health service utilisation, adults with any mental disorder use both emergency departments and hospitals more than those without a mental disorder, leading to higher health care costs.  In Ireland, it has been estimated that the overall cost of poor mental health is about 2% of GNP, which we calculate to equate to about &euro;4 billion.  To put this in context, the cost of overweight and obesity in Ireland was estimated in 2009 at &euro;1.13 billion, equating to 0.7% of GNP.</p><p>One can see the impact of mental health is greater than some health issues that are getting much attention.  This evidence suggests the individual and social returns from adequate investment in mental health in Ireland are likely to be "high and sustained", according to the Centre for Economic Performance in England.  The main economic costs of mental health difficulties in Ireland have been said to be associated with the labour market as a result of lost employment, absenteeism, lost productivity and premature retirement.</p><p> Mental Health Reform strongly recommends that the area of mental health is recognised and afforded appropriate priority within the wider health agenda to reflect its significance in contributing to the burden of disease in Ireland and its impact on other areas of life.  Despite the high costs of mental health difficulties to Irish society, resources for mental health services continue to be disproportionately low compared with resources for physical health services.  For example, in the most recent budget, announced for 2017, there will be a 3% increase in revenue funding for mental health; the wider increase in revenue funding across the health budget was 7.4%.  In the 2016 budget, mental health funding represented just 6.2% of the overall health budget, which is significantly lower than other leading countries and lower than recommended in Irish mental health policy.  In both Britain and Canada the proportion of funding for mental health out of the health budget is approximately 13% and in New Zealand it is 11%.  This Government&rsquo;s allocation for next year will do little to address the historical underfunding and decades of neglect of Ireland&rsquo;s mental health system.</p><p> I would like to speak about mental health in primary care.  In addition to gaps in mental health services, there continues to be a significant lack of capacity within the primary care sector to provide comprehensive mental health at that level, including early intervention, detection of mental health difficulties and appropriate primary care interventions for adults and children.  Such gaps include wide variation in access to mental health support in primary care and the underdevelopment of the role of mental health workers in primary care teams.  There is a lack of a comprehensive range of mental health interventions in primary care and this is reflected in the current limitations of counselling in the primary care service, which is only available to people over age 18 who have a medical card and has a maximum of eight sessions.  We know that as of the first quarter of 2016, 2,500 clients were waiting for counselling for between three and six months with the counselling and primary care service.  That is significant as this is supposed to be an early intervention and quick access service.</p><p> I will speak about e-mental health, as there is potential for this to play a significant role.  E-mental health is another strand of service delivery that has received little attention in the Irish context and could be considered in the development of our health system.  There is potential for e-mental health supports to improve accessibility and affordability of mental health care, reducing the extent of unmet need.  This, in effect, could address health inequalities and social exclusion, particularly in times of increased demand and overstretched services.  We note, for example, the counselling in primary care service received 17,000 referrals in 2015; however, an estimated 325,000 people over age 15 in Ireland have a probable mental health problem, so we can see there is a significant gap in provision when compared with need.</p><p> It is very important to balance investment in the future health services towards prevention and early intervention services, particularly those targetting the mental health of infants, young children and their families.  Despite targeted investment by Government in evidence-based programmes to improve outcomes for children and families, such as the area-based childhood initiative, there has been a lack of national direction on mental health in this area and a lack of consistency in incorporating mental health integrally into local early intervention programmes.  Prevention needs to include an approach that places the social and emotional health and well-being of infants on a par with that of their physical health.  This should be set out in national policy and complemented with the necessary resources.</p><p> In 2013, the World Health Organization recommended redirecting mental health spending towards community-based services, including the integration of mental health into maternal and child health, thereby enabling access to better and more cost-effective intervention.  We note a recent evaluation of a parenting programme in Ireland indicated that for every &euro;1,463 spent per child, a saving of &euro;4,599 per child was realised.  In this context I draw attention to the fact that according to information we recently examined, funding for family resource centres - a community resource that can be a great space for early intervention - was cut between 2008 and 2015 by 38%.  The financial impact on wider society by neglecting to invest in early intervention services has been clearly identified, from economic disadvantage to academic underachievement, substance abuse, so-called juvenile delinquency and intergenerational effects, to name but a few.  Researchers, clinicians and economists are in strong agreement that adequate investment in this area and a move towards prevention and early intervention, as opposed to crisis care, will lead to long-term economic savings, enhanced social capital and individual better outcomes.</p><p> One of the clearest goals must be for mental health to become the business of everybody in government and not just the health system.  Overall, Mental Health Reform recommends that the Government adopts a "mental health in all policies" approach.  This approach has been defined by the European Framework for Action on Mental Health and Wellbeing as the development of "mental health promotion and prevention and early intervention programmes, through integration of mental health in all policies and multi-sectoral cooperation".</p><p> To conclude, I draw attention to our core recommendations.  These are that mental health should be prioritised in any future health care vision and integrated with physical health care throughout the health system, that the principles of human rights, autonomy and recovery should underpin all health service delivery, including in mental health, the wider health services and related social and community services and a "mental health in all policies" approach should be adopted to take account of the broad impact of mental health on a range of social and economic policy areas.  Additionally, the Government should invest in mental health in primary care to ensure the mental health needs of the population are addressed at the lowest possible level of the mental health system.  This should be supported through investment in mental health resources in primary care and implementation of a shared-care approach between primary and secondary mental health services.  Furthermore, individuals with long-term mental health needs should be afforded access to free primary health care.  That is very important to facilitate recovery and long-term health.  Finally, investment in prevention and early intervention services should be put in place to support the mental health of infants, young children and their families.</p></speech>

It is a very important subject.  I remember being in school and learning the Latin maxim, <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>; I am not sure if I am saying it correctly but it refers to a healthy mind in a healthy body.  That was drummed into us and it is very true.  The witnesses have reflected that quite comprehensively in their submission today.</p><p>I am interested in the addiction area, as I mentioned to the witnesses from St. Patrick's Hospital.  It is not mentioned in the submission but that is not to say it is not of paramount importance when we speak of mental health.  What is the view of the delegation in that regard and particularly the tackling of addiction in young people?  Professor Lucey from St. Patrick's Hospital mentioned how mental health issues can start in people under 25.  Where there are career guidance counsellors in schools, I would like to see mental health counsellors, or at least counsellors if they are not called mental health counsellors.  These can be people who people can talk to, particularly teenagers and especially when they start drinking etc.  I would like to see that happening but I wonder what is the view of the delegation in the context of its all-policies approach and the EU framework that has recommended it.</p><p>We should consider such a post and I think it would be worthwhile. </p><p> Funding for family resource centres has been cut.  I will push for the decision to be reversed because family resource centres act as a preventative measure.  I would like to hear the views of the delegation on the matter.   </p><p>  I have spoken in the D&aacute;il about education being key in protecting one's mental health.  Dr. McDaid outlined in her submission that "suicide is the leading cause of death in young males, exceeding road traffic accidents and cancer".  Suicide is a scourge in this country and I will do all that I can to help improve the situation.  I thank the delegation for attending today. </p></speech>

The delegation mentioned that mental health care could and should be integrated with physical health care.  As Deputy Madigan has pointed out, we all have spoken about mental health in the D&aacute;il.  We are all aware of how important mental health is and have asked for something to be done, but let us consider the perspective of this committee.  In terms of having integration at all levels from primary care onwards, I ask the witnesses to outline practical steps that can be taken in the areas of funding, skill mix and the integration of health professionals.</p></speech>

It has been amazing reading about what the group has achieved over the years.  It has been extremely beneficial.</p> <p>  I will only make a few points as Deputies have made similar points.  I was struck by the cuts made to the budget for resource centres.  Dr. McDaid mentioned repeatedly that prevention is better than cure and that if we do not nip it in the bud, we will set off on the wrong foot.  Recently I read a report compiled by the Northern Ireland Forum.  It provided startling figures that from 2001 to 2015, there were 7,431 reported deaths by suicide in the South and that 4,177 people since 1988 in the North have lost their lives due to suffering a mental illness.  As many speakers have said already, we have raised the issues in the D&aacute;il.  There is a genuine consensus here that something has to be done and fast.  </p> <p>  Counselling sessions have been mentioned.  Eight sessions may work for some people but others may require 20 sessions.  Also, the people who are above the qualifying threshold and, therefore, do not qualify for a medical card lose out with this system.  People under the age of 18 years do not have a chance to access the measure.  All of this bring us back to the primary care model and prevention. </p> <p>  Education is one of the most important aspects that has been raised here.  We must give people coping skills from an early age to deal with the pressures that they will meet throughout life.  All of us have listened intently and learned a great deal here.  The facts and figures are worrying as they highlight what does not happen on the ground.  We, as a society, are stuck at the cure stage but we should be working on prevention.  Approximately ten years ago the World Health Organization conducted a study on how much a person who leaves schools at 18 years and joins the workforce contributes to society in taxes.  I believe a person's life should be valued properly.  That might sound strange but such a figure would highlight how much society loses when a young person dies compared with his or her lifelong contribution to society, thus showing it is a win-win situation.  I am sorry for being a bit long winded.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.667" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shari McDaid" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#O00400"><p>Not at all, Deputy.  I will answer the questions in the order in which they were asked.</p> <p> Deputy Madigan asked how addiction fits into the area of mental health.  We have a structural problem in the health system in that we have separated addiction services from mental health services in a way that does not reflect the experience of individuals who have addiction difficulties.  Many people who have an addiction issue also have a mental health difficultly.  Sadly, many people with a mental health difficulty sometimes reach out in inappropriate ways by supporting their mental health through addiction.</p> <p>  One thing that we need is a much more integrated service approach to supporting individuals with both issues at play - mental health difficulties and addiction issues.  In the worst case scenario we have seen people who have an addiction being turned away from mental health services and we have had some tragic situations in that regard.</p> <p>  The idea that has been put out is what one might call a no wrong door policy.  That means that if one arrives at the door of a health service, be it a mental health service or addiction service, the service should work with a mental health service adequately to provide the holistic approach to care that a person needs.  We need to address addiction and substance misuse and the whole area  of the inappropriate use of alcohol in this country.  I hope that the alcohol Bill, in the form proposed by the Government, will make its way through the full process.  We also need to be prepared when people struggle with these issues to recognise that they might need mental health care and to make sure that the mental health care is provided to them. </p> <p>  In terms of mental health counsellors in schools, I am intrigued that a member made the suggestion because it was suggested to me by a young person recently when we visited the Galway child and adolescent mental health services.  One of the messages we came away with very clearly from that visit is that young people do not feel that there is anyone within schools who they can turn to for support even if there is a guidance counsellor.  The message that was given to me was that a guidance counsellor might talk to them about their future career but might not make it clear that he or she can support the child's mental health.  We probably need some kind of identified individual in schools that students or the children themselves will have confidence in going to for help.  We must also realise that we are going to need other options because it would be very easy for one person in a school to quite quickly become overloaded.  Jigsaw services are important.  Other innovative solutions for children and young people, like online, should be explored. </p> <p>  Deputies Madigan and Buckley asked about the cut in funding for family resource centres.  A Vision for Change set out that the broadest area of contribution to the mental health population would be in the community and yet in some ways that is the area that has been least developed and resourced.  We cannot pay lip service to community involvement in mental health care.  We cannot just say we want everyone to talk about mental health in the community and be open to doing so without resourcing the initiative.</p> <p>  We know that people who live in disadvantaged communities are at much higher risk of developing a mental health difficulty.  It would be very appropriate to provide dedicated resources in centres that have open access, where one can start building the confidence of disadvantaged communities in particular to support each other in looking after their mental health and to have better direct access to care where needed.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked the important question of what does physical and mental health care look like.  One of the reasons it is hard for us to conceive of that here in Ireland is that it is so unavailable that we are really just starting the conversation.  About a year ago someone talked to me about how they had a particular health treatment or an occasion for surgery that was followed by rehabilitation.  The person told me that no one, after that process, asked about his or her mental health needs even though it was a difficult time.</p><p>Similarly, in regard to cancer treatment and to a whole range of other conditions, having mental health raised as part of a conversation in a coherent way and making sure there is access in primary care to mental health workers who are ready and prepared to support individuals with their mental health, whatever their health issue is what we really need.  It comes back to the issue of significantly boosting the capacity of our primary care mental health system, probably through something such as psychologists in primary care who are available to conduct assessments and early intervention support, but also much greater capacity in our counselling and primary care service and directing people to other options such as e-mental health once those are developed.</p><p> Deputy Buckley also raised the issue of the education system and asked about making mental health part of what every child learns as a normal skill so that every child learns to look after their mental health as they are growing up.  It calls to mind the fact that mental health guidelines were published by the Department of Education and Skills for primary and post-primary education, but no resources whatsoever were attached to the publication of those guidelines.  Clearly we can talk about mental health and the need for every area to be involved but we have to start to invest in the mental health of Ireland's population if we want to see the fruits of those aspirations in terms of Irish people having better mental health care.</p><p> Deputy Buckley also raised the issue of crisis care in the context of the numbers of people we have lost to suicide in Ireland.  This is an area that mental health reform has been very concerned about in recent years, particularly because so many people who use mental health services and their family members have come to us expressing their frustration that when the person knew he or she needed urgent help, never mind the people who are afraid to seek help, he or she ended up having to go to an accident and emergency department, waiting for hours and hours and not getting an appropriate response to their urgent distress.  We have called for direct access to a 24-7 specialist mental health services across the country in every community in Ireland.  We think that is possible to implement.  We think it is possible to implement at a minimum a seven-days-a-week service, provided by the mental health services with outside telephone support outside of hours that would reach much of that need and ease much of that distress for people who struggle with their mental health on an ongoing basis.  We are calling for an implementation plan for that 24-7 service within three months and full implementation of the service within two years.  </p></speech>

Regarding the integration of services for mental and physical health, would it be Dr. McDaid's considered or informed opinion that there is segregation; that acute hospital care is one service, with social care and mental health care being dealt with by a separate wing of the health services?  Does she believe that the root of the problem probably comes from the old model where people with mental health issues were put into institutions?  For the purpose of the work of this committee, does she believe that whole structure must be changed in order to get the services for mental health and physical health working together as she referenced in her statement?</p> <p>  In regard to a limit of eight sessions on the GMS medical card scheme, I am not sure of any other aspect of health care where barriers and limitations to the amount of treatment are put in place.  One often sees barriers in the treatment of end-stage disease, where the treatment is expensive.  Very rarely in my experience, and I have worked as a pharmacist in the NHS and as a community pharmacist in Ireland, does one see limitations being put on the prescriptions that one can get filled.  Something that was not raised during the proceedings but I have seen it happen in community pharmacy, is where private health insurers put a time limit on inpatient care in a psychiatric hospital.  It is one of the issues that nobody ever speaks about.  A consultant psychiatrist may prescribe that one stays in hospital but once a patient has reached his or her limit, one is turfed out or somebody has to pay to allow the patient to remain in hospital.  I do not know of any other aspect of health care, where that sort of discrimination is practised.  Has work been done on dealing with that issue?</p> <p>  With the rise in the rate of acute depression in the community during the recession, there is an onus on the patient to get better themselves.  If one is not a medical card patient and one presents with depression in the GP surgery, my experience is that the onus is on the patient to source a psychotherapist or a psychologist.  I have heard that six months of counselling for people with a treatable depression could cost about &euro;5,000 in professional fees.  I think that is an enormous barrier to getting oneself well.</p> <p>  Has Dr. McDaid any views on the regulation of rogue counsellors or people offering counselling services online to vulnerable patients?  It seem to be fairly widespread.  In regard to Dr. McDaid's reference to e-mental health, will she elaborate on it now or send me some data on it later?

It bring clarity to the situation.  I have two questions.  As a spokesperson on mental health, I have found that mental health permeates every Department, be it education, justice and equality, victims of crime and rural areas.  I came across a situation where the HSE refused to install a hoist for two mentally disabled children because it required a fixed hoist, which would require a slight adjustment to the wall and therefore the HSE ruled that it was now a matter for the county council.  In fairness, Wexford County Council stepped in and dealt with it.  I would have said it was not the responsibility of the county council but a matter for primary health care.  Will Dr. McDaid comment on integration of services even outside the health issue?</p> <p>  Will Dr. McDaid comment on the integration of common assessment tools?  I had a situation where it was considered that a very young child needed to see a psychologist because of a bereavement in the family, but after 18 months her mother got a letter stating that her five-year-old child would not be seen because mental health issues arising from bereavement were not covered.  However, in fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee is looking into this issue.  I would like to hear Dr. McDaid's views on common assessment tools.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shari McDaid" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#P00700"><p>I will respond to Deputy O'Connell's question on whether the problem in the lack of integration arises from the separation between acute hospitals and social care in our health structures.</p><p>In my view, that is not where the difficulty has arisen.  Let us look back at the primary care strategy published in 2001.  Unfortunately, it had described a rather limited role for mental health.  Mental health is hardly mentioned in that strategy.  Mental health workers were not described in that strategy as core to the primary care team.  In the 20 years since then, whatever investment has gone into primary care has gone into the core primary care team roles.  Mental health workers have literally slipped off the radar and off the agenda.  Primary care is where most of us get our health care.  If mental health care is not integrated in terms of designated mental health workers, the whole health system is neglecting that part of an individual's health at a structural level.</p><p> Reference was made to the counselling in primary care service being limited to eight sessions.  It was rather insightful to suggest that there is no other part of the health service where we ration in this way or where we say a patient can only have eight sessions.  In fairness to the counselling primary care service, I understand that there is some flexibility on a case-by-case basis.  However, relying on a case-by-case basis can be somewhat risky.  This is because if the message is put out from the start that an individual who takes up the service will only be assured of eight sessions, the patient may believe, even from the start, that the service will be unable to answer their needs and the person may not go near it.</p><p> That point was related to the question of the limitations of and what happens when private health insurance runs out for someone who is an inpatient.  I do not have enough detail to say exactly what happens to a person in that situation.  Theoretically, if a person still needed inpatient care, he or she could be transferred to an inpatient bed.  It should be the case that if a person needs inpatient care, as with any other health condition for which a person needs such care, the person will get as much as is required.  Having said that, we want to get to a point where far fewer people end up in inpatient care.  If we had more developed community-based mental health services and a good relationship between primary care and specialist mental health services, we would expect that fewer people would end up needing to take up inpatient beds.</p><p> A comment was made about the prevalence of people who have depression going to a general practitioner and being given a prescription and then encouraged to go to private counselling services.  That is simply not an adequate response.  The fact that such a response is even considered adequate reflects the historical Cinderella position of mental health care and the way it has not been taken seriously.  Certainly, that approach should play no part in the future vision of health care.  We should see something different.  Any health professional should have access to mental health supports for people and they should be publicly provided.  We should ensure that financial cost is no barrier to someone receiving mental health care, especially when we consider the cost of having a mental health difficulty in the workplace, absenteeism, presenteeism as well as the numbers of people on disability benefit and invalidity benefits because of a mental health condition.  Economically, it makes no sense to make it expensive for someone at the start of mental health treatment, especially when this barrier will lead to long-term higher costs.</p><p> A question was asked about the regulation of counsellors.  There is an urgent need for regulating the counselling and psychotherapy professions in the country because it is difficult to boost capacity in an unregulated system.  We would very much appreciate it if this were made a priority.</p><p> Reference was made to e-mental health.  One of the leading countries in this area is Europe is Netherlands.  We are in partnership with five other countries in a north western Europe e-mental health project.  One of the partner countries is Netherlands.  We would be glad to supply the committee with further information on developments on the project.</p><p> I thank Deputy Browne for his question on how other Departments needs to play a role.  I will offer another example of what is needed.  Currently, we are piloting the best practice approach to supportive employment to help people with mental health difficulties to get back to work.  There are some key barriers to people getting back to work when they have a mental health difficulty.  Let us suppose a person is not allowed to drive because of the medication he or she is receiving.  Moreover, let us suppose he or she is living in a rural community and there is no transport option for that person.  He or she will be literally trapped at home and unable to take up employment opportunities.  That is a good example of how decisions about initiatives to provide transport in rural communities need to have a mental-health-in-all-policies approach.  Such decisions need to have a mental health lens in which the mental health impact is considered, whether positive or negative, of an initiative to provide rural transport.  Such an initiative is needed to help people of working age to get to places of work.  It is not only a question of helping those outside the workforce to get to social activities.  This is a very good reason that we need a mental-health-in-all-policies approach to be considered by every Department.</p><p> I was asked about common assessment tools.  The question raised related to a child not being assessed for 18 months and remaining on a waiting list for 18 months to be assessed by the child and adolescent mental health services, only for the child to be deemed ineligible for support.  I am sorry for being repetitive, but again this speaks to the point that if we had adequate assistance in primary care, that scenario might not have arisen.  If we had skilled mental health workers like psychologists in primary care, they could provide the necessary assessment quickly.  In that way, they should be in a position to say quickly whether the child needed to be referred to the child and adolescent mental health services.  That would be far preferable to a child sitting on a list, a child whose whole life might be changed by that period of 18 months without getting the mental health addressed.  I hope that helps to answer that question.</p></speech>

We are moving on to a different but somewhat related aspect of community and social care, with a particular emphasis on supports for older people in the community.  I apologise for the delay and am sorry the witnesses were waiting so long.  Notwithstanding that, I want to extend a very warm welcome to them all.  We are joined by Dr. Michael Browne, author of the report of the Forum on Long-Term Care for Older People; Professor Cillian Twomey, co-chair of the forum, retired consultant geriatrician and former president of the IMO; Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke, co-chair of the forum and former member of the Law Reform Commission; and Mr. John Dunne, CEO of Family Carers Ireland.</p><p>In January, the advocacy and support organisation for older people, Sage, in partnership with Third Age, Family Carers Ireland and ALONE, sought submissions on the issue of long-term care for older people.  The report arising out of that consultation by the Forum on Long-Term Care for Older People, prepared by Dr. Michael Browne, has been circulated to members.  Dr. Browne will present on the findings and recommendations of the report and Mr. John Dunne, CEO of Family Carers Ireland, will present on the carer's perspective.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Browne to make the opening presentation.</p></speech>

By way of introduction, I would like to briefly state my position on this hugely important matter.  I have been around for some time and have been involved in research, policy analysis and reflection in this area for over 30 years, first as a research officer with the National Council on Ageing and Older People during the 1980s and 1990s and more recently with the Forum on Long-Term Care for Older People.  I was involved in preparing some background papers for the seminal 1988 report, The Years Ahead, and I believe the analysis and agenda for action set out in that report remain current and very relevant to the work of this committee.  In some respects, what I am saying is that we do not need to reinvent the wheel.</p> <p>  I do not intend to go over ground members already know and are only too familiar with from their deliberations and from their own personal experiences in dealing with constituents in various parts of the country.  Rather, I want to focus on what are the key areas that require concerted attention and action.  My colleagues, Professor Cillian Twomey and Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke, on foot of their respective professional backgrounds of medicine and law, will be able to provide detailed insight into specific aspects of the challenges facing the health and social care services as they apply to older persons.</p> <p>  I want to make the obvious point at the outset that the term "long-term care", as used in the forum, refers to the whole spectrum of support and care, not just nursing home care.  Indeed, we need to be mindful of the fact that most long-term care and support is provided in the community.  We are talking here about a relatively small cohort of the older population, but a cohort to which any of us may belong at some future date.  That should clearly be an impetus, if one were needed, for a whole-of-society approach to this issue.</p> <p>  There are some important pointers to where we are now and where we, as a society, need to be in terms of providing the type of health and social care infrastructure to which we all aspire for our older population.  First, there is a major discrepancy in the Irish health care system between the way care for people with acute illnesses and that for those with slow, debilitating illnesses such as dementia are funded.  A core question to be addressed by society and the Government is whether this is right or equitable.  Second, while there is broad acknowledgement of the principle of enabling people to exercise their will and preferences in the way care is provided, the reality is that some people who need to be in nursing homes end up there not by choice but because of a lack of appropriate community-based alternatives.  I venture to suggest that most of us will know people in that category.  Third, the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 are crucial in enabling people with reduced decision-making capacity to exercise their will and preferences.  The full implementation of this legislation is of critical importance, as is the enactment of legislation relating to the deprivation of liberty.  Fourth, there are some very obvious instances where, without good reason, both the level of services available and the way these services are delivered fall short of what is required.  For example, there is still much to be done to ensure that the design and location of nursing homes cater for key quality-of-life considerations such as links to the community, maximising individual capacity and catering for individual preferences.</p><p>Also, people's inability to access the therapies they require at a level commensurate with need impacts greatly on their quality of life, general well-being and, indeed, on their need to have to avail of expensive acute hospital services.</p><p> All the research evidence and reflected practice suggests that multi-purpose community-based units providing a continuum of support and care, such as day facilities, sheltered accommodation and nursing units, can contribute enormously to enabling people to live independently or semi-independently.  These should be made an integral part of the community care infrastructure.  Such models could be developed initially in locations where existing public long-term residential care facilities have been deemed to be no longer fit for purpose.   Some members may be aware of facilities with such potential in their constituencies.  Space might be found in such facilities for a coffee shop, a newsagent, a clothes boutique and perhaps a betting shop but other people in the community could use these facilities too.</p><p> The potential of appropriately designed housing in the provision of support and care has not been developed to date in Ireland.  There are appropriate models of housing with care that have been developed in other jurisdictions and there are some in Ireland that can and should be replicated nationwide.  Housing and health and social care can no longer remain parallel lines and must converge.  For this to happen we need to focus as much of our energy on local government as on national government and on housing policy as much as on health and social care policy.  There is a need for local authorities to take on much more responsibility for the provision of sheltered and supported housing.</p><p> More attention is required to ensure that best gerontological practice is always applied in meeting the specific nursing, medical and personal care requirements of people with complex care needs in both nursing homes and in the community.  There is a dearth of appropriately designed and staffed dementia-specific accommodation, including assisted living housing and full residential care.  This gap in provision needs to be addressed as matter of some urgency.  It is reasonable to suggest that people with dementia are among the most socially excluded groups in society.</p><p> The question of the respective responsibilities of the State, families and individuals in providing long-term care and support is one that has not been adequately addressed in Ireland to date.  I expect that Mr. John Dunne will have something to say later on this topic.</p><p> The nursing home support scheme, the so-called fair deal scheme, is a large area of health expenditure but there is little focus on outcomes, quality of life domains or on catering for the will and preference of people who require nursing home care.  The current model of fee negotiation between the National Treatment Purchase Fund and nursing homes is unsatisfactory, not least because it only provides for bed and board and takes no account of different individual care, support and quality of life needs.</p><p> The forum deliberations reiterated the point that much more can be done at local community level to prevent or delay the onset of conditions that require more extensive and expensive care and support, including, in particular, accessible transport and initiatives to combat social isolation and loneliness.  It is likely that a community-based social enterprise model of support and care delivery supported by the State has significant potential to target interventions at the lowest appropriate level.</p><p> Ireland can learn much from practice in other jurisdictions with particular reference to following: legal frameworks relating to people's rights in respect of long-term care and support; models of financing; the individualised payments approach that targeting resources around individuals; the optimal balance to be achieved between community-based care and residential care; the devolved responsibilities of local government or municipalities in providing long-term support and care, including housing; the integration of mainstream and specialised housing provision; and the use of assistive technology.  We can learn much under all of the headings I have just mentioned.</p><p> I will suggest five key questions that the committee needs to address.  What is the optimal level of support and care we wish to provide for older people with dementia and other chronic conditions?  What is the likely cost of this care?  How do we wish to fund it in the short, medium and long term?  How do we achieve an appropriate balance between funding provision for acute hospital care and funding for long-term care?  How can we achieve social and political consensus on these matters?</p><p> The areas that need new legislation are as follows: the financing of long-term care; providing a legal framework to provide equal access to community care and nursing home care; and the regulation of home care provision.  There are many areas where additional legislation is not required but rather a more targeted allocation of resources based on social consensus.</p><p> There is a broad consensus on the direction that our approach to supporting older people who need care should take.  This includes the need to cater for people in the community at the lowest appropriate level of complexity and the need to provide high quality residential care when and if this is needed.  This requires a greater mix of accommodation choices that is currently available and the application of best gerontological practice in all situations where older people require care and support.</p><p> We know what needs to be done as it has been articulated for the past 30 years at least.  Doing it demands new thinking and innovative approaches based on an ethic of solidarity that requires society to provide a long-term health and social care infrastructure that respects the inherent dignity and personhood of all irrespective of age.  As an absolute starting point we need to change the systemic bias in Ireland towards nursing homes.  This requires an enhanced budget for support and care in the community and legislation to enable provision and regulation for same.</p></speech>

I will start by endorsing what Dr. Browne has said in terms of the findings of long-term care report.  My role today is to broaden the agenda and consider the wider dimensions of family and community care in Ireland.  Family carers underpin and enable most of the major components of the current health strategy from accelerating hospital discharge to the treatment of chronic care in the community.  Whatever plans the committee recommends I have no doubt family carers will be central to their implementation and success.</p> <p>  As Dr. Browne said, there is a major discrepancy in the how the health service funds the care of people with acute illnesses and those with debilitating illnesses.  Between 2008 and 2015 the HSE has reduced its expenditure on home care by &euro;11 million despite the fact that the target population of older people has increased by 25%.  During the same period the HSE increased its spending on residential care by &euro;68 million.  In spite of all the rhetoric the pattern is getting worse.  One of the reasons is funding for nursing home care is available on a statutory basis but there is no equivalent provision in respect of funding for home care thus creating an imbalance in the system.</p></speech>

What other initiatives would he suggest?</p><p> It is not achievable to mandate powers of attorney and Ms Rickard-Clarke will be aware of this given her legal background.  Would a more prevalent use of these help in terms of knowing the wishes of the elder person if something goes awry or he or she suffers ill-health in respect of their accommodation?  What are Dr. Browne's views on retirement villages in general?  We do not have such villages in a private capacity in Ireland but they are prevalent in the US.

I am president of the European Network of Carer Organisations and the way we talk about primary care in Ireland is extraordinarily limited in a European context.  In Europe, the focus is not just on changing the institutional delivery of care; it is about remodelling the entire purpose of the care.  Hospitals deal with acute situations, which are a problem to be solved.  There is a commercial or industrial model around it.  In the community, they talk widely in Europe about a goal-oriented approach to health care.  The goal is not curing the condition; the goal is something that is negotiated with each individual in terms of the quality of life they want to achieve.  I have never heard that mentioned in the debate on primary care in Ireland.  We think that is the direction we should go and, to do that, we seek a community-based model of care, which recognises the importance of care in the home in our health system and gives statutory entitlement, among other things, to home care services, including respite.</p> <p>  An important consequence of our historic failures to address this is that Ireland operates a postcode lottery in the provision of community services.  I assume the committee will examine this aspect.  To make meaningful progress on this, we would focus initially on primary care networks.  It might be realistic to say that across 90 primary care networks, there should be a consistent delivery of a bundle of services within three to five years, allowing another six to ten years to complete that roll-out at the level of 542 primary care teams.  This is again a scenario where the best becomes the enemy of the good and timing is important.  If this is not addressed as an urgent issue, it will be talked about forever and never happen.  In that regard, we acknowledge that staff interests should be fully engaged in discussions about how this is to be achieved but one of the key principles the committee should be willing to endorse is that, in the final analysis, their interests must come second to the interests of patients.  That has not always been the experience in the past.</p> <p>  Links between primary and secondary care remain as they were characterised in 2010 to the Joint Committee on Health and Children as "poor, resulting in disjointed and unco-ordinated care pathways, with less than optimal results for patients".  Despite the HSE&rsquo;s new practical guide for discharge and transfer from hospital, patients are routinely discharged from hospital without a documented care plan or the necessary supports.  Carers' experience is usually a brief conversation in a hospital corridor and that is the limit of engagement on a care plan.  Part of a vision going forward should be a transfer of care protocol that would prevent hospitals dumping patients on the community care system.  We do not criticise the system for this.  Managers are often give a few hours notice to put in place a complex home care package, which is not realistic.  While we support the move to community health organisations and hospital groups, that creates a gap between two parts of the health system.  A formal transfer of care protocol would be a way to bridge that gap.</p> <p>  Much of what is going at the minute takes a problem-oriented acute care model from the hospital to a community care setting.  The hospital model is not particularly appropriate for treating chronic illnesses, which are usually characterised by comorbidities and long-term, indeterminate palliative care pathways.  Palliative care came into existence under a structured pattern of development of major cancers.  There are many other conditions about which people know what the ultimate outcome will be, but nobody can predict its path.  That is a totally different challenge in the context of positive caring and palliative care, which is not recognised within the system.  A shift to a goal-oriented approach could be key to that.  The experts say it fits a wider collection of conditions, is more compatible with a team-based approach, which fits the primary care vision, and places a greater emphasis on physician-patient collaboration rather than that the patient being the recipient of treatment from the clinical side.  The benefits of this approach include better balance between clinical and social care considerations and an improved approach to comorbidity and treatment of rare diseases.  If they are combined, as a group, they are the third most common condition in the country.  As individuals, people are isolated and left struggling as to how they fit within the system.  This approach also opens up the option of examining new concepts of what is a chronic condition.  For example, incontinence is more than three times as common as dementia or strokes and 1.5 times as common as diabetes and it is a major predictor of institutionalisation if it is not dealt with properly.  It also leads to many secondary problems but it is not recognised as something other than being treated by throwing pads at patients and that is the end of it.  This has to do with the way the care is framed.</p> <p>  Related to the shift to primary care is the question of shared responsibility.  We welcome research findings in a poll carried about Am&aacute;rach, which shows that people favour a model that shares responsibility for health care between State, the family and other actors.  Currently, while that is the case nominally, in practice, all gaps in care fall back on to the families, even at the cost of carers' health and well-being.  Family carers&rsquo; experience is their expertise and practical knowledge of the patient is not always taken into account by health professionals.  Carers are often not involved in care planning.  Care planning should be viewed as something to be negotiated between health professional, patient and carer.</p> <p>  The lack of clarity in sharing responsibility for health care between the State and family-community is only reinforced by the prevailing situation in which HSE acts as commissioner, provider and regulator in the home care sector.  This represents a significant complicating factor in any move towards a self-directed support model of home care, which is about to begin piloting with a view to national roll-out in 2018.  There is not realistic timeframe to achieve independent national oversight of home care.  This situation is not entirely of the HSE&rsquo;s making but it needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency on a statutory rather than administrative basis.  It is only as part of clarifying formal responsibility for various parts of the health care system that it will be possible to decide, for example, whether it makes sense to have home care formally regulated by HIQA or overseen by an ombudsman-type model.  For example, will we have a scenario where HIQA goes into people's homes and says they are not fit to provide care?  What will be the consequence of that?  We have witnessed the consequence in the formal system, where it was ignored for years before homes eventually shut down.  We will not be able to shut down people's homes.</p> <p>  The required shift to primary care will increase the system's dependence on a hidden workforce of more than 200,000 family carers on which the health care system depends.  This dependence will only increase in coming years.  Today, one in 20 people in Ireland is a family carer but, by 2030, demographic changes will require one in five of us to undertake this role.</p> <p>  The economic case for safeguarding family care into the future is clear given that family carers provide 6.2 million hours of unpaid care each week, saving the State more than &euro;4 billion each year in avoided health and social care costs.  That is an extremely conservative calculation.  Economics aside, it is socially and political significant that a majority of people want to play a significant role in the care of their loved ones when they fall ill and that they want a health system that will support them to do this.</p> <p>  Based on our current experience of supporting family carers, we recommend, as the committee frames its proposals for the future of the health system, that the following measures should be put in place to expand family caring in line with wider demographic changes: information campaign to promote earlier self-identification by family carers because otherwise they would not get on a proper trajectory for a sustainable care plan; integrated information, training and peer networking supports for family carers being consistently and readily available in each primary care network area within the next three years; carer assessment based on validated well-being scales and appropriate interventions to assist family carers who are being overwhelmed by their particular circumstances - CSAR and InterRAI which are tools used by the HSE are important and useful but they are resource allocation tools, which are not capable of fulfilling the carer need assessment role; availability of appropriate home care services along with person-centred and flexible respite options; and guaranteed access to appropriate respite options and provision for orderly planning and transition when a family carer becomes incapable of sustaining their caring role.</p><p>Arguably, one of the biggest blocks to people taking on a caring role is that if they are not able to keep it up, a situation could worsen.  The State needs to recognise this and provide for it.  There must also be proper facilities to support the health and well-being of family carers, including screening, respite cover for medical procedures and medical cards for full-time carers in receipt of the carer's allowance.  The number of family carers who wait years for a medical procedure for themselves only to have to decline it when offered because they cannot put an alternative care arrangement in place is depressing.  Additional measures to support people balancing a family care role and paid employment will also be important into the future.  Such measures should be planned and implemented in the context of the ongoing renewal of the national carers' strategy on a rolling four-year basis.  In time, this should be underpinned by a carers' Act similar to that enacted in Scotland this year.</p><p> Family Carers Ireland supports placing primary care at the heart of Ireland's health service with a view to moving towards a goal-oriented approach to treating progressive life-limiting conditions in the community.  To underpin this, we are calling for the establishment of a community-based model of care which recognises the importance to our health system of care in the home and gives statutory entitlement to home care services, including respite.  Any long-term strategy must address the question of restructuring and redistribution of resources and the reorientation of these to support care in the home and community.  There is not much disagreement about what needs to happen.  It is just that nothing is happening.  It is critical that this committee's final report contributes to framing an analysis and strategy to this challenge, not least because Ireland's health care policy is confronted by a growing legitimisation crisis, which is defined as a decline in confidence in the administration functions, institutions and leadership of the system.  We believe this is probably the biggest challenge facing the health care system and the work of this committee.</p></speech>

I apologise for the low attendance which is due to an earlier session of the meeting running on for longer than expected and the fact the D&aacute;il is now in session.  There is also a health conference on today at which two of the committee's members are speaking this morning.  I would like, however, to reassure the witnesses that their submissions and contributions this morning will be taken into consideration by the committee's research team who are working on the drafting of its report.</p> <p>  I would like to take up a couple of points with both witnesses.  There is no doubt that at a constituency level one of the biggest issues is the lack of home care and home help services.  For the first time in my experience there are long waiting lists for home care services generally.  It is now common practice for people in their 80s and 90s to be put on waiting lists.  I have never seen the situation as bad.  I accept the suggestion, in principle, that there should be a statutory entitlement to home care services, as in the case of nursing home care.  However, an aspect of that approach that concerns me and which has been alluded to by Dr. Browne is that when it comes to nursing home care, we are charging people for care in respect of which in any other setting, including acute hospital care, there is no charge.  I would welcome the witnesses' view on the principle of a person in his or her advanced years who needs additional care being charged for that care, albeit after their passing.  My concern is that if we move to a system of statutory entitlement to home care, there will be a proposal to charge people for that as well.  I would also welcome the witnesses' views on the funding model that should be pursued in both respects.</p> <p>  Moving on to day care services, I have seen a few examples of pretty good day care centres.  They are certainly very popular and are an important element of community care.  The witnesses might comment on day care services, which is an issue I do not think either of them have commented on thus far.  On the need to combine housing and health care services, I agree with the point made earlier about our not being very good at doing that.  There are very strict demarcation lines between the HSE and local authorities and we need to join up thinking in this regard.  I believe there is a need for a particular type of vehicle to do that.  Other than simply saying both agencies need to work more closely together, we need to provide a vehicle through which there would be structured co-operation between the two authorities to achieve what is desired.  There are a small number of examples of good quality supported housing for older people with ancillary services and so on, but they are the exception rather than the rule.  Do the witnesses' have any ideas in terms of how this combining of services might be approached in structural terms?</p></speech>

The point was made that carers are neglecting their own health and failing to undergo medical procedures because they are unable to put in place alternative care arrangements.  That is very alarming.  Time and again we have heard at this committee, including again today, that there is a lack of leadership and confidence in the system.  This is very disappointing.  Reference is made on page 25 to the shortfalls in community and care services and to the State having a statutory obligation to provide support to people in nursing homes but that it is under no legal obligation to provide community-based services.  It is almost certain that the inadequacy of support services for care in the home continues to be the key factor in determining the need for residential care.  I understand the point that where there is action there is instant reaction and that in this instance a lack of action in terms of supporting older people within their communities will lead to their ending up in residential care and, thus, increased cost to the State.  Perhaps the witnesses' would elaborate on that point and on my earlier point regarding the lack of leadership and confidence in the system which they said is resulting in morale within the system being very low.</p></speech>

What is the real impact on the ground of the lack of services in psychiatry of old age?</p> <p>  In regard to vulnerable older people, what in legal terms is required for the increased protections of people, in particular in home care situations where much of the care is now being provided by agency staff and in respect of which, as mentioned earlier, there is no oversight?  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, inspects residential institutions, but there is no oversight of the care being provided in people's homes.  I have heard a few horror stories in that regard from people working in the industry.</p></speech>

I will respond later to Deputy Browne's questions.  I will ask my colleagues, Ms Rickard-Clarke and Professor Twomey, to respond to the questions regarding the regulation and oversight of home care and the psychiatry of old age and its contribution, respectively.</p></speech>

I chair the national inter-sectoral safeguarding committee which was established last December.  We are formulating our strategy plan for the next five years.  The key issue to have is a legislative framework for safeguarding.  At present, we have the HSE safeguarding service and office, but it works very much on an administrative basis and there is a difficulty where serious issues arise because it is not on a statutory basis as nursing homes refuse safeguarding officers.</p> <p>  Another key factor for very vulnerable old people is an independent advocate.  The national safeguarding committee would like full legislation on the need for an independent advocate.  Mr. Dunne mentioned the care legislation in Scotland.  We need to replicate the provisions on safeguarding in the UK Care Act 2014.  The UK Mental Capacity Act 2005 provides for a system of independent mental capacity advocates for vulnerable people.  They must be appointed for a vulnerable person, including an older person, particularly in certain circumstances.  One of these is admission to a nursing home, residential care or an acute hospital over a certain period of time.  It is with regard to their protection, care needs and serious decisions being made on their medical treatment.  This advocacy is independent of everybody, which is extremely important.  The Support and Advocacy Service for Older People, SAGE, tries to do this, but it is difficult without a statutory framework.</p> <p>  With regard to equality, we have the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, which was ratified in December 2015.  We had a commencement order on 17 October establishing the decision support service and we will ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities before the end of the year.  This all means rights and equality.  For older people in particular, we do not have these rights and equality but we will ratify the convention and we have legislation which states the wishes of the person are extremely important.  We have a lack of equality between acute hospital care and long-term care, and the choice and wish of people to decide where they wish to be.  If we are to sign and ratify the convention we must step up to this.</p> <p>  Another piece of legislation coming before the Oireachtas by the end of the year to complete our obligations under the UN convention is the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill regarding the right of people to decide where they wish to reside.  We do not have any procedure at present.  The European Convention on Human Rights has very clear provisions on prisoners who are charged and people who have been involuntarily detained for mental health reasons, but we have no procedures in law and are completely in breach of the European Convention with regard to very vulnerable people who are put into nursing homes against their will and who do not have a choice on where they want to live and their supports.  When we have this legislation and we ratify the convention we must find the budget to step up to the mark.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.704" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Cillian Twomey" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#V00200"><p>I thank Deputy Browne for the question.  If consultant manpower levels are inadequate for consultants in old age psychiatry, as they are, there is a deficit in the service provision.  It is unequally distributed.  This applies to care of older people in general and care of people with chronic illnesses of all ages.  What is required is a multidisciplinary package.  The straight answer to the question is there should be more consultants in old age psychiatry.<br/><br/>I was appointed as a geriatrician in 1979 and I was the sixth geriatrician appointed in the country at the time.  There are now approximately 110 geriatricians in Ireland.  At a time when everyone is going berserk about how awful things are, it is fair and right one should acknowledge there have been some improvements.  There is an endless demand for health care, and no matter what the committee comes up with at the end of its deliberations it will still not satisfy most people because this is the nature of the service, but there is a fundamental inequity in what is done to people with chronic illness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>those who are acutely ill.  If I get a stroke, go to hospital, get thrombolysis, then get a complication with my heart, go into heart failure, get kidney failure, need dialysis and ultimately need a transplant, I will get all of this fantastically well serviced in the country, and we need to remind ourselves of this.  No matter what my age is, this is what I will get.  However, if I survive until 75 and get a stroke, having never once cost the State anything in terms of health care, and I am incapacitated by the stroke, the first questions I will be asked is when I will go home or what home I will go to, what property I own and about my money.  This is completely and utterly fundamentally flawed.  There is a basic fundamental inequity in the way we approach illnesses in people with chronic disease as opposed to acute illness, and the committee cannot avoid addressing this question.<br/><br/>The question how this can be dealt with was asked and it is a fair question.  All of us have a responsibility to provide for the needs of all people.  It is a combination of general taxation and social insurance.  This is what it should be.  If a 20 year old betting man was asked to pay more tax to look after Johnny McGuirk or Cillian Twomey if they get a stroke in 100 years time, his answer would be no.  That man would not believe he would be affected because 90% of people who reach the age of 80 are healthy, but this is not the point.  A civil society in my view has a responsibility.  We do not say this sufficiently and we give lip service to choice.  People are sent into nursing homes because there is nowhere else to go.  Why is it they are either independent at home or in long-term care?  The village-type idea promoted in this morning's presentation has much to commend it.  We have given huge financial incentives to build nursing homes.  Why do we not incentivise more humane alternative supports in the community for people, which would include, as Dr. Browne said, such facilities as a shop and a betting shop so it becomes an integral part?<br/><br/>The Years Ahead report in 1988 prescribed all of this.  The committee will write a report which will tell us what we should do in 2016 and onwards.  I invite committee members to read The Years Ahead.  It speaks about integration and linking housing with health, transport and social supports.  It states it is not just about illness and medical issues but about social issues.  It is all there.  An implementation plan was put with it and it was priced.  Dr. Ruth Barrington was its lead author.  We are honours graduates in this country at reports.  We are the greatest on earth at reports.  I would like to see one or two of them implemented.  The Years Ahead contains an awful lot of what would be good for chronic illness in our society.</p></speech>

It is a fact that many carers defer medical treatment and as soon as the person they are caring for dies or goes into long-term residential care they then begin to get their own health looked after.  It is insane, if we think about it, that someone saving the State so much money is allowed to encourage their own health to deteriorate to a point where there are two charges on the health budget instead of one saving.</p><p>That is the fact, however, though the system does its best.  I was approached recently on the subject of whether we could encourage carers to be more active in screening programmes.  That would be a good thing as it would be preventative, but if they are screened and told there is a problem, there is no way the system can step in and do something about it.  It would be a small example of joined-up thinking and a small part of what we see as the ethos of goal-directed primary care.  We are 1,000% in favour of the retirement community model because it includes day respite and short respite breaks, which are part of the live-in community.  Independent living in retirement communities is an excellent part of the total spectrum of care in the home.</p><p> If somebody provides intensive care at home and is about to go into hospital themselves, the only option is for somebody else to come into the home on a live-in basis, which is ideal but very difficult to achieve in practice, or to have short-term respite break beds.  In recent years most such beds have been displaced.  They might have been shut down because the facilities in which they were based were deemed inadequate or they have been converted into step-down beds for acute hospitals.  There are large chunks of the country where one cannot get a respite bed anymore.  In some places there is one building with maybe four beds.  It is effectively rationed out and one week it is for adults, one week it is for children and one week it may be for the elderly.</p><p> I was asked about costs and the funding model.  All community health care organisations are roughly the same size in population but CHO 9, Dublin north, accounts for between one quarter and one third of all home care packages in Ireland.  If there are waiting lists in Dublin north, there are serious problems.</p></speech>

We latched onto the problem with fair deal when we came across cases where a person was <i>in extremis</i>and a health service manager said he or she could not give people home care support but could put them in institutional care.  A person looking for &euro;200 to stay at home was offered &euro;1,000 because there was a statutory entitlement to that funding.  Four or five years ago we were saying this was insane and we have said it every year since.  It is great that people are now beginning to focus on it but we did not set out to propose a fair deal model for community care.  We said that by introducing fair deal with a statutory basis for one sort of funding, we have destabilised and created a perverse incentive within the system.  If somebody who qualifies for fair deal could be offered a package of home care which is cheaper, would it not make sense to allow fair deal funding under the legislation?  Fair deal funding has ballooned, and while it is all very well to have a statutory entitlement, if the funding is not in place, we are left with a big waiting list.  Under fair deal there was a statutory entitlement and a big waiting list until the funding was increased and there was an improvement in supply.  In community care there is no statutory entitlement but there are still waiting lists.  The key to it is the funding level.  We suggested accessing the fair deal funding if it was going to be cheaper.  The magic number is &euro;41,400 per year.  In other words, that is the net cost of fair deal after the family contribution under the scheme.  This would provide five hours care in the home per day, seven days per week, which is approaching a Rolls-Royce home care package, for the same cost and with no contribution required.<br/><br/>An extension to or variation of the fair deal scheme to community care has been suggested.  The fair deal model levies savings, which is fair enough.  It also levies income, but it seems a bit crazy to reduce the income going into a house where the house is providing the care out of that income.  The house is also being used as a centre of care so it is difficult to understand why some of the value of the house should be consumed to fund it.  The funding model for fair deal does not look like a very good fit except, perhaps, in the case of assets.  We have consulted widely on this and the feedback from carers has been that if they could be guaranteed the quantum and quality of supports they needed, they would be willing to look at any arrangement.  They also said that, as things are at the moment, they have zero faith in the capacity of the system to deliver it.  At the moment they would see any move in the direction of front-loaded charging as a grab on funding with no assurance of the quality of what would follow.  Carers recognise the reality of budgets and challenges but it does not make sense to reduce their income when they are trying to do a job.  The fair deal model, as it stands, would not work.  A modified fair deal is not out of the question in principle but it would have to be backstopped by categoric assurances of the quantum and quality of the services that would be provided once somebody started paying for them.</p></speech>

If we say "fair deal" often enough there will be a presumption that something fair is going on but there can be absolutely nothing fair about fair deal until we apply it across the board.  There is no will to do that and I am not advocating it but there would at least be consistency about it.  I agree with Mr. Dunne that there are differences between supporting somebody at home and putting a person in residential care.  Mervyn Taylor is fed up of me saying that the nursing home support scheme, NHSS, is a clever, disingenuous label which I call the "unfair deal".  It has established itself in people's minds as something fantastic for the senior citizens of this country but it is, in my view, a disgrace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.713" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#W00500"><p>Mr. Dunne spoke about regulation of home care.  The 2011 report of the Law Reform Commission on legal aspects of professional home care dealt with how home care could be regulated.  It contemplated HIQA setting up standards equivalent to the standards it has for nursing homes or residential care for people with disabilities.  The commission also set out the different levels of care.  Assessment of need is one but more important is a consideration of the outcomes, and it suggested a review from time to time as people grew older and their needs changed.  The commission drew attention to the different levels involved, from low-level care such as companionship care - and many are in nursing homes because of social isolation - through intermediate level care where a person is helped with bathing and other things, to the advanced level involving nurses.  These things would be reflected in the professional staff required.  The service provider would be regulated and the recipient would contract with the service provider.  One of the great difficulties of home care is that families, or the older person living on their own, are struggling to be the employer but that does not work.  There should be a system whereby the HSE or private providers are regulated.  The principles set out in the report, such as independence and choice in quality care, are very clear.  The quality of home care goes from zero to very good and there is no regulation which gives rise to issues relating to safeguarding and abuse.</p> <p>  Deputy Madigan asked about EPAs.  We have had enduring powers of attorney legislation since 1996.</p><p>We have since had a Council of Europe recommendation on people's right to autonomy and self-determination and the recommendation that all states have detailed legislation on enduring powers of attorney and advance health care directives.  We have had legislation in place since 1996, but there has been no national campaign on it.  In the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act we have reformed legislation on enduring powers of attorney and, thankfully and at long last, a legal framework for advance health care directives.  While advance health care directives have been recognised by the courts, for the most part they were disregarded in practice because we did not have a statutory framework.  A commencement order to set up the working group on advance health care directives was made on 17 October; therefore, that work has started, which is very welcome.  One of the causes of great delays in the discharge of people from acute care settings is the conundrum that a person's wishes are not known, there are no formal plans in place and a family are arguing with different views on the matter.</p><p> In addition, under the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act the office of director in the decision support service has now been established.  The first function of the director specified in the Act is to conduct a public awareness campaign.  We must have a national campaign on EPAs and advance health care directives, as well as a campaign to generate public awareness of what we must all do to plan for our future.  Of course, the office will also supervise the area in which in the past there was a lack of safeguards for existing EPAs.  That issue is dealt with in the new legislation; therefore, the role of the director will be very important.  Anybody who wishes to make a complaint about any of the intervenors mentioned in the Act such as an attorney, a designated health care representative, a decision support person and so forth can make it to the director.  It does not involve a court application.  At present, it involves a very expensive court application under EPAs.  The director can carry out investigations formally and informally and can refer a matter to court, if necessary.</p><p> There is a final point to be made on EPAs which is extremely important.  I have heard people say many times that a solicitor is required and that it is expensive to do.  They do not realise the Free Legal Advice Centres can undertake EPAs.  That is very important and should be promoted in order that people who ask about the matter in a community centre will be told where they should go to avail of the service or that there will be a person from FLAC visiting the community centre to facilitate those who wish to plan for their future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.715" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Browne" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016110900002#X00200"><p>I will return to the Chairman's question on funding and make two comments, one of which is that we must look at the issue in a general way, but it is also something that should not be landed on people at a stage when they require high level of support and care.  It is something that must be thought about and planned for as a society.  On that basis, we must revisit the Mercer 2002 report on the financing of long-term care, in which a number of aspects were examined and considered and some proposals were made.  We do not have time to discuss them today, but it would be worthwhile for the committee to consider the report.  In other words, everybody knows from an early stage that there will be the question of the funding of their long-term care and there should be a system in place that is fair and equitable to do this.  My point is that it is an issue for society.</p> <p>  The second point made was related to the housing-health interface.  It is very tricky.  It is tricky primarily because of the type of administrative system in place in Ireland, under which there is silo funding from the top Department down to local government or the HSE.  One way to deal with this is in the context of local government reform, an we have mentioned regularly and we have been asked by the OECD and various other bodies to examine it.  Some type of administrative structure to enable the pooling of resources at local administrative level, within which housing and health services would be integrated, is the only way by which we will be able to deal with it.  It is tricky and a challenge, but we can do it.</p> <p>  I refer to the community care service and the dearth of supports and services.  Obviously, it is evident that this dearth of services creates problems, but I wish to refer to simple things such as easier access to physiotherapy, occupational therapy and house adaptations.  These adaptations might be relatively minor; they might involve the provision of grab rails, accessible ramps, toilets and so forth.  At that level there is great potential for more interventions at relatively low cost.  In that regard, there must be somebody in the community - I am not sure whether it would be the role of the social worker or perhaps some other person - to pull these aspects together at what I term the lowest level of complexity.</p> <p>  A couple of points were raised by Deputy Josepha Madigan.  One concerned initiatives to combat social isolation.  The fundamental and crucial issue is that there is premature disengagement of people from society.  Why, as a society, do we communicate the message, at a very subtle level, that somebody no longer has a contribution to make either to the workforce or the community?  We must deal with that issue at a fundamental level because people have a significant and enormous contribution to make on an ongoing basis.  Many make it, but some do not.</p> <p>  On the question of retirement, I am a little concerned about the notion of segregation.  While I see the potential, we used to have a lovely concept - I am speaking about the ideal - which I believe was mentioned in a report some years ago from the Department with responsibility for the environment.  It was a report on building sustainable communities.  We should hold in so far as possible to the concept of sustainable communities, inclusive of everybody, within which we can have the concept of the multi-purpose unit.  Three aspects of that vision are important.  We must make provision for what might colloquially be termed people who are a "go go", people who are a "slow go" and people who are "no go" in terms of mobility.  That is where we need to be and the type of concept we should move towards.</p> <p>  There is the question of leadership in the system which was raised by a few members.  We probably need innovative and inspirational leadership, but I have no idea from where it will come.  It can come from either a political level or an innovation level from a charismatic individual, but we need it.  We must change the narrative and the discourse.  We need to regard older people, even those with dementia or other chronic conditions, as essential and integral parts of communities.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the committee members for the chance to give them an update on how the work on the national planning framework is going and our plan to timeline over the coming months.  We have been working on this for quite a while.  We have had much extensive engagement.  We briefed Oireachtas Members last July on the overall structure and the plans for the national planning framework.  This meeting is a very useful opportunity for us to bring forward some of the key ideas that are emerging and particularly to hear the committee's views on and have its input to the process.  There is a huge amount of work beyond our summary presentation.  We will be able to provide further detail and evidence to underpin many of the principles and priorities that will emerge.</p> <p>  We foresee a very important role for the committee, especially as we hope the NPF will be progressed through the Oireachtas process and ultimately adopted by the Oireachtas under the proposed new legislation in the Planning and Development Acts.  The presentation will give the committee a good sense of our progress on some of the key challenges.  The fundamental question we in the Department and many other stakeholders are asking is what kind of country we want in 20 years time and, perhaps more important, how we get there.  The "how" is very important.  I hope the committee's input today, our further thoughts and the views from the regions and the Irish Planning Institute will be very valuable in that.  I will pass over to Mr. Hogan who will run through the detail.</p></speech>

It is a long timeline.  The national planning framework, Ireland 2040, will be the successor to the national spatial strategy, which was the one and only previous national spatial planning document.  As such, Ireland 2040 will be the spatial expression of Government policies.  It will draw together all the different Departments' priorities that have a spatial dimension.  It is led by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government but is a whole-of-Government document.  It will be necessarily high level and strategic, given that it must address national priorities and development goals, but it will be developed in parallel with and will lead into the three regional assemblies' regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, which will commence as soon as we have a draft national planning framework.  As such, the national planning framework, together with the three RSESs, will be the basis for more joined-up policies and balanced regional development and will be the basis for or form the backdrop to planning investment and decision-making.</p> <p>  We all have a sense of the opportunities and challenges facing us as a country, but if we look 20 years or more ahead, it is likely that we will have to plan for up to an additional 1 million people in the country.</p><p>Over the past 20 years there has been in excess of that and we expect somewhere approaching that in most growth scenarios over the next 20 years or more.  The likelihood is that because the population is ageing and household size is falling, the number of additional households will greatly exceed the average divided into a number of extra people.  This means that we are looking at a minimum requirement of 500,000 additional households over the same period and this is a continuation of the current requirement of 25,000 homes per annum every year for the next 20 or more years.  Although we will have a smaller workforce relative to the size of population, we will more than likely exceed the previous peak employment number of 2.2 million people.  Against that backdrop we have looked at current trends over the past 20 years and there is a marked trend towards employment concentrating in and around larger towns and cities, yet housing has dispersed further and further beyond the settlements into the surrounding areas and around the edge of settlements themselves.  When this is combined with an ageing population, with commitments to climate change and emissions, with expenditure considerations of service delivery and public expenditure and quality of life, we face considerable challenges.</p><p> The national planning framework, our national plan, is recognised as essential to ensure sustainable development goals.  It has been referenced in the programme for Government.  It has been cited by the action plan for housing as being important to a number of objectives.  It is also referenced in the planning policy statement which dates from last year.  In order for it to work, it is clear that the national planning framework must be backed by a wider policy alignment across all Departments and it requires alignment between planning and investment.  That is one of the criticisms with regard to the previous national spatial strategy.  The national planning framework will have statutory backing - this was the first planning recommendation of the Mahon tribunal, and this is covered under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill which, I believe, is on Second Stage.  Since the national spatial strategy was done 15 years ago we have significantly changed environment legislation.  It is now a requirement that the whole strategy would be subject to strategic environmental assessment.  That may have a bearing also.</p><p> The schematic which members have sets out the national planning policy hierarchy; the national planning framework is at the top, the three regional spatial and economic strategies feed on from that and these influence the relevant city and county development plans and local economic and community plans at a local authority level.  It cascades down from a strategic to a more detailed local level.  With regard to the experience of the national spatial strategy, NSS, and our ambition for this project, we have concluded that the NSS offers an invaluable learning experience, and we could talk a lot about that but we want to move forward.  There was an expert advisory group report commissioned in 2014.  It is a short report that recommended that a future spatial strategy would be more focused, shorter, higher level and would deal with hard choices as required.  One of the important recommendations also was that rather than having a wish list of things it would be a genuine strategy combining the desired objectives together where they can have best effect.</p><p> The evidence from the preliminary census this year, and we will have more census data in the coming months, confirms what I have already said about the dispersal of population and the concentration of employment.  It is clear that growth is increasingly happening, particularly population growth but also economic growth, around our key cities and towns.  This growth is not so much in the urban settlements themselves but in their hinterlands.  If we talk about Galway, Cork or the mid-east region of Leinster, that hinterland area is where the fastest growth continues to be.  We are seeing a trend towards increasing vacancy within our urban areas and more development led growth at the edge manifest as sprawl, as it would be commonly known.  I believe there is a kind of parallel in that some of the more inaccessible or remote rural areas of the State share some of the characteristics of the central urban areas where there is a fall in population and a feeling that services are no longer available to people.</p><p> It is clear that the national planning framework must be different from the national spatial strategy and the key lessons are that it requires a whole-of-Oireachtas approach and that a degree of support, or a majority of support, will be necessary.  Rolling Government buy-in through funding and other supportive means would also be important to underpin the implementation of such a strategy.  With regard to the actual content of the document, it will be important that it addresses each region's different potential and avoids the concept or the perception that there would be winners and losers, as has been the case in the past.  That does not mean that everywhere can be treated in the same way - different areas have different levels of potential, but it can certainly be analysed, influenced and progressed for the benefit of everywhere, if we can get it right.  The ambition is that Ireland 2040, or the national planning framework, must, through an evidence base, establish a plan making vision that people will understand and buy into as a plan that can be realistic and responsive.  It needs to be adaptable over time as clearly things will change.  We cannot anticipate everything that is going to happen over 20 years and we need to build in a mechanism for review.</p><p> There are four key areas of the work programme, namely, the governance of the project, communication and consultation, framework development and environmental assessment.  With regard to governance we have put a structure in place, with the national planning framework team at the core of this at the moment, to progress the material to move the project ahead.  The team is reporting to a cross-departmental steering group that involves representation from all the different Departments and the regional assemblies.  This is chaired by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We are also establishing an advisory group to reflect a broad range of sectoral and other interests.  Feeding into this team is a series of working groups to address important aspects of the project such as the environmental assessments, demographics and more day-to-day and month-to-month interactions with the regional assemblies.</p><p> I will now turn to the education and consultation area of the programme.  As Mr. Walsh has said, we undertook some initial high level engagement with stakeholder engagement in July.  One aspect of this included a briefing to Members of the Oireachtas.  We invited a range of different bodies, including infrastructure agencies, environmental and business groups and people who are concerned with society generally, to a series of events and posed a number of questions.  We facilitated responses to get a feel for what people's views were.  We have drafted a report on that engagement which will be made available as part of our general public consultation which we expect to launch in January.  For those members who are familiar with the local development plan process, the pre-draft consultation in January is an opportunity for all interested citizens in our society to interact with the process and to give their views before we prepare a plan.  We will prepare an issues and options paper to provide information at a number of different levels.  There will be a basic summary overview as well as some more detail for those who are interested.  The intention is that we will have a draft national planning framework by the second quarter of 2017.</p><p> The sort of questions we have been asking and on which we will reflect in the issues paper and for public consultation are what Ireland should look like in 20 years and how we ensure every place can realise its potential.  We posed questions about jobs, housing, services and the wider context such as Northern Ireland and the relationship between the two islands and the EU.  We also asked about the key environmental challenges, national infrastructure priorities, what the game changers might be, how we would implement a strategy into the future and what success might look like with regard to the outcomes at the end.</p><p>With regard to framework development, we are obviously taking on board what we hear from the stakeholders, regional assemblies and others.  The public stage is next.  We are certainly influenced by the Scottish national planning framework.  A slide shows the cover of the third planning framework for Scotland, which is a very useful document.  It seeks to strike a very good balance between addressing the whole of the territory without getting into very great detail that should be dealt with at a more regional or local level.</p><p> We are working with the Economic and Social Research Institute on demographic and econometric modelling projecting what the future might hold although it is not necessarily a predict-and-provide economics-led model.  We must obviously take into consideration a whole range of other societal factors, including geography.  We are using the model, however, to test some of the more technical scenarios in terms of what different options might lead us to or result in.  There is an environmental assessment under way.  We have appointed the consultant RPS to do that work on our behalf.  </p><p> On the modelling inputs, the spatial data modelling and mapping services are being provided by the All-Ireland Research Observatory team in National University of Ireland Maynooth.  We are a small team within the Department but we are working with a range of outside bodies and are very much open to all of that.</p><p> The second last slide shows where we got to in terms of strategic issues and policy choices.  The key question regarding how we approach the way forward concerns determining the extent to which we follow the business-as-usual scenario, which is really pointing to an increasing level of development in Leinster, influenced by Dublin.  Having said that, Dublin is critical to the national economy.  It is not a case of Dublin or somewhere else but of Dublin and everywhere else.  In getting to this stage, one of the first points we want to address is planning for people.  In other words, it is a matter of determining what planning means for people over the course of the period we are talking about, particularly in terms of society and quality of life.  Ultimately, people are concerned about what it means for them and their standard of living.</p><p> The second set of factors is really about the place-making strategy, which is really what the special planning is about, starting off with a vision for Dublin but then covering other cities and towns.  There is an important role for elsewhere, such as regional cities and larger towns.  We also need to examine the strengths and opportunities for the regions.  By "the regions", we mean everywhere else in Ireland.  We must determine how development can be balanced appropriately.  It is important that we consider a future for rural areas.  The backdrop has been one of growth, certainly over the past 20 years, but the resilience may have been challenged owing to population decline, certainly in the north and west, over the past five years.  We need to consider a strategy to address that.</p><p> We must also consider the all-island, European and global contexts.  We operate in a very uncertain, changing world.  While we cannot account for everything, we must be adaptable enough to make changes if and when required.  We must co-operate with our neighbours.</p><p> Regarding opportunities for integrated land and marine development, the concept of marine spatial planning is one which we are obliged to put a system in place to deal with over the next few years.  The national marine territory is ten times larger than the national land territory.  A system must be set up as part of the process.</p><p> With regard to equipping Ireland for future development, we are talking about infrastructure and infrastructure co-ordination.  Obviously, it is also about aligning investment and setting out what the priorities might be.  An important balance must be struck by us between identifying key national projects and a lot of local and longer-term projects that follow.</p><p> On making a virtue out of Ireland's unique environment, an issue arises over environmental stewardship.  I refer to the environment as a resource and also as a unique asset to be protected in some instances.</p><p> With regard to implementation and delivery, we must ensure the NPF is not just a book that sits on a shelf.  It must be followed up and have meaning by being adopted across government.</p><p> I have mentioned environmental assessment already.  It must tie in to the framework development process.  At different stages, we must produce the various reports.  It covers flooding and habitats.</p><p> With regard to the project timetable, we are finalising the issues and options paper as well as a communications strategy for our expected launch of the consultation process after Christmas, in January.  We are keen to work with the committee throughout the process and to take feedback.  It is likely there will be a period for submissions extending to the end of February.  Then there will be a draft NPF for further consultation in the second quarter of the year.  That will probably be after Easter, which is in mid-April.  It will be April or May, at the earliest.  It is possible for us to have a final draft for approval by the summer.  That is the most ambitious timetable for us.  Clearly, however, the decision on this will evolve, particularly as we prepare a draft.</p><p> We would like to build in a future update and review to coincide with the availability of future census data.

The Irish Planning Institute, IPI, welcomes the preparation of the framework and believes the work represents a major opportunity to consider, analyse and prepare evidence-based policy that can address many of the fundamental issues that will affect the future development of the country.  As a policy adopted by the Government, it should form the means of co-ordinating activity across all the Departments by setting out clear spatial-development strategies, which can be used to direct funding for infrastructure, and by integrating planning with other considerations, such as climate change, rural development, landscape, built, cultural and natural heritage assets, energy planning, and infrastructure, from green infrastructure to road, sea, air, cycling, energy and rail infrastructure.</p> <p>  The institute believes there are a number of specific issues of which cognisance should be taken in developing the framework.  I will outline them briefly.  First, it is critical that the framework be supported by a strong evidence base, which must take account of the results of the most recent census.  In developing the framework, there should be awareness that resource management and planning are inextricably linked.  Population growth and urbanisation have given rise to very significant demand for resources.  Ensuring the management and efficient use of resources will be a central tenet of spatial planning in the years ahead.  Therefore, the planning system must play a central role in the formulation and implementation of policy on such critical issues as climate change, energy, transport, industry, raw materials, agriculture and food production, fisheries, biodiversity, regional economic development, and critical infrastructure delivery, to name but a few.  The NPF, as the overarching national planning policy, has a fundamental role in this. </p> <p>  Energy needs to be a central concept within the NPF, and renewable energy policy should be considered as a spatial component.  Strong and unambiguous implementation policies in respect of achieving a low-carbon society by 2050 must be set out in the framework and in subsequent regional planning policy and county or city development plans.</p> <p>  The NPF forms an ideal policy document to consider the implications of marine spatial planning for local authorities with a coastline.  It is vital that the national marine spatial plan be consistent with the policies of the national policy framework and that this consistency is carried through in the hierarchy of plans, from national to local level.</p> <p>  A consistent approach is needed to deal with the visual impact of offshore wind farms, coastal erosion prevention and mitigation, the protection of sensitive parts of the coastline, and areas where marine infrastructure is likely to have spatial implications for the coastal zone, as with the landings of cables and pipelines, port development, off-shore oil and gas exploration, etc.</p><p>The NPF can provide such a consistent framework. <br/><br/>We believe that a radical revision of the national policy on rural one-off housing is needed.  The current policies in development plans are too permissive as is evident from the high number of planning permissions.  For example, between 2010 and 2013, one-off units represented between 30% and 52% of all housing units granted permission each year.  The repot Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness stated that in the year end to August 2016, one-off houses represented 42% of housing commencements, an increase from 39% in the preceding period.  There are urgent reasons to review current policies in respect of rural housing, for example, the demise of small towns and villages in rural areas, car-based mobility <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>energy policies, objections to wind farms and electricity pylons and climate change.  The NPF should adopt new national guidelines in this area.  <br/><br/>Ireland will continue to need to develop large-scale strategic infrastructure.  During the period of the national spatial strategy, NSS, such infrastructural developments included the Corrib gas line, midlands wind farms, electricity transmission networks, a processing site for liquid petroleum gas, waste incinerator projects and port land works.  Each of these had to be decided by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the absence of a spatial policy framework at national level.  The NPF provides an opportunity to develop such a framework and to correct this. <br/><br/>The experience with the NSS has shown how a policy that is based on one spatial development perspective can be highly vulnerable to changes in economic and population performance during the plan period.  The Gateway strategy did not prove as successful as hoped.  While population initially grew faster than projected, it later slowed down.  It is suggested that the NPF should make use of the scenario approach to test different future paths of development, including Brexit, further policy integration with Northern Ireland and achievement of the targets in the energy white paper, which would suggest a radical change in mobility patterns, etc.  It would be very beneficial if the NPF included a summary of economic forecasting models and potential outcomes which have influenced the preparation of the framework. <br/><br/>The investment in the national motorway network has radically changed the accessibility of the regions within Ireland.  The creation of this network will put continued pressure on the development of land adjacent to this network, particular in the vicinity of motorway interchanges.  It is important that a national policy is developed to protect these areas, both for suitable development but also prevent unsuitable dispersed commercial and residential development occurring. <br/><br/>The NPF provides an opportunity to adopt a national landscape strategy which could address national parks, areas of high scenic amenity and cultural landscapes in need of protection.  Such a strategy could be integrated with an ecological strategy that seeks to maximise the potential of the European designated sites by linking these sites into a national ecological network.<br/><br/>The degree of spatial and functional integration between the Republic and Northern Ireland and between the main urban development areas of Dublin and Belfast is highly uncertain in light of Brexit and it is vital that consideration is given to this in the preparation of the NPF.  We again thank the members for their time and the committee staff for their assistance.  We are available to take questions or comments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Vance" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016110900002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members for the opportunity they have afforded us to present here today to discuss the forthcoming national planning framework, NPF.  As they may be aware, the Association of Irish Regions is the representative body for regional government in Ireland whose membership is drawn from current and past cathaoirligh and the directors of the three regional assemblies.  Two directors are here with us today, Mr. Stephen Blair on my left and Mr. Jim Conway on my right.</p> <p>  In line with wider public sector reforms, following enactment of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, the regional tier in Ireland also underwent considerable reforms with the abolition of the former eight regional authorities and the reconfiguration of two regional assemblies to become three, namely, the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, the Northern and Western Regional Assembly and the Southern Regional Assembly.  These three new regional assemblies, which took effect on 1 January 2015, have been mandated by Government to take on significant new roles and responsibilities not least in the whole area of regional spatial and economic planning.</p> <p>  Members may be aware that each of the three regional assemblies now have a statutory duty to prepare, adopt and monitor a regional spatial and economic strategy for their respective regions.  When prepared, these regional spatial and economic strategies will replace the current regional planning guidelines and provide a long-term economic and spatial strategy for the development of the regions in the years ahead.  These regional strategies must, of course, be consistent with and complimentary to the NPF and, therefore, must be prepared in tandem with the development of the national framework.  Clearly, the NPF, at the top of the planning hierarchy, must be sequentially prepared first but it is very important that the two processes are integrated to ensure mutual consistency.  Accordingly, the planning staff in the three regional assemblies have been liaising very closely with their colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government as work on the NPF progresses.</p> <p>  The Association of Irish Regions is very supportive of the need to develop a new NPF to replace what is now a largely obsolete NSS, which dates back to 2002 and was prepared in a very different time.  While the NSS had its faults, it was nevertheless a very important milestone as it represented the very first attempt in Ireland to have a spatial plan for the entire country.  Having said that, it is important that, with the benefit of hindsight, we critically evaluate the weaknesses of the NSS and learn from our mistakes as we prepare for this new NPF.  Unlike the NSS, it is very important that the proposed NPF is provided with a statutory foundation.  Therefore, we would encourage the Oireachtas to proceed with passage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill through all Stages in a timely fashion to ensure it is enacted before the completion of the draft NPF in 2017.</p> <p>  It is very important that the NPF is constructed as a whole-of-Government exercise with every Department of State committing to the policy framework and its subsequent implementation.  Unlike the NSS, which was seen very much as simply a Department of the Environment strategy, it is very important that there is complete "buy in" to the framework across all Departments and State agencies.  In addition, the proposed legislative requirement to have the NPF laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas will also help to enhance its democratic legitimacy.   There is a need for an accompanying investment plan.</p> <p>  The NSS was a purely physical planning strategy which had no budget provision attached to it.  Even the very modest Gateway Innovation Fund of &euro;300 million identified in the plan never materialised.  It is very important that the proposed NPF has an associated investment plan attached to it so that the priorities identified in the framework can be realised.  Unlike the NSS, which did not set out clearly the implementation arrangements, it is critical that the proposed NPF contains details of how the framework is to be implemented.  In other words, the NPF needs to identify the "what, the who and the how", what measures-actions are to be taken, who is responsible for delivering them and how they are to be delivered and when.</p> <p>  One of the accepted weaknesses of the NSS is that it did not have a set of metrics which could measure whether the strategy was being implemented.  Thus, for example, while the NSS was promoting the concepts of balanced regional development and regional potential, it did not set out any way of measuring this.  It is imperative that in the formulation of the NPF, thought would be given from the outset of a set of metrics which could be used to monitor and evaluate progress on the implementation of the framework.  For example, how is "regional potential" to be measured?</p><p>On the need for tailored policies for all parts of the country, there was a strong perception among the public that the national spatial strategy was just a strategy for urban areas and that rural areas were largely ignored and undervalued in the strategy.  It is, therefore, very important that in constructing the national planning framework a vision is set out for all parts of the national territory and bespoke policies are devised which will contribute to developing the potential of all our regions.</p><p> There is a generally held view the national spatial strategy identified far too many growth centres, the gateways and hubs, which was unrealistic and counter-productive.  Therefore, the proposed national planning framework should identify a more limited number of urban centres, which have the critical mass and are capable of being key drivers of regional economies.  This will need to be followed by the prioritisation of national infrastructure to unlock the latent potential of these centres.  This concentration of a smallish number of urban centres will need to be counterbalanced with policies and measures to further enhance and develop the potential of other regions.</p><p> As I have stated, the context in which the new national planning framework is being prepared is very different from that which pertained at the beginning of the century.  Ireland is slowly emerging from a deep and prolonged recession and a recovery is far from uniform throughout the country.  Furthermore, significant changes in the global economy have occurred which, when taken in conjunction with technological advances, make it a very different landscape in terms of job creation and retention.  Therefore, in addition to the challenges set out above, the new planning framework will have to deal with a set of new challenges, not least how to avoid a two speed economic recovery and how to deal with the problems of congestion and other economies of scale in Dublin while at the same time dealing with issues such as population decline and economic stagnation in other parts of the country.</p><p> Other emerging issues arise from our climate change obligations and our need to become environmentally sustainable.  Issues regarding renewable energy, energy efficiency and a low carbon economy must be addressed as does the sustainable exploitation of our extensive marine resources.  What is very evident from an examination of past demographic trends is that the continuation of a business as usual model will see Ireland continue to develop in a very unbalanced way, with the greater Dublin area and east coast continuing to increase its share of population, labour market and economic output relative to all of the other regions in Ireland.  Is this in Ireland's best interest?  We in the Association of Irish Regions certainly do not think so.</p><p> As well as the imbalance in population and employment growth east to west, the past two decades have seen a very unsustainable pattern of growth.  This is manifested in the fact it is not our cities which are growing most, but rather it is the outer suburban areas and satellite towns around our major urban centres which have reported the highest growth rates.  This in turn has resulted in people having to commute increased distances and has led to increased car dependency, all of which we know is unsustainable.  Given these long-established and powerful market forces, it is necessary for the national planning framework to closely examine what policy levers could be most effective in counteracting these market tendencies.  This will necessitate building up very robust evidence-based decision making, which can underpin the development of the national planning framework.</p><p> As was stated here earlier, it is projected the population of the State will grow by a further 600,000 people over the coming 20 years.  Together with forecasts of smaller household size, this converts to a need to build 500,000 houses over the period.  Where are these houses to be built to accommodate this population growth?  While birth and death rates are relatively stable and hence predictable, migration rates are not and are highly volatile.  It is estimated that approximately 50% of future population growth will be accounted for by external and internal migration.  These rates play a major role in regional population levels and profiles.  If economic activity and opportunity influence migration patterns it can be argued an interventionist policy to deliver sustainable long-term economic opportunities in the region, supported by appropriate investment plans, may be the most appropriate solution for delivering balanced regional growth in a small open economy.  It is, therefore, critical the forthcoming national planning framework provides the strategic framework which will shape the spatial patterns of development of the national territory in the coming decades by enabling and supporting all regions to fulfil their potential.</p><p> What is clear is that a focused and sustained interventionist policy, clearly articulated in the national planning framework, will be required if past embedded trends in population and employment growth are to be altered to support more sustainable patterns of development throughout the regions.  The challenges are substantial, but the risks associated with doing nothing are even more profound and should not be contemplated.</p><p> We in the Association of Irish Regions are fully behind the need to replace the national spatial strategy with a new national framework at this critical juncture as Ireland emerges from the recession to guide and direct future spatial patterns of development over the coming decades in a more balanced and sustainable fashion than which occurred during the Celtic tiger era.  Strong policies, matched with prioritised and sustained funding, will need to be put in place if the vision and goals of the national planning framework are to be realised.  We in the regional assemblies will play our part in preparing and adopting complementary regional spatial and economic strategies, which will articulate in much greater detail the regional aspects of the national framework and will drive the implementation of the national planning framework at regional level.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to present our views.  I and my colleagues will be delighted to answer any questions.</p></speech>

While they were all from different perspectives there was repetitiveness, which is a good thing because we clearly understand there is an overarching concern, which is very important.</p> <p>  It was summed up in the presentation by Mr. Hogan, who spoke about establishing a place-making vision on an evidence base which people will understand as a plan and will see as realistic and responsive to their needs and adaptable over time.  This sums it up in many ways.  It is very important.  If we have learnt anything from past experiences it is that it was not realistic, many of the objectives were not achieved and the resources to back up those objectives were not put in place.</p> <p>  As I see it, the national planning framework should reflect the expression of the Government's economic strategy and its commitment and plans for the infrastructure of the country.  We have been discussing balanced regional development.  During the election earlier this year, if anything kept coming up everywhere at national, local and regional level it was whether there is balanced development throughout the regions.</p> <p>  There is a huge feeling locally that there is no balanced regional development.  We saw the negotiations for Government and the programme for Government ticking all the boxes on balanced regional development.  This was partly formed by the fall-out of the politics and representation from the rural communities which mobilised.  Let us face it, this is a political building.  The electorate voted in large numbers for people who advocated balanced regional development.  There is a clear political message and I am sure the Minister and those of us in this room are very aware of it.</p> <p>  I was a local councillor for many years, and I am very familiar with the county development plan process.  I know the time, lead in and consultation process involved.  The witnesses are being very ambitious, and I salute them, but their time plan is unrealistic with regard to all the consultation processes.  It is great and I welcome it, as it is important that we have a national spatial strategy, but it is not realistic.  I ask the witnesses to respond to this.</p> <p>  As someone who comes from D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which has a port, I am particularly interested in the marine spatial strategy.  This was evident in the local plan of the area.  I do not want to be parochial, but I hear from people throughout the country that local authorities are putting up their hands and stating they do not know about issues as simple as foreshore licences, water and tidal marks and the jurisdiction of port authorities.  There is no synergy, and there has not been a proper synergy, regarding what is going on.  I ask the witnesses to flesh out their thinking on this.</p> <p>  We have great opportunities.</p><p>There are national, regional and local plans.  We have 31 local authorities and they need to be involved and to feel involved.  I am not just talking about the executive and the planners, but the elected members who represent communities must be involved.  Subsidiarity is a system of making decisions at the lowest common denominator where the people's decisions can have a real meaning.  I really want to hear more about the detail.  I think the Irish Planning Institute, IPI, has made an exceptional presentation.  I have not seen a full copy of it because it was in small print.  I think it raised really good issues and plays a really helpful and meaningful role in planning in general.  The IPI has already appeared before the committee since I have become a member.</p><p> We need to provide a clear, simple, realistic national vision and a national strategy.  That is where the issues paper, consultation and communication are vital.  Local authorities - and I speak as someone with a lot of practice there - feel alienated from the national process.  I think it is important that there is a local focus, a regional focus and a national focus.</p><p> I have a question on whether the time for the framework is realistic.  Brexit and the all-Ireland dimension to planning was raised by the Irish Planning Institute.  This is interesting because it will be important.  Planning does not stop at the Border.  There is synergy in the cross-Border interaction and that potentially will be greater because through adversity and challenges, it raises bigger issues for the island of Ireland's dynamic in agriculture, wind energy, alternative energy, transport and power.  There is a range of things.  We need an all-island approach to planning.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  In their response, I would like the witnesses to focus on the timeframe and how it is proposed to engage with the professional planners and the elected members in the local authorities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.737" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016110900002#H00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I have six questions.</p><p>First, on the issue of balanced regional development, the over-concentration of economic and population growth in the Dublin region is bad both for Dublin and for the rest of the country.  There is a benefit to having a much more proactive strategy of trying to achieve that goal all people say they want, which is more balanced regional development.  I am interested to learn whether those who drew up the expert advisory report on the national spatial strategy looked at and came up with conclusions or whether anybody else in the Department or elsewhere looked at and came up with conclusions as to why that spatial strategy failed to produce balanced regional development, which was one of its own objectives.  There was a reference to Scotland.  Obviously regional development in Scotland is quite an important issue in terms of distribution of its own population.  Are there lessons to be drawn from the Department's detailed knowledge of its national planning frameworks that could be applied here?  Second, I am concerned on the basis of the presentation about the lack of any proactive engagement with the North and the Assembly in terms of the way in which our national planning framework could interact with comparable frameworks, specifically for the Border, midlands and north west region but also more generally in terms of the overall benefits of a truly national planning framework.  I would like to hear more about the engagement, particularly at departmental level, that has happened with the Northern Ireland Assembly and your counterparts in the relevant Departments in the North?  What will happen in the next period to ensure that it is not a blind spot in the plan?</p><p>I am even more concerned about the absence of any discussion on socioeconomic disadvantage.  Socioeconomic disadvantage has a spatial and geographic reality.  Mr. Paul Hogan mentioned the need to have interaction or synergy between the planning framework and the investment opportunities.  If that is blind to the geographical distribution of socioeconomic disadvantage, then it will leave the <i>status quo</i>in place.  I know it is something to which our planning discourse has a tendency to be resistant but has it been a feature of the discussions?  Likewise, is it part of the conversation with the Irish Planning Institute?  If not, I really think we need to consider it over the coming months.</p><p>This is not a criticism of the Department but I have another concern, having been through the county development plans and strategic development zones, I too like Senator Boyhan know stakeholder engagement is really tricky.  The issue is getting people involved.  It is not just about holding events but is about empowering ordinary citizens and stakeholders to have the level of knowledge about these technical and detailed fields of planning knowledge and that is really tricky.  Trying to do that and have a draft document by the middle of the summer is even trickier.  I wonder whether the Department is relying on the same models of stakeholder engagement as we would operate in local authorities or will something different be used, given the significance of this plan and the length of time available?  I would be both delighted and amazed if we meet the target of the draft plan by the early summer.  I notice that Mr. Hogan entered a caveat, by stating that would be the best case scenario.  Again this is not a criticism but I wonder whether it is realistic to throw out something so ambitious.  If it going to be a nice, short high-level strategic document, that is probably easier but I query that without saying I do not want it to happen.</p><p>The last question relates to Irish Water.  Yesterday a number of us attended Irish Water's detailed briefing on their midlands-east region water supply proposal.  Irish Water is currently engaging in a non-statutory public consultation that will run until February.  The utility is planning to have a report mid-2017 and to then proceed to an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning permission by the end of next year.  One reason I am interested in whether Mr. Hogan thinks he can meet his target of a draft report by the middle of next year is Mr. Hogan's report and Irish Water's proposal obviously have really significant interactions.  If recommendations emerge from the Department's report on different priorities for regional development and infrastructural development, how will that conflict or coincide with such a major infrastructural proposition by Irish Water?  Has Mr. Hogan been discussing that element of or the overall infrastructural plan with Irish Water and how will those two things coincide through out the course of the Department's work next year?</p></speech>

I go against the comments of Senator Victor Boyhan on the Irish Planning Institute.  The Irish Planning Institute, in the course of its presentation today, gave percentage statistics on the number of permissions granted for one-off rural housing.  It stated the number of permissions was between 30% to 52% of all planning permission granted.  It was stated it had become easier to get planning permission for one-off rural houses.  I think the statistic is misleading and has not been put in context.  As a person who lives in a house that was a one-off rural house, I can guarantee that it has not become easier to get permission.  This statistic is in the context of few planning applications being submitted to local authorities at the time.  That is the reason the percentage of permissions for one-off rural housing granted was between 30% and 52% of the applications.  I think in fairness that must be made public.  If one took the number of applications for one-off houses during the period of the Celtic tiger, one would see a significant decline in the percentage granted.  What has been presented here today is an unfair presentation of the number of one-off rural housing.  The ongoing problem with one-off rural housing is that we are not providing ample opportunities in our towns and villages for people to build in them.  I would like the Irish Planning Institute to acknowledge that what has been presented here today is not factually correct when put in context.</p> <p>  The national framework policy, now known as the new regional economic strategy, is fantastic but when one deals with people on the ground, it is difficult enough to get them to understand the local area plans and the county development plans and they see nothing at the end of the timeframe.  However, by the time one mentions regional planning and national spatial planning, one has lost the public.  They have equally lost faith in the system of delivering what they want for themselves.</p> <p>  I welcome Councillor Pat Vance, my colleague from Wicklow, who on Monday went through his fourth if not fifth county development plan process.  Equally I acknowledge that these have now become statutory documents, which is a move in the right direction.</p><p>Recently I asked a question in the D&aacute;il about the National Transport Authority's document, entitled Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin area 2016-2035.  Which will come first?  The NTA stated, "The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and the Planning and Development Act 2000, which state that the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (formerly Regional Planning Guidelines), Development Plans and Local Area Plans in the GDA must be consistent with the Authority's Transport Strategy."  We try to consider economic development outside of Dublin.  The strategy does nothing for regional economic growth.  We are talking about the province of Leinster and the counties outside of Dublin.  The strategy is completely restrictive of any growth potential.  It states that it will maintain the current percentage level of economic activity in those counties.  That provision does not address the fundamental problem of having 75% of the population commuting to Dublin daily.  The strategy clearly states that regional, county and local policies must take cognisance of the NTA's strategy that is on a statutory footing.  Who is the boss in this situation?  Who is driving whom?</p><p> I am amazed that members from the regional authorities can interact with the strategy.  The National Transport Authority launched the document this year.  The strategy does nothing for economic growth and will not alleviate the urban-rural divide that will be created.  The planning framework stipulates that we need to develop jobs where people live.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.740" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016110900002#J00200"><p>I will pass some of the questions to my colleagues to answer and the other organisations will offer their input.  I will address a couple of the issues.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan and Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the timing and challenges of the strategy.  As Mr. Hogan has said, it is a challenge.  Equally, as nicely picked up by Deputy Casey, we need a document that is relevant and can influence funding, investment decisions and align policies not just within the planning sphere but across other investments ranging from energy to education and transport.</p> <p>  In terms of alignment, part of the drive to advance the document as early as possible is our alignment with the mid-term review of the capital investment plan.  We have had discussions at Cabinet committee level.  Bilateral meetings have also taken place between the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on how we can ensure that the mid-term review, that is due to take place in the first half of next year, will be informed by, perhaps not the final adapted plan but certainly the key principles and priorities that will emerge in a draft plan.  As Deputy Casey has said, that is partly a driver to ensure that the national planning framework, NPF, becomes the touchstone that others match their plans with rather than catching up after measures have been adopted.</p> <p>  We have a very small team and there is a significant challenge.  We do not rely just on the Department or regional assemblies that will do a lot of the work.  The principles around the NPF will be made concrete and developed into something that is of more direct relevance to people living in the regions through the regional economic strategies.</p> <p>  On the point about ensuring this is not the same old consultation process, we get the same views from the stakeholders who we know will come back into it.  We have decided to develop and build towards a January launch at a national level and rolled out across all 31 authorities to translate the questions that have been posed, including the more basic questions that are relevant, and not just from a national context.  The responses of people living in villages or communities to questions such as how they see their communities in 2040 or what they would like to see in them can be of relevance to local authorities, various community groups and individuals who think about how their children will grow up in a different society and country in 20 years time.  We can work back from that and we are tailoring the information.</p> <p>  Mr. Hogan indicated that there will be layers of documents.  As well as technically detailed and evidence-based analysis to underpin some of the big issues we must face - we call them hard choices - there will also be a document that will be more general and will stimulate those discussions.  The last layer will be a short, relevant and pertinent document - someone suggested that we must write a document that a ten year old can understand - that outlines what the NPF means to individuals, how it will impact on the development of the country and how it will be reflected in the regions and, more important, in the local plan.</p> <p>  As part of a multi-strand campaign, we plan to roll out early in the new year a communications plan with different spheres.  We will tap into the social media side and looking at more innovative ways to access.  We have not finalised those and it will be a matter for the Minister and the Government to take decisions about the scale of the programme.  However, that is how we see ourselves.  We know that those who are interested and have engaged in the past, like the institutes, regions and local authorities, will continue to feed into the process.  We want to broaden that audience, however, and get more input in order that what comes out at the end of the document is a plan that is relevant and has buy-in not only from the system but from everybody.  We recognise that is a significant challenge.</p> <p>  If we are looking at how we engage with the local government sector, and Senator Boyhan was quite correct, we cannot get this message out just from the centre.  The intention is that we will mobilise a locally focused campaign beyond January for each of the 31 authorities.  It will be for the chief executive, the management team, the elected members and the different groupings and committees underneath to discuss these matters, to make them available, perhaps even to bring them into some of the schools and organisations, and be asking those kinds of questions in order that it generates a discussion that can feed back into the decision-making process.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the marine and land strategy.  There are two elements in that.  Mr. Hogan mentioned the requirement for a marine spatial plan.  That is under way and over the next couple of years we will develop a huge base, working with the Marine Institute and other Departments, to frame a process and vision for the marine environment.  Perhaps more relevant is the work that we have been doing within the Department to align better the planning system and foreshore licensing system through a proposed maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill.  It has been a long time in gestation and it was trying to address a range of issues around the consent processes and interactions and trying to streamline the environmental considerations across projects that require planning permission, possibly licensing by a Minister, and the foreshore element.  That work is well advanced and is among the Department's priorities to get published during this current session.  That will provide a good framework for dealing practically with something that is happening but has an impact on land management.  There is a broader planning framework link-up with the marine spatial plan that will also address the more strategic and principle views.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Cussen to deal with the issues around the advisory report and the lessons learned.  The economic environment shifted quickly after the national spatial strategy, NSS, was published.  We have taken strong lessons from it and certainly the NPF and the Scottish NPF version have a lot to offer us.  I will ask Mr. Hogan to touch on the socioeconomic disadvantage issues and how that feeds into our modelling and scenarios.</p></speech>

I have taken detailed notes of them.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked what lessons have been learned.  The NSS was the first strategy of its kind in this country.</p><p>It was innovative and moving into a space around which many of our structures and institutions were going to be tested in terms of implementation.  Sometimes we rush to judgment a little too harshly on the success of the national spatial strategy as it brought about a focus on what was sometimes dysfunction in the planning process, particularly with respect to land zoning and the development plan process.  We should remember that before the strategy was done, we had 88 planning authorities in the country with 88 development plans and no overarching strategy.  As a result of the strategy, we started to look more closely at statutory development plans, how they added up, how they interfaced with regard to boundaries and whether the numbers added up.<br/><br/>We found a story that was very clear with regard to over-zoning, particularly with regard to inappropriate locations.  Without the national spatial strategy, we would not have had the following context.  In the mid 2000s, for example, we found one local authority in the midlands was proposing to zone enough land to cater for the total projected population increase of the entire midlands for 20 years.  That created a basis for a focused process of statutory interaction with the local authority.  Today, that authority is an exemplar of integrating its approach to a broader regional context.  So, through a series of statutory interactions using the section 31 direction process, local authorities started to understand more the need to co-ordinate and integrate their forward planning approaches, which led to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 and the core strategy approach, with an alignment of infrastructure and so on.  Sometimes we forget that the national spatial strategy was the stimulus behind probably one of the most deep-rooted reforms of the planning process in 20 years.<br/><br/>It is a more mixed picture in terms of its regional development impact.  There is no doubt that while we were addressing planning reforms, we started to encounter decisions that both moved against the strategy, particularly with regard to decentralisation, as well as the economic headwinds from the 2008 period.  For example, the decision to suspend the gateway innovation fund was unfortunate as it was a very important instrument, even though it was limited to the gateway locations.<br/><br/>I will focus for a moment on the expert advisory group.  Its view was that the national spatial strategy was trying to perform a number of functions and we had no regional planning guidelines when it was being done.  It was trying to stretch from a national to regional to local strategy and it was not strategic enough.  The expert advisory group also felt that we probably needed to focus a little more on place and that we needed to be much clearer with regard to implementation.  Some of the points relating to metrics, etc., were very well made, although we do face certain challenges.  It is not something in which we can get into a large amount of detail within a national document.  Nevertheless, the points are very well made with regard to the implementation aspect.  If we have not published it already, we can make the expert advisory group document available to members of the committee.  It is a very short report that is accessible and easy to understand.<br/><br/>There was a very good observation from Deputy &Oacute; Broin on the importance of engaging with our neighbours on the island.  We are meeting our colleagues from the Department for Infrastructure from Northern Ireland this Friday and Mr. Hogan is involved with the north-west gateway project board and arrangements around that.  We will meet them again in December.  We will need to ensure that the planning framework, &quot;Vision 2040&quot; or whatever way it will be described should evolve very much from an island perspective and also from an east-west perspective, taking in the work of the British-Irish Council and so on, as well as spatial planning work streams.  It is something we are particularly keen about.<br/><br/>Deputy Casey raised a point about the NTA and it is important, in the context of this committee, to address that.  The transport strategy for the greater Dublin area must be consistent with the national spatial strategy and what will become the national planning framework.  In effect, the transport strategy for the Dublin area must look upwards to what is overall national policy on planning, economic development and so on.  The Deputy is correct in that there is a reciprocal arrangement in the legislation that the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area acknowledges the regional planning guidelines and what will become the regional spatial economic strategy and <i>vice versa</i>.  We are trying to achieve co-ordination between planning, in a spatial and place-based sense, transport, etc.<br/><br/>There is an important connection between an issue raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in respect of disadvantage, the transport issue and a general narrative raised by Senator Boyhan on regional development.  Let us be honest.  With the interface of the Dublin area, there is an ongoing debate around what we do with our motorway junctions and locations with much pressure for development.  Some of our colleagues from the Irish Planning Institute have usefully and correctly identified that the billions of euro we spent on our national motorway network will make the latter a national asset for the next 50 years and that how we manage growth and development around that over the next five, ten, 15 or 20 years will be absolutely essential in how that 50-year or 100-year asset will be protected in future.<br/><br/>To bring this back to disadvantage and regional development, I know Wicklow very well because I have family living in the county.  There are towns such as Wicklow and Arklow that, in their own sense, exhibit patterns of disadvantage, underutilisation of potential and so on.  We can consider the pressure for development and debates around whether the NTA strategy supports the development of Wicklow, and I have followed closely those debates in the D&aacute;il, for example, as well as the questions around that.  When we strip it back, are we really talking about what is, in effect, opportunistic development in the locations that might provide cheaper land solutions or better accessibility?  Would we not be better from a disadvantage perspective, with a people and place-centred approach to planning, to speak about trying to activate the potential of key towns like Wicklow and Arklow, which are now on the motorway network and accessible?  There are people living there and it is where the jobs we need to provide for those people should be, as opposed to, in effect, catering for or in some way being unwittingly part of a further extensification and sprawl of the Dublin area.  This example is being played out in most local authority areas abutting the Dublin area.<br/><br/>If we are going to tackle the issue of disadvantage, which exists in this city as much as in regional towns and rural locations, we must try to get the jobs, housing and infrastructure to happen in a more compact footprint.  Sometimes that means resisting the pressures there will be for, in effect, more opportunistic development where we see business parks, etc., flung further and further out from where people live.  Effectively, that is within an approximate 30 km radius of this city.</p></speech>

On the issue of social disadvantage, under the planning for people heading, social disadvantage and how to tackle it is a key element.  I covered that under the general heading of society and quality of life.  Certainly in our analysis of the country and how we would approach the strategy, the issue of social cohesion is really important.  If people feel they are being left behind, they are not part of society and cannot participate, there are all sorts of consequences.  There is even a touch of that in very recent election results.</p></speech>

It is just to illustrate the point before moving swiftly on.  It is a national development goal to reduce social disadvantage and we can all agree with that.  What we can do in a high-level document is improve mobility and access to employment, both in terms of physical location in a strategic sense but also the types of choices that people have in transport terms to get to employment, where our employment is located and how we organise settlement versus employment location.</p><p>Ensuring more appropriately distributed employment and a better spread will be important, as will the provision of third level education and ensuring that, as the demand for third level education grows in the next decade, there is good access to third level so that people can improve their qualifications.  This is not just an urban issue - it is both an urban and rural issue, which makes it more complex.  It is something we are very aware of as a team.</p></speech>

In the context of today's discussion about the forthcoming NPF, the approach it takes to rural housing will impact on other issues such as transport, energy and climate change.  It is within that framework that the approach we take to it needs to be considered.  More broadly, there has been much discussion about the demise of rural towns and villages.  The Department's presentation noted the level of vacancy in towns.  There needs to be a focus on these towns and villages and any changes to rural housing policy needs to be accompanied by realistic alternatives to that which, as I mentioned, should be centred on our rural towns and villages as service centres and as population centres.</p> <p>  Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Tracey will speak on the issue of rural housing and Mr. Henk van der Kamp will speak on the issue that Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised on the spatial and geographic link to socioeconomic disadvantage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.748" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Tracey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016110900002#L00300"><p>It is very easy to read our submission about radical revision of rural housing as being against rural housing.  Rural housing is a very complex issue.  There is a huge amount of data available which would enable an appropriate and bespoke policy to be developed for rural housing.  I have worked for the last 14 years in the most rural local authority in the country in Leitrim.  We have the lowest level of urbanisation in the country and there is a huge volume of rural housing in Leitrim as a total proportion of the housing in the county.  During the upper Shannon pilot scheme, which most people would know as the urban renewal scheme, the level of house building in the countryside in County Leitrim dropped by 50% because through the urban renewal scheme there were opportunities for people to obtain housing in the towns and villages throughout the county.  I can produce those statistics for the committee if it wants to see them.  In fact, they are in a published paper I did for the institute during that period.  They are a bit outdated but Deputy Casey is correct when he says the statistics are being influenced by the level of applications being made throughout the country.<br/><br/>In Leitrim, one-off housing made up 85% of all planning applications because there was nothing else happening.  It skews the statistics and makes one think of the phrase &quot;lies, damned lies and statistics&quot; but there are very solid statistics there which show there is a high degree of one-off rural housing happening in areas where they are actually not doing anything for rural renewal because they are happening in the immediate hinterlands of larger towns and villages where there is already existing pressure for services such as school places.  If one takes a place like Ballyreilly West in County Leitrim, which has a two-teacher school, we cannot get anybody to build a house there.  The policy in Leitrim is that anybody who wants to build a house out in Ballyreilly is more than welcome to build one because the placement of a new house there would be a significant investment in that community.  The pressure is not coming from people who are native to the area looking to build in their own area but from urban generated housing.  We have failed the community by not providing adequate choice in housing, whether in a town or a village.  I live in a village 7 km outside Carrick-on-Shannon and it is a vibrant village.  In terms of demand for school places, since I moved into that village the school has gone from a four-classroom school to an eight-classroom school.  We have four pubs, a hotel, and a community.  All of these were built because that village is vibrant.  It has a vibrant rural hinterland with lots of people who are living in the countryside around it using the services.  I can go to other villages elsewhere in the county that have nothing like that.<br/><br/>We need to radically revise national policy because sometimes the policy document is quoted to justify housing in inappropriate locations.  It is like the devil quoting the Bible - one picks out the section of the sustainable rural housing guidelines that supports granting the planning permission in that particular location.  We are not calling for the ban on rural housing because that is ridiculous.  The rural population needs to be sustained.  We need to do things to try to discontinue the depopulation of the rural areas.  We have to make those areas that are suffering from population loss attractive to people to come into.  That can only be done through appropriate location and convenience to jobs, etc.  It can also be done by ensuring they do not go into those areas already suffering from urban generated demands in the hinterlands of the towns.  There should be a policy that sets out a <i>modus operandi</i>where the local authority will identify, for example, electoral districts that have a population decline, those which have the highest levels of vacancy and those with the highest level of uncompleted estates, using data that is there like that.  The policy should identify perhaps two or three categories of rural areas, some where anybody who wants to live in a rural area can go to live and others which are more restrictive, perhaps retaining what little capacity is still in those rural areas in the hinterland of the towns and urban centres to accommodate the progeny of the original residents in that area.<br/><br/>Many rural farmers cannot provide a house for their son or daughter on their land, which is in close proximity to the town, because the capacity has been absorbed by people who have moved into the area.  We must have bespoke policies and in that sense we are talking about a radical revision.  We have to set out a radical and detailed methodology by which we designate areas that are open for consideration, areas that have an open book approach, areas that have a limited approach and areas that we have to close down.  That is the approach.  <br/><br/>There have definitely been difficulties in recent years particularly since the water table and soakage tests have come in.  It is now very difficult to find a site that is suitable to take a waste water treatment system.  There are people, such as those in Trinity College, looking to devise non-discharge systems.  They are very expensive and will really only accommodate people who have to live in these areas and who will have to go to extra cost because of environmental protection regulations if they are to do it.<br/><br/>I agree that some of the statistics have been skewed by recent activities but the underlying point has been made in our submission that at the moment there is not enough being done to provide housing choices in towns and villages and urban centres and that is forcing people to vote with their feet and look for a one-off house.  It is an easy option.  In the longer run, they are paying for those options.  People who really do not need to be out there are paying for it with their pocket book.  We are also paying for it with our competitiveness as a nation.</p><p> When people are living 20 km to 30 km away from their jobs, and one spouse is travelling 30 km in one direction and the other is going in the opposite direction to her job, they need two cars and their salaries have to be commensurate.  It puts up the cost of living of those living in these isolated location, which in a sense they have been driven to, not necessarily because they are sons and daughters of existing landowners who want to be near home and in the area they grew up in.  I support people like that because they become members of the church choir and join the GAA and actually know where the local school is.  To them something that is convenient is across a field, rather than a two mile round trip on the road.  We have to support the existing rural population to maintain themselves and to grow, but that will not necessarily mean a liberal housing programme.  It needs the delivery of jobs on the ground, convenient to those people.</p></speech>

Unplanned over-concentration in Dublin is bad but a planned concentration of population in Dublin may not be bad and this is one of the key questions that the national planning framework has to address.  It would be a very interesting question to address it in social media, in community discussion and an even more interesting question to get the debate going might be that the national planning framework will make a radical change to one-off housing.  That will get many people talking about our national policies.  Spatial planning is a creative discipline.</p> <p>  The national planning framework is about a picture of Ireland in the future.  Everybody should have a say in that.  That makes it interesting.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked why the national spatial strategy, NSS, did not work.  We can say it has worked in many way.  I agree with Mr. Niall Cussen that the context it has provided has been very useful.  One of the reasons it may not have worked is that it tried to do too much.  It is back to the question of the social and economic disparities.  Perhaps we cannot do a great deal about that in terms of the geographic location, certainly in terms of settlement patterns or major employment concentrations.  Trying to disperse employment into eight gateway towns and even more hub towns clearly has not worked.  The biggest mistake that the NPF could make would be to revisit that and to repeat it, even in a smaller number of centres.  That would be a high risk strategy.</p> <p>  I think the scenario based approach would allow different models to be tested, including a radical overhaul of one-off housing, but also including concentration in Dublin as a realistic possibility for a national planning framework.  Why do I say that?  Ireland is not the only country that is suffering population decline in regions within successful economically performing countries.  Almost every western European country has the same problem at the moment.  While the cities are growing the rural regions are declining.  We call it shrinking population.  This is widespread.  The projections are that the cities will grow further.  We do not have many mega cities in Europe, but there are many mega cities in the world and these seem to be growing even faster.  The idea that we have to disperse development across the island is a very important question for the national planning framework.  In our submission we suggested that this can be done by scenario based approach, which would also help the community engagement.  </p> <p>  Let me finish on another point that we raised in our submission, that is, that the national planning framework, unlike the national spatial strategy should not just be about population settlements or distribution.  The national spatial strategy was to a large extent and perhaps had to be about that, but there is an opportunity now with the White Paper on energy to be proactive on the energy side and perhaps make energy more important than population settlement for the next generation because that is where the major challenge is and also where the significant opportunities are, ironically for the rural areas of Ireland.  If I can make one case today, it would be an argument for the energy potential of the regions outside Dublin.</p></speech>

Deputy Pat Casey as well as the Chairman would be well aware of it, on the periphery of the area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and the attitude and the frustration of members of the regional assemblies in regard to the NRA and its attitude to development along the N3 and the N11.  Very expensive roads are built and one does not allow people on to them.  In the north Wicklow area, we have gone through the proper process and we have to grow Bray to 40,000.  There is not enough land and land is being properly zoned for the past seven or eight years.  A planning application has been submitted recently for a substantial number of houses and commercial activity and the NRA has objected to it.  The frustration of the members of the assembly both in Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth in regard to the NRA is that the application was in compliance with the strategy for County Wicklow.  It is very important that the national planning framework has a statutory base because we see when a plan has been developed and agreed and is legally in compliance with the regional strategy, we think stakeholders such as the NRA should be complying and helping to bring that plan to fruition and not frustrating it.  At present, there is huge frustration in respect of the attitude of the NRA to development in the Wicklow area.  Despite the fact that the county council is complying with everything under the spatial strategy, the proposals are being frustrated.  That must be dealt with in the new planning framework.  The stakeholder must be statutorily obliged to help the development that has already been approved.</p></speech>

It is important that we maximise the fact that we have a capital city of international scale within the region, and which is of benefit to the wider region.  It is important also to maximise the scale of the city and look to the sustainable development and consolidation of the urban centres generally within the region and to ensure that those are places where people see that people live and work in there, and not just view it as a commuter belt to the capital city.  At the same time there is a need to recognise the value and strength of the rural elements of the region. </p></speech>

Let me assure members that in the preparation of the regional strategies, we are working very closely with the National Transport Authority.  Outside the greater Dublin Area certainly the legislation is different and the NTA follows the regional strategy and does not precede the strategy.  They are working with us, for us to guide the development of the regional transport strategy for the regions.</p> <p>  Equally, Irish Water because of its current requirements to produce capital investment plans has to do it in advance of both the national planning framework and the regional strategies, but once the new strategies come on board Irish Water will revise its plans to be fully consistent with the regional strategies.</p></speech>

They were most helpful.  First, may I remind witnesses of the question in respect of Irish Water and the overlap of the two plans.  On the socio-economic disadvantage and the issue of the concentration of population in Dublin, the conversation was really interesting.  For me, the unplanned over-concentration of population and economic development in Dublin is a very bad thing, both for the city and for others.  However, over-concentration, even in a planned way is only a good thing if that is what people want.</p><p>While there are people who live and grew up in rural Ireland who want to gravitate to major population centres, and some who want to emigrate, there are many who do not.  As policy makers, part of our responsibility is to find ways to give people that choice.  If a person grows up in Inishowen, he or she should have a real choice as to whether to live, work and raise a family there or migrate elsewhere.  Despite the fact that population migration to major cities in Europe is a reality, it is not necessarily a good thing or something we should support with public policy.  I suspect that part of the reason it is happening is that the drivers of economic development have been large foreign direct investment companies, which are always going to locate in large urban centres such as Dublin or Cork, and there is not much one can do about that.</p><p> I am not sure that subsuming the spatial reality of socioeconomic disadvantage within the overall framework of people, place and economic opportunity is enough.  The one thing the State can control is where it invests in public infrastructure.  We are going to have a profound transformation of our water infrastructure over the next 20 or 30 years, whatever happens in the short-term debate about the funding model.  We are going to move from a large number of water treatment plants to a much smaller number of larger treatment plants.  Where we put those plants will decide who gets to work in them.  If we decide to locate them in parts of the country where, infrastructurally, they make sense but where there is also a demand for jobs, it will make a big difference.  I would like the plan to contain a mapping of socioeconomic disadvantage and its geographical reality.  We know that some of it is regionally balanced, and in the south east unemployment levels reflect this, but Dublin is one of the most socially segregated capital cities in Europe and many of the infrastructural decisions taken over the years reinforce that.  We have a DART along the south east coast in what has been the most affluent part of the city for a long time and this has reinforced the socioeconomic advantage for those of us who had the fortune to grow up in that part of the city.</p><p> To what extent are the spatial elements of socioeconomic disadvantage mainstreamed in the overall plan?  If they are not, can we map these and overlay that map with other aspects such as energy, water or public transport infrastructure?  That would be a real change in how we think about these things.  My fear is that, in common with our equality framework, it is socioeconomically blind and, unlike other countries, we have a tendency not to want to be too explicit about it.  I do not suggest that this should be to the detriment of the sustainable development and environmental goals or regional balance.  I just think there needs to be a greater emphasis on it.</p></speech>

When a jobs application comes in for Wicklow, on a zoned piece of land within an environs plan, the NTA objects to it on the basis of the carrying capacity of the N11.  This does two things.  It stops the traffic coming into Dublin and creates reverse commuting and this is taking the pressure away from the M50-M11 merger, which is in no capital plans anywhere at the moment.  Anything that has a job potential in Wicklow will help solve that situation and a number of such applications have come in but the NTA has gone against them.  We acknowledge that the Wicklow and Rathnew environs plan borders the M11 and is within 50 m of it.  It will use the interchange and affect the carrying capacity but is that not what it is there for?  I am not looking for <i>ad hoc</i>development but there needs to be fairness over the submissions the NTA makes in respect of jobs in Wicklow.  The document, which was launched this year, is focused on inside the M50 and on improving transport connectivity therein.  It does not address issues outside the M50 and I have a problem with the strategy in this regard.</p><p>We had to rewrite our core strategy and a lot of our objectives in the county development plan, which was almost passed on Monday but will require a second round next week.  Transport is now guiding our strategies so who is making the decisions?  The NTA has launched its strategy and we had to conform, rather than the NTA having to conform to the infrastructure requirements for the development of Wicklow, Kildare, Meath or Louth.</p><p>I will not get bogged down in one-off planning issues but I will make one point.  I agree that we should not have people living in a rural area have with no connections to that area.  The statistic put before us today is unfair, however, because it looks at a percentage of the data where there were no planning permissions at all.</p></speech>

Until we address that we are not giving people the options of living in rural towns and villages.  A rural village or town will never reach the objectives Irish Water has for a 15-year return on investment and will never be able to get a payback on water infrastructure.  Something needs to be done to allow villages and towns to expand and develop because most of them have stagnated at the moment and have no chance of developing into the future, which adds to the one-off rural problem.</p></speech>

Irish Water has a couple of different plans, a five-year rolling capital plan which brings us back to the baseline and represents priorities with which we have to deal, and a 25-year strategic plan with which all facets of the Department, including the planning side, have been very closely involved.  Irish Water and the water and planning divisions have all been aligning.  We in the Custom House are ensuring that nothing clashes with, or runs counter to, what we are doing.  Irish Water bases its requirements on the current plans and this further reinforces the need for an NPF that is updated and aligned.  Once that is there and once regional plans are in place Irish Water, like the NTA, will have to ask how it will reprioritise.  In advance of that we are engaging with it on the plans for the midlands and the east, among other areas.  We see the underlying population demands of Dublin and how we need to manage those over the next 20 years or so.  There will be a demand for significant national resources in that respect.</p> <p>  Another question was on how the NPF will or will not deal with some of the tricky issues that were raised.  The NPF will set some very broad principles which the regional, city and county development plans will flesh out and prioritise.  The planning system however is a lot more responsive and recognises the issues.  In the west of the city there are three major SDZs and the whole point of strategic development zones is that it is not just about houses but the infrastructure that goes in before them and is integrated into the development.  Making better use of the rail lines and the stations that have not been activated for some time, such as in Clonburris and Hansfield, is important and hopefully in ten years' time we will look back and agree that the city is more balanced, better serviced and more integrated across all its areas.</p> <p>  The last question on our list was, "What does a successful NPF look like?"</p><p>In 20 years time, what will indicate that we got it right?  There will be the initial process in January and, as we draft it and bring it back to the committee, we will be able to get its views and feed those into what it is hoped will be not just the Department's document but a national document.</p></speech>

Pavee Point welcomes the opportunity to engage with the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on the very important issue of the recognition and acknowledgement of my community's ethnic identity.  From the outset I wish to convey our huge disappointment and deep frustration at the fact that the State continues to deny us our ethnicity and identity.  That said, we hope the work, interest and commitment shown by the committee will give added impetus and encourage the Government to show political leadership and unequivocally, through the Taoiseach, make a declaration in the D&aacute;il that the Parliament, the State and the country recognise the distinct ethnic identity of my community.  The persistent refusal of the State to recognise our ethnic identity is untenable and diminishes our standing in the international community, almost to the point of embarrassment.<br/><br/>Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre has been campaigning and advocating for over 30 years that my community constitutes a distinct ethnic minority and should be recognised as such.  We have the support of many academics and many international human rights monitoring bodies, the most prominent of which is the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD.  In 2005 and 2011 the CERD reported on Traveller ethnicity.  In the latter report, the committee recalled its previous concluding observations and general recommendation No. 8 on the principle of self-identification and expressed concern at the State party's &quot;persistent refusal&quot; to recognise Travellers as an ethnic group, notwithstanding that they satisfied the internationally recognised criteria.  In an Irish context, we have the support of the Irish Human Rights Commission and this committee's predecessor.  We also know that the Attorney General's office has advised that there would be no costs or legal implications arising from the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  A body of evidence has been provided which is legal, sociological and anthropological in nature and which conclusively confirms that Travellers constitute a distinct ethnic group.  <br/><br/>The CERD's recommendation No. 8 asserts that the principle of self-identification apply if no objective justification can be put to the contrary.  Traveller organisations, with the support of international human rights groups and domestic human rights organisations, have established a <i>prima facie</i>case and the burden of proof now rests with the State to disprove Traveller ethnicity.  In its attempts to disprove Traveller ethnicity during the years the State has raised a number of issues, one of which is consensus, but nowhere in international law is consensus required in terms of self-identification and the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  Another issue raised is cost, but we know from the Attorney General's office and the work of this committee's predecessor that there are no costs or legal implications arising.  These substantive issues which have been put forward by the State in its attempts not to recognise or acknowledge Traveller ethnicity have been dealt with very convincingly.  Therefore, one can only assume that the opposition or the objection is ideological in nature.  <br/><br/>The recognition of Travellers as a minority ethnic group is not the subject of some abstract, ideological debate.  The recognition of our ethnicity is fundamentally a human rights issue which has implications for policy development and service provision as my colleague, Mr. Ronnie Fay, will outline.  The acknowledgement of our ethnicity will send a very powerful and symbolic message about respect, inclusion and recognition.  It is about validating our history, culture and language.  It is not, as some argue, about making us less Irish.  There is no conflict between nationality and ethnicity.  I am very proud of my Irishness and Travellerness.  Recognition would have a very powerful impact on our collective self-esteem, confidence and status in Irish society.  It is my strong and long held belief that in the absence of this recognition, the subtext to the narrative continues to be one of viewing my community as dysfunctional, primitive and comprising people who need to be rehabilitated and civilised.</p><p>This racist ideology feeds into internalised oppression, which in turn creates shame, low self-esteem, depression and suicide.  We are all familiar with the stark suicide rates within our community, which are almost seven times higher than the national average.</p><p> In May 2015, the Government and people of this country showed great leadership, courage and generosity by amending our Constitution to allow for marriage equality.  We are asking for the same leadership, courage and generosity to be extended to my community.</p></speech>

While we say that we are frustrated at having to attend yet another Oireachtas committee meeting, we welcome that this committee is keeping the issue on the political agenda.  At this stage, it is up to the State to explain its rationale for refusing to grant recognition despite the recommendations of a range of UN treaty monitoring bodies, European institutions and Irish equality and human rights organisations, as well as a report of the previous Oireachtas justice committee.<br/><br/>It is ironic that Irish Travellers are recognised as a minority ethnic group in Britain and Northern Ireland whereas that recognition is yet to be afforded here in their country of origin.  I will not restate many of the arguments because Mr. Collins has summarised them and many committee members agree with them and understand the evidence.  Our sister organisations and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, articulated them in detail at the committee's previous sitting.  Instead, Pavee Point would like to focus on three policy areas where the non-recognition of Traveller ethnicity has profound implications.<br/><br/>First, Pavee Point disputes the assertions of many Governments since 2005 that recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group would have no beneficial implications for Traveller status in Irish society.  They told the UN committee: &quot;To define Travellers as an ethnic minority would not entitle Travellers to any additional rights or protections&quot;.  The Government is only correct in so far as being a Traveller is named as a distinct ground for protection under Ireland's equality legislation and is thus offered the protection against discrimination afforded by the legislation.  However, the Government's assertion that there would be no effect misconstrues our position and misses the point about the importance of respect for cultural identity.  Pavee Point contends that the Government's persistence in not recognising Travellers as an ethnic group reveals or reflects a mindset and policy project that continues to be assimilationist.  This begs the question that, if Travellers are not a distinct community, then <i>ipso facto</i>they should be treated the same as the general population and incorporated into the general Irish population and they and their needs will become invisible, which is patently not the case.<br/><br/>Pavee Point contends that the persistence of this mindset has been a major contributory factor in ensuring that many of the key recommendations of the Government's policies, including the task force, the national education and health strategies, the findings of the all-Ireland health study and so on, have not been implemented.  It is most evident in local authorities' assimilationist approaches to Traveller accommodation and their unstated policies to persuade or force Travellers to move into houses instead of implementing stated Government policy of a commitment to the development of Traveller-specific accommodation.<br/><br/>This assimilationist mindset has more recently been presented as mainstreaming, particularly by the Department of Education and Skills, and is used to justify disproportionate cuts in public investment in Travellers.  I have provided a chart that uses the Government's figures to show these cuts.  For example, education was cut by 86.6%, from &euro;76.5 million in 2008 to &euro;10.2 million in 2013.<br/><br/>This June, the European Commission assessed Ireland under the EU framework for Roma integration strategies.  Wherever one reads &quot;Roma&quot;, Irish Travellers are included.  The Commission stated: </p><blockquote>A mainstreamed approach is sufficient when outcomes are identical for all components of the target groups; when evidence shows a clear gap between the situation of Roma and Travellers versus the rest of society (e.g. regarding their health and housing situation), policies should be adjusted and specific measures should also be developed.</blockquote> <p>Given the demographic profile of Travellers, it is clear that neither the so-called mainstreaming approach nor denial of cultural ethnicity is serving Travellers well.  My submitted presentation highlights some of the key facts, for example, 84% unemployment, many Travellers without access to running water, a mortality rate that is 3.5 times the national average, which includes child mortality and a suicide rate that accounts for 11% of all deaths at six times the national average, or seven times in the case of men.  Only 13% of Travellers complete secondary schooling and less than 1% of Travellers go on to third level education.  I am trying to show the link between the denial of cultural identity and its impact on outcomes.<br/><br/>Second, the lack of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group demonstrates a continuing reluctance by the Government to acknowledge that Travellers experience racism.  The Government position is that it acknowledges that Travellers suffer discrimination, but that they are protected as a specific ground in equality legislation and that this should be sufficient.  The implicit Government position is that Travellers suffer a discrimination that is unique to Travellers and is unspecified but is not racism.  Accordingly, Travellers have been excluded from important Government and other initiatives to tackle racism over the years, including proposed legislation on hate speech.  This was clearly evidenced when, in 2005, Pavee Point had to lobby the Government and embarrass it at the hearing in Geneva at the first International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, ICERD, report, citing how Travellers had been excluded from the Know Racism public awareness campaign and lobbying to be invited to be part of the national steering committee for the action plan against racism.<br/><br/>Since the Government axed the effective National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, responsibility for anti-racism and interculturalism lies with the integration unit in the Department of Justice and Equality.  This unit specifically deals only with migrant integration and excludes Travellers.  How then can Travellers be included in anti-racism and intercultural initiatives as a right?<br/><br/>A further example of this was the potential exclusion of Travellers from the census question on ethnicity.  Pavee Point lobbied for this question for many years.  Ironically, when it was finally introduced, the only group that was to be excluded was the Traveller community because the State did not recognise its ethnicity.  We had to lobby and get a compromise question, that being, &quot;What is your ethnic or cultural background?&quot;  The cultural bit ensures that it is inclusive of Travellers.<br/><br/>Third, the Government position on Traveller ethnicity is contradictory and confusing to many outside observers.  There are numerous examples of stated Government policy recognising Travellers as an ethnic group in all but name.  The definition under the Equal Status Act 2000 is:</p><blockquote>&quot;Traveller community&quot; means the community of people who are commonly called Travellers and who are identified (both by themselves and others) as people with a shared history, culture and traditions including, historically, a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland.</blockquote> <p>While the question of what constitutes an ethnic group has not been defined in Irish law, the language used to define Travellers under the Equal Status Act is virtually identical to, and is clearly drawn from the definitions of, what constitutes an ethnic group under British law.  In the landmark case that Mr. Martin alluded to, the British courts stated that, for a group to constitute an ethnic group, it must fulfil a number of conditions, including a long shared history and a cultural tradition of its own.  It is ironic that Travellers are recognised as an ethnic group in the other jurisdictions but not in the Republic of Ireland.  Personal accounts from Travellers in England show that they felt more respected as a result of the recognition of their ethnicity.<br/><br/>Pavee Point contends that the continued lack of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group and the lack of explicit acknowledgment that they experience racism have much deeper consequences than an abstract sociological or ideological debate and are major contributing factors to the slow pace of change and the confused and sometimes contradictory policy approaches of Government interventions relating to Travellers in recent years.  We are also mindful that recognition of ethnicity, in and of itself, will not be a panacea for Traveller inclusion in Irish society.  However, it is an essential part of the jigsaw for creating the conditions where Travellers can feel respected, their cultural identity can be celebrated and the State can no longer discount the lived experiences of anti-Traveller discrimination and racism.</p></speech>

For people who do not know me, "Minc&eacute;irs Whiden" is Gammon, the Traveller language, and means "Travellers talking".  It is an all-Ireland Traveller-only forum of approximately 900 members.  I am saying this so that the committee has some understanding of where I am coming from on this issue.</p><p>I thank members for this opportunity to make a presentation and, as already has been stated, for a follow-on work to that done by the previous committee.  A lot of good work and recommendations came out of that, which unfortunately were not acted upon.</p><p> It was the State that institutionalised the mindset that Ms Ronnie Fay and others have spoken of, that Travellers are a sub-culture of poverty and are a failed part of the settled community.  It is akin to seeing the shadow of one self; that we are failed settled people who need to be rehabilitated.  It was the State that institutionalised that mindset in the itinerancy report of 1963.  It did not happen by accident.  This has been continually reflected since the 1960s in policy, practice and attitudes towards Travellers, including all the Traveller children who went through schools, including myself.  We nearly were educated to not be a Traveller.  Mr. Martin Collins spoke of the internalised oppression and shame that comes from that.  I am a psychotherapist and we see how it becomes internalised; when one cannot defend it as a child then one will internalise it.  There is a lot of internalised shame and it has done damage to countless Travellers.  Reference was made to suicide and mental health and I deal with that on a daily basis.  I know Senator Frances Black from another arena with regard to mental health issues and I see internalised oppression and shame every day of the week, as well as how that internalised struggle is dealt with or sometimes how some people, unfortunately, cannot deal with it.</p><p> Many Travellers, as a result of being told so by their teachers and by the media, feel from the day they are born that they are failed settled people.  That is the message the State has given to all Travellers.  The State is saying that actually, the culture is not a valid culture, that really a Traveller is a failed settled person.  It did not recognise any of the evidence that is there to the contrary and the State has not come up with anything so far.  As I talk I get emotional about the matter because as Ms Ronnie Fay and Mr. Martin Collins have said, we have been dealing with this for 35 years.  I re-read a leaflet recently from Minceir Misli another all-Traveller group I was with in the 1980s about the recognition of ethnicity.  We are still here and the State continues to refuse it.  We do not have equality in the State and we can never have equality in the State for Travellers until Travellers are recognised as an ethnic group.  It is saying that one can have equality but really, the Traveller is a failed settled person.  That is the message Travellers are getting.  We cannot have full equality for Travellers until Travellers are recognised as an ethnic group in the State.  As long as the State continues to deny Traveller ethnicity it is still working towards what is written in the 1963 Commission on Itinerancy report and named as the "final solution".</p><p> I know the language has changed from "absorption" to "integration" but unless there is recognition of ethnicity, it is still assimilation.  The end product is still the same.  The language has changed and there has been some move towards change, but recognition of ethnicity is one of the crucial issues that underpin all the actions and the mindset, including the relationship between settled people and Travellers on this island.  The national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, is being developed at present and we asked that "inclusion" be the term used rather than "integration" because the word integration really does not do what it says on the tin.  If this strategy is not based on a recognition of Traveller ethnicity, then it is going to be based on the same mindset that has driven the policies in the State for generations and which has done countless damage to the relationships between settled people and Travellers but also to the everyday lives of Travellers themselves and to Traveller children on this island.  It is through that recognition that we need to change.  If we are going to make a change we need to make it based on respect for cultural identity for all - as Mr. Martin Collins has said - and there is no conflict between ethnicity and nationality.  I attended a lecture recently by a Nigerian lady who said there are some 350 different ethnic groups in Nigeria.  For a moment I thought she was talking about the whole of Africa, but she was talking about the 350 ethnic groups in Nigeria.  All are black, some spoke the same language some spoke other languages, negating the idea that one cannot have a separate ethnic identity without being of a separate nationality.  That mindset needs to be challenged within Ireland because we are going to have a lot more ethnic minorities - and we already do - who will be Irish but of different ethnic origin.  If that does not change, the annihilation of Traveller culture will continue and we will continue to see the conditions that Travellers live in, and we will continue to see people internalising their oppression that expresses itself in different ways, such as through addiction, suicide, self-harm or a complete and utter breakdown of a community.  We can see it through homelessness, which is a huge issue in Ireland.  Travellers really did not have an issue with homelessness.  I know that we live in pretty poor conditions but we did not have an issue with homelessness up until about ten or 15 years ago.  A person could get a trailer and move somewhere, but with the advent of the anti-trespass legislation we can no longer do that.  The private rented sector or the market will not come in and do anything about that with regard to Travellers.  We can see it already and more and more Travellers are becoming homeless.  We need to address these issues.  As we sit here there are people all over the State living in conditions they can no longer tolerate.  Most of the people sitting on this side of the committee room are out there every day of the week and see it happening on the ground.  I know that I get a bit emotional when I talk about these matters because it does affect me.  I lived in it.  I grew up in Cherry Orchard, one of the first big campsites in Ballyfermot.  I lived in Labre Park and in a caravan most of my life.  I saw it at the ground level but now it is even worse because people cannot move somewhere else.  If the State does not recognise Traveller ethnicity I am no sure where the State is going with regard to equality.  It is only words on paper and does not mean anything.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I am chairperson of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD, and for more than 30 years I have been engaged in solidarity work with Travellers and Roma organisations in Ireland, Europe and beyond.  I am an academic at the National University of Ireland Maynooth and am proud to have taught more than 20 Traveller graduates.  I suggest that quite a few of the 1% who were spoken of are actually our NUI graduates.  They are graduates because key to that sort of positive engagement was an explicit recognition of Traveller identity and ethnicity and a very welcoming atmosphere to Traveller identity and ethnicity.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to engage with it today.  I apologise if some of what I say repeats what my friends have already said.  It is, however, important that perhaps the members hear some of it from us as part of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.  I thank the members for their ongoing interest in this urgent and important matter for Travellers and for Irish society as a whole.</p> <p>  The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, ICERD, which in 2015 marked 50 years since its adoption, is the first UN human rights treaty.  In effect it came in during 1965 and was ratified in 1969.  If we look to that period, we remember the terrible things that were happening with regard to apartheid in South Africa.  That created the catalyst for this treaty.  The 177 countries of the 192 member states globally of the United Nations have ratified the convention.  The others countries that have not ratified it, there are one or two that I will not name, are some of the small island states------</p></speech>

I now understand that the third report - if members can do the mathematics, they can work out that it is well and truly due - is being prepared and will be submitted next year with examination by the committee, probably in 2018.  If at a later stage, the committee would like me to come and talk about wider issues associated with these matters, I would be very happy to do so.<br/><br/>CERD actively supports the widely international consensus regarding the rights of people to identify as members of particular ethnic groups and has called on states to acknowledge this self identification.  CERD is a small convention with seven articles and is not too difficult to manage.  The way we amplify and explain the issues we are dealing with is by general recommendations, of which there are 35.  The last one is about hate speech, which I would suggest is also very relevant, as my colleagues have already mentioned, for Travellers in Ireland. Our general recommendation 27 furthermore recognises and seeks remedies for the particular discrimination faced by Roma and Travellers, which the committee felt needed to be directly named and identified,  Sometimes in international documentation, the term used is &quot;Roma&quot; but you will normally find a footnote at the bottom of the page, certainly in CERD documentation, that says that the term is used in an overall way to include other groups like Travellers and Sinti.  In our view,  discrimination can and often does include identity denial and despisal of identity, which, as my colleagues have said, has very particular effects and consequences for members of the community.  <br/><br/>The concluding observations of CERD on Ireland, alongside those of a number of other UN treaty bodies and the reports of the working groups on Ireland's two universal periodic reviews of the overall state of human rights in Ireland - my apologies for all these short-cut terminologies - have consistently recognised and recommended that the Irish State should acknowledge Traveller ethnicity.  In 2011, building on what Mr. Collins has said, which I will not repeat, and recalling general recommendation 8, we called on Ireland to pay particular attention to self identification as a critical factor in the identification and conceptualisation of Travellers as an ethnic minority group.  Building on the previous recommendations we have already spoken to, we recommended that the State should continue to engage with the Traveller community and work concretely towards recognising Travellers as an ethnic group.  This was in 2011 and I must be clear that we are now in late 2016.  That engagement may have happened but the recognition has not yet been realised.  In fact as has already been pointed out including here by Emily Logan of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, there already is <i>de facto</i>recognition of Traveller ethnicity in Irish equality legislation with the definition of Travellers adopted by the Oireachtas for the Equal Status Act largely conforming to understood international definitions of ethnicity, including those used in British legislation.  In addition, I would suggest that such recognition is also implied by the focus on discrimination and racism against Travellers in the State's reports to Council of Europe human rights bodies as well as to the UN bodies listed above.<br/><br/>There are no legal barriers to recognising Traveller ethnicity.  Acknowledging the right of Travellers to be named as a minority ethnic group and as a full part of Irish society involves two important steps, namely, respect and recognition but these, as has already been pointed out, must be in tandem with the third step, of the State assuming its responsibilities to create the conditions for a level playing field within which Irish Travellers can actively be full citizens in Irish society.  This means, as has been pointed out by a variety of international bodies, full engagement and involvement with Travellers and their organisations in the design, organisation, implementation and management of programmes on their behalf.  It means addressing the rights gaps that have been very well articulated by my colleagues here this morning that relate to accommodation, education and employment and with due regard to hate speech and due acknowledgement of the rights of Traveller women and children.  All of these are well articulated in the recommendations made by various international bodies.<br/><br/>I suggest that there has been some work done in this area.  There have been cutbacks but there has been some work that is ongoing.  The National Traveller and Roma Integration Strategy could provide a very useful starting point but it needs resourcing and finalisation and it needs to be implemented as a matter of urgency.  Acknowledgement of Traveller ethnicity will not directly address the widespread, entrenched and often structural inequalities and discrimination experienced by Traveller women, men and children in Irish society but it could begin to help the contradictions that have been articulated in particular by Mr. Fay and the reluctance to move to a rights-based framework.  It could also help to assign the failed assimilation imperative, which my friends have already discussed, and its consequences for Travellers, along with the patently inaccurate conflation of ethnicity and nationality.  What it will and can do, as someone who has seen this across a number of countries that have come before the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, is to act as an important gesture of acknowledgement, respect and recognition, which cannot be underestimated for Traveller women, men and children and should not continue to be sidestepped.</p></speech>

If the Taoiseach or Minister stood up today in the D&aacute;il and recognised Travellers, as this committee recommended two years ago in 2014, what would be the impact on the morale and mental health of Travellers, particularly in the wake of tragedies like Carrickmines?  I am directing this question to Mr. McCann given his psychotherapy background.  What is the impact of the foot-dragging of the Irish State in respect of recognising Irish Travellers on morale and mental health?  That question is for all the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.781" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas McCann" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016110900002#D00400"><p>It would send a very clear message to the Traveller community that this State recognises and validates its culture.  It would not be a magic wand because we have dealt with and are dealing with generations of exclusion, racism and poverty.  It would not change things overnight but it would start a process of healing in this State and begin to build confidence in the community.  It is good that there is some funding for Traveller Pride week but recognition by the State would be a much stronger position from which to build Traveller pride in terms of this State recognising Traveller identity.</p> <p>  In terms of mental health, the denial of identity has a huge impact on mental health.  Numerous pieces of work have been done on this by different people that relate to internalised shame, low self-esteem and denial of identity.  Employment was mentioned earlier.  There have been cases where when Travellers were employed and it was discovered that they were Travellers, many of them were let go.  I sat on the board of the Equality Authority for eight years when it was first established and have seen cases coming through.  People had to hide their identities and still do in order not to be penalised.  This has a huge impact on Travellers.</p><p>It is hard to compare the situation of Traveller children.  I tried to think of a comparison earlier.  It might be comparable to colonisation or something.  It is a colonisation of culture.  The only comparison I could draw is that it is similar to when a country is colonised and an identity is eroded.  I do not know whether the committee is familiar with some of the depictions of Irishness in <i>Punch </i>magazine.  It is the same erosion of culture and has an impact on people.  I am glad to see that has changed.  Irish confidence and self esteem 50 or 60 years ago was in a very different place than it is today.<br/><br/>The families in Carrickmines are living on a reclaimed dump and face significant health hazards.  They are waiting for accommodation that will probably not be delivered until the end of 2017, if it happens at all.  As people know, there was a protest by residents when a field was identified for the families affected to move into.  I know the families are living in terrible conditions because councillors visit them on a regular basis.</p></speech>

The <i>International Journal of Epidemiology</i>conducted a review of all of the research examining the impact of racism on health.  It found there is extensive evidence there is an association between self-reported racism and ill health after adjusting for a range of commonly-measured cofounders and that the strongest and most reliable association is between racism and poor mental health.<br/><br/>The all-Ireland Traveller health study showed that only 41% of Travellers had confidence and trust in the health service, as against 82% of the general population.  It also showed that 40% of Travellers had experienced discrimination in accessing health services, compared to 70% of black Americans and 14% of Latino Americans.  That shows that Travellers in Ireland experienced much higher rates of racism and discrimination than in other jurisdictions where there might be a perception that things are worse.<br/><br/>There is evidence of health inequalities in Ireland.  The Department of Health has not convened the national Traveller health advisory committee since October 2012.  Travellers are invisible in the forthcoming HSE service plan.  The health inequality statistics for Travellers are the worst in the country.  The social inclusion budget that has been allocated will deal with homelessness and drugs, which are major issues, but not one penny will go to Travellers.  The Traveller budget was decimated even before the Celtic tiger.<br/><br/>Recognition of ethnicity will not be a panacea, but it will mean that people have to take the issues into account.  Connecting for Life, the suicide strategy, shows that the rate of suicide among Traveller men is 6.6 times or seven times higher, accounting for 11% of Traveller deaths.  Travellers are included with all other vulnerable groups.  That shows the mindset and impact of that mindset.  We have to take urgent action.<br/><br/>The all-Ireland Traveller health study was published in 2010.  There has never been an action plan to address its findings.  We cannot do any more.  We are not being listened to.  Unless there is a driver and sanctions for inaction and someone takes responsibility nothing will happen; goodwill will not make things happen.<br/><br/>There are fantastic people in the HSE and the Department of Health, but the institutional framework is lacking.  Unless we have accountability and a process to drive things forward, the same things will continue to happen.  No one seems to care.  Nothing happens when Travellers are being killed.  One could call it ethnic cleansing.</p></speech>

From their point of view, there is probably an element of groundhog day to this meeting because they appeared before a previous committee which produced a report.  We will produce a report and will definitely endorse what was in the previous committee's report.  We need to go further than that.  There is no point in a committee repeating what a previous committee said.  I would be interested in hearing what the witnesses would like us to include in the report we will produce the end of this process.</p> <p>  Many members of the public are unaware of the difference between nationality and ethnicity, and have not directed their minds to that question.  The witnesses are perfectly legitimate in saying that the responsibility for informing the public rests upon the State, and that change will happen if the relevant Minister or Taoiseach makes the appropriate announcement in the D&aacute;il.  The witnesses have limited resources, and that fact needs to be communicated to the general public.</p> <p>  Any campaign benefits from canvassing local representatives.  A Fianna F&aacute;il representative, Deputy Bobby Aylward, came to me to say that Travellers in Kilkenny had asked him to canvass and campaign on their behalf and lobbied him to try to get their ethnicity recognised.  He mentioned it to me and I found it quite effective.  It is something witnesses may also think of doing with other representatives.</p> <p>  Why do the witnesses think ethnicity has not been recognised?  I am not looking for the retrospective blame of people, but why has the relevant Minister or Taoiseach not made the required statement?  My second question has probably been answered in the response to Senator Kelleher.  It is important to identify the tangible benefit to Travellers of the recognition of their ethnicity by the State.</p></speech>

I do not think we can overestimate or have the capacity to adequately convey the significance and symbolic value of the Taoiseach of the State standing in the D&aacute;il and making a declaration to the House and the country that the State unequivocally recognises Travellers as a distinct ethnic minority group.</p> <p>  Mr. McCann referred to self-respect, feeling valued and recognised and having one's identity recognised.  As Ms Fay said, ethnicity is not a panacea, but it is quite important and would be a very good starting point.  It would inform a range of other areas in terms of how services are designed and delivered and how the needs of Travellers are met.</p> <p>  I would suggest that Travellers are completely invisible in schools because our culture, identity and history are not reflected in the curriculum.  One could argue that the curriculum and education system as it is currently constructed is part of the assimilationist agenda.  The same is true of accommodation policies and other areas.</p> <p>  A declaration of ethnicity is the beginning, rather than an end in itself.  It needs to be followed up by a national plan on how we support ethnicity in a practical sense.  Nomadism and the right to travel is important.  That right has been suppressed by the State because there is a view that nomadism is a backward, primitive way of life and has no place in a civilised, western and democratic society.  It has been relegated to something that is deviant and backward.  There are practical implications.</p> <p>  Travellers are completely invisible in our museums and heritage centres.  It is as if we do not exist.  When we commemorated 1916 this year, Travellers were completely excluded and invisible.  I would like to point out that Travellers were actively involved in and inextricably linked to all of these events in terms of Irish history, including Independence, the Easter Rising, the subsequent Civil War and so forth.</p> <p>  As we all know, history is always about people who own the mines, not about those who work in them.  Those who are part of the elite and have privilege and power are those who get to interpret and write history, and do so from their world view.</p> <p>  There are symbolic implications, but there are also practical implications, as I have just outlined.  I do not know whether that answers the question.</p></speech>

Up to now there has been an ongoing refusal to believe the evidence.  First, there is a notion that Travellers were somehow dropouts from the Famine.  The historical records from the day indicate fairly clearly that this was not the case.  There was a Poor Law inquiry which predates the Famine.  Different categories of people or their representatives came along to that Poor Law inquiry.  Among them was a group then referred to as &quot;tynkers&quot; - not a term Travellers wish to be referred to - and another group referred to as &quot;beggars&quot;.  It was clearly understood well before the Famine that there were different categories.  There is plenty of historical evidence from scholars to illustrate that point going way back beyond that.<br/><br/>There has been a sort of commitment to the notion of us as a monocultural society.  I would welcome more time on another occasion to try to disperse that notion of ourselves.  We have never been a monocultural society; there has always been diversity in Irish society, represented by Travellers, black Irish people, Jewish people and others.  They may have been small minorities, but they did exist.  Thankfully, we have greater diversity now.  It is also about a power differential and use of denial identity as a mechanism for maintaining a power differential.<br/><br/>There is also probably a certain lack of awareness and a need to engage in some of the discussions the Deputy is talking about.  He mentioned the difference between ethnicity and nationality.  I speak as somebody who worked for nearly a decade with the Irish community in the UK.  We have been able to recognise the differences between ethnicity and nationality when we are speaking about the Irish diaspora abroad - I am concerned for some of them today.  When speaking about the Irish diaspora abroad we have been clear about acknowledging the difference between ethnicity and nationality.  We may just need to apply the same logic to our capacity to recognise the difference between ethnicity and nationality for Travellers who are full Irish citizens and should be a full part of Irish society.<br/><br/>On this issue we need political leadership.  I welcome the Deputy's question and I welcome the opportunity to say to members of the committee that in my experience as a member of CERD and having worked globally on these issues, I recognise that it takes political leadership to begin to create the conditions for a cultural shift.  What the Deputy says and what the Taoiseach might be able to say in the D&aacute;il are particularly important in that regard.<br/><br/>I accept that the Traveller organisations can contribute, as they already have contributed very substantially.  I speak as someone who has been actively involved with a number of them in recent years.  However, the powerless can do only so much.  In the end, the Deputy represents the powerful political establishment even if he does not feel that some of the time.  It is important that his words get heard in this Chamber and elsewhere.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked what difference it would make.  Earlier I spoke about this acknowledgement, which is <i>de facto</i>already present.  For me this acknowledgement respects a floor of respect and recognition.  However, it also requires the State to fully assume its responsibilities to address the other gaps and the contradictions Ms Fay outlined, by on the one hand acknowledging racism experienced by Travellers by reporting to my committee with the responsibility globally for monitoring racism and then at the same time Travellers not being explicitly included in programmes and initiatives to address racism in Ireland.  It will make for an interesting discussion the next time Ireland's CERD report is brought before the committee which should be in 2018.<br/><br/>There are also a number of other gaps which my colleagues have already articulated.  There is the possibility of the current inclusion strategy addressing those gaps, but it needs resources, commitment and that cultural shift.</p></speech>

A few weeks ago we heard the shocking metrics about health outcomes, infant mortality, life expectancy and mental health, as well as the core social problems in health, education, housing, etc.  As Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned, it is important that this committee reinforces what the previous committee did and the positive measures it proposed.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach made that very important statement of recognition and respect.  I know this has happened with the Sami people in Scandinavia and there have been other groups in the North, in Britain and elsewhere.  What has been the practical effect of that over a period of time for groups there?  How has it improved their relative position in that society at that time?  Some reports mention that mental health and self-respect have improved.  I ask the witnesses to go into more detail about how that formal move by the state has had practical implications for people.</p></speech>

This is the same with the Sami people, the Maori or indigenous people in other parts of the world.  That recognition and that acknowledgement create a ground floor.  I will leave it to my colleagues to talk about the particular things.  The Sami people now have their own parliament and they work across a number of countries.  Some of these recognitions of indigenous people have come very late in the day.  However, it means that indigenous people even in what was until relatively recently war-torn Guatemala for example are acknowledged and recognised within the country.  It does not do away with the racism, discrimination and a variety of other things they experience but it is a first step towards creating conditions for full citizenship.  It has made that difference.  It means that people can come fully to the international arena and represent themselves, both as, for example, New Zealander and Maori.  It certainly makes a difference.</p> <p>  The corollary of that is the implication that somehow this would confer extra rights on Travellers, which is not the case.  It creates the conditions where Travellers can exercise or may be able to exercise the rights they should have as citizens in Irish society by addressing the other gaps.  I will leave it to my colleagues to talk about the other gaps.</p></speech>

As was said, usually the powerless are written out of history.  Sometimes there is a thing called the alternative history, the laws that were made against people.  I recently looked at the Vagrancy Act from the 1500s or 1600s that named one of the groups as tinkers.  It goes way back and this State has just carried on this exclusion which has gone on for centuries.  There is a power dimension.</p> <p>  As was said, there are benefits for people in terms of identity, feeling included in the State and equality.  There is the right to have one's identity recognised.  I think we have a right to be recognised in this State.  We are members of this State and have been here for a long time.  We have a right to be recognised by the State as an ethnic group.  There is a power dimension and each time we have to justify.  It is with the best will in the world that people come to the table and ask what the benefits of that are.  However, we have to constantly justify why and what the outcome of that would be.  If the tables were turned and the settled people were on the other side and were coming to us and asking why settled culture should not be recognised, I think members would have an understanding of the frustration we feel, constantly having to put that argument forward.</p> <p>  The evidence is there.  There has been report after report.  We know the conditions.  We need to change that.  I spoke earlier about the neighbours of the people in Carrickmines coming out and protesting.  That would not happen with any other group.</p><p>That told us something about the state of the relationship between Travellers and the settled community.  Recognition would begin to change this.  Not only does the State need to recognise Traveller ethnicity, it must also make a formal apology to Travellers for the injustice done to them.  Minc&eacute;irs Whiden calls for such a formal apology because Travellers might then believe some positive action will be taken and that it will be meant rather than an idle statement.  Recognition of Traveller ethnicity and an apology to the Traveller community for what the State has done to Travellers are needed.  This is there in black and white and it needs to be acted on if relationships and conditions are to change.  It would be a stepping stone in building new relationships.  That is the key effect it would have. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.795" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ronnie Fay" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016110900002#G00200"><p>To add briefly to what Mr. McCann and Ms Crickley said, recognition of Traveller ethnicity would make intangible differences which cannot be properly measured.  The impact of the referendum on marriage equality is a good example.  The referendum made a major difference for gay people but these differences are hard to identify because gay people were already protected in law and had access to rights, etc.  Many intangibles will flow from recognition of Traveller ethnicity, as people will feel accepted, respected and part of society.  There are many intangible issues that we cannot put our fingers on but which will make a major difference to people's feelings of self-esteem and self-respect.</p> <p>  One of the tangible differences recognition would make is that Travellers would become more visible.  I acknowledge that the joint committee has a wide brief and members have different interests and focuses.  The recently published action plan for education recommends only one Traveller-specific action, which relates to Travellers in third level education.  This is against a backdrop of major inequality in education, cuts in resource teaching and visiting teachers for Travellers, cuts in school transport and so forth.  I should say that we lobbied for the action recommended in the education plan and it would make a start.</p> <p>  My point is that I do not blame members because I know they are all busy.  Nevertheless, they need to ask how legislation can be Traveller proofed, as it were.  One of the best ways to do so is to keep the Traveller issue in mind.  It is not the case that legislators set out to discriminate.  People are busy and racism can be sometimes unintentional but unintentional racism has exactly the same impact as intentional racism.</p> <p>  Recognition of Traveller ethnicity would have real tangible and intangible effects.  The main intangible benefit would be in terms of visibility, active participation and consciousness.  A further benefit would be if legislation were Traveller proofed, which means asking what would be the impact of legislation coming through the Oireachtas on Travellers.</p> <p>  As I stated, we should consider the action plan for education in the context of inequality in education.  For example, given that 62% of Travellers experience discrimination in school and only 13% complete second level schooling, why is there only one action on Travellers in the recent action plan?  Those are the types of issues that must be addressed.</p></speech>

I was present in the D&aacute;il Chamber last year when the Private Members' Bill was discussed and it was heartbreaking.  Everyone who participated in the debate had a tangible feeling.</p><p>The witnesses dealt with the &quot;Sure, what does it matter?&quot; argument, which is one that is often thrown around.  The marriage equality referendum probably helped in this regard because people used to make similar arguments about gay people when they would say they had access to civil partnerships, for example.  The delivery of the referendum result quantified for people what something like that means.  There is an onus on members and the witnesses to package this argument.  </p><p>The decision to add this issue to the committee's equality agenda is an indication that it is an important issue for us.  I do not have questions, other than to ask what the barriers are to achieving recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  The witnesses stated it would not have a cost.  Is that not part of the problem?</p><p>Equality does not mean treating everybody the same but recognising difference and allowing people to achieve their potential.  It is argued in a duplicitous way that, in the name of equality, Travellers should not be singled out and everyone should be treated the same.  At the same time, we are slashing the transport budget which <i>de facto </i>means that Traveller children cannot get to school.  </p><p>Inequality saves the State money in the short term but denies Traveller children their potential and also has health impacts.  Is that one of the reasons behind this or is there anything more?  All of the arguments the witnesses have made are straightforward.  There is a contradiction involved to the extent that we recognise Traveller ethnicity in some ways and deny it in others.  Is the issue one of cost?  The arguments for recognising Traveller ethnicity are clear-cut and we will push the issue.  </p></speech>

How can we make a counter argument when we do not know what argument is being made?  We are arguing with one hand tied behind our back.  It is Kafkaesque because it is as if we have been arrested, no charges have been laid and there will not be a trial.  How can we respond?</p> <p>  The committee needs to hold the State to account by asking for an explanation of its failure to recognise Traveller ethnicity.  We were told cost was the reason but that is not the case.  We were then told it was a legal issue but that is not the reason either.  We have rebutted any reasons that have been given and the onus can no longer be placed on us.  If there is an argument, let us hear it and we will either make a counter-argument or not, although I am certain we will have an argument.  There has never been a rebuttal of our case in the public domain.</p> <p>  We spoke about the importance of political leadership.  A previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. John O'Donoghue, recognised Travellers as an ethnic group when he launched a pack for us, and the former Ministers for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, did likewise.  One must ask who is the permanent government and where is the opposition to recognition within it.  As far as we can see, there are good people in the Department of Justice and Equality who are fighting for us on this issue.  We do not know what is the argument against recognition because we have never been given one.  This makes it difficult for us to make counter-arguments.  I am being honest with the committee.  </p></speech>

It would be wrong and dishonest to claim we will fix the issue but I hope we will try to do so.  We have not thought enough about this issue.  Sometimes we listen to Travellers and are horrified.  We ask how we can treat a group of people like this in our own country but when we leave the room, we move on and do other things because there are many other problems and issues.  I hope this will change and members will be able to help.</p></speech>

I thank the groups present for the great work they are doing and apologise for the lack of support they are receiving.  I am ashamed that Travellers do not receive more support.  I am very aware of the great work Mr. McCann does.  I have no doubt the witnesses are extremely frustrated by the failure to gain support or make progress on this issue.  I feel bad about that.</p> <p>  Having listened to Deputy Wallace, I believe the committee will work hard to make a difference because this is a good committee.  I am new to the Oireachtas, however, and I do not know how slowly the wheels turn here.  I am sure Deputy Wallace knows how this works.  Hopefully, we will not produce just another report.  </p> <p>  Ms Fay stated that Travellers needed someone in the Oireachtas who would drive this issue forward.</p><p>I would like her to expand a little on that.</p><p> Ms Fay produced a fantastic chart on the cuts from 2008 and 2013 affecting education in particular and accommodation.  It is shocking to note the amount of money that has been cut.  Why does Ms Fay believe this has happened? </p><p> I note what Mr. McCann is saying.  The shame felt by the Traveller community is almost compounded by the fact that there is no recognition of ethnicity for it.  This needs to change absolutely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.803" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ronnie Fay" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016110900002#H00200"><p>I will try to answer the questions.  With regard to the cuts, the reality is that many political choices were made under the guise of austerity.  The community and voluntary sector was cut to the tune of 36%, which was totally disproportionate.  As I have highlighted, funding for the Traveller sector was cut by between 80% and 100%.  This could happen because nobody cared or listened.  We highlighted this and campaigned but no one was looking after our issue.  We carried out research and gave the evidence but what we desire has still not happened.  Linked to the driver notion is the fact that we have been calling for a Traveller agency for the past 20 years or more.  It is not unique to any one area.  Circumstances in education are particularly bad, and the same is the case for health.  There has never been a Traveller training or employment strategy.  Some 84% of Travellers are unemployed.  This State was rightly regarded as in crisis when there was an unemployment rate of 14%.  During the Celtic tiger years, 84% of Travellers were employed but nobody seems to care.  Having looked at the recent action plan for Traveller education for the period 2016 to 2019, I note that there has been one Traveller action for the group that has probably the most educational inequalities.  We all know that the better educated one is, the healthier one is and the more likely one is to get out of poverty and be employed.  There are cumulative impacts.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan asked what additional points could be in the report?  I would include the call for a Traveller agency.  We are not naive enough to believe we will get an accommodation agency, a health agency and an employment agency.  I call for one agency that looks after culture, gender, accommodation, health and education.  Unless this is established, what has been happening will continue to happen, unfortunately.</p> <p>  The various political groupings in the House could consider having a guardian angel for Travellers in each of the sections.  It does not just happen.  It is not that people set out to exclude, but that there is exclusion because there are so many other agendas and political pressures.  Some 42% of Travellers are under 15 years of age and 65% are under 25.  Therefore, there is a very young population so Travellers do not have the capacity to lobby in the same way as others.  The community is dispersed so it does not have political clout in the same way.  We, the Council of Europe and CERD have called on every single Taoiseach for many years to appoint a Traveller as a Taoiseach's nominee in the Seanad.  It has never happened.  It would not be the panacea but it would be symbolic.  If a politician is meeting a Traveller in here, he or she is more likely to think about the Travellers.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the equality debate.  There will be no Front Bench spokespersons coming out as Travellers in this House; that is the reality.  It was great that there were gay people who could come out and add their voice within the parliamentary parties, but that will never happen for Travellers.  We must recognise the extreme marginalisation of Travellers and the fact that we are not starting on a level playing field.  A lot has to happen.  Ethnic recognition is one tiny step, but it would be very significant and a key part of the jigsaw that must be put in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.804" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016110900002#H00300"><p>I will build on that.  Ms Fay and others have spoken at length about the policy implications of not recognising Traveller ethnicity.  Traveller ethnicity has to be the starting point.  On that, one builds the policy infrastructure in terms of services and how services get designed and delivered, be it in schools or the health service or through recruitment strategies for employment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and so forth.  However, it is only a starting point; it is not the panacea in itself.  It is not an end in itself but the beginning.  It is a very important beginning, however.</p> <p>  Why are things happening to Travellers in the way they are?  Ms Fay is absolutely right that Travellers lack a political voice both within their community and outside it in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and local authorities.  We have very few champions within the institutions of the State, including the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I will not be as generous as Ms Fay on racism.  The reality is that there are politicians at local level and within the D&aacute;il who are racist.  We have seen examples of that.  The D&aacute;il can be a microcosm of the wider society.  We must be honest and acknowledge that.  I will not name names but we have seen examples over the years of Deputies at local level blocking Traveller accommodation.  We have had Deputies come out with anti-Traveller racism in the not-too-distant past.  We are dealing with institutional racism among the political classes and political elite.  There is no getting away from that.  It is a challenge and a block.  It is important to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  With regard to ethnicity, apart from the practical implications, which are very important, unequivocal recognition by the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il of Traveller ethnicity would put to bed once and for all the racist notion and ideology that my community is in some way dysfunctional, primitive and backward, and that it comprises people who need to be civilised and normalised by the State.  It is a racist ideology.  If an announcement in the D&aacute;il achieved nothing else, it would address this.</p></speech>

I would love to see the day on which it happens.  Mr. Collins is correct that the hostility permeates through all levels of life.  One sees it manifest in political life and beyond.</p> <p>  I agree with much of what my colleagues around the table have said.  Like Senator Black, I am a new member of this committee so I appreciate the engagement we have had over the past two sessions.  It has allowed us to hear and learn a little more.  My key question was whether recognition of Traveller ethnicity would really make a practical, tangible difference given the socioeconomic, cultural, community and social issues that exist.  On the day that is in it, I believe very firmly in and advocate a politics that is for social justice and respecting and promoting diversity and equality.  The delegates, in addition to their colleagues during the last session, have made the argument very clearly that an announcement from the Taoiseach and legislation on ethnicity would be fundamentally important.  I appreciate that.</p> <p>  On the issue of the delay or hold-up, I believe the delegates have answered their own question.  Mr. Collins referred to the subtext to the narrative, which involves hostility, prejudice and racism towards the Traveller community.  Mr. McCann said it was the State that institutionalised the mindset, and that mindset still prevails.</p> <p>  Let me outline my concern and political objective regarding this issue.  I hope the Taoiseach makes an announcement on Traveller ethnicity sooner rather than later and recognises it legislatively but I am concerned that the mindset will still prevail.  That is my experience in the North regarding the Traveller community.  Although there is recognition in the North, all the issues faced by Traveller people in the South arise there.  I refer to social, health and educational issues and access to jobs and training opportunities.  I do not want to sound too defeatist because I take a great deal of heart from what the delegates have said and are advocating.  With the collective political will, we can achieve recognition but the following day we will have to wake up and we will require champions.  We will need people such as the delegates kicking hard day after day to put this on the agenda.</p><p>The delegations are correct.  We are human beings and there is a whole broad range of lobby issues coming at us.  This for me is a fundamental issue.  Mr. Martin Collins touched on it by pointing to the year that is in it and living up to the aspirations of 1916.  If we cannot at the very least respect, support and help our Traveller citizens, then that is a blight on us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas McCann" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016110900002#J00200"><p>Mr. Martin Collins referred to local politicians and Travellers.  Minc&eacute;irs Whiden carried out a political education campaign with Travellers to do exactly that because we do not have any political representation.  When Bills, which predominantly impact on Travellers, are going through, we have no say in them whatsoever.  The anti-trespass legislation, which does not affect settled people, is used against Travellers.  We did not have a say in that.  We do not have any say in the legislation which impacts primarily on our community.</p> <p>  There is a need for a political voice from the Traveller community.  As Ms Ronnie Fay said, we hoped there would be an opportunity for representation with the restructuring of the Seanad.  There are other representative groups there from very privileged communities.  I do not see why the Traveller community cannot be represented in the Seanad, particularly as it is an excluded community.</p> <p>  The denial of Traveller ethnicity does not acknowledge the racism that Travellers face.  Acknowledging Traveller ethnicity will say that what has happened to the Traveller community for decades is racist.  We need to look at that.  There is a lack of acknowledgement by the State that what has happened and is happening to Travellers is racist.  People can and have campaigned on anti-Traveller tickets and stopped Traveller accommodation in areas.  Some councillors are on local authority Traveller accommodation committees not to promote Traveller accommodation, but to ensure it does not go into their area.  That has to stop.</p> <p>  We need to start to build a new relationship based on equality, trust and recognition of cultural identity.  Then we can build some of the programmes, like Ms Fay said.  It might be an agency that will drive and make change.  There might be a question of resources too.  The Equality Authority report on ethnicity stated there might be a rearranging or re-prioritisation of resources.  One must take into consideration the cuts implemented.  The starting point is recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  Then we can start to build a different Ireland based on equality and respect for cultural differences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.808" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anastasia Crickley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016110900002#J00300"><p>Sometimes when this discussion about racism towards Travellers begins, I am reminded of my work with the Irish community in the UK in the 1970s and the campaigns for the release of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven, campaigns in which some committee members were involved.  It took a while for people to acknowledge that what we were experiencing as a community was straightforward racism.  Sometimes there is a need for people here to acknowledge, in the same way, that what has been experienced by Travellers here constitutes racism, in spite of the fact the State reports to the international committee responsible for monitoring racism.  It must also reflect that in all of its policies and administrations.</p> <p>  In my view, and one which has been expressed widely by international instruments, there are no legal barriers to acknowledging Traveller ethnicity.  I use the term deliberately.  Recognising it almost infers one is conferring a favour.  Travellers are a minority ethnic group.  The definition used in our equality legislation is that of an ethnic minority.  In a way it is almost laughable that we would then, having put that definition into our equality legislation, name what we have done for exactly what it is.</p> <p>  The first article of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination states racism can happen when there is purpose, intent or outcome.  It has not just got to do with purpose.  It also has to do with whether the outcome is that people experience racism.  That is precisely what has happened for Travellers.</p> <p>  There is much talk and hate speech towards Travellers which obfuscates and provides spurious explanations about extra costs and extra rights.  These are reflected in every country where we deal with racial discrimination.  That is all 177 countries which have ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.  There is frequently that kind of talk and that sort of concern.  The Traveller organisations have done their bit.  It really is in some way up to our leadership, including all committee members.  In general recommendation No. 35 about hate speech, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination put a special responsibility on politicians and those in leadership roles not just to not use hate speech but to respond to it and to be really a significant part of creating the counter narrative.</p> <p>  Acknowledging Traveller ethnicity creates the conditions for a real move towards a rights-based approach.  It is not that initiatives have not been taken to address Traveller marginalisation and disadvantage.  However, the acknowledgement of ethnicity would put the ball firmly and squarely in a rights-based approach going forward as to how Traveller marginalisation is addressed through several of the mechanisms which my friends have already spoken about.</p> <p>  I fully support the idea of a Traveller agency but I also fully support the need, as indeed is fully reflected in all of the UN human rights treaties we have signed up to, for full participation by Travellers and Traveller organisations in the design, monitoring and implementation of programmes and initiatives that are supposed to address the inequalities they experience.  Ireland has a great record globally in its support of human rights.  I am proud to be part of that in the global sphere.  I would also be proud to be part of a recognition and acknowledgement of Traveller ethnicity here, so that this rights-based approach could be reflected in our work in Ireland.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Jacinta Brack to the Visitors Gallery, for the want of a better description, who was one of our presenters on the last occasion.</p> <p>  What is this about?  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made the point this is about building on, not trying to replace or repeat.  Despite the excellent work and the clearly declared intent of the former justice committee some two years ago and three and a half years from the last time Pavee Point made a presentation before the justice committee, we share the frustration that we are not there yet.  Like the little ad on the television, "Are we there yet?"  I hope we will be.  It is our intent to reinject impetus into the case.  That is why we have made this a priority in the short opportunity that 2016 offers.</p> <p>  Pavee Point and Ms Ronnie Fay disputed the assertion of voices from previous Administrations that recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group would not have the beneficial implications for Traveller status in Irish society.  We also recognise that this is a totally false premise.  Mr. Martin Collins, in his own phraseology, said it would be a powerful and symbolic signal on which to build.  We will take that.</p> <p>  I have not heard the phrase "failed settled person" before.  That is an interesting concept that may be in the minds of some.  I hope we can properly address it.  Mr. Thomas McCann's emphasis on policy, practice and attitudes, especially the impact on children, was well noted by the committee today.  I thank him for that.</p><p>I have one question remaining for Ms Crickley.  I am very interested in the process around the committee for the elimination of racial discrimination.  My understanding is that the Government is obliged to provide a written submission in 2017.  Can Ms Crickley advise by what point in 2017 that must be provided?  I understand also that the written submission is to be followed by an oral follow-through.  Will that take place in 2018?  As argued so well and succinctly by Ms Crickley and other earlier witnesses the clock is ticking and it is time that those who have within their gift to deliver this declaration come forward and so, and with the heart that it deserves, on the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

The process is that the report should be put together in consultation with the groups affected by the issues.  This is part of the process for every UN treaty.  This means that all of the groups that are here and others are actively consulted about the report.  My understanding is that the report is in preparation.  It is usual practice that once a draft is ready there is a consultation process.  The views are taken on board.  It is my hope that the State will support Irish civil society in doing this, as is the case in other countries.  This has not been the practice to the extent that it used to be since times of austerity.  My hope is that Irish civil society and in particular Irish Traveller organisations would be able to attend in Geneva when the Irish State is presenting its report.  This is a normal process in most democratic societies.  In terms of the process, the report is produced and circulated in advance.  The committee appoints a rapporteur, which will not be me and I also will not be able to contribute during the examination.  The country is then examined, usually represented by a Minister or a Minister of State.  The NGOs and civil society and the Irish Human Rights Commission are given an opportunity to make some input and then the whole committee, which is an independent group comprised of 18 people elected from around the world, draws concluding observations and recommendations.  This will happen in early 2018, if the report is submitted next year.  As I said earlier, the report is already late but if it is submitted next year with the information that Traveller ethnicity has been acknowledged I think it would be a positive day for addressing racism towards Travellers in Irish society.</p></speech>

The Good Friday Agreement refers to equal rights North and South of the Border.  As already stated, under the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997, Travellers in the North are recognised as a distinct ethnic minority group.  The Irish Government has an obligation to harmonise our legislation with the legislation that pertains in the North of Ireland.  It is important to make that point.  The 1997 Order is an internationally binding agreement, as many people here will know.</p> <p>  In terms of this process, when will it be completed and will the report be tabled on the floor of the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

I see no reason that cannot be done.  As I explained to Mr. McCann this is the conclusion of this exercise.  If this was a first address we could extend it but that is not the case.  We are contracting it purposely in order to inject the necessary speed because we want to see a result.  We will deliberate on our draft report and have it ready for presentation.</p> <p>  This is a busy committee.  We will have our first report on Irish Sign Language debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  Reports are selected from a lottery and ours was drawn from the hat because it was the only one in it.  It appears we are the only committee yet to have produced a report in 2016.  We intend to stay ahead of the other committees and with a bit of luck - I have never been lucky in lotteries - this report will be on the floor of the D&aacute;il soon.  That is, I believe, our shared and collective intent.  However, that matter will be discussed later when the committee is in private session.</p></speech>

The second of our two scheduled engagements today on the very important issue of the recognition of Traveller ethnicity is a discussion with Dr. Robbie McVeigh.  I advise him that the committee has identified the recognition of Traveller ethnicity as one of its priority issues in 2016 work programme.  I welcome Dr. McVeigh to the meeting.  I understand he has travelled a distance to come here and he has a very tight schedule this morning.  We very much appreciate his taking the time to come before us.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that he will be invited to make a brief opening statement and that will be followed by a questions-and-answers session.  I must advise him on the matter of privilege.  I ask him to note he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence he gives to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are again reminded that under the salient rulings of the Chair they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. Robbie McVeigh to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I congratulate the committee on prioritising this issue, which is a very important one not only for Travellers but in terms of broader human rights and equality issues in Ireland and beyond.  I am very pleased to be here.  I have travelled here from Edinburgh and had to wade my way through the tears of travelling Americans.  There was not one Trump supporter on that flight.  It is interesting times in which we are living.<br/><br/>I spoke at the previous incarnation of this committee in 2013 and we had a broad discussion on some of the substantive issues around what makes Travellers an ethnic group.  I am happy to speak on those issues in depth but I will leave it up to members to raise those in the question-and-answer session.  <br/><br/>I should put my engagement with this issue in context.  I was first asked to address the issue in the context of Northern Ireland by the old Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, which is a pre-peace process body.  That gives members an idea of how long I have been engaged in this.  I was a young man when I started, so I am hoping that we are moving towards closure on this issue.  I engaged with the question as a neutral at that stage.  I was asked to address the question of whether Travellers constituted an ethnic minority in Northern Ireland at that time and I found that they did in that context.  That recommendation was subsequently adopted by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, which then fell into the Race Relations (Northern (Ireland) Order 1997.  It was one of the parts of Travellers being explicitly recognised as a group protected by the race relations order, which ended all the discussion around this issue in the North.  From my perspective, it has been a good thing because people have got on with the business of addressing Traveller issues from the point of view of recognising that Travellers were an ethnic group like many other black and minority ethnic groups across Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>Because of having this background, I was asked to be an expert witness in a case in the London County Court that addressed the question of Traveller ethnicity in England and Wales.  I addressed the question of whether Travellers constitute an ethnic group and England and Wales and found that they did and that assessment was agreed with by the court there.  That was a test case that established that Travellers were an ethnic group in England and Wales.  That is my background.  The members can see where I am coming from and that I have been engaged in this for a long time, if nothing else.<br/><br/>One aspect I did not address on the last occasion I came here, which is worth addressing now, is the situation in Scotland, which is slightly different.  I thought it was useful to include that quote from the Scottish Government in my opening statement.  This frames its policy towards Travellers, including Irish Travellers.  That quote states: &quot;The Scottish Government recognises Gypsy/Travellers as an ethnic group in its work and encourages others to do likewise.&quot;  It took a very explicitly proactive, pro-ethnicity position and that now frames what the Scottish Government does in terms of its work with Travellers and around racism and ethnicity.  Again, that is an example of proactive intervention. <br/><br/>In total, across those different UK jurisdictions and the North, ethnicity is defined and framed by legislation in England by the court case, in which I was involved as an expert witness, and in Scotland now both by legislation and by Government policy.  It is proactively saying that Travellers should be regarded as an ethnic group and that is a positive development.  That is the obvious comparator in terms of our nearest neighbours here. It is worthwhile stressing that the core of what makes Travellers an ethnic group in terms of those judgments and policy statements goes back to the Mandla <i>v</i>. Dowell Lee case, which is the definitive test case in the British context of what constitutes an ethnic group.</p><p>The two essential characteristics of &quot;ethnicity&quot; are a long-shared history and a group with a cultural tradition of its own.  Those are the two elements that would have to be established and we did establish them in terms of getting recognition for Traveller ethnicity in England and Wales, and the North.  Those points have been well made over time.  We can come back to them in discussion if the committee wishes, but I will not list them at this stage.  The essence of the court case was that we had to prove that there was a long-shared history and that Travellers had a cultural tradition of their own.  <br/><br/>One of the key points of interest to the judge in the case was the existence of Travellers in the United States.  Travellers had emigrated to America before the Famine and they went with language and cultural traditions that were established well before the Famine.  If one wanted definitive evidence of a long-shared history, that was it.  It was not that it emerged post-Famine.  It is clear that Traveller cultural traditions were in place before the 1840s at the latest.  That was enough for the judge in the case.  <br/><br/>From my perspective, my job is kind of done.  I have been working on this for a long time.  There is more than enough evidence to support the legal case, which is what I tended to work on.  My sense is that the prevarication and resistance in the South of Ireland is more to do with politics than legal or sociological definitions of ethnicity, although I am happy to work through those again if the committee wishes.  It is important to recognise that there is a <i>realpolitik </i>aspect to this but that reality has to be addressed if ethnicity is to be recognised. <br/><br/>There are two readings of the situation.  One is that a Minister or Government official just thinks that Travellers are not an ethnic group and will keep asserting it.  As I stated earlier, there is not much I can say to that except to say that it is not good policy.  It is not based in evidence.  A huge weight of evidence in support of Traveller ethnicity has been established over the years.  I cannot really argue against it, but I do not think it is a sensible way to frame policy.<br/><br/>The second reading seems to be more telling.  It is that somehow there would be an enormous cost to the State if Travellers were to be recognised as an ethnic group.  My position is that it does not matter.  If it is the just or right thing to do, cost should not be the determining factor.  Having said that, the cost implications are nothing like what seems to be suggested.  The placing of Travellers in an ethnic paradigm provides a minimum level of protection, which is a good thing, and presents us with the correct paradigm to engage with Traveller inequality in a range of ways.  However, the cost of locations are not massive.  The heavens did not fall in in the North of Ireland after the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order in 1997.  As I stated, protection for Travellers was integrated into anti-racist and anti-discrimination work, which was good, but there was no massive cost associated with it.  Likewise in England and Wales, after 2000 there has been no massive obvious cost.  It seems to me that the notion that there is some huge cost attached is a bit of a red herring.  Some would say the implications are minimal.  I am happy to address those points, but that is my perspective.  We should do it if it is the right thing to do.  However, if we do it, it is unlikely to have massive cost implications.  <br/><br/>There are two broader points I wish to address.  I have worked on the issue for a long time and there comes a point when one wonders why the resistance and what are the implications of the resistance.  The first thing I should speak to is what I call &quot;ethnicity denial&quot;.  This term has begun to enter the wider literature.  It is the idea that an ethnic group can be arbitrarily denied its ethnic status without grounding the denial in fact.  It is a dangerous principle.  In that sense, this is not just a small minor issue in the Irish context, as Ms Crickley made clear in terms of the work of CERD and its analysis of the implications of ethnicity denial in the broader context.  The reality, however, is that it is a dangerous thing and not an abstruse academic concept.  Ethnicity denial has happened in the past.  Most obviously, notably and notoriously, it happened to gypsies or Roma under the Nazi regime.  They were classified as a social rather than an ethnic group.  A consequence of that classification was that the Roma Holocaust has only really been recognised over the past 20 to 30 years.  It took a long time after the end of the Second World War for there to be any recognition of that genocide because people went with the notion that we were dealing with a social rather than an ethnic group.  The policy has profound and dangerous implications and Governments that follow it should only do so with the greatest of care.  It should not be done arbitrarily.  That point bears emphasis in this context.<br/><br/>For all of us, it has been a remarkable year.  We have been reflecting on the 100 years since the Proclamation.  If we are serious about the project of cherishing the children of the nation equally, there is no question but that we need to recognise difference as a part of the process.  It is standard practice in human rights and equality interventions and legislation that recognising difference is a part of ensuring that people become equal or more equal.  It is not rocket science.  It is now a given that we should do that, but a key part of that in the Irish context is to recognise Traveller ethnicity.  If we are serious about trying to make policy and interventions in a context where Travellers are becoming more equal rather than less equal, recognising ethnicity is a key first step in the process.  It is not a panacea, but neither will the heavens fall.  It will not solve everything, but it is clearly placing Travellers in the correct paradigm for intervention and it is the right thing to do. </p></speech>

It may be an unfair question, but Mr. Martin Collins made a point that I found intriguing.  It concerned the obligations on the Government for equivalence of rights under the Good Friday Agreement and the recognition that exists for Travellers in the North.  Does Dr. McVeigh see that as a possible avenue?  Be it political, institutional or otherwise, there has been a reluctance and the reality is that it has not happened.  The Good Friday Agreement is as old as it is and the recognition in the North exists.  What are Dr. McVeigh's views on that?</p></speech>

That was a clear political principle.  The Senator is probably too young to remember, but I was part of the human rights and equality community at the time.  The notion that both Governments were committing to a highest rather than lowest common denominator approach was seen as a huge victory, but the specific commitment came from the Southern Government.  On that basis, there is a whole raft of other issues that might be addressed from the same perspective.  In the sense that there was a commitment, there is no question but that the protection of Travellers around ethnicity and race discrimination is stronger in the Six Counties than it is in the Twenty-six Counties and that should be an embarrassment for legislators and others in the South.</p></speech>

It is interesting because it was pre-peace process legislation.  Later on, some of it was swept up in broader human rights and equality legislation but the specific legislation, the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997, still stands.  The order was made by the Conservative British Government at the time.  That Government had engaged with the issue in a similar way as legislators and civil servants in the South.  There was quite a lot of reluctance and it was not taken as a given.</p><p> The work that I and many others did around the support for the position of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, the main Government human rights body at that time, played a key part in them recognising that there was going to be an ongoing equivocation around this issue and on that basis it was just easier to name Travellers in the legislation so that all of that ambiguity was resolved.  They did not take that without engaging with it over a number of years.  There was quite a long discussion around that, not just in the Traveller support community but also in the broader human rights and equality community.  Eventually, a Conservative British Government, not particularly noted for its support for progressive interventions on race and ethnicity, supported that position and integrated it into legislation.  There are two lessons we can draw from that.  First, it ended at that point and there is nobody walking around Northern Ireland saying that it is mad that Travellers are recognised as an ethnic group.  Everybody accepts, within the paradigm of broader race discrimination, that anti-race discrimination interventions would include Travellers and that is just the way it is.  The other point, which I do not want to make too negatively, is that the notion that there would be some terrible cost implication proved to be untrue.  It did not happen.  </p><p> The situation is much better.  It was defined very clearly in the legislation so the ambiguity disappeared overnight.  There are other ways to do it, as I have said already.  The Scottish Government has done it in a different way and has not made its position quite so clear.</p></speech>

The discrimination that Travellers might experience in the Six Counties is actually much the same as that which another southern Irish person might experience but that dynamic will not be true in the South of Ireland.</p> <p>  I am conscious that I am probably getting far too academic about this but the reality is that absolutely everybody has an ethnicity.  In this context, a lot of the legislation in the English case was around the "No Travellers" signs in pubs but a sign that said "Only Travellers" in a pub would discriminate against the Deputy in precisely the same way.  In that sense, the Deputy's ethnicity is defined by his not being a Traveller.  He will have lots of other positive ethnicities but the answer to the question he posed is "Yes", that is true,</p></speech>

I feel bad about not having any questions but that is not because Dr. McVeigh's arguments are poor.  On the contrary, the case he makes is so compelling.  He has demonstrated clearly how out of sync we are, in terms of both law and policy, with our nearest neighbour.  That argument is won.</p> <p>  We all understand the symbolic importance of the fact that ethnicity has been recognised in those jurisdictions but at a practical level, what has been the effect?  Has it had an impact, for example, on the lack of visibility of Travellers, an issue raised by previous witnesses?  In terms of society and policy making, has it had any impact?  Were any special steps taken on foot of the recognition to introduce measures that would reduce marginalisation?  </p> <p>  I agree with Dr. McVeigh's argument that cost is irrelevant where human rights are concerned.  I also appreciate that the delivery of this is not going to involve huge costs.  I am trying to understand why this has not happened here yet and it seems to me that the lack of delivery has been used to save money at the expense of a vulnerable section of society.  The lack of recognition has allowed the State to disproportionately cut services to Travellers.  Does Dr. McVeigh agree with that or have any comparisons he could make in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.836" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Robbie McVeigh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016110900002#N01100"><p>The visibility issue is very complex.  My personal opinion is that the situation of Travellers in terms of the broad equality platform is worse in the Six Counties now than it was in the 1990s.  That is not particularly related to the legislation.  There are many other things happening.  One of the dynamics is that the Six Counties was a society that had two main ethnicities and a tiny number of Travellers and Jewish people.  It was a society bifurcated between Protestants and Catholics and was almost completely white.  That has now changed and part of the change has created a context in which the North should be much better at dealing with ethnicity but is not particularly so.  Previously, anyone who was interested in race and ethnicity in the Six Counties would have looked at Travellers because there were no other groups but now there are lots of other groups, which makes it harder for the Traveller voice to be heard.  I would also make the same observation about the South.  It is a reality that Ireland is becoming a much more complex, multicultural society.  The days of 30 years ago, or more, when anti-Traveller racism was the only issue that people addressed when they were talking about the need for intervention are no longer with us.  The questions around ethnicity and anti-discrimination in the South are much bigger and more complex now.  The lack of visibility is as much to do with that as with negative intervention by Government.  Certainly, it is not justified by the legislation in the North but in reality the situation is no better, despite the interventions and that is frightening.</p> <p> I ask the Deputy to remind me of her question on costs.</p></speech>

The Government has been able to cut costs at the expense of Travellers by not recognising their ethnicity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.838" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Robbie McVeigh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016110900002#N01300"><p>There is an element of truth in that.  However, one must factor in the cost of not doing these things.  There is a terrible cost in keeping people poor and that is not just true of Travellers but of lots of other groups too.  It will be interesting to see what happens in the United States in the coming period but not providing health care to people, for example, is incredibly costly.  It is generally true that interventions that integrate people in lots of different ways, in terms of accommodation, health provision and so on, give rise to cost savings.  I would argue that such savings are probably greater than the cost savings that may have arisen by the cuts to facilities in recent years.</p> <p>  At the end of the day, the core point is that nobody has come up with an argument to support the assertion that Travellers are not an ethnic group in this jurisdiction, whatever the cost implications might be.  On that basis, nobody has come up with such an argument and it is quite frustrating.  As I said, I have been working on this for a long period of time.  In the old days when we were engaging with the British Government and it was resistant, at least it came up with a case and tried to develop an argument against Traveller ethnicity.  Ultimately it failed to do that and eventually agreed that Travellers constituted an ethnic group.  The British Government played the game in that sense.  It is more difficult here where it is just an assertion.  The State simply goes to CERD and says that it does not think that Travellers are an ethnic group but does not say why.  It is very hard to engage with that, both academically and legally and it is frustrating.</p></speech>

It is a phantom argument, in fact it is not even an argument.  In that context, I am trying to understand why it has not happened.  Is there some sort of neo-liberal ideology behind it somewhere?  It does not make any sense.</p></speech>

That has not tended to be part of the discourse, but it is a dangerous implication.  Consider the all-Ireland health study on Travellers, which was an important intervention across Ireland and was based on the recognition of Traveller ethnicity and had significant achievements.  If one follows the logic of the current position, that should not have happened at all.  We should not have had a document referring to Travellers as an ethnic group and we should not have had health interventions that were based on that reality because the State did not recognise Travellers as an ethnic group.  The logic of this is that Travellers never experience racism and that whatever they do experience is something else.  That is even more dangerous than ethnicity denial.  One does not need to look further than Nazi Germany to know the implications of claiming that something one is doing is not racism.  It is not silly, abstruse or hyperbolic to point out that this kind of policy by governments has dangerous implications.  The notion of denying that Travellers experience racism has not followed ethnicity denial, but it is always implicit in that approach.</p></speech>

Some of the other witnesses mentioned the potential of a Traveller agency and what it could do to address many of the socioeconomic issues of which we have heard.  Can we learn anything from the Northern Ireland experience in terms of interagency improvements or policy initiatives that have tried to bridge the gap in the problems that have been presented to us?</p></speech>

That is a good thing, but there has always been less of a Traveller-specific infrastructure in the North.  Historically, this was because nothing was done for Travellers.  Until direct rule, there was such a level of anti-Traveller prejudice that a Prime Minister welcomed the fact that Traveller numbers were dropping.  The notion that it would be perfect if there were no Travellers was expressed not by ordinary politicians, but by the Prime Minister.  Nothing was done.  As interventions around race began to be made, Travellers were integrated into broader anti-racism interventions.  That is the Northern Ireland trajectory.</p> <p>  In the South, there were genuine attempts to address the issue from the Commission on Itinerancy onwards, but in a Traveller-specific way.  If one is placing Travellers in a paradigm of ethnicity and racism, the integration model is better.</p></speech>

The implication of ethnicity is a broader intervention around race equality.  That is the core first step.  What is done via other interventions is a different issue.  In terms of ethnicity, there would be no justification for having a race strategy that did not include Travellers.  That is why the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD, thing is so silly.  If one is going to make an intervention under CERD, Travellers should be integrated under it.</p></speech>

No government in Europe was addressing the situation of its Traveller or Roma population as directly or committedly as the task force report did.  One can be self-critical, but one must also recognise that a great deal of good work has been done.  The failure on ethnicity is appalling, but some of the interventions by the Government and all political parties have been good, laudable and more than what has been done elsewhere.  It is not a wholly bad story.</p></speech>

That needs to be recognised.  The sad reality is that the situation of Roma and Travellers in many European countries is measured by the number of deaths.  It is a low bottom line from which to start in terms of policy intervention, but the reality is that the Irish Government has, at different stages, at least taken the issue seriously and engaged with it.  That needs to be recognised.  The failure on ethnicity is awful and is not a glowing example to anyone in the world, but other interventions have been good.  Other European member states would look to Ireland as being a model of good practice in that regard.  I am not trying to paint a rosy picture, but I am suggesting that there is a history of good interventions, particularly by the Traveller support movement, that needs to be recognised.  Interventions have been supported by members of most, if not all, political parties in that time.  Their contribution also needs to be recognised.  It is a curate's egg, in that there is a history of doing nothing.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

Dr. McVeigh was one of the presenters during its process.  It is two years since the publication of the report.

We are trying to reinject impetus into the case.</p> <p>  Dr. McVeigh used the word "frustration".  Is he taken aback?  He is certainly disappointed by the lapse in time and the failure to adopt the report of the former committee and deliver on its recommendation.  It was an all-party and unanimous report, but the issue has not maintained the drive that was apparent at the time.</p></speech>

I also spoke at the conference on ethnicity and Travellers in 2012.  The best that the Government could come up with was one Traveller who did not have any competence, I believe, but who just happened to believe that he was not a member of an ethnic group.  That was the best case that could be presented.  It was embarrassing.  It was hard on him.  In a room full of Travellers who all believed that they were members of an ethnic group, that was supposed to be the case against ethnicity.  It was intellectually and politically embarrassing.  I am someone who is proud to be Irish and who is proud of this year's commemorations.</p><p>That is why I spoke about it directly in my opening statement.  If we are serious about cherishing the children of the nation equally, prevarication on the question of Traveller ethnicity is an embarrassment and I cannot find the logic to it.  It took years to get this notion of cost out, but as I have suggested, if one address the question of cost, the experience in other jurisdictions would suggest that the cost implications are minimal.  It makes Ireland, which has a very positive reputation in terms of international human rights and equality constituencies, look silly and a country at the forefront of ethnicity and racism denial rather than at the forefront of the struggle for human rights and equality around the world.  On that basis it is shocking to me.  I will keep coming back to these committees and I will keep making the case, if members want it to be made, but I cannot see any justification for the delay.  It is just wrong.</p></speech>

We regard this as an important opportunity to explain the bank's role in the Irish economy and the community, particularly across the wide areas of responsibility covered by this committee.</p> <p>  Allied Irish Banks has over 2.2 million customers and 360,000 EBS customers.  AIB group is deeply rooted in every level of the local community.  As an example of its sheer reach and range, the banks spend more than &euro;600 million a year in the purchase of goods and services from local Irish suppliers.  A total of 60,000 customers use the 205 AIB branches every day.  A further 7,000 customers visit our 71 EBS locations each day.  Our close partnership with An Post, which has more than 1,100 offices around the country, provides daily banking services to 15,000 customers with approximately 4 million transactions expected to be recorded by the end of this year alone.  These combined banking services amount to a remarkably embedded and widespread network across the country.  Our 3,000 staff within the branch network are drawn from the community, bringing with them unique local knowledge and understanding of our customers and their needs.</p> <p>  The close relationship between AIB and its customers is crucial to its business and is at the heart of its planning.  AIB is currently reorganising its banking model to work closer with customers, retail business and corporate customers.  A total of 19 new local markets are headed with an individual leader responsible for AIB's overall engagement with customers in that region.  The bank will organise around customers at a local level, eliminating duplication and unnecessary complexities in the system.  This new structure provides customers with a one-stop-shop form of service and brings more local autonomy when it comes to decision making, including lending.  It is designed to be more tailored to each customer's needs and will allow far more agility of service and will enable the AIB to move working capital faster and more efficiently through the economy.</p> <p>  Nobody is more aware than Oireachtas Members of the rapid changes in how people are managing their finances, both business and personal customers.  Customers set the pace today and banks are required to respond.  Customers expect a personal professional service, whether it is over-the-counter or through technology.  Digital and technological usage provides convenience, personal security and competition that allows choice.  The trend across Ireland, Britain and western Europe is a seismic move towards digital.  For example, 76% of all AIB's personal loan applications are now done through the digital channels.  Some 95% of customer transactions are automated.  Nobody should imagine that this activity is conducted only by a younger generation of customers.  The use of digital channels by older age groups is growing consistently also, regardless of geographical location.  In line with European norms, banking online and through remote channels has been embraced across the country.  Almost 50% of customers in rural counties are now using digital banking of one kind or another.  At least 43% of the 500,000 banking transactions conducted daily are outside of normal banking hours and are executed over online and mobile channels.</p> <p>  We are keenly aware that the one thing that will differentiate banks such as AIB into the future is the quality customer service, whether it is in-branch, online or on mobile.  That is the one constant that remains in spite of all other developments.  We are aware that we must maintain the correct balance between providing our customers with a trusted personal one to one service and an accessible and reliable digital or mobile service.  Last year AIB opened three new branches, one in Little Island in Cork, Carrickmines in Dublin and Grand Canal Dock near the city centre in Dublin.  This year we opened the only in-store banking outlet in the Republic of Ireland through the SuperValu in Lucan.  This new outlet adds to the growing number of flexible banking options available to our customers to use where and at a time of their choosing.  Any company claiming to deliver market leading service must go to the customer.  AIB is increasing its mobile sales force, trained staff who travel to meet customers where and when it suits their needs.  In addition to the core opening hours, by the end of the year, AIB will be operating 20 bank lobbies across the country, providing a wide range of services, seven days a week from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m.  Where there is a lack of physical bank branches, AIB operates community banks in rural areas of Cork, Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary, Mayo, Galway and Donegal.  There were 40,000 over-the-counter transactions at these banks since the start of 2016.</p><p>In addition, students now have exclusive on-campus services in 13 universities and colleges, including in Waterford, Sligo, Dublin and Galway.  <br/><br/>We mentioned AIB's partnership with An Post earlier and the banking services that are available in all An Post offices.  This year alone, almost 4 million transactions will be processed in An Post for 400,000 customers, reflecting the flexibility, easy proximity and security that the post office service offers to bank customers.  Personal customers can use any outlet of An Post to complete cash withdrawals.  They can also lodge cash to their AIB accounts.  AIB credit card bills and payments can be completed in post offices.  Business customers can also avail of a large range of banking services at any post office, including cash lodgements and credit card bill payments to an AIB credit card.  <br/><br/>With small to medium enterprise providing thousands of jobs across the country, AIB support for the SME sector is reflected in our strong lending activity.  For the first three quarters of 2016, AIB has seen an 11% increase in the value of new money loan approvals and a 5% increase in the number of loan applications approved.  The bank has committed to providing customers with a decision within 48 hours of their credit application up to &euro;30,000.  Since its launch in September 2014, 28,000 applications have been approved under the scheme.  AIB has developed a sectoral approach to its business, analysing key components of the Irish economic landscape and building up specialised teams to provide expert opinion, guidance and advice to customers in those sectors, whether they are retail, hospitality, health, transport, technology, hospitality or farming.  This strategy of building sectoral capability has been very effective, giving the bank a strong sense of awareness of customer needs.  For example, the bank's agri team now includes 12 specialist advisers with front-line experience of farmers' needs and opportunities who can respond rapidly and pragmatically to issues such as flooding, price volatility and poor crop yields.  <br/><br/>In response to the flooding crisis of last year, AIB opened an emergency flood response line for small businesses and farming customers and proactively contacted customers whose business finances might have been impacted by adverse weather.  We offered customers a moratorium on loan repayments in order to free up cashflow for their businesses at that critical time.  Following the full drawdown of our first &euro;500 million agriloan fund, AIB launched a second &euro;500 million agriloan fund at the end of 2015 to support the continued development of Ireland's farming sector.  Recently, AIB has been engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, on the low-cost agri cashflow support loan scheme announced in the budget.  AIB has a history of partnership with SBCI in helping small businesses and farmers to grow their businesses, creating employment and supporting the economy through reduced price loans.  Since the launch of AIB's &euro;400 million SBCI loan fund in 2015, which is available at 4.5%, a discount of 2% off our standard business rate, AIB has approved more than &euro;5 million of credit each week to businesses and farmers.  The average loan drawdown last year in this fund was &euro;28,500 but loans drawn down ranged in size from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1 million.  AIB relationship managers are continuing to proactively engage with dairy farming customers who may be experiencing cashflow pressures and the bank's agri adviser team has participated in numerous seminars, farm talks and workshops to support customers.<br/><br/>AIB is the largest bank seed fund investor in Ireland also and it is supporting businesses through the country irrespective of location.  In Skibbereen, for example, the bank is the strategic partner of Ludgate, the first rural digital hub, providing 1,000 mb of broadband, 80 hot desks, co-working space for all small businesses and 24-7 access.  Meanwhile, a strategic partner of the PorterShed in Galway, AIB is funding a shared workspace for entrepreneurs, start-ups, accelerators and incubators for the western seaboard.  We have had a really positive response to the AIB Start-up Academy, which is a programme of supports for start-up business owners.  This includes a range of summits, boot camps and a mentoring programme designed to inspire, support and nurture SMEs in critical initial phases of getting their businesses off the ground.<br/><br/>AIB Group has the largest share of the mortgage market, with our latest mortgage lending figures showing a 15% increase on last year's numbers.  We approve eight out of ten applications and we have consistently been one of the cheapest in the marketplace.  We have reduced our variable rates for both new and existing customers four times in the last two years, totalling a 1% reduction.  Meanwhile, though impaired loans are dropping significantly as the economy recovers, there has been an &euro;18 billion reduction in impaired loans to &euro;11 billion since December 2013.  The bank continues its case-by-case restructuring of personal and business customers in financial difficulty.  Implementing sustainable solutions for customers takes time but progress is clearly being made and the bank continues to see a continued reduction in impaired loans.  This remains a critical priority for the banking industry in general.  <br/><br/>Regardless of our customers' locations, a new set of challenges has come unexpectedly from the Brexit vote.  AIB is very conscious of the short-term negative effect of a weakened sterling.  We continue to work with customers whose businesses are now experiencing cashflow challenges due to currency fluctuations.  Brexit has also brought market uncertainty and volatility.  As a bank we are acutely aware of the anxieties that many of our customers are facing, be they farmers in the west of Ireland or shop owners in the midlands.  Some are under pressure and while we cannot predict the shape of the post-Brexit change we can, as a profitable and sustainable bank, assure the committee we will support our customers and jobs and continue to provide credit to businesses, which are the backbone of the Irish economy and the heart of communities.  AIB is actively advising our customers to plan strategically on the impact of Brexit on their business.  We are holding Brexit information events this month in Sligo, Limerick, Clare and Drogheda and there are more planned for the new year.  <br/><br/>At the outset, we mentioned the degree to which the bank is involved in the community.  Nowhere is this more highly illustrated than in our sponsorship of GAA club hurling, football and<font color="#FF00FF"></font>camogie.  The bank's relationship with the GAA spans more than 25 years and that support reaches into every one of our 2,000 clubs that engage in the championship, with many parishes and communities benefitting.  In 2015, the bank extended its GAA sponsorship to include the all-Ireland football championship also.  <br/><br/>AIB once again thanks the committee for the opportunity to explain the level of support and commitment we have to our customers, their families and the local community.  This relationship lies at the very core of our business.  Having returned to sustainable profitability and having begun repaying capital to the State, the bank is robustly positioned to continue that support no matter where our customers live or work.  We are now happy to take questions.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.868" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam McLoughlin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#D00300"><p>We thank the Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for the invitation to attend this morning and to contribute on the topic of maintaining an effective service and presence in rural communities.  To assist the committee, we have submitted a short presentation in advance and my remarks this morning will follow the layout of that presentation.</p> <p>  The Bank of Ireland Group provides a broad range of banking and other financial services.  These services include current account and deposit services, overdrafts, term loans, mortgages, business and corporate lending, asset financing, leasing and instalment credit, invoice discounting, foreign exchange facilities, interest and exchange rate hedge instruments, life assurance, pension and protection products.  There are a number of ways in which Bank of Ireland services the needs of our customers in communities.  We do this through lending, for example, to support customers to own homes and grow their businesses.  We do this by providing services via our extensive retail bank branch network and by giving customers access to 24-7, a form of banking service which they increasingly demand.  </p> <p>  Bank of Ireland is the largest lender to the Irish economy.  In the first half of 2016, we advanced new and increased lending of &euro;3.5 billion to Irish businesses and consumers serving approximately 1.7 million personal and 183,000 business customers in Ireland.  We are Ireland's number one business bank providing 50% of new lending to SMEs and the agricultural sector.  Through these lending activities, Bank of Ireland is an active part of the life of every community in the country.  We maintain a highly visible and highly active involvement in communities the length and breadth of the country.  Our branch network is a core component of this involvement and of the service we provide to other communities.  While some institutions have significantly reduced their branch network or withdrawn from the market entirely, we have maintained our strong, countrywide presence with no rural bank closures in the past five years.  We continue to invest in our network.  Today Bank of Ireland has the largest retail branch network of any bank in Ireland with 250 branches nationwide.  This is a very significant branch footprint and one which gives us an unparalleled presence in communities in all parts of the country.  </p> <p>  Over-the-counter business and personal transactions make up only 4% of total transactions with customers and more than seven in ten of our customers are now active online.  Therefore, as well as offering Ireland's largest retail branch network, we augment our branch presence by approximately 1,770 self-service devices nationwide for our customers, as well as working with 440,000 customers who actually use mobile devices for their banking needs.  It is also important to state that we view our branch network as being about more than banking transactions.  Our branch network is increasingly a focus for our support for local communities, for start-up companies, entrepreneurs, innovators and for local community groups.  </p> <p>  Bank of Ireland has a very active enterprise development programme primarily delivered through our 250 strong branch network.  Twice a year, in May and November, Bank of Ireland organises national enterprise week.  During these weeks, a range of activities focused on supporting SMEs in start-ups takes place.  Most of these events take place in local branches where small businesses are invited to showcase their business to advertise their products and services and to meet new and existing customers.  We also offer small businesses the opportunities to access credit clinics and participate in relevant information sessions.</p><p>During national enterprise week in May 2016, Bank of Ireland hosted 750 events countrywide with approximately 2,900 businesses taking part.  All events were free and were open to business and the public.  Our next enterprise week starts next Friday.</p><p> In addition, in this year alone Bank of Ireland will host up to 100 enterprise town events nationwide, investing more than &euro;1 million in the programme.  Enterprise towns take place over two days and see local business communities, along with sports, social and charitable organisations, hosting a major community event that is open to the public.  This event allows each town to showcase all it has to offer, supporting the local economy, connecting businesses and raising the visibility of what is happening in the towns and villages and potential opportunities for business development.  In the weeks up to Christmas Bank of Ireland enterprise towns are scheduled to take place in Carndonagh, Askeaton, Midleton, Tullow, Claremorris, New Ross, Swords, Smithfield, Headford, Carrigaline, Trim, Montrose, Balbriggan, Rathcoole, Skibbereen, Bagenalstown, Loughrea, Listowel, Castlecomer, Kilmacud, Malahide, Ballybay, Charleville, Mountmellick, Castlerea, Ballymahon, Kildare and Newcastle West.</p><p> The support of innovation and entrepreneurship is also an important component of the work of local branches.  Since 2015, Bank of Ireland has pioneered the development of spaces within branches which support start-up companies and entrepreneurs.  These spaces, referred to as workbenches, offer working and meeting places for entrepreneurs free of charge.  The bank now offers workbench space in a number of branches in Dublin, Cork and Galway with a further workbench to open next Friday in Limerick.  So far, more than 500 start-up companies have used a Bank of Ireland workbench to help get their business up and running.</p><p> A significant component of our offering to local communities is the work we do with customers and members of the public to support them in the use of new technology, be that computers, Internet or the use of smartphones.  Bank of Ireland has a team of advisers, called digital arrows, whose role is to bring digital training, support and knowledge to community groups and customers across Ireland.  The arrows engage with active retirement groups, transition year students, business customers, farmers and community groups, holding events in local hotels, community halls and libraries, and offer practical guidance on how to use new technology in a range of ways, from communicating with relatives abroad, shopping online to using digital channels for banking.  Bank of Ireland now has a digital arrow on each of its 250 branches nationwide and nearly 3,000 sessions have been held with senior customers so far this year, including many sessions in nursing homes and with active retirement groups.</p><p> Bank of Ireland recognises that it is a service provider to people of every age.  Just as we support customers to gain fluency and proficiency in the use of technology, we also must understand the needs and expectations of younger people in society.  We support creative sponsorships in the fashion world with Junk Kouture, in the technology space with CoderDojo and with BizWorld we teach children how to run a business and to provide product to market.  These sponsorship are impactful to local communities, allowing young people to express themselves creatively and to gain new skills.  Our branch footprint is utilised to support these sponsorships and the community engagement they facilitate.</p><p> Finally, as set out in slide 13, there is the broader work of our colleagues in both central offices and our branch network.  Bank of Ireland's corporate social responsibility programme aims to have a positive impact on every community in which we operate.  The bank's charitable giving scheme, Give Together, has raised over &euro;25.5 million since its inception in 2007, supporting over 1,500 charities across Ireland.</p><p> In conclusion, my presentation has set out a number of elements of the service and presence offering from Bank of Ireland nationwide.  This offering includes our position as largest lender to the Irish economy, the most extensive retail branch network in Ireland and the support for enterprise and innovation that takes place across the network.  This also includes the engagement the bank has with local communities through our corporate social responsibility, CSR, programme, our youth sponsorships which support the integrated development of young people and our engagements which support digital skills development among our customers and the wider public.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.871" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Matthews" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on behalf of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  I am the head of the monitoring department in the league.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. John Knox, a business analyst from our research and development department.<br/><br/>The league represents almost 400 credit unions and over 3 million members across the island of Ireland, North and South.  We have approximately 300 credit unions in the South and 100 in the North.  Our credit unions have assets of almost &euro;15 billion.  Credit unions are self-help financial co-operatives owned and run by their members.  Our aim is to help members who group together under a common bond, such as their place of employment or their local community, to pool their savings and to get access to credit.<br/><br/>This morning we are concerned with rural communities.  In the context of an erosion of key services and functions away from rural communities and towards bigger centres of population, the localised credit union model remains not merely relevant but an essential support for the future.  It is an essential support for local communities in an age when we increasingly see the globalisation of financial institutions and the deployment of technology almost as a barrier rather than an enabler between local people and the decision makers who make such extraordinarily important financial judgment calls that affect people's lives.  In many communities, especially rural communities, the credit union is not just a local source of credit and other financial services, it is the only physically present, face-to-face interaction available for those accessing those services.<br/><br/>The credit union model is locally based and democratic.  The decision makers one needs to know and meet are physically present in one's community and, indeed, are from that community.  Credit unions are adapting to changing circumstances.  We are challenged by macro economic circumstances which mean that, increasingly, the return available for our members' savings is limited and certainly far less than it would have been heretofore.  The policy platform of the league is set out in our six strategic steps.  It has been circulated to the committee.  The platform is intended both to meet emerging needs and to strengthen the credit union model.  Three of the proposals, those dealing with micro lending, SME and agri lending and lending for social housing, are set out more fully in our submission to the joint committee.<br/><br/>Late last year a personal micro credit, PMC, pilot initiative was launched in 30 credit unions across the country, branded as the &quot;It Makes Sense&quot; loan.  Its aim was to prove that credit unions could offer a loan product that matched the convenience and ease of moneylenders' offerings while addressing the exorbitant interest rates charged by those offerings, yet was within prudential lending guidelines of the Central Bank.  The pilot was an undoubted success and the scheme is now being rolled out to as many credit unions as possible.  Already, over 80 credit unions are offering these loans, with more to come on board in the coming months.  It is intended to circulate details of the scheme to all Oireachtas Members, along with an up-to-date list of the credit unions that offer it, in coming weeks.<br/><br/>On lending for social housing, the league's proposal is in response to Government policy set out in its social housing strategy to 2020.  The report of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government supported the initiative as a priority action.  The programme for a partnership Government reflected positively on the initiative.  While numerous meetings have taken place, to date no substantive progress has been made and this is a matter of considerable frustration for the league and for credit unions.<br/><br/>Turning to lending to SMEs and agri lending, traditionally credit union lending was for personal purposes such as home improvements, cars, educational needs, family events and so forth.  The lending types that our proposal seeks to address include loans for vans, tools, workshops, farm buildings, tractors, machinery and livestock.  We understand that these loans are different and more complex due to the cyclical and seasonal factors that affect cashflow.  This must be appreciated by all stakeholders, including the Central Bank when it is framing regulation for credit unions.  It is essential to consider our proposal within its context of ensuring that all applications for loans are expertly assessed so the lending decisions are prudent and members' savings are fully protected.<br/><br/>The Irish League of Credit Unions is providing leadership in responding to community need and Government policy.  We now look to the Oireachtas and the Government to deliver on commitments made to credit unions before the election.  In particular, we look to the joint committee for practical help in ensuring delivery on commitments made in the programme for partnership Government.  Credit unions are not just based in communities, they are rooted in them.  On behalf of hundreds of urban and rural communities, the challenge is not just to protect the <i>status quo</i>.  The bigger opportunity is to strengthen and develop a credit union model that delivers much more in the future, something credit unions are more than capable of doing.  I thank the members for listening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.873" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#E00500"><p>An Post thanks the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today to speak on this important matter.  I am the retail operations director and I am accompanied by Mr. Liam O'Sullivan, who is our mails operation director.  We apologise on behalf of our new chief executive, Mr. David McRedmond, who could not attend due to a long-standing commitment.</p><p>Our appearance here is timely given the change in Government responsibilities for the national post office network, now under the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It is also a time of continuing global trends, impacting all postal administrations worldwide, of increasing significant technical substitution and e-commerce.  This is impacting greatly on both the mails and retail businesses of An Post, as it is on all our fellow postal administrations.</p><p> Over recent years, we have had a number of interactions with the transport and communications committee, and much of what is said here is similar to what was said at those committee meetings.  An Post maintains a greater service and presence in urban and rural communities than all other commercial or Government bodies.  Through our mails network, with 7,620 collection and delivery staff, we deliver 2.5 million mail items every day to 2.1 million homes and businesses.  We deliver mail to all households every working day, often the only interaction some customers have with another person.  In recent years we have invested heavily in both our mails and post office networks.  In 2015, for example, 43 of our post offices were upgraded and 23 new locations and 14 new post office contracts were awarded in various parts of the country.  In 17 areas, local mail services were relocated to a purpose-built or purpose-fitted delivery service unit, providing top-quality modern customer and operational facilities, including ample safe parking and van loading facilities, cost-efficient lighting and heating and customer post office box and IT facilities.</p><p> The size of the post office network continues to be crucial for our commercial agenda.  Its very scale allows us to service our customers' needs throughout the country.  This scale is also a major factor in our retaining and winning more business.  The reach of our network has attracted business as diverse as bill payment and banking services for major organisations to provision of social welfare payments, savings, foreign exchange and retail products such as Postmobile and gift vouchers.  Using geodirectory data, we can see that 99% of addresses in the country are within 10 km of a post office and 93% within 5 km in rural areas.  Our contract with the Department of Social Protection specifies that outlets must be available within 3 km of 95% of customers in an urban area and 15 km in a rural area.  The post office network comfortably exceeds these requirements.</p><p> The post office network is the largest retail network in Ireland.  We handle circa 120 million transactions annually, with some 1.7 million customer visits to post offices each week.  We have 1,131 offices nationwide, 51 of which are operated directly by An Post, the remainder being run by independent retailers, that is, postmasters as contractors.  Postmasters are paid based on the business they perform.  We run this network in a business environment that is tough for all participants.  All our business lines operate in a very difficult marketplace with many competitors and, critically, are increasingly open to electronic substitution.</p><p> It might be useful if I highlight some changes between the present day and the last date on which I presented to an Oireachtas committee in March 2014.  This should clearly illustrate the business context in which we now operate.  The mails business has continued to decline in this period, due in the main to the global trend of electronic substitution.  This can be seen in actions by our major customers, such as the utilities and financial institutions, which now seek to reduce their use of the postal system through electronic statements and discounts to customers.  Since March 2014, we have seen a decline of more than 11% in core mail usage.  Since the peak of mail, reached in 2007, we have seen a 38% decline.  We have seen growth in online shopping, which has to some extent increased the levels of our parcels business.  This is a growth area we intend to pursue, but it must be noted that this business is very price competitive.</p><p> In March 2014, we had 750,000 weekly Department of Social Protection, DSP, customers.  This has now fallen to 625,000, a decline of 17%.  This was caused, first, by a decline of 30% in the number of jobseeker payments as people, thankfully, gained employment.  We saw a reduction of 5% in pension payments due to the very low number of new pensioners choosing the post office option for their payments.  Similarly, we saw child benefit payments decline by 16%.  In the same period we have seen our bill payment business decline by 20% due to the loss of some key corporate customers plus a general decline in utility bill payments as customers choose to pay by direct debit for convenience but also to get discounted utility bills.  We have seen good growth in some traditional as well as new business streams introduced in recent years.  Our State savings business continues to grow, with now in excess of &euro;20 billion of customer savings, and we have significant plans to enhance these services over the coming years.  We have seen increases in our banking services with AIB and we added Ulster Bank as a customer in 2015.  The foreign exchange business has been a big success since being introduced in 2011, and we continue to see good growth each year.  We have both a foreign exchange cash and card business.  Our One4all gift vouchers and Postmobile businesses have also seen good growth.</p><p> We continue to look for new business activities, and I am pleased to advise the committee that we will introduce a new payment account in the first quarter of next year.  This will have all the features of a normal bank account, apart from a chequebook and overdraft facility.  We have also introduced a court fines payment business and we will shortly add the national lottery service to all post offices nationwide.  We have introduced many new mail service initiatives in recent years.  Many of these are in the area of online shopping, with such initiatives as our DeliveryBox product and our AddressPal service.  This service enables customers to purchase products at reduced postage cost from UK websites and is proving very popular, with now more than 38,000 registered users.  In the coming weeks, we will also launch Post Logistics, a freight service which will enable SMEs throughout Ireland to access European markets readily.</p><p> Overall, though, the reduction in the core mails, DSP and bill payment business has meant that business levels at post offices have reduced by 11% since 2014, and this level of decline is expected to continue.  While the new forward-thinking business activities are very welcome and necessary, they do not make up for the reductions in the core business streams.  I also highlight that Government business continues to be the dominant activity in post offices, making up 62% of the income earned.  No company could sustain this level of business and income reductions without making the necessary changes and cost reductions.</p><p> A large cost to An Post is the post office network.  The fact remains that we continue to have very many unsustainable post offices, where the income earned from customer activity does not match the cost of operating the offices.  Along with all costs from the company, this has to be addressed.  The company has not to date had any policy of closing post offices, only examining an office if the postmaster chooses to retire or resign or, unfortunately, in some cases is deceased.  The committee may be aware that in the event that we consider the closure of a post office, we undertake a consultation process whereby we invite submissions from local interested parties on the need to retain a post office in the locality.  The submissions received to date range from no submissions at all to significant levels of interest.  We evaluate the submissions received and reach a final decision on whether to re-advertise the post office contract or close the office.  Since March 2014, we have closed 16 offices, which is 1.4% of the network in numbers but 0.2% in business terms.  This is in the context of the 11% reduction in business previously outlined.</p><p> The committee will also be aware that we have been involved in the post office network development group, an exercise with Mr. Bobby Kerr looking at the post office network of the future.  We expect Mr. Kerr to make his final recommendations in the coming weeks, which will include proposals on segmentation of the post office network and some protection proposals for rural post offices.  His recommendations will be dependent on Government support for the rural post offices if they are to survive into the future.  An Post is also part of the post office hubs working group led by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring.  This group is examining what other services, in a social and Government context, could be provided in post offices.  The company is supportive of both these initiatives.</p><p> Much of the network was developed at a time when Ireland was a very different place and, like so many organisations, it has not been immune to the huge social and economic changes in the country.  The company supports initiatives on supporting rural communities but is of the view that this is an issue for Government and local communities themselves rather than commercial entities such as An Post.  Our extensive range of services can continue to be provided in rural communities, as long as a sustainable business model can be found.  Over the years, local communities have changed significantly the manner in which they do their business.  Increasing numbers of citizens choose to do their business online or through bank accounts or mobile phones.</p><p>They also pass many local shops to do their shopping at large shopping centres and towns.  As illustrated earlier, they do less and less business at their local post office.  This is also impacting on many of the shops that happen to be co-located with our post offices.  All rural retail units are experiencing significantly reduced footfall numbers due to the actions of the people in the community.</p><p> We will continue to investigate the provision of more products and services using our leading post-office-counter technology.  We also believe we have a big part to play in increasing the level of financial inclusiveness in urban and rural areas.  The introduction of our own payment account will be a first step in that area.  Many of those without bank accounts currently use the post office as their preferred location for the management of their finances.  This includes collecting their Department of Social Protection entitlements; paying their bills, many on a part-payment basis; saving through the post office savings bank for important family events such as first holy communions, Christmas etc.; topping up their phones; buying gift vouchers as presents; getting foreign exchange requirements when travelling abroad; and using our postal money order, sterling draft and Western Union services if they want to send money either nationally or abroad.  Many people are still worried about bank charges and direct debits, and by using our services many citizens manage their money efficiently in a cost-effective manner.</p><p> We continually look at our service standards and the standard of our post offices.  I am sure many members have seen significant improvements in many offices in recent years.  We undertake mystery shopping on a monthly basis at 300 of our busiest offices, which is done on our behalf by an internationally recognised organisation in this field.  In recent years we have seen an increase in the scores given for customer service.  This is further evidence of the strength of the post office network and the level of trust and satisfaction our customers place in us.</p><p> We welcome the huge level of good will towards the post office network and are heartened by the level of support for the post office network in D&aacute;il debates.  We particularly welcome the Government's support, illustrated by the establishment of the Bobby Kerr and Minister of State, Deputy Ring, initiatives.</p><p> We are very aware of the challenges facing communities and businesses in rural areas.  We recognise that difficult decisions that impact on local communities have to be taken at times.  We believe that a national policy for rural communities needs to be developed.  This might result in extended services including post offices services being available at fewer locations.  We are ready, as always, to work with Government, postmasters, our customers and business partners to generate extra business for our post offices and to identify a financially sustainable model to ensure the success of the national post office network.  We have submitted some slides showing the key activities in our mail and post office business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.876" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned O'Hara" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#G00200"><p>We represent the postmasters who provide the post office service, referred to by the representative of An Post.  Some 1,100 of the post offices are run by postmasters who are independent contractors.  The post office network is a national asset that is owned by the people and is a key resource to address many of the challenges faced by rural areas.  It can also provide good value for the Government and taxpayer in doing so.<br/><br/>The network can offer expanded State and financial services, and innovative social and community services.  We thank AIB, which is one of the financial services that uses the post office to transact business for the 400,000 customers the AIB representative mentioned.  We enjoy the trust and good will of the people we serve.  The people we serve want their local post office to stay open.  We collected 500,000 signatures last year and handed them in to Government.  A recent <i>journal.ie</i>poll indicated that 82% of people wanted the Government to do more business through the post office.<br/><br/>An Post referred to the level of decline in transactions.  This affects the post office network which is facing a financial crisis.  The current annual income of postmasters, which includes all the costs they incur to provide the service - rent, rates, employee costs etc. - is forecast to drop by a cumulative &euro;35 million over the next five years.  The Government, as the biggest customer and owner of the network, needs to make decisions now to invest and secure the future of the network by implementing a transition plan.  Postmasters meet the public every day and they tell us they want us.  We live in a democracy.  We expect the Government to listen to the people and implement what they want.<br/><br/>The post office network needs important Government decisions now.  I will use the word &quot;now&quot; several times during the presentation because the problems facing post offices have been well aired.  The network, which is owned by the people, is part of the fundamental economic and social fabric of the country.  The current changes happening in the country are damaging communities which feel their views have been ignored by successive Governments.  We feel this was reflected in the result of the last general election.<br/><br/>Rural communities, in particular, want support to help stop the negative multiplier effect on their communities as different services are withdrawn from their localities.  There is a gradual withdrawal of services, including Garda stations and banks, resulting in fewer jobs.  If people can afford to, they leave.  People have to travel further for services.  The post office then closes.  There is a negative knock-on with reduced footfall, the local shops and pubs closing, young people becoming more disillusioned, more people leaving and we are in a never-ending downward spiral.<br/><br/>The communities we serve recognise that post offices currently serve as a magnet in retaining footfall in towns and villages and in some cases in attracting footfall.  When the services of post offices are withdrawn, there is less incentive to visit or stay in that town and village and other businesses suffer.  The State, as the owner of the post office network, has a major role to play in addressing and redressing the issues faced by these communities.  Communities can, and do, experience significant barriers in accessing State services.  The post office network currently provides sensitive and secure services, and is well positioned to address gaps in the provision of State services and to be developed into a network of community hubs.<br/><br/>The report into the post office network by Bobby Kerr and the business development group identified community participation and safety, health services, transport services, financial services, social enterprise services and Government information services which could and should be provided through the post office network.<br/><br/>We believe the post office can become the &quot;State-on-your-doorstep&quot; for the communities that have difficulty in accessing State services.  All Government payments should be made through post offices, including those related to the Department of Social Protection, motor tax, Health Service Executive, CAO, third level fees, fines and licences.  We have done research in typical towns with a population of about 800 people and no Garda station and no bank.  People in those towns have told us that we should be in a position to supply and complete all Government forms.  They should be qualified to verify people's identities and become peace commissioners, for example.  We can operate a standard An Post bank account.  We can do counter transactions for all the commercial banks.  We currently do them for AIB.  We take lodgements for Ulster Bank.  We currently do not do anything for the other banks.<br/><br/>We can become a venue for remote health checks in the future and, obviously, immediately for smaller health checks.  We can become prescription drop-off points.  We can provide transport information.  We can book transport.  We can pool cars and provide meeting points.<br/><br/>Our survey indicated that people felt the need for ICT training.  Everybody has a PC at home; they do not necessarily know how to use it.  It can be done locally.  We can provide broadband access.  We can provide citizens and tourist information.<br/><br/>All these services will require Government investment - both current and capital.  We believe the level of investment required will provide good value for the people and for the taxpayer, but decisions need to be taken now.  All the issues involved have been considered at length by the post office business development group set up by the then Minister, Alex White.  Bobby Kerr was appointed in December 2014.  The report was published in January of this year.  Two working groups were set up.  One, chaired by Bobby Kerr, had its initial meeting on 4 February.  The second, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, had its initial meeting on 27 July.  There has been no concrete action from either group to date.  We have talked about it and identified this, that and the other but there is no plan to do anything.<br/><br/>As this talking continues, the situation continues to deteriorate.  The search for an ideal solution is never-ending; there never will be an ideal solution.  We want to plan for what has been identified.  Enough research has been done.  We want a five-year plan to be renewed annually, and we need that plan identified and implemented now.<br/><br/>Post offices are at breaking point because of the reduction in transaction levels and the collapse of the network is imminent.  Once the post offices are gone they are gone.  Individual postmasters are contractors; they are under intense pressure to maintain the post offices.  Some of them do it because the business has been in the family for years.  However, they need urgent decisions regarding the increase in costs they are facing.  They have increased rent, increased staff costs and other increased costs.  Postmasters are currently subsidising An Post, the Government or the communities they serve in providing the services because they are doing it out of their own pockets.</p><p> Post offices are ideally placed to provide a significant contribution in the context of the challenges faced by rural Ireland and can provide good value in doing so.  The following is required from Government: appropriate investment to protect the network; a comprehensive five-year plan; and additional State services to be sanctioned.  The State owns the post offices and we cannot provide services unless it sanctions them.  Additional financial services could be provided.  New social and community services must be tested and delivered, particularly in rural areas.  We ask the committee to request that the Ministers for Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, act immediately to ensure that the Government takes the necessary decisions now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.878" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#H00200"><p>The submissions have been very interesting and there is a common theme.  All the organisations, the banks, credit unions and An Post, have one branch network.  They are telling us also that there is a huge transfer to digital operations and, therefore, that manual transactions are decreasing by the day.  Interpersonal relationships with small businesses are decreasing.  That is the daily experience of those of us who live in rural Ireland.  We are quite adept at using the Internet.  In four or five years' time, please God, we will all have a gigabit of broadband in our houses, we all hope to have fibre and very powerful 4G and 5G and whatever.  The transfer is taking place across all age groups.  The idea that only the young use these mobile phones is not true.  Every age group is using them, booking holidays online and so on.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses think it is sustainable to keep the branch networks they own?  In the event that it is not, and that they will get more and more digital transfers, have any of them considered moving back-office functions away from the major cities, where there is congestion, where it may take people two hours to get to work &ndash; it takes an hour and a half to travel four miles in this city, as I know only too well &ndash; to rural communities where they can get highly qualified and motivated staff?  The companies that do have rural locations for back-office work find that they are very successful.  Will there be compensation because that is the growing business?  When we ring a telecommunications or computer company we might wind up talking to anybody anywhere in the world.  Why not rural Ireland, or towns in rural Ireland?  I do not believe in denying the truth that the days when people had to go to a bank to do simple transactions are over.  I have to confess that in the past 30 years I have stood in the branch of the bank that I deal with on two occasions.  I do everything else some other way, such as by post or e-mail.  Increasingly, this is becoming the way that people are doing business.</p> <p>  An Post has the added reality that every business in the country is trying to get people to go to variable debits and electronic receipt of the invoices.  I do not think that is going to change.  That is going to continue inexorably - how quickly we do not know.  How fast can we get alternative services and how sustainable are those alternative services?  In other words, are they just a short-term palliative and will that be taken over by the digital revolution?  Looked at in a hard-headed way, the witnesses seem to indicate that income will decrease even if they bring in new services.</p> <p>  Postmasters and postmistresses - post office owners - make the case cogently that their incomes are not substantial.  They cannot sustain reduced incomes.  If we want to sustain a fairly broad network, can we retain all the branches?  Is the move so great that even with extra business they are only sustaining their incomes and might even be sustaining decreasing incomes?  We need to be hard-headed because, as somebody involved for years in rural development, I know that wishing the past came back never worked.  Creating a future where we say here are the challenges and here are new opportunities for doing things in different ways because this is where people are going, has some chance of success.  There is nobody more ruthless than the customer.  If the customers want to bypass the local shop and go to the big town, or to do something electronically because that is easier, they will do it.  They are booking hotels and holidays, doing banking transactions and so on online.  Wishing that the local community, which we are trying to sustain, is going to act differently leads to a much greater chance of failure than facing up to reality and then dealing with it.  I would be particularly interested in what all the witnesses&rsquo; organisations could do to provide other employment in rural Ireland, such as back-office work.  If they were to consider the latter, what would be the inhibitors involved.  Would it be availability of suitable people to employ, broadband capacity, the road network or whatever?  We need to know what they are and to address those issues and provide for what the witnesses think is lacking.  We live in a challenging world.  One witness referred to Brexit.  They can add Trump this morning.</p></speech>

All the organisations are integral to the rural community and its viability.  They also have to be commercially viable at some level.  There is a constant tension between responsibility to the people they serve and the need to be commercially viable.</p> <p>  Whenever credit unions are mentioned in this House people speak well of them.  Everybody wants them to do well.  However, we are still in the shocking situation of having an asset-rich organisation while sectors of Irish society are crying out for the capital to make the necessary investments.  For example, there is a massive housing crisis and if the money of the credit unions was invested in housing, that would improve returns for their members and resolve one of the biggest social crises in this country.  That issue seems to have become stuck.  Why is the Department of Finance not facilitating what I have described?  Why does there seem to be a blockage within the Department on that issue.  Can the credit unions give us an update on the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and their negotiations and discussions with it?  Do the credit unions feel that the regulatory system in this country does not see a place for them as fully-functioning banks?</p> <p>  AIB closed approximately 67 branches throughout the State in recent years.  When a bank branch closes, it causes major difficulty in towns and people start to reorientate their activities towards other locations.  How many AIB and Bank of Ireland branches exist with reduced services?  I refer, in this regard, to those which only deal with cash on two or three days each week.  Can the witnesses provide figures in respect of that matter?</p><p>Even though there are particular units in specific towns, services have been reduced.  Perhaps the witnesses could detail the other services that have been reduced apart from the cash services in those banks.  What activities are being used to mitigate this issue?  Many people cannot access broadband and it becomes very difficult for them to fully participate in the banking system.  I believe that some banking services are currently available with An Post but what is holding the banking sector back from increasing the number of services with An Post in the future?  For example, deposits can be made via An Post.  Is there any way that AIB and Bank of Ireland can increase the services?  I acknowledge the Bank of Ireland does not have the same relationship but is there a possibility that rural communities can access banking services directly through An Post both to help the bank customers and to help the viability of An Post in the future?  As for Bank of Ireland, the witnesses mentioned it has not had closures recently, but there have been some closures, for example, the recent closures in Caherdavin and Parkway in Limerick.  Perhaps the witnesses could discuss those further.</p><p> I believe there is a serious crisis with An Post.  I have spoken to a number of postmasters in local towns and it is becoming increasingly non-viable for their businesses to function.  In an average sized Irish town, the post office is under pressure.  A post office may have taken a cut of about &euro;15,000 in income over the past number of years because the transactions are the basis of their income and those transactions are reducing.  I know of one particular post office that has &euro;90,000 annual income but two staff salaries must be paid from that.  Rates, electricity, insurance and all of the other costs must also come from that.  From my interaction with postmasters, and from the words of the representatives of the Irish Postmasters Union today, it seems to ring true that increasingly, the shoulders of these individuals are taking the burden of the reduction in footfall, as the witnesses have already spoken of.  One of the big problems in Ireland is that we have far too few banks, believe it or not.  We have two pillar banks and as a result those two banks can slice and dice the market to their particular desires.  They can charge interest rates and deliver services to their particular economic desires because there is not enough competition.  In Germany there are public banks with a significant, or a majority, stake in that particular economy.  Why does An Post not pitch to become a bank in a full effort to deliver banking services throughout society?</p><p> I will now turn to the issue of the Irish Postmasters Union.  There have been some decisions by the Government with regard to the issuing of driver licences.  It must have stung postmasters around the State that a service for which they pitched ended up with a private system for delivery.  An Post delivers phones currently.  Is that really working for postmasters with regard to being a retailer, or at least an agent, for phone suppliers?  There are many public sector organisations and people who work for public sector organisations in the State and I have never heard an organisation being as open to taking on new activities, roles and responsibilities as is An Post.  I commend An Post on that approach.  There seems to be an enormous flexibility among postmasters to make this system work in order that there is a viable postal service in the State.</p></speech>

I have a few questions and will start with AIB.  I am a customer myself with AIB.  Whether that is a conflict of interest when I ask questions I do not know.  I must start on a negative with regard to AIB.  I live in a peninsula in west Cork where AIB had branches in Ballydehob and in Schull, both of which have been closed.  The nearest branch for many of my constituents is about 35 km or 40 km away.  This was an extremely negative move by AIB.  It may have been somewhat forgivable to close one branch but to close two was a fatal blow to our community.  Since then people have been moving into the bigger towns to do their banking and this has had a knock-on effect for businesses locally and these communities have suffered shop closures.  AIB is providing a travelling bank but it is not acceptable to try and do business on different days.  Most people do not register as to what day it is open and go in to the car park and it is not there or whatever.  It is a big loss and it was a huge blow.  It is a heavy criticism of AIB that it would have such poor insight into the knock-on effect the branch closures would have on the local community.  We talk about the survival of local businesses but how can they survive if they do not have a bank to do any business?  I address this criticism also towards the Bank of Ireland, as it does not have a presence on that peninsula either.  I must stand up for the constituents who elected me.  Closure of branches continues to be a huge issue and I would like to see if AIB or Bank of Ireland are going to address this situation, not in that particular peninsula but in many more communities where they are closing banks.  Is the travelling bank our future?  If it is then it is a bleak future because a person cannot do proper business in a travelling bank.</p> <p>  That being said, it is a difficult time and maybe the witnesses could elaborate further on how they are helping farmers through the current cashflow crisis being experienced by many farmers.  There have been massive issues with grain, as well as massive losses in the dairy and suckler sectors.  These three sectors are coming under massive pressure this year, more so than previous years.  I would love to know how the banking sector is addressing it.  Discussions with farmers are hugely important but how are problems being addressed on the ground?  The same goes for businesses in rural Ireland.  They are still finding it difficult to survive.  We say there is recovery.  There may be recovery in bigger cities but it is not feeding its way back into our rural towns.  I would like to know how the banks are delivering for those businesses and individuals who try to start up businesses.  To be fair, AIB did speak about its backing for the Skibbereen Ludgate project.  There is an excellent manager in Skibbereen so it is easy to know why a project like that is working.  There was a big digital weekend in the Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen recently, so continued work there would be very much welcomed.</p> <p>  We speak about electronic transactions and these can lead to a lot of frustration among our older people and sometimes it is forgotten that they are not able to use the computer or the smart phone.  Sometimes when one goes to a bank branch now the customer is advised to press buttons, and many older people find it very difficult.  I would appreciate if the witnesses could take that into consideration.</p> <p>  With regard to An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has appeared before this committee.  While he is a man who would fight for the people of rural Ireland and has done so for many years, I am worried about some of his comments about introducing travelling post offices.  That would be an absolute disaster, such as the one we are living in.  I see that as a backdoor system towards closing post offices.  Any proper-minded Deputy would be totally opposed to that measure.  I do not know if there is a group coming up with these proposals for the saving of post offices but if that is its first proposal, I know the direction in which it is steering.  Am I correct in saying there is talk of plans for post offices being 15 km apart?  If that is where we are going, then we are going down a very bad road.  We talk about being able to deliver driver licences and car tax but this talk has been going on for many years but with no movement whatsoever.  That is the area where post offices need to be moving into and not talking about travelling post offices.  Many people who are social welfare recipients are receiving letters telling them they can have their benefit paid electronically.  That is damaging towards the post office network and has serious implications.  Credit unions have been delivering for their local communities.</p><p>We are lucky to have one in our peninsula, which has fairly reasonable rates.  I ask all the institutions represented to look at their local farming and business communities because they continue to struggle.  It is a difficult time in rural Ireland for farmers, publicans and shop owners.  If we begin to remove services, close banks and introduce mobile post offices, we will go down a very dangerous and slippery slope in rural Ireland, which is the issue we are discussing today.</p><p> When a post office runs into a problem and is closed for whatever reason, why must it take an eternity before it reopens?  Why can a decision not be made quite quickly, whatever the issue at the post office may be, positive or negative?  Why must we wait for months before a post office opens in the community?  It takes business from the community and gives little opportunity to a new start-up to keep the business there.</p></speech>

The contraction of the recession, the impact it had on the banking sector and the knock-on impact on society in general means there will be a change with regard to the banks, but the biggest issue I can see, particularly in rural Ireland with smaller bank branches, is the loss of power of the local bank manager.  Will the representatives from AIB and Bank of Ireland touch on how this has happened?  The mistakes made by the banking sector, no more than other mistakes in policy throughout the country, were made at a very high level, in national headquarters and beyond, where the people involved could not see some of the risks being taken in overall financing.  I do not believe the problems of the recession were the fault of the local bank managers.</p> <p>  I was a farmer before I came to this job, and this point is also with regard to small businesses and community groups.  Local bank managers had local knowledge, knew everybody locally and had respect.  They also had the power to make decisions about lending.  When a farmer or small business owner came in to talk about a tough time, the bank manager who dealt with them may have had a relationship with them for ten years.  A local bank manager had the ability to take a punt on something that might look dodgy on paper to a manager making a decision in Dublin.  This seems to be gone.  Bank managers in the regions are very much administrators more than bank managers and have lost this power.  Even if I am wrong, the perception is not wrong because it is how my constituents and the public perceive it.  Why do the representatives from the banks believe this has happened?  Do they agree with me?  Do they believe the banks have lost the local knowledge?  Local managers must now push a request up the line, and the person making the final decision is so far removed from the loan request or loan extension request and the local knowledge that they are not best placed to make the decision.  The witnesses spoke about an evolving system but do they see any change back to what was?  I take the points on board about the big move to online, and we are probably moving away from more human contact and interface, but we will never lose it completely, especially when it comes to small business.  If we address this issue we will address many of the problems for banking and beyond.</p> <p>  What are the impediments to credit unions and the post office network working more closely together, particularly for the post office network?  To me they are a perfect fit.  In my local village the credit union only opens for a couple of hours on Friday evenings, when it does not always suit to get there.  We have a massive asset in the post office network, which is open and looking for footfall.  I know contact has been made, but I believe more synergy could be there.  I am disappointed more has not been made of this potential.  Will the witnesses outline the impediments?  From a policy perspective, are there any moves we can make to assist them in working more closely together?  From a distance, I can see the mutual benefits but perhaps I am missing something big.</p> <p>  The credit union to which I referred, which only opens on Friday evenings, has amalgamated with other credit unions.  I received a crash course in the credit union sector as a baptism of fire when I was a new Deputy for Kildare South when problems arose with the Newbridge branch, which I know was not part of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  At that time there was a lot of criticism about the registrar of the day referring to a hub and spoke system, and the idea of every credit union having its own entity not being viable in the future.  I now see my local credit union amalgamating with larger credit unions.  Is the hub and spoke model playing out?  Is it the right thing to do?  What are the challenges to it?  No more than my point on the banks, we do not want to lose local knowledge but I accept we must have proper governance and not everybody is suitably qualified to be a director of a credit union.  I ask the witnesses for their comments on this.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Daly from An Post for his presentation.  When he spoke about his role in the post office network development group and Bobby Kerr's group, what recommendations has he brought to the development group?  Has he come up with his own ideas on how to support the post office network?  How does he propose to try to solve the post office network's problems which are quite evident?  Earlier I spoke about perception, and there is a perception that An Post takes the post office network for granted and that it could do more.  I believe the network needs to develop services away from An Post in order that it is not totally dependent on it because this could lead to complacency.  I would like to hear any recommendations he has brought as an individual.  I accept the points on new business which he outlined, such as the court fines process and foreign exchange.  These will bring increased footfall and perhaps this is the answer to my question.  Does Mr. Daly understand the concern in the post office network?  Is he working proactively with it?  He began by stating the scale of the network is a great asset and I acknowledge this.</p> <p>  It is great to have the Irish Postmasters Union before the committee.  I completely agree it is a national asset and a remarkable starting point.  If an entrepreneur came in with this model and was asked to make it work, that person would get very excited about the possibilities.  He or she would also see many challenges.  Its greatest strength is the scale of the network it has throughout the country.  I welcome the work of Bobby Kerr's committee and the hub initiative of the Minister of State, Deputy Ring.  The committee would not be doing the union's representatives any favours today if we told them they were all great and we will fight against people who want social welfare transactions to go online.  One of the responsibilities of the committee is the improved provision of broadband throughout the country, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v touched on this earlier.  The committee is working very hard to make sure we get better access to broadband throughout the country.  I tell my constituents and business people in rural south Kildare who are up in arms because they want improved provision of broadband to be careful what they wish for, because when it comes it will mean ease of access for online shopping, and all online transactions will become easier.</p> <p>  We have serious education work to do to let people know that if they do not use local services such as the post office network, they will lose them.  The people who turn up at public meetings to attack politicians on the closure of post offices are probably the very people who have not stood in a post office for a long time.  Earlier Mr. O'Hara mentioned that people voted in the election but those same people may not be using the network as much as they should.  The witnesses will find no greater supporters of the network than me and other members of the committee, but the move online cannot be stopped.</p> <p>  I am aware of the very positive work being carried out through listening sessions.  This comes back to my point on moving away from An Post and not being overly dependent on it.  Several points that jumped out at me as having huge potential are the peace commissioner service and tourism.  This comes back to local knowledge.</p></speech>

It is very important they are all here today.  I would like to tell the representatives from the banks how important it is for them to support people in the community, whether families, business people or people in the farming community and to continue giving out loans.</p><p>People are not looking for enormous loans from the banks in the current economic climate but when they - young couples, farmers or business people - seek funding, I ask that the banks ensure that their applications are looked upon sympathetically and that they try to help them.  </p><p> I thank the credit unions for being very credible and for doing a great deal for their members.  The credit unions are probably sick of being praised but they deserve it.  I would like to publicly compliment them on their work.</p><p> I wish to devote the remainder of my time to posing questions regarding our post office network.  I want to declare a vested interest in that I am a postmaster.  What is An Post's financial strategy for the next five years?  Is it operating a sustainable model?  Will rural post offices be closed?  Will there be reductions in incomes for existing post offices, thereby making them unviable?  Have the representatives found that the Government has implemented any changes to date far in light of the promises made in A Programme for a Partnership Government, particularly the commitment to community banking, which can be found on page 48 of the document?  Does the post office network development group foresee post office closures such as those as predicted in the Grant Thornton report of 2014?  How many contract post offices have had their incomes reduced since 2014 and, in particular, this year?  Can that be broken down year by year for the period 2014 to 2016?  That is a very important question.  After rents, rates and insurance costs are taken into account, are some rural and urban post office staff being paid at or below the national minimum wage?  The relevant post offices in this regard will not be closed by An Post or the Government, they will simply cease to operate because of a lack of funding.</p><p> What is the strategy to replace the income from Government through the social welfare contract, which currently stands at &euro;75 million?  Are there specific plans and figures for contracts with Government to replace that money, without which the rural network would obviously collapse?  With regard to when the new social welfare contract will be up for renewal, has the post office network development group ensured - by means of its current report - that there will be both a social and economic element to the contract, which might help to regenerate and sustain all communities, urban and rural?  Will the group make a recommendation in its final report in respect of the introduction of community banking - something that was promised in the programme for Government - along the lines of the New Zealand or Sparkasse models?  New Zealand has a population of 4 million and Kiwibank now has an income of over &euro;100 million and 860,000 customers.  This means that almost one in four people in New Zealand uses the services of Kiwibank.  Are we to continue to support the commercial banking sector, which, unfortunately, vanished from disadvantaged rural areas and thereby helped to bring about the destruction of small communities?</p><p> The Government talks about the new e-payment bank account but it is not a full banking service and will only have a minor impact on the incomes of individual post offices.  Will there be a significant financial shortfall that will threaten the sustainability of the current 1,100 post offices if it is implemented?</p><p> Regarding mail consolidation, local post offices sorted mail in the past to be delivered by postmen and postwomen in rural areas but that element was removed and replaced by mail being sorted at larger central locations.  Has this process been a financial success?  What has been the financial effect of this on the incomes of local post offices?  Will the removal of this service accelerate the closure of more post offices, as predicted in the Grant Thornton report?  What will be the predicted size of the network in three years' time?  There are currently approximately 1,100 post offices.  How many post offices does the post office network development group envisage being in operation in 2019?  </p><p> Has the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, done everything possible to protect the income and viability of its members or is it more interested in negotiating redundancy-style packages rather than trying to secure the viability of our post offices?  Has the rural membership lost faith in the IPU?  As I am addressing the IPU, I would like to say - because I am entitled to do so - that I am very disappointed, considering my work rate in supporting post offices over the years, that senior members of the union have been very critical of me, both personally and publicly, in a very vehement way.  All I can see as being the cause of that is the fact that I was doing what its members are paid to do, namely, stand up for rural post offices.  While they were talking about redundancy packages, I was talking about keeping post offices open. That is why, both publicly and privately, senior people in the IPU have criticised me, said bad things about me-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.891" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#L00500"><p>I thank all the representatives for taking the time to come here to make presentations to us this morning.  I will respond with a quick overview of those presentations.  I would say to the representatives from two banks, which, quite rightly, are described as our pillar banks, that we are approaching the end of what has been an exceptionally difficult period economically for the country.  I come from rural east Galway and I deal predominantly with small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and assist them as best I can with whatever advice and support I can give.  A number of these enterprise are still exiting that very difficult economic process.  One could argue that if they have survived the past eight to ten years, the future is probably quite bright for them.  However, many would have some significant legacy debt overhanging their businesses.  I ask the two banks to be as considerate and as supportive as possible when dealing with those SMEs because they are, in the main, family-owned businesses that have been in existence for generations.  They very much form part of the economic fabric of our towns and villages.  They deserve whatever support they can get because of the commitment they have made to working hard to sustain their businesses and keep the overall economic vibrancy of their towns and villages alive.  They have come through an exceptionally difficult period.  With a little of support, leniency and breathing space, I am confident that a large number of them can survive and thrive into the future.  If that policy could become part of the mechanism for dealing with those SMEs that are still struggling, it would add considerably to our national effort to ensure that the recovery extends to every single town and village throughout the country.</p> <p>  I thank the representatives of the credit unions for their presentation.  I compliment them on the exceptional success of the personal micro-credit scheme.  It is a wonderful example of the State and the credit unions collaborating to support people who find themselves in an exceptionally difficult economic environment and who would normally resort to moneylenders that charge punitive interest rates and end up having difficult relationships with the latter.  The credit unions stepped in and found a mechanism to support people who need very small amounts of money at particular times of the year.  It is an exceptional success and I congratulate the representatives on it.  I hope the remaining credit unions throughout the country that have yet to embrace this opportunity will do so as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  Turning to the representatives of An Post and the IPU, I reiterate what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  I will not repeat it because he was on the button in terms of what is happening in an increasingly digital world.  It is exceptionally important that the IPU, An Post, the State and the Government work together and acknowledge that we are living in an exceptionally changing world.  I come from a very small rural community.  I was raised in the middle of a bog in east Galway in a place called Attymon.  We had two post offices and now we have one.   I cannot recall the last time I set foot in that post office.  I have had no need to do so.  There is a wonderful postmaster there doing great work, but I do not need to be there for the majority of the 52 weeks of the year, and neither do my neighbours.  The question is should we continue to pursue an outdated model of engagement that is no longer necessary for the vast majority of people, including individuals like my mother who is 75 years of age and who uses her iPad, on a daily basis, to do her banking, check her balances, pay bills and check the price of a train ticket?  She does all her engagement with her bank and with various organs of the State on her iPad.  She is not unusual in doing that.  People might describe her as such but she is not.  A rapid change is happening within rural Ireland and, as we move to the point where we will hopefully have excellent broadband coverage in the near future, the speed of that change will increase even more.</p><p>The union and An Post should acknowledge the change that is happening and look for opportunities within it.  Pursuing an outdated model of engagement that is no longer relevant to customers who are voting with their feet in not visiting post offices is a futile exercise and a waste of time and energy.  They should focus on the strengths of post offices to see what opportunities are available in offering services where personal face-to-face engagement is required.  However, they should not insist on sustaining or promoting an outdated model of business engagement that is simply no longer relevant to the vast majority of people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.893" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#M00200"><p>I, too, welcome the delegates from the banks, the credit unions and An Post.  All of these facilities are important in the part of the world from which we come - rural Ireland.  Since the recession people no longer know their bank managers or bank officials in the way they used to know them.  I am sorry to say I agree with Deputy Martin Heydon that power seems to have been taken from the local bank manager.  That appears to be the case in dealing with loan applications.  It is a shame because bank managers had good engagement with their customers.  They knew with whom they were dealing.  When someone came in to apply for a loan, they knew his or her background and were well aware of to whom they would be giving a loan, but power appears to have been taken from them and it is others up along the line who do not know the customers who are dealing with them.  That is a retrograde step.</p> <p>  There was a young fellow on a farm at home who wished to build a house for himself, for which he wanted a loan of &euro;100,000.  One of the two banks represented here would not give him a loan of &euro;100,000, but it was prepared to give him a loan of &euro;180,000.  The problem was, based on his income, he would not be considered for a loan of that amount.  The young man in question knew what he was doing.  He was able to build enough in which he could live - the kitchen, a bedroom and a bathroom.  He would build as much as was needed to tide him over, to which he would add as the years went by.  He had brothers and cousins, as well as others, all of whom were willing to help him build the house.  However, whoever was making the decision on the loan application decided that the house would have to be completed in order that if it was not being paid for, there would be a more saleable asset to dispose of.  The person who made the decision did not know who it was he or she dealing with.</p> <p>  I disagree with the representatives that most people are happy with the arrangements made in banks nowadays.  Many elderly persons cannot manage the technology used.  Some such as Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon's mother can, which is fine, but not everyone can.  For that reason, they seem to be locked out of banks.  They cannot go there in the way they used to and are not getting the service they were used to.</p> <p>  I appreciate very much the work of the credit unions.  I make no apology for saying many families would be hungry - their tables would be short of food - were it not for the credit unions which do wonderful work, or at least they do in my neck of the woods.  We are proud and glad of their involvement in rural communities especially.  </p> <p>  There is a lot of talk about post offices.  If the local post office is lost, it will go a long way towards the parish or village losing its identity.  The creamery has closed, as have many local shops, while rural pubs are under severe pressure.  The local post office is the last place that ensures the retention of the identity of a village or parish.  I am worried that local post offices do not have the full backing of An Post.  Like my brother, I, too, am worried that some elements within An Post are hell-bent on redundancies and closing down more post offices.  Perhaps they might be doing a little more business, but they have asked to provide extra services such as the making of social welfare payments.  They received a commitment from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in that regard, but it does not seem to be happening all of the time.</p></speech>

I am sure there are other services that could be offered.  For instance, I cannot understand why the Government put a system in place covering all of County Kerry under which a person has to drive from Caherciveen, Valentia Island, Ardgroom, Eyeries and Lauragh to Tralee to renew a driving licence.  It is ridiculous.  Post offices could have operated the service without any bother.</p></speech>

There was an assurance given by the banks that they would offer low interest loans to a certain number of farmers in the new year.  I ask that the scheme be extended to beef farmers and that there be no limit on the number of people who will qualify under it.  Farming has reached a critical point.  All sectors are under severe stress.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.899" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Mulhall" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#M00800"><p>I thank members for their comments and questions which I have grouped into five key areas.  I will start with the sustainability of the branch network.  </p> <p>  The first point is there has been a lot of discussion about the intervention of digital services and what they mean for all businesses, not just banking.  Our view in AIB is that digital services remove friction from banking.  They make service provision much easier and provide greater accessibility, which is good news for the customer.  However, it is still a service industry in which people meet people.  That is where business is done.  Therefore, the role of the branch network and, specifically, the role of the branch is changing and will continue to change into providing a far more advisory service, a place where commerce is executed.  It is also worth noting that this is not just about bricks and mortar.  We have a mobile workforce on the ground which is made up of agri, SME and asset finance advisers, etc.  We are bringing the bank to the customer.  We are very focused on ensuring we reach out to the customer in a meaningful way because that is absolutely in the interests of both the customer and the bank in order to ensure a free flow of credit and commerce within the business.</p> <p>  I stress, as I did in my opening statement, the substitution effects.  I have mentioned our investment in digital services, as well as in An Post.  The provision of services through An Post is a key aspect of our strategy.  Someone highlighted the fact that, post the crisis, AIB had to close a number of branches.  That was regrettable.  However, we were conscious at the time that we wanted to ensure we would not leave our customers abandoned in service provision.  We were focused, therefore, on the strategic partnership with An Post to provide services in a meaningful way.</p> <p>  There were questions about service provision.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. O'Callaghan, who deals with local markets to talk about about future expansion.</p> <p>  The second issue on which I will focus is power and discretion in driving and the empowerment of local staff.  In our opening statement I mentioned that we had changed the way we configured from a local markets perspective.</p><p>We now have 19 local markets across the island of Ireland.  We are very focused on ensuring each accountable executive running those local markets is empowered to make decisions.  We have returned some responsibility for credit decision-making back to branch managers.  In circumstances in which branch managers do not have that discretion, and decisions have to be made by credit units, we have pushed the staff of the credit unit out into the regions.  We are taking a decentralisation approach in that regard.</p><p> I take Deputy Heydon's point that if this message is not coming across, we need to do a better job of making sure our customers understand it.  We see this issue as something that differentiates us from our competitors and that should be harnessed into the future.  As part of our approach to ensuring there is autonomy of local markets, we have deliberately aligned our local market structure to the county structure of Ireland to ensure there is a feeling of community.  We want people to feel that AIB is sticking with the community.  Our sponsorship of GAA events is part of this.</p><p> I agree with the point that was made about back-office functions.  It makes absolute economic sense to look at the migration of more and more services out of environments where labour and infrastructure costs, such as office rents, are high.  We have some pedigree in that regard.  There are over 400 staff working at our main contact centre, which operates out of Naas, where we have been for quite some time.  It is quite a large local employer.  We are continuing to look at how we can migrate other services that we do not have to operate from a centre in Dublin.  We are looking at how we might set up a centre in Limerick to handle complaints and resolve issues on a national basis.  We are conscious that driving in this direction works for our business model as well.</p><p> I agree that AIB needs to support business.  As I outlined in the opening statement, we have seen an 11% increase in new money provided into the SME sector this year.  We have partnered with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to ensure the pricing of that credit is appropriate to the business provision and the needs of our customers.  We are very focused on the agricultural sector.  It is our primary sector in Ireland.  We recognise the role it plays in the overall indigenous economy.</p><p> I think our credentials with regard to supporting customers who are in difficulty and at times of difficulty, such as the flooding events I mentioned earlier, allow us to say we are very focused on providing such support.  The world is not perfect.  We will continue to evolve and to work with our customers on delivery.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. O'Callaghan, to speak about the issues of service provision, our relationship with An Post and the expansion of services through our branches.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.901" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#N00200"><p>Members of the committee asked how the bank's relationship with An Post and the post office network might evolve into the future.  The first thing to say is that AIB has been in partnership with An Post for 13 years.  I would say it is a long, strong and productive partnership, certainly from our point of view.  As we regularly survey our customers to learn more about the experience they have with the 1,100 branches in the An Post network, we know that they enjoy really good experiences.  I want to thank An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union for that because it is very important for our customers to get a happy service that they value.</p> <p>  As we said earlier, we know that 15,000 of our customers visit post offices across the island of Ireland every day.  We estimate that they will undertake 4 million transactions this year, which is very significant.  All AIB personal and business customers in every community can visit any one of the 1,100 post offices to lodge or withdraw cash or use their cards.  It is quite an extensive service.  We are in regular dialogue with An Post.  I think we have a good relationship.  We are very happy to continue discussions with An Post about how we can further enhance that service in the period ahead.</p> <p>  Members of the committee have expressed concern that banks are reducing the services they offer in their branches.  There was a suggestion that different branches offer different types of services.  I assure the committee that all of AIB's branches open at least five days a week, from Monday to Friday.  Indeed, some of them open seven days a week.  All of our branches, including small rural branches and urban branches, offer the full range of service in areas like personal lending, SME lending, deposits, investments and foreign exchange.  I know the question of when customers can avail of over-the-counter services is a sensitive one.  While we have self-service facilities in all our branches, every customer in every branch has the option of having a face-to-face interaction with an AIB person in respect of any transaction.  I refer, for example, to over-the-counter transactions involving cash, cheques, coins or foreign exchange.  We are very committed to that.  We are saying, in a nutshell, that the full range of AIB services is available to our customers in every one of our 205 branches.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.903" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam McLoughlin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#N00400"><p>I will answer the questions in the order the Deputies asked them.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked us about our commitment to back-office locations in rural Ireland.  The Bank of Ireland employs 600 staff at its customer care centre in Kilkenny.  We have maintained a network of 250 branches.  For the past five years, our strategy has been to maintain our presence in communities to support our customers in those communities.  We require our branches to be commercially viable.  We have closed no rural branches over the past five years.  We have merged some city centre branches, but we have not closed any rural branches.</p> <p>  The value of the support provided by the professionally trained workforce in our branches does not just lie in transaction banking; it also lies in the lending activity provided in support of SMEs, personal customers and agri-customers.  I have mentioned that we provided lending of &euro;6.9 billion into the Irish economy in 2015.  That is a lot of loans to a lot of sectors and customers.  We provided &euro;3.5 billion in the first six months of 2016.  The main task of our staff is to facilitate such lending, rather than to engage in transaction banking.</p> <p>  A number of members of the committee asked about transactions.  We now see 96% of transactions being done by customers self-serving over digital channels and that number is increasing each year.  The quantum of over-the-counter cash transactions in branches now accounts for 4% of our total transactions and that number is decreasing.  In the last 12 months, we have seen a 20% reduction in the quantum of cheques being processed, lodged and issued by customers.  Those numbers are coming down.</p> <p>  We were also asked about engagement with An Post.  As Deputy Cannon suggested, we are seeing that activity reducing and reducing.  That is being done.  We have kept our 250 branches open.  It has not made sense to us, from a commercial point of view, to spread that load to another institution like An Post.  We expect the extent of this activity to decrease.  We envisage that there will be much more activity around lending capability into communities.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the provision of services.  We provide a full service in our 250 branches.  As I have mentioned, the volume of over-the-counter transactions is reducing.  We are seeing less activity.  Rather than reducing cash services, we are installing external lodgment ATM devices in all machines in all branches, starting with our smaller branches.  This means that rather than giving six hours of service a day between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., we can provide a 24-7 service.  People can lodge and withdraw money 24 hours a day, every day of the week.  Rather than reducing hours, we have made this extended facility, which offers extended opening hours, available in rural branches.</p> <p>  As part of our policy of supporting digital banking, we are experimenting with Wi-Fi in some of our branches to see whether we can support the challenge of implementing the broadband that is needed, particularly in the west of Ireland.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned a couple of branches.  We have done no rural closures.  We impose an obligation on the branches to be commercially viable.  This is why lending is so important to us.  We have done some city centre mergers.  The Chairman mentioned the Caherdavin branch, which has not been closed.  Bank of Ireland employs 27 staff in the Caherdavin community in Limerick.  We have changed some of the cash services but, as I have said, we have provided extended alternatives that are in place for longer hours.</p><p>I will explain the reason we closed the branch at Parkway in Limerick city.  We opened a new branch 1.7 km down the road.  We moved the service down the road.  We have another branch close to the Parkway Shopping Centre at the gates of the University of Limerick, as well as a branch at Roxboro Shopping Centre.  Within the space of 3 km we had three branches.  We have the most extensive branch network in the broader Limerick area, as well as 250 branches throughout the country.  We are committed to communities and to our branch network.  However, the branches must be commercially feasible.</p><p> Deputy Michael Collins asked about supporting farmers.  We have a &euro;1 billion agriculture fund for the farming community.  This is supported and led by 14 mobile agriculture development managers.  They work to support the farming community.  The scheme has an agri-flex arrangement that operates in times of distress for farmers.  For example, if commodity prices go down or if there are challenges in tillage or dairy, then we can give payment holidays to farmers or they can accelerate payments at times when cashflow is up.  A flexible arrangement is in place and the feedback is positive.  Our presence is strong but it is really a question of mobility for advisers.  The idea is to engage with customers and to walk the farm with the farmer and to visit small and medium-sized enterprises.  These are the places to be rather than in bricks and mortar.  We have kept our commitment in this regard.</p><p> Deputy Heydon referred to loss of power on the part of the local branch manager.  For many years, even before the crisis, the arrangement in the bank has been that the local branch manager or credit staff make the recommendation on a loan.  The application goes to the centre for underwriting.  That was the case prior to 2008 and it remains the case today.  The key recommendation or decision is with the local staff and local branch manager.  These are the people who engage with other staff.  There is an appeals process if a loan is turned down, but a loan is generally turned down for either reasons of sustainability or affordability on the part of the customer.  The branch manager and the regional office have an appeals process if people are unhappy with the decision.  The bank has been consistent in this regard.</p><p> This is a regulated environment and we must ensure consistency of practice throughout the country.  I referred to the numbers for lending in 2015.  The figure was &euro;6.9 billion for last year and &euro;3.5 billion for the first six months of this year.  This is demonstrable evidence of a strong commitment to lending in the economy.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae referred to loans as well.  The volumes of loans are significant.  The total figure of &euro;6.9 billion represents a significant amount of new and increased lending to the economy.</p><p> Deputy Cannon referred to the legacy or overhang from the banks.  We are cognisant of the need for new and increased lending and for Irish banks to support small and medium-sized enterprises and family-owned enterprises.  We take that seriously.</p><p> The role of the bank branch is very much around a lending commitment and development exercises as well.  I referred to national enterprise week, an event that takes place twice a year.  The next event will be held next week.  People are welcome to attend and it is open to the public.  This is about supporting local small and medium-sized enterprises, including agri-businesses and other small businesses.  We have the &euro;1 billion agri-fund, a &euro;300 million nursing home fund and a &euro;20 million flood fund.  That was used when the floods happened in January of last year.  We are committed to that.  I think I have covered most of the questions but if I have not, I would be glad to pick up on any points again.  Mr. Farrell may wish to add a comment.</p></speech>

The hospitality sector is extraordinarily important for all rural constituencies.  We held a major conference on business in this sector in recent days.  We have lent over &euro;110 million throughout the country to the sector already in the year-to-date.</p> <p>  Another point cuts to the heart of the discussion today.  This relates to our support for enterprise towns.  We have made a significant investment in recent years in a concept called "enterprise towns".  We decided that if we wanted to benefit from economic recovery, we could not be bystanders.  We decided that we had to stimulate economic activity and support local communities.  As part of the first run, some 50 enterprise towns were designated.  This year, we plan to run 100 enterprise town events throughout the country in all constituencies.  In the Chairman's constituency, events will be run in Ashbourne, Navan, Kells and Trim.  Events will be held throughout all constituencies.  There will also be events in Kildare, Westmeath and Kerry.  In several towns in the constituencies in these counties, we will run extensive programmes of support and networking activities for the small businesses and enterprises in those areas.  They represent the anchor of rural communities.  We have spent &euro;1 million this year alone in cash to support the initiative.  A total of 600 of our staff are indirectly and directly involved in driving the programme.  We are seriously committed to it and it is something we have expanded rapidly since its inception some years ago.  We are continuing to invest in this project.</p> <p>  We have provided space in our branch infrastructure for start-up and workbench activities.  We invite people from start-up companies.  They represent the future in terms of generating the next generation of jobs.  They can use the Wi-Fi facilities and the workbench, space and support services and meeting rooms.  These provide the entrepreneurs with a safe-haven environment to get their business up and running during the fragile early stage when they are trying to get things moving.  There is major investment in this area and extensive connectivity with our small business customers.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.907" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Matthews" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#O00400"><p>I thank members for their questions and comments.  I will deal with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question first.  It is probably not as relevant to credit unions because they are local anyway.  Since they are not branches of a larger entity, they have a local presence and they intend to keep that local presence.  Where there is consolidation, it is generally around a county town in such a way that employment will be maintained locally rather than coming in to one of the larger cities.  From that point of view our position is clear.</p> <p>  Deputy Heydon asked a question about smaller credit unions.  A big debate is ongoing in credit unions about feasibility, what makes a feasible credit union and whether it relates to a particular size of assets - in other words, whether the ideal size is a &euro;20 million, &euro;50 million or &euro;100 million credit union.</p> <p>  From the point of view of the league, feasibility is about far more than finance and assets.  Obviously, financial aspects arise and they tend to relate to loans, loan growth and managing the cost base.  However, equally important is the ability to provide the local services that are needed by credit union members and not necessarily on a for-profit basis because credit unions are not-for-profit organisations after all.  The third pillar is the ability to govern the credit union in question, to have good governance structures within the credit union and to be able to maintain these in future.  If a credit union can answer those three questions in the affirmative, then it should be an option for that credit union to stay as a stand-alone entity rather than consider the merger option.  Having said that, where credit unions merge, generally the objective is to keep the local services and to keep what has become a branch.  In other words, the objective is to keep open what was a credit union and what has become a branch, where possible and sometimes to improve the services on offer as well.  That is our standpoint on the matter.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the Central Bank view on credit unions.  The Central Bank has said consistently that it wants to see a strong well-governed credit union movement that should represent a feasible alternative in the financial services market in Ireland.  We have to take the Central Bank at its word in this regard.  The Central Bank instituted a strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions in recent years - I am using Central Bank terminology.  There has been considerable restructuring of the credit union movement.  To be fair to the Central Bank, as these new scenarios are being embedded in the credit union movement, we are beginning to see more leeway from the bank.  The bank is allowing credit unions to do a little more now, especially in the area of payments, mortgages and personal micro-credit.  The Central Bank is a major stakeholder along with the credit unions and others in this regard.  The bank had to revisit its standards and rules to allow these changes to proceed.</p> <p>  We are beginning to see more activity and more leeway from the Central Bank.  By nature, the regulator will be slow to make changes and to change its mind.  Credit unions must continue to show the Central Bank that we can reach the standards required.  Moreover, we must keep the pressure on the regulator to make the changes we want to see.  My colleague, Mr. Knox, will discuss the departmental role.</p></speech>

The Irish League of Credit Unions proposal on social housing and on credit unions providing funding for social housing is a direct response to the Government social housing strategy 2020, which was published in November 2014.</p><p>The strategy stated that in light of the unprecedented crisis in social housing, there was a need for private funding to be sourced to help alleviate the social housing crisis as quickly as possible.  It specifically mentioned sourcing private funding from the credit union movement.  Our proposals launched in October 2015 were a direct response to that call from Government.  In terms of the engagement with the Department of Finance and the then Department of the environment, there was a large amount of activity between the launch of the strategy and our proposal response.  We received a lot of assistance in the preparation of our proposal from the officials of the Department of the environment in particular.  We hope that the Government will implement what is its own social housing strategy which mentions, and is reiterated again in the programme for a partnership Government, that it will investigate using money from the credit union movement to help alleviate the social housing crisis.</p><p> There is a road block in that the fund that is to be set up by Government must be off balance sheet.  We understand that is where the difficulty currently lies.  To satisfy the EUROSTAT requirements, the Government must raise private funding in this way and not have it included on the Government balance sheet, because that is not allowed.  In that regard, we were very happy with and appreciative of the Minister, Deputy Coveney's attendance at a recent meeting with the credit unions in Cork in which he outlined that there are moves in that regard and that there has been engagement between the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, etc., with EUROSTAT on that issue.  We hope that roadblock will be lifted.</p><p> In parallel to that, when that preferred option, from our point of view, was not progressing as quickly as we would have liked, we also made proposals for developing a private fund that would indirectly lend to the approved housing bodies, which would then build the social houses.  All of that is outlined in the document that has kindly been circulated to the committee on our behalf.  In that regard, we continue to engage with the Irish Council for Social Housing and the equivalent representative body for the approved housing bodies.  We are engaging with them and with some of the larger housing bodies on how a fund could be developed for credit unions to invest in that would then be loaned to the housing bodies.  That is where we are at with that.</p><p> As the Cathaoirleach correctly outlined, the driving force is that credit unions have a large amount of surplus funds from the holding of members' savings.  As they are not all on loan at the moment, there is a large amount held in investments in the main pillar banks and in Government bonds.  What the credit union movement would like to see is more of that money being used in a social and productive fashion, in keeping with our ethos.  Of course, the knock-on benefit for credit unions would be a slightly higher return on those funds.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.911" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#P00300"><p>I will reply to the questions in the order in which they were asked.  Some of them are obviously linked, such as on the sustainability of the network.  I might take those questions at the end.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked a question about back office functions.  We do not actually have that many back office functions in the cities any more.  However, we have more people in rural areas than any other organisation, such as the postpersons, the postmasters and their staff.  We have companies in Athlone and Kilrush that we deliberately set up outside of Dublin.  Post Insurance is based in Athlone and BillPost is based in Kilrush.  We do not have that much to outsource from cities any more.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about postmasters' income.  I think he referenced a decline of &euro;15,000.  That is very much at the extreme end of the scale.  There is a small number of postmasters who have seen reductions of that magnitude.  What I would say is that they saw increases of that magnitude a number of years ago, so they have come back to where they had been.  Postmasters' income has not moved in any way in line with the decline of business.  In fact, the average postmaster now is still being paid 15% more than in 2008.  We are on average 2% down from when postmasters' income reached a peak in 2010.  We do recognise that postmasters' income is down, but it is not in line with the decline in income.  As I mentioned earlier, our mail activity has dropped 38%, Department of Social Protection transactions have dropped 20% and BillPay has dropped 20% since the peak.  Postmasters income, albeit declining, is not declining by anything of that magnitude.</p> <p>  This might also answer Deputy Healy Rae's questions.  If we look at what has happened in 2016, some 13% of postmasters have seen an increase in pay.  Another 23% have seen their remuneration stay the same, but two thirds have seen a reduction.  That reduction is in the magnitude of 5%.  It is nowhere in line with the reduction in business, although it is obviously a significant issue for the future.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked why we have not pitched to become a full bank.  We tried that and set up Postbank in partnership with Fortis just before the banking crisis.  Unfortunately, as part of the banking crisis, that collapsed.  Our strategy now is to grow our financial services.  As I said in my address, we have a very significant financial services business.  Our State savings business makes up 17% of the country's savings.  We have over 30% of foreign exchange business.  We have a very high percentage of the bill payment business, Western Union, etc.  We already have an awful lot of financial services that a bank would provide and we intend to grow them.  As I said in my address, we intend to bring out a payment account in the first quarter of next year.  That, in effect, will bring us into the current account market.  We are also in the process of actively looking at loan products for individuals and SMEs.  We intend to grow our financial services business over the next couple of years without the need to be a full service bank, which brings enormous costs and enormous obligations upon an organisation in terms of capital, resources, training and all of that.  While not pitching to be a bank, we are a very significant player in the financial services industry and we intend to grow in that space.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins mentioned travelling post offices and the 15 km distance.  They are just parts of what is being looked at by the group under the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring.  They are not proposals by any means at this stage.  They are very significant in the UK, which has a lot of travelling post offices.  The UK is probably the closest comparison of the post office network in Ireland in terms of its size, rural spread, etc.  The UK has found that rural post offices do work there.  It is merely one of a number of initiatives being looked at by the group under the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins also asked why it takes an eternity to sort out some post office contracts.  There has been a very small number of those cases.  I could count on one hand the number of examples over the past number of years that have taken a long time to sort out.  They are down to legal and investigation issues and I am obviously not going to go into that in this forum.</p> <p>  Deputies Heydon and Healy Rae talked about the network.  At this point, I might answer a number of questions on the sustainability of the network.  Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Cannon probably outlined better than I ever could the problems of the post office network.  It is about customer choice.  Anybody who thinks we can force pensioners to come to the post office to collect their pensions is living in fantasy land.  We are seeing a big decline in pensioners choosing the post office.  We are seeing a big decline in child benefit customers choosing the post office.  We hope that the introduction of our payment account might address that somewhat, in that some people might choose to use our bank account rather than one of our competitors.  The fact of the matter is that business is seriously in decline.  I mentioned Department of Social Protection welfare payments, BillPay, etc.  We have to address that.</p> <p>  The network at the moment consists of 1,131 post offices.  More than 700 of them are unsustainable in terms of their cost to An Post to operate.  The bigger offices subsidise that to some degree.  However, even in the bigger offices in urban areas, we are seeing reductions in income.  They are becoming less sustainable, although we believe they will continue to be sustainable because they have a significant footfall to serve.  We are working with the Government on the whole issue of rural post offices through the group under Mr. Bobby Kerr and the group under the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring.  I believe that rural post offices can only be dealt with in the context of what is happening in rural Ireland in its entirety.  The post office is only one part of it.  There are Government services, banking services and credit unions services along with post office services.  It has to be looked at in the round.</p><p>Nationally, we need to devise a structure that means we can have sustainable rural communities providing services.  This does not necessarily mean we will have the same number of outlets as today.  We could envisage a scenario in which we would have fewer locations providing many more services, whether they be Government or banking services etc.  We are working very closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, on it.  An Post is a commercial company.  As I said in my address, no commercial company could deal with the business declines we are having to deal with.  We have a new CEO and a new chairman and we will be revising the strategy during the coming months.  It will have to take on board the issue of unsustainable post offices and we will work with the Government to do so.</p><p> Deputy Martin Heydon asked what we had done in the Bobby Kerr group and what we recommended.  We have done much work in examining the network as to where the business and the population is.  We will recommend a segmented approach whereby more services will be offered by the bigger offices, and we will seek to improve the look and feel of the bigger offices and the services available.  However, the smaller offices must be dealt with as part of an overall Government strategy.  Person to person business is in decline and nothing we can do will stop it.  We have invested much in new services.  Deputy Ciaran Cannon mentioned an outmoded model and asked what we have done to introduce new products.  We have brought many more people into the post office during recent years for our new services such as our foreign exchange, gift voucher and post mobile business.  These services are bringing people into the post office who were not there before.  We are investing in new channels, given that we do not believe the physical post office channel can be the only channel for post office services in the future.  We have introduced mail services for business people in some of our delivery service units.  We have introduced more online services.  We are doing all we can to introduce new services, however the magnitude of the business that has been lost is so extreme that there are no business levels out there to replace it.</p><p> There were comments on Government services such as driving licences, motor tax and the DSP contract when it expires in 2019.  These are all issues for the Government.  We are fully open for business and we want to do business.  Although we tendered for the driving licence business, it was decided not to give it to us.  We are ready to do motor tax and we could do it in the morning.  It will come out of the Bobby Kerr group.</p></speech>

Apart from the post offices, we have approximately 7,500 staff engaged in mail activities and outside the major urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford - I had better not leave any out - we have several thousand people embedded in rural Ireland.  In the next couple of weeks, An Post will launch an export freight service, which will be available equally throughout the island.  We have particularly identified small and medium enterprises in rural areas which have found it difficult to access export markets in the UK and, most particularly, in Europe.  While this is not creating new jobs in An Post, we are launching this new business to assist other businesses in rural areas to grow their businesses through export and it should encourage other businesses to locate in rural areas, given that they can access a European network via An Post.</p></speech>

We welcome this new service which brings transactions to us.  There were teething problems, which we addressed directly with An Post.  We see it as a revenue line.  Postmasters cannot decide what to sell.  An Post or the Government decide.  While we would and could feel we would offer different services, we are not in a position to do it.  We are dependent on our masters to provide us with opportunities to earn money.  The amount of money that can be made through motor tax and driving licences has been well publicised.  An Post referred to our commercial mandate.  We see the commercial mandate as in conflict with the social and community service An Post offices can provide and, to some extent, it can damage it.  If An Post chooses to publicise its online billing, it damages postmasters' transactions.  We are paid by transactions.  There is a time lag in when we are paid.  In 2016, some postmasters were paid for transactions they did in 2014.  If a new transaction comes on in 2016, a postmaster will not be paid for it until 2018.  It is slightly disingenuous.  I do not want to get into a match.  We are timelagged.  The forecast for our transactions is that they will decrease during the next four or five years.</p> <p>  Deputies Ciar&aacute;n Cannon and Martin Heydon referred to broadband and the opportunities and threats or challenges coming from technology.  We recognise it more than anyone else.  We are the people directly faced by them.  Being involved in a five-year planning process allows us to address some of them.  As part of the Bobby Kerr group, the first presentation we received on broadband was about everybody in the State having broadband by 2019.  This has now been changed to 2023.  This is 2016.  We want a five year plan that takes us up to 2021.  There are opportunities in those five years whereby people could use post offices to avail of broadband services in post offices.  There are commercial opportunities with An Post's commercial mandate.  We want this.  While we recognise the challenges, we want an ongoing plan to address them.  We do not know whether there will be a post office in 50 years time.  We know it will be there in five years time and we need to plan for it, and it is a rolling plan.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has left.  He asked us about our involvement in the post office network renewal board.  We are in there because our members decided we should be.  We want the plan for our future and represent the interests of all our members, urban and rural.  We have done our own research on what people want.  People tell us.  We have brought those to the Bobby Kerr group.  We are responsible for some of the issues regarding the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring.  Deputy Heydon referred to listening sessions.  We conducted listening sessions in Ballymore Eustace, Fethard-on-Sea, Newbliss and other towns.  We are listening to people and proposing what they are telling us they want.  I am not sure what Deputy Michael Healy-Rae referred to.  I am not aware of any criticism anybody in the Irish Postmasters Union has ever made of him.</p></speech>

I appreciate it.  I am a practising postmaster.  Maybe I am not practising, given that I am here three days a week.  I am a postmaster and I have a particular interest in the sustainability of the post office network.  I was interested in what Mr. Daly said regarding comparing the incomes of postmasters and how they have decreased by an average of only 2% during recent years.  When he was comparing it, it was not what might be described as a high income, given that every postmaster must provide an office for commercial activity and an office for mails.  Accommodation, light and heat charges have increased significantly during recent years and commercial rates have increased significantly.  It is not what would be called a very sizable salary.  I am not saying this on my own behalf but for many of the postmasters I have been in contact with.  I am surprised that we are only at 17% of State savings, considering the turbulent times we have gone through economically during recent years.  An Post would have been perceived as having a very reputable brand, along with the Irish League of Credit Unions, with no offence to our banking friends, during recent years.  I would have imagined this percentage would have been higher.</p><p>A number of post offices have been identified that will possibly never be sustainable, regardless of the level of new business generated.  Will Mr. Daly quantify the number of rural post offices that will be unsustainable in the future?</p><p> My next question is addressed to the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU.  The ILCU responded to the then call for submission on measures to address the housing crisis.  The ILCU has in the region of &euro;10 billion on deposit that it can invest.  Has any progress been made in the two years since the ILCU made its submission on the housing crisis?  The housing crisis has got worse.  I am not interested in hearing about talks but have there been concrete proposals on how this money, that can be used to alleviate a serious social problem, will be used?</p><p> The Irish Postmasters Union has been doing a great deal of good work in the past number of years in promoting the significant role the post office network plays in a sustainable, vibrant rural community.  In many rural communities there are no banks or credit unions outside of large provincial towns.  In many of the villages, the final service that remains is the post office.  I have grave concerns that when the post office services is gone from rural towns, such as the village I come from and many other villages across the county, that we will no longer have rural communities.  They are the glue keeping rural communities together.  In terms of the input to the Bobby Kerr report and previous reports, do the representatives from the Irish Postmasters Union feel any sense of urgency by Government to put in place a plan for a five year term to sustain the offices that are sustainable for five years?  Given that responsibility has been spread across three different Ministers are we still procrastinating on the services and supports we can put in place to support the network?</p></speech>

We have grown savings from 6% at the end of 2007 to 17% and this is based on Central Bank reports.  As Deputy Troy stated this is down to confidence and trust in An Post, the post office network and in the State savings products.  In terms of the number of post offices that are sustainable, I mentioned in my address that we have an obligation under the Department of Social Protection, DSP, contract, our largest contract for a particular geographical coverage.  We could do that with 600 post offices, so that would leave circa 530 offices, which would not be needed to satisfy our largest contract.  Every one of them would be unsustainable.  Within the figure of 600 post offices, there are also circa another 200 offices which lose money for us, but which we require to satisfy our DSP obligation.</p> <p>  I do not recall saying that a postmaster's income was at a high income level, what I was reiterating were the changes over the number of years.  I recognise that postmasters have costs but they have to recognise that the business is in decline and even for the business that we are retaining, it is highly competitive.  Every time a bill payment contract comes up with a major utility, there is pressure on An Post to reduce the price.  The price that we charge is under significant pressure.  We are a commercial entity and we must make commercial decisions.</p></speech>

In the course of the presentation I said that all the issues of the post office have been aired over and over again for the past number of years.  The question of motor tax has been around for 20 years.  There is no sense of urgency.  They have been discussing it but our fear going into that process is that it would be a talking shop.  We sat down on 4 February 2016 with An Post and the Bobby Kerr group and of last week, on 4 November, we have not made any significant progress.  The only serious financial proposals put on the table are by us.</p></speech>

In our understanding, past and present, the Government is undermining the network by encouraging our customer to transact their business through the bank.  We have examples of numerous letter, and I can show members five, six, seven letters issued by this and the past Government which have encouraged people to use the banks over the post office network.  If that continues, the post office network collapses because as Mr. Daly has said, most of the income that is earned by the post office network to deliver the service of social welfare is fundamental to underpinning the network.  If one takes the foundations out from the post office network, which is the Department of Social Protection and continues to encourage the clients to get the money lodged to a bank account, the onus is on the Government to ensure that does not happen.  If that continues to happen, the post office network will not survive.  Our intention is to be able to deliver a Government service.  We have said, and we continue to say that we can be the State at your doorstep.  People have said there is no requirement for face to face service any more.  I think there is and we believe there is a requirement for face to face contact, particularly in regard to Government services.  More and more people request the help of the TD to fill out forms and accessing services.   I think that can be done by the post office network in a cost-effective way, and in a way that every community needs and survives because of it.</p></speech>

The Government published their social housing strategy in 2014 and we published our response to its request for funding from credit unions a year later in October 2015.  It is not exactly two years but it is a year in which no substantive progress has been made.  We mentioned that in our opening address.  In the first from November 2014 to October 2015, there was very good engagement with the relevant Departments and that helped greatly in preparing our proposal.  The frustration that was referenced in our opening address comes from the lack of progress since October 2015.  We have had numerous meetings and the barrier at this stage seems to be mainly around the fund being on or off balance sheet and there is no solution to that yet.  No decision has been made in that regard as yet.  That is where our frustration stems from.  We are still awaiting a fund that we can invest in.  It looks difficult for the Government to create any type of fund without it being off balance sheet.  We appreciate and understand that.  Likewise we welcome the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney meeting the credit unions in Cork, stating that housing is a priority of the Government and we really hope to see that being acted upon and moved along as speedily as possible.  We mentioned the lack of progress on that front.  We would like to create our own fund but the difficulty around that remains that the Central Bank would have to approve credit unions to be allowed to invest in that fund or in any other fund in regard to social housing.  As it currently stands the Central Bank prescribes a list of investments that credit unions can invest in but that list does not allow for investment in social housing.  We would need to change the Central Bank regulations as well.</p></speech>

For a functioning society we need to ensure that people can have face to face interactions.  If we rule out face to face interactions with each other, it will not be a society that anybody wants.  There has been some frightening information put out in front of us but it is very important that the message from this committee that goes out to the public is that it is the intention of this committee to build viable and strong vibrant economies regionally and in rural areas.</p><p>While there have been certain trends over the last number of years in these aspects, everybody will agree it is our objective to fight those trends and reverse some of them if possible.  </p><p> I thank the witnesses for coming here today and giving this information.

Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise the witnesses that the openings statements and any other documents they have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>We will continue our consideration of stream 3 of our project, maintaining an effective service and presence in rural communities.  What we have been doing as a committee over the past number of months has been engaging with as many organisations as possible who have a stakehold or engagement with rural communities around the country in an effort to see whether we can make sure that Government does the necessary things to make these rural communities viable.</p><p>I invite Retail Excellence Ireland to address the committee first.</p></speech>

Retail Excellence Ireland is a not-for-profit organisation.  We are Ireland's largest retail representative body.  We have about 1,700 company members that operate over 10,000 stores nationwide.  We have offices in Ennis, County Clare, and in Dublin.  I will be brief because I know the committee is running behind time.</p> <p>  In 2002, we conducted the largest piece of research into what drives town centres and what engages citizens to come and use their towns and villages ever conducted in the State.  We found that six matters were of extreme importance.  The first thing we found was that the key driver is proximity.  I know that sounds pretty obvious but I am concerned that there may be many towns and villages whose plans of revival are based on getting tourists to come from Wales, for example, when a town or village should really be built for the people of the local area.  If a great job is done for them, visitors will follow.</p> <p>  The second most important thing for a town's viability is the daytime offer.  That involves retail, the local post office, the bank and perhaps a town cr&egrave;che or library.  If the offer is not fit for purpose, people will not come.  In the Irish State today, far too much is made of car parking charges.  That ranked sixth in importance.  To be frank, there are some towns in the country in which if one actually paid people to park, they still would not come.  The offer obviously has to be appropriate.  Otherwise, everything else is meaningless.</p> <p>  The third most important issue was the evening economy, which is of great importance to many towns.  The fourth most important issue was accessibility, which involves driving or getting in to the town the same way in the same amount of time each and every time.  It is especially pertinent to women with children.  The fifth most important issue was the public realm, beautification and such like.  The sixth most important issue was car parking charges.  Those are the fundamentals for us in terms of town revival.</p> <p>  Having done that research, we decided to become active.  We are a not-for-profit organisation, but we invited the top 100 populated towns in the country to apply to work with us.  Two were chosen, Limerick and Carlow.  Carlow did not work for two key reasons.  One reason was that they refused to define the inner core, as in, where the town centre was.  We found that the shopping centre owner out the road and others obviously believed that they were a part of the town centre.  As a result, our intervention was scattergun and did not work.  Any retail investment we brought to the town was arguably invited to the shopping centre rather than the town centre.</p> <p>  In Limerick, we had a far different outcome.  The county council CEO and economic development director were great.  We did three things.  One was to improve the offer.  We went out and sold Limerick to retail and hospitality investors.  More than 40 new stores opened up in an 18-month period.  The second thing we did was to improve the public realm.  The county council put money into Cruises Street.  Money is also going into O'Connell Street.  It is simple beautification and it does not need hundreds of thousands of euro spent on it.  The beautification of the public realm can simply be three buildings either side of each other in a street being painted, the planting of trees, good signage or awnings put over front doors.  The third thing we are working on at the moment is citizen engagement.  It involves reminding the people of Limerick and the wider conurbation that it is their place and that there are lots of great things to come and do.</p> <p>  We are active in about 30 towns today, trying to advise and assist local stakeholder groups and town teams on how to be better.  We have a very positive relationship with county councils.  As the Chairman of the committee knows, Navan was selected on Saturday evening as Ireland's friendliest place as part of our awards programme.  We are trying to get local authorities to nominate towns and to get behind businesses to be the best, drive service standards and engage customers.</p> <p>  How does one revive a town?  The first thing I would advise is to establish a town team.  The team needs to involve all stakeholders, young and old, including the Tidy Towns group, the chamber of commerce and more.  It has to be inclusive.  The second thing I would advise is to define the inner core.  Start at the centre and work outwards.  Define the centre, whether it is from Jack's pub to the pharmacy on the corner to the bank or whatever.  That is where all the effort must be focused on.  The third thing I would advise is to do everything possible to improve the offer.  Big towns might be able to appeal to retailers to come and set up, but small towns can easily do stuff like hosting a mini-English market, which appeals to local artists and producers to come and trade with the people.  English markets rules should apply, which means it would be rate controlled and rent controlled.  It would offer a safe place for these people to come and do business.</p><p>We can improve the public realm, which does not involve lots of money.  It can be simple stuff.  We would always insist that the retail businesses would sign a statute of behaviour for what they need to do in terms of cleanliness, standards, opening on time, getting behind the town brand and any initiatives the town team has decided to run and engage the people of the town.  We are bad at that in this country.  We are very quick to think about how to get visitors to the place.  However, for example, I live in Ennis and I am delighted that there are economic development directories agreed with a plan that we will put in place.  We are designing a &ldquo;my County Clare&rdquo; card.  Everyone in the county will be invited to sign up to it.  When they go their local pub or restaurant, they will be asked whether they want to find out what is going on in their town.</p><p> We are going to build a citizen database and every two or three weeks we will e-zine and text people about what is happening in their county.  It is not going to be about sales or retail offers but about great things to do - a family day, a duck race, an outdoor cinema night or whatever - to try to reacquaint people with their place.  It is cheap.  Irish consumers today desperately want mid-week convenience, to nip in and out to the shops, but weekend experience.  Tonight and tomorrow night there will be families sitting around every kitchen table in the country talking about what they will do at the weekend.  Families are travelling further for an experience.  That is why places such as the Arboretum Garden Centre in Carlow or Ballyseedy in Tralee or The Orchard in Celbridge are doing well because they offer food, retail, something to do and a day out.  Towns can do that, if we work together positively.</p><p> I have three requests for the committee.  Please get behind our town revival pilot programme that we have pitched on many occasions to Government.  It is an educational programme for ten towns over a 12-month period in partnership with the Association of Town Centre Management in the United Kingdom which has been helping small villages and towns to be better for 25 years.  We get on great with local authorities and county councils but we believe their skill set around town management is poor.  They do not have the skills that Don Nugent in Dundrum Town Centre has.  When a vacancy, accessibility or cleanliness issue arises in Dundrum, something happens.  We probably do not have the same skills in Ireland.</p><p> The second request is that we have to pitch in with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment around an accelerator programme to get small retail and general businesses online.  While we welcome the digital voucher, it is not visionary enough and &euro;2,500 on a voucher will not go very far.  There is a department store in Ballybofey in the back end of Donegal called McElhinneys, which off its own bat has built a 14,000 sq. ft. warehouse that is about to open.  It sells to 65 countries.  This year &euro;560 billion will be spent across Europe.  We are not visionary enough in helping small rural businesses go online and take on the world.  We would love for this accelerator programme to be funded by Government.  It involves taking 15 businesses and helping them with Enterprise Ireland standard support.  Any modern economy has three main pillars: export, which we are brilliant at with Enterprise Ireland and Origin Green.  Second is foreign direct investment and we are brilliant at that.  My sister is on the board of IDA Ireland.  After last night we might not be so good but we do our best.  The third pillar is the domestic economy and, to be frank, we do very little for businesses here, especially rural ones.  If McElhinneys can do what they do and employ 190 people in a small provincial village in Donegal, I am sure there are many others we need to get behind and support.</p><p> The third request is for larger towns and that Government would introduce use it or lose it legislation for big box retailers who are sitting on vacant property in the centre of towns, which is killing towns.  The county chief executive in Wexford, Tom Enright, has been very vocal about a national grocery brand, one that we should be proud of as a large and profitable retailer, causing the greatest distress and upheaval in town revival.  While there is good reason for smaller properties not to be let because there is no tenant to be found, to have these huge boxes vacant in town centres with this brand happily paying rates to keep competitors out of the town is destroying 24 towns today.</p></speech>

The subtext is maintaining an effective service and presence in rural communities.  That is very important because we need to consider maintaining rather than seeing it go away and trying to set it up again.  One never misses the water until the well runs dry.  It is important to give assistance and gear ourselves to look after what is already there.  It is a service.  I am joined by a full-time newsagent and a full-time convenience store operator from Monasterevin, respectively, Noel Kelly, our president, and, from Mountrath, Ann Martyn.  We need to understand that these people provide a service to their communities.  They are very proud of that.</p> <p>  Within our written submission we have given more detail about the social and economic capital that revolves around these businesses.  We know we are speaking with friends and we would like the committee to understand that we believe our stores are the cornerstone of the community.  It is important to build on what is there.  There are very considerable difficulties for a new store opening up, such as guarantees, bonds, hostile lenders, planning difficulties and so on, and there may be difficulties in obtaining a suitable premises.  We welcome newcomers but it is better to look after those who are there.</p> <p>  Our association has 1,500 stores in membership and we give information to our members.  We assist them on a macro and micro level.  We represent them, ensure they are connected with each other and encourage them.  We are very much to the fore in unashamedly promoting Irish products to the point that each year we identify a particular product our stores can sell, and over several years we have identified confectionery and local confectioners and give access to their products nationally without any fees or charges.  It is a leg up to small indigenous businesses.  Quite frequently our stores are the ones the local entrepreneur will come to with a new business thought.  We will give it access.  The majority of our members are affiliated to symbol groups, and if the product works, they will show it and the sales to their buyers and become the launch pad for brands that are very familiar and have moved on to bigger and better things.  We are very proud that we can act in that fashion.  That happens from the small store taking an interest in their neighbours.</p> <p>  We have asked the committee to consider several things.  We know it wants to complete its report as quickly as possible, but we would like it to take cognisance of some points.  Mention was made of an earthquake last night but another natural event, unfortunately, is flooding.  Many of our members were affected by this in recent years and will no doubt be affected again in the next few years.  It is grossly unfair for an insurance company to refuse to insure a business following the flood relief work done by the Office of Public Works with &euro;500 million of our tax money.  That is disgraceful and this committee should make representations to ensure one of the terms of contract is that insurance is granted.</p><p> The level of insurance is a massive problem for us.  One cannot have a viable business, or have a business at all nowadays, if one does not have insurance in light of the position with regard to litigation.  The cost of insurance is going through the roof once again and it is very important the committee makes observations on that.</p><p> Committee members will be aware, given the representations they receive, of the difficulties with crime in rural Ireland.  There are gangs involved in crime and we have noted five different styles of gang.  We find one issue in particular very frustrating.  As an association, we would have no difficulty involving ourselves in assisting our members and others in making people aware of the presence of gangs in an area, through a neighbourhood watch-type approach.  We find it very upsetting that the Data Protection Commissioner is refusing to allow the use of images of people who are known to have - and in many cases are actually convicted of having - taken part in various offences, which means we do not have the ability to provide that information to our members.  In many instances, members are more than half an hour from garda&iacute; so this would be a preventative measure.</p><p> We have also asked the committee to consider requesting from the Departments of the Taoiseach and the Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that there should be a counterweight argument with regard to Brexit and cross-Border shopping.  This is not necessarily to stop individuals going across the Border but to show, on the debit side, the cost to people societally and in terms of the real cost of travelling across the Border.  Once again, unfortunately, paper in the media does not refuse ink and this is becoming an issue once again.  We believe people should be made aware of the difficulties that follow from cross-Border shopping.</p><p> The submission mentions that there is to be a rural charter, which is important, and there is a promise that there will be a health check for legislation as it affects rural areas.  I am of the view that it should be further defined to ensure that there is a health check for small and medium enterprises in particular and how they are affected by legislation.  Unfortunately, too many items of legislation have come out of this House which work on the basis of a one-size-fits-all approach.  As small retailers, we have been caught with significant compliance costs and significant unforeseen consequences due to legislation.  We are not Hewlett Packard yet we have the same obligations to comply with certain parts of legislation.  Surely there must be a way to modify or allow for these things for small businesses.</p><p> It is most important that retail and representative bodies are allowed the right to negotiate.  It is perfectly obvious why competition law came into place and we have no difficulty with that because we live and breathe by competition.  However, the tables have turned much too far and we are now precluded from negotiating in any fashion whatsoever.  Our Australian retail counterparts have protection in that they are allowed to negotiate.  Even this week, new Australian legislation allows for protection from unfair contracts to be extended to small businesses.  These are the important matters.</p><p> In terms of what we would like the committee to do, a number of matters are pertinent today, one of them being the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  I think it very important that the committee sees that there is an enormous distinction between, on one hand, our members, who are, if not struggling retailers, then small retailers who are the cornerstone of the community and who know their customers, and, on the other, those who take their direction from Germany, the UK or elsewhere, otherwise known as the multiples.  They are the ones who have caused the difficulties in respect of the sale of alcohol.  As far as we are concerned, the Government can go after them by all means and perhaps use a threshold by way of overall turnover or size.  However, it should not come after the small guy because we are not the problem.</p></speech>

One of the major challenges to retail at the moment is the billions of euro migrating to the Internet annually.  The problem for the country on the back of this is that &euro;3 out of every &euro;4 is being spent outside the jurisdiction, so it is being lost to the State.  It seems to me that one of the projects the LEOs and the local authorities should be nailing down is in regard to ensuring that the real retail space that exists in towns and villages throughout the country is quickly put up onto a virtual retail space.  In other words, towns such as Athboy, Oldcastle and Ballivor would have a virtual space on the Internet and each of the retailers that function in the area would be given help, direction and support in starting to use e-commerce or, at the very least, some level of access to marketing tools on the Internet.  If many of these businesses do not migrate to that sphere, they will encounter massive difficulties in the future.</p> <p>  We had a discussion on this not long ago.  It is a King Canute-type fight against the Internet at one level but what Mr. Fitzsimons said is also important, namely, that people need human interaction as well and there will be an important space for that in the future.  Mr. Fitzsimons might tell us how many town teams are in place or being developed throughout the country.</p> <p>  The enterprise agencies in the State have had an attitude towards retail which has been that they will give soft supports but they will not provide other types of supports.  Displacement has been an issue for them in that regard.  As a result of the fact that there is such a level of migration to Internet sales, is it time for the enterprise agencies to look at giving more solid and stronger supports - such as financial, investment or grant supports - to retailers, particularly in rural areas, so they can function?  Obviously, those supports would be based on the viability of the businesses in question after they are provided and would not represent an effort to keep them alive in circumstances where they are not sustainable.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Jennings indicate whether there has been any change with regard to retail organisations, such as the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, negotiating with suppliers in a collective fashion which defends their members' rights or is it still the case that local retailers are forced to deal individually with very large suppliers and, therefore, have very little negotiating power?</p> <p>  Mr. Jennings said that the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association has 1,500 members.  What kind of employee levels are there within that and how big is the specific sector?  There has been much discussion about Brexit and we had Enterprise Ireland before the committee recently.  When its representatives told us it was dealing with Brexit, I asked how many people were working on it and I was told that there are two.  We often hear that supports are being given to businesses that are suffering with regard to Brexit.  The entire Border region is a major rural area and it is the one most under threat with regard to people doing their retail shopping in the North.  Do the witnesses know of practical examples of supports the types of businesses to which I refer have actually received to date in that space?</p> <p>  When the witnesses talk about getting retailers to use vacant spaces, are they referring to a vacant site tax or what type of mechanism is suggested?  Has any consideration been given to the idea of a progressive rates base for businesses in order that businesses in rural spaces would have a rates base which takes into consideration their levels of profitability?  This might help further their sustainability into the future.</p></speech>

I will begin with the presentation from Retail Excellence Ireland.</p><p>I am very conscious of the point about defining the core area.  In the year and a half I spent in Kildare County Council, the first thing we learned about planning was that any good planning should be sequential from the town centre out.  Compared with Newbridge, Naas was always the retail town.  However, a large multiple development on the edge of the town saw perfectly viable businesses in the heart of the town close and go out, given that there was more footfall out in the large shopping centre.  In Newbridge, the Whitewater shopping centre was developed in the heart of the town, and Newbridge is a more thriving retail town.  Local businesses beside Whitewater are benefitting from increased footfall.  Regarding planning laws, could Mr. Fitzsimons comment on how Lidl and Aldi stores, which can provide free parking, seem to be given a run-through by local authorities and the impact it is having in our towns and villages?</p><p> I was surprised Mr. Fitzsimons put such importance on the beautification element.  I completely agree and welcome the fact that he sees it as an important element.  Our local authority recently came forward with a shop front initiative.  Although some towns did not buy into it, in Athy the &euro;50,000 for painting a shop front was snapped up in no time and it has already had a very visible effect on the main street.  Last Thursday night I was at a Tidy Towns community action awards ceremony in Kilcullen, a relatively small town.  More than 100 people attended and it was standing room only.  There was an award for the best business shop front, the local GAA club got something and there was a Tidy Town award for the best estate.  It was all integrated and there was a very strong sense among the people in the town of the need to support local businesses, given that they support the people.  Mr. Fitzsimons used the phrase "use it or lose it" regarding planning.  As we said to An Post, the Irish Postmasters Union and the Irish League of Credit Unions earlier, we must continue to drive a message to our citizens that if they do not use their local post offices, shops, convenience stores and newsagents, they will lose them.  Online shopping is a major challenge.</p><p> Mr. Fitzsimons mentioned getting expertise in and learning from the UK.  Many regional towns in the UK were decimated and their town centres died.  Are we trying to avoid the mistakes of the UK or are there examples of towns that have got it right over there and lessons that can be learned from a planning perspective?  While I do not disagree with the point that local authority skills are poor, we cannot bypass the local authorities.  I would be interested in any views on how we can improve it and work with the local authorities, given that they are an integral part and they are all over the country.  It is key.</p><p> Mr. Jennings and Mr. Kelly are very welcome.  I will take two points from the presentation we received earlier.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is undertaking a review of the motor insurance industry.  There has been a public consultation process and it is feeding into the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  In recent discussions with him, he told me it was the starting point.  Insurance is a key issue for members of the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, as it is for all businesses.  We hope the lessons we learn from the motor insurance problems will feed into the exact same problems we have in the insurance sector across all areas.  The rows about whether blame falls on the legal profession or on the insurance companies for settling too early reflect the same problems and will cross over.  I look forward to having a process early in the new year whereby the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association members can feed into a similar review.</p><p> I take on board the points about the Data Protection Commissioner.  Shoplifting is cruel.  Constituents of mine have contacted me about their frustration in respect of their convenience store where the weekly and daily losses to shoplifting are significant.  Maybe the committee should write to the Data Protection Commissioner about it and highlight a specific recommendation that has been put to us here today and ask whether more can be done to enable retailers, given the investments they make in CCTV.</p><p> Regarding the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and structural separation, I have been contacted by the vast majority of shop owners in my constituency and I have sympathy for the concerns they raised.  Some of the larger multiples have mounted a very good campaign and they have used some of the smaller shops to make the argument.  The people who contacted me are very solid people whose judgment I respect and who are very concerned about it.  However, I found some of the arguments they were making would not necessarily affect their stores, given that they are on the smaller scale.  Although there will be some element of shuttering or using curtains, their stores are not necessarily big enough to require a separate room.  I can understand the challenge from the shoplifting and extra staff perspective.  Could Mr. Jennings and Mr. Kelly outline exactly how the structural separation would impact on their members' stores?  What proportion of their trade is alcohol sales?  How significant a proportion is it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.936" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#W00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  They opened up and discussed many interesting points.  I come from a rural constituency in west Cork.  Earlier, I spoke about the banks.  We have lost two of our banks, which resulted in a major shop in our town closing within a year.  This shows the knock-on effect it has.  It has a severe effect on the town.  People are shopping in the bigger towns, which may be 40 km from where they live, and the local town is losing out.  Other shops are struggling for survival.  These issues are not taken into account when somebody makes a very quick decision about closing something without looking at the further implications.</p> <p>  During the drafting of the programme for Government we discussed town revival programmes a lot, especially the rural resettlement programme.  If we brought people into our towns it would make the towns and shops busier.  Rural resettlement could include living over a shop.  Many shops have nobody living over them.  My town, Schull, is popular during the summer.  During the winter, a town that could house 250 people might not have 20 people living in it.  The effects of that are very evident to me.  Recently, I went into the hotel there and asked if I could have tea and a scone in the morning.  They told me they did not have anybody cooking because they had nobody staying the night before.  How will they survive?  The hotel industry is very important given that it has a knock-on effect on local businesses.</p> <p>  In west Cork, Bandon and Skibbereen were severely hit by flooding, which decimated businesses.  A motion on insurance is to come before the D&aacute;il in the next week or so.  Insurance companies have lost the run of themselves and nobody seems to be able to control them, discuss issues with them or see where we can turn the issue around.  Some businesses are contacting me and, probably, other Deputies.  They are getting astronomical insurance bills, and if they have been flooded, they cannot get insured again, even if major flood prevention works are carried out in their towns preventing flooding and millions of euro have been spent.  They are a law unto themselves.  The committee needs to bring the insurance companies before it to discuss it and help protect businesses.</p> <p>  "Use it or lose it" is a great idea.  If local authorities around the country could apply this, it would bring a lot of life into local towns.  I made the point on local radio a few months ago.  I attended a meeting in Macroom, outside my constituency, and on the way home at around midnight or 1 a.m. I went through many of the towns I represent.  They were like ghost villages.  The only difference between them and the western films we used to watch long ago was that there was no straw blowing through the village.  It is an unfortunate fact.  To try to turn it around is very difficult.  This committee is trying to help.</p> <p>  I am involved in a community alert group and I see CCTV cameras as a big plus in preventing crime, especially in businesses.  I am astonished that one cannot pass the information on to one's peers.  Sometimes, one wonders who is favouring whom.  People need to protect their businesses.  As Deputies, maybe we need to ensure legislation is brought forward to change that.  Another crisis is facing retailers, namely, the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  I would love to know who was the author of the Bill.  Maybe they can argue a point with the big stores such as Tesco.  They might be able to do something, however, the small, local stores are being asked to bring in new laws under the Bill.</p><p>It is not workable and it will not work.  We could see major job losses because of it.  I will oppose it completely.  I have been in contact with the Rural Alliance group to make sure that we are all in support of small businesses and small shopkeepers.  When it comes to the sale of alcohol, they know best and they control it best.  The smaller storekeeper knows better than most to make sure that areas where alcohol is displayed are manned and watched carefully so that the wrong people do not buy alcohol.  The Government can bring forward plenty of other provisions in the alcohol Bill if it wants to turn this around and make it look workable, but it should not attack the small stores.  I will support small business and small shopkeepers.  We should be able to give them any help we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.938" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#X00200"><p>I thank all the witnesses for taking the time to appear before the committee, present to us and offer us a very fascinating insight into some of the ideas they have for sustaining and reviving our rural towns and villages through their commercial activity.  I am a somewhat vested interest in this regard.  I own a small rural business.  I am a small rural retailer.  I sell alcohol in a pub which is the only one in my town.  In fact, I am the only retailer in the village in which I live.  I am very much on the front line in facing up to some of the challenges the witnesses face.</p><p>I will pursue a few lines of questioning that might give me a greater insight into the challenges the witnesses face and then examine how we can best support them.  Mr. Fitzsimons referred to the issue of commercial rates.  How difficult an environment does that continue to be for retailers in our towns and villages?  Galway County Council last year was considering a mechanism - I think it is in place now but I could be wrong - whereby it identified 40 vacant premises in Ballinasloe and 35 in Tuam and incentivised new businesses to come into the towns and trade from those vacant premises on the basis that in their first year of trading they would not have any rates liability, in the second year they would have a 50% liability, in the third year they would have a 75% liability; and, finally, they would have a full rates liability in the fourth year.  This seems to have been very well received.  It is a kind of scaffolding structure to make these businesses viable during the most difficult period of their trading, namely, the very beginning of their trading life.</p><p>The towns I know best are those close to my home: Portumna, Gort, Athenry, Loughrea and Tuam.  They are all market towns with populations of roughly 4,000 to 6,000, have very large rural hinterlands and rely hugely on those rural hinterlands to survive.  One or two of the more, I would argue, visionary council engineers have suggested to many retailers in these towns to consider seriously a full pedestrianisation option, <i>&agrave; la</i>Grafton Street or Henry Street, and create a necklace of high-quality car parking facilities on the periphery not of the town, but the town core.  Some of these towns might already have such car parking facilities in place.  They would require shoppers to walk no more than 200 metres or 300 metres to what one would describe as the town core.  Mr. Fitzsimons spoke about beautification and making our town centres more attractive.  I may be completely wrong, but it is my opinion that in the case of the shopper who wants a pleasant experience of visiting his or her local town and wants that experience in the town core, if he or she goes to Dundrum Town Centre, as mentioned by others here, he or she is in an enclosed building, there are beautiful benches and it is a pleasant place to be.  People can park there, shop till they drop and walk out four or five hours later.  Could an attempt be made to replicate somehow that ambiance and that environment in our town centres?  I am not suggesting putting roofs over them, even though one engineer suggested that for a street in Tuam a number of years ago, but rather making them simply more pleasant places to be so that people and their children can walk freely across the streets and back again, from the butcher to the newsagent to the draper, knowing they are in a perfectly safe environment.  The fear of retailers, many of whom I have spoken to about this, is the simple feeling that people will not make the 200 metres or 300 metres journey from their car to the town core and that if the cars are not driving right by their premises, it somehow disadvantages them in terms of access.  I am not so sure this is the case.</p><p>Have either of the witnesses' organisations considered this as a policy?  Do they agree we should pursue it?  If we were to do so, is there some way the State could support such an endeavour?  If one goes to towns in France, Spain or Italy on a Saturday afternoon, one will see they are in the main pedestrianised, not because they are somehow formally so, but because they seem to be self-pedestrianised.  There are markets and there seems to be a vibrant community life in the town centres because in the main there are no cars there.  The cars seem to park on the peripheries of these smaller towns.  Have the witnesses considered this?  What are their opinions on it?</p><p>The Chairman spoke very well about the issue of digital and both the challenge and the opportunity it presents for retailers.  I have a 20 year old son.  I cannot remember the last time he bought a stitch of clothing in any shop within 20 miles of where we live.  He was looking for a pair of hurling boots at the beginning of the hurling season.  He asked me if he could buy a pair of hurling boots.  I told him of course he could.  He bought them sitting on the sofa at home, and they arrived in our letter box the following morning from Newry.  There is a shop that sells hurling boots four miles away from where we live.  He had no interest whatsoever in getting into a car, driving to that shop and spending his time in the town centre.  For him, it was all about the choice and the convenience of being able to buy whatever boots he wanted from the comfort of the sofa, sitting in front of the television.  He shops and watches television at the same time, and that is a phenomenon with which we must somehow engage and use to our advantage.  The Chairman is right in his idea.</p><p>A gentleman from a rural town came to me about six months ago with what was a very rudimentary town commercial website, that is, a kind of Shopify for towns.  There would be an overall place - say, Loughrea, Athenry, Tuam or Portumna - one could go to on an app on one's phone; one could then subdivide into different categories - food, drapery, whatever it might be - and each retailer in the town could plug into the app and place its own shopfront on it.  I do not think individual retailers have the time, expertise or resources at the moment to start setting up individual online businesses as McElhinneys has done.  McElhinneys is a pretty rare case, and I applaud it for what it does.  There are others, such as Calvey's, a little butchers in Achill, in a tiny village on the coast of Ireland.  Its owner sells wonderful lamb all over the world from the back of his shop.  He has developed his brand, and it is an extraordinary business and perhaps an example to others.  Could we develop the idea of a kind of online town marketplace which individual retailers could plug into and begin to access customers such as my son?  My son has no interest in local shops whatsoever.  He is 20 years old, he will be 30 before long, and all of a sudden his activity will become the norm nationally.  We must face this challenge.</p><p>Some of my colleagues spoke about the alcohol Bill.  Deputy Heydon has asked the question already.  How much of a negative impact do the witnesses feel the obligation on them, if it arises, to remove alcohol in their premises completely from public eyes and public display will have on their business?  How much of their current turnover is reliant solely on alcohol?  How much of their remaining turnover is driven by the footfall generated by people who want to buy maybe a bottle of wine on a Friday evening or a few cans of cider on a Saturday?  How impactful do the witnesses reckon it will be on their business if we oblige every retailer, from the most massive multinationals down to the tiniest corner shop, to remove alcohol completely from public display?  I am interested in the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.939" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Fitzsimons" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#X00300"><p>I thank the members for their questions.  I will commence with the Chairman's.  Our digital statistics are pretty depressing.  Of everything bought online in Ireland, 70% comes in from international jurisdictions.  Deputy Cannon referred to online purchases his son makes.  I will say it again.  Irish consumers this year will buy &euro;12 billion worth of goods online, but &euro;560 billion worth of goods will be bought across Europe.  There must be an opportunity there.  McElhinneys may be a one-off, but I am sure we can find 20 such businesses.  McElhinneys is probably the best thing in Ballybofey town as it provides 190 jobs.  I will say it again.  We are prohibited from benefiting from Enterprise Ireland support.  McElhinneys applied and was told it was a retailer and should go away.</p><p>A Minister of State who was involved in jobs suggested he would go up and open the premises and he was told to go away.  This is the rural affairs committee; it is appalling that a small indigenous Irish retail business in rural Ireland is not supported, yet an international company can put a brass plaque up in the IFSC, employ one person and get ridiculous levels of support.  Something has to be done.<br/><br/>Virtual towns might be a good idea but going online is not for everyone.  Some of my members say the only people who make money online are Google and the consultants.  We do not want to lose many people lots of money.  <br/><br/>How many town teams exist is a very difficult question.  There are three business improvement districts in Ireland, which are legal structures to manage towns.  I do not know how many town teams exist.  I am involved in three in Clare.  I will be in Wexford tonight with its town team.  I estimate there are about 50 or 60.  The difficulty with town teams and volunteers, which Deputy Troy will tell the committee following his merited efforts in Mullingar, is that voluntarism only lasts for so long.  There might be a huge meeting of stakeholders and a town plan but it runs out of passion and energy after time.  There is a necessity for local authority support.  We did well in Limerick with 40 new stores because the county CEO, Conn Murray, appointed a town co-ordinator, a young guy who ran around the city and told everyone what was going on and got everyone behind the plan.  <br/><br/>Brexit is a serious issue.  We were promised a Brexit proofed budget but from a retail perspective, we did not see that.  We have to be careful about how we comment because we do not want to accelerate the problem but there is significant activity going up North.  Online <i>.co.uk</i>retailers are reporting a 500%, 600% or 700% increase in demand.  We are facing a crisis.  We would have loved a reduction of the 23% VAT that was introduced as a financial emergency.  It is now time for another financial emergency to reduce it back.  We are price non-competitive.  There is little we can do as retailers.  We would also like to see a revision of the employer PRSI for low paid workers from 8.5% to 4.25% because those jobs are vulnerable.<br/><br/>The final question was on the vacant site tax.  We recommend the immediate compulsory purchase of any building of a particular size within the inner core that is not being used by the property owner.  There should be a compulsory purchase order at discount by the local authority and it should be put to good use.  It could be split into smaller units and we could go off and get Penneys, or whichever is the brand of the day, to open up.  Having these vacant and derelict sites in the middle of towns is not good enough.  <br/><br/>Deputy Heydon asked about Kildare.  There were many bad planning decisions made over time.  One in Naas was extremely bad - it involved an out-of-town big box retailer who invested less than 5% of its turnover in staff while the guys down the town invested over 15% of their turnover in staff.  The Minister of the day cut the ribbon on that premises but I knew, as people in the town did, that there was a net jobs loss to the town that day.  We need to apply the sequential test which means telling that brand and others that they have to go into the town, split up the offer and put the food, alcohol or fashion into a smaller box.  The sequential test must apply.  It is hard to compete with out-of-town free parking and all that kind of stuff.<br/><br/>There was a question on beautification.  The biggest property developer in the world said at a conference recently in New York that all his money and that of his peers is going into urban renewal.  I thought that was great.  He said he is building a beautiful civic place that has seating and waterfalls and is architecturally beautiful.  If a commercial offer is built around that, people will come.  This is not just about commerce.  It is about having a place that people can gather, dwell and communicate.  The future of retail is human-to-human, where people can talk to people.  In the context of pedestrianisation, which Deputy Cannon raised, and some of the issues the Chairman raised, the future is in rethinking towns and having a town centre that is beautiful where people can congregate and breathe.  A commercial offering and car parking should be built around that.  We need to rethink towns commercially because the future is young people going online.  Potentially towns will become places where evening economies are way more important in terms of hospitality and all that kind of stuff.  It will be a bit like continental Europe which has huge protections for SME retailers.  In France, the local Carrefour cannot sell tobacco, bread and lots of other things.  That would protect all these small indigenous businesses in the town centre.<br/><br/>Deputy Cannon asked about rates.  One of the worst things ever to happen in rates in Ireland was the revaluation of places in towns and villages.  The revaluation rethought how rates work and it linked rates to rent in local authority areas.  The higher rent payers paid more rates but who are the higher rent payers?  They are the businesses in town centres.  The rates of the secondary and tertiary business parks, the local printer's way out the road and the hotels, went way down.  If we are serious about towns, there is something wrong if we go and double the rates in town centres.  <br/><br/>What Deputy Cannon said about the rates incentive is brilliant.  It is illegal so it is not actually a rates incentive; it is a grant equivalent of fixtures and fittings.  It is a great idea which we have promoted in about 30 or 40 different places.  It has worked in Ennis, where I live.  Our economic development director went out with a booklet to talk to retailers about the rates break that was announced.  The most important thing is that it should only apply to retail mixed uses, which we need.  We have enough coffee, bookmakers, and charity shops.  What are we missing?  The Deputy's 20-year-old son will tell him what we are missing.  We are missing Tiger, Nando's, Pandora, H&amp;amp;M, and all the go-to brands.  If we can get them into our towns of a certain size, young people will come in and enjoy it.</p></speech>

I can tell the Chairman about the practical experience in my shop.  We have four full-time staff and seven part-time staff, which is a total of 11 people.  I have made representations to Deputy Heydon about this on occasion.  People are inclined to dismiss part-time staff but our part-time staff are secondary school and third level students.  When they have been with us for a couple of weeks, I bring them in and sit them down.  They are very happy to have some extra pocket money, are less of a drain on their parents and are able to contribute.  What I always say is the biggest attribute of working in Kelly's newsagents is they will learn how to work.  This is not something they will learn in secondary school or even in third level.  They will be taking instruction from supervisors and when they have been with us for a couple of years, they may be working with one other member of staff who is junior to them.  They will be handling significant amounts of money.  They will be dealing with members of the public, 95% of whom are the salt of the earth, but they will also be dealing with people whose circumstances at home mean they are hard to deal with.  These are all things that will stand them in good stead, whether they become a nurse, a bank official, a teacher or whatever.  That is the true essence of employment in a small retailer.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Martyn to address the question on structural separation because it affects her directly.</p><p>As I am president and it is a burning issue for many of our members, I am fully up to date with its implications.  Three of the committee members mentioned it, so Ms Martyn will deal with it.</p><p> The Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, CSNA, represents a broad group of retailers.  We represent urban, city, small and large stores.  Deputy Cannon and Deputy Danny Healy-Rae would be aware that symbol groups, such as SuperValu, Centra, Spar or the like, are not actual multiples.  The stores are mainly family owned stores that avail of a central purchasing and advertising policy.  These are all people who come under the committee's umbrella, particularly the rural element.  As I said in my opening remarks, the committee is very favourably disposed towards small retailers.  Deputy Cannon mentioned car parks, which is very good.  The members referred to rates.  From 2007 or 2008 private business people were supporting the local authorities with rates.  This year Kildare County Council introduced its first increase for a couple of years.  We do not avail of any grants.  We are self-sufficient, industrious and provide employment.  All we ask from the Government is that it does not put obstacles in our way or increase the amount of red tape and regulation we must deal with.  We do not have the backroom office staff to deal with all of these matters, unlike the bigger enterprises.</p><p> The Chairman asked what grants we would need.  If he and his committee could roll back some of the impositions of Government, we would be very grateful.  As I said, we are industrious, self-reliant entrepreneurs.  That is all we require from the committee.  I thank the members for their time.</p></speech>

I am from Mountrath, County Laois.  The members probably know the town because they will have travelled to Limerick from Dublin.  It has been bypassed now so we probably do not see any of the members there anymore, but they are welcome to visit at any time.  I will talk about the structural separation for alcohol, but all of the issues raised in terms of rates, town degradation, parking and so forth have affected Mountrath in a big way.  The town is now left with probably six or seven functioning businesses, where previously it was very progressive.  The town was a bottleneck because there was so much traffic and so many lorries travelling through it.  I am talking about rural degeneration.  I was born and reared in that town.  My parents had a business there since 1950 and reared six children there.  There were many families on the street.  We all walked to the local school.  I returned to take over the business and work in Mountrath.  I have three children and they are the only children who walk to school from a street that previously sent 20 or 30 children to school.  This is where we see the demise of the local community.  I am not telling the members something they do not know, as they know all of this.  I applaud what the committee is doing.  We will do what we can to help the committee to examine where we can improve the situation.</p> <p>  However, I will discuss structural separation today.  Deputies Collins, Cannon and Heydon asked about this.  I have a Centra food market.  I am not one of the big multiples.  I pay my bills and buy my stock.  Probably 2% of my sales would be alcohol.  As a retailer, a mother and a member of CSNA, I applaud what the Government is doing to try to change the thinking about alcohol, especially the abuse of alcohol.  We are 100% behind changing attitudes to alcohol in Ireland, particularly because I have children and a retail outlet.  I see what can happen.  However, we strongly oppose section 20.  Deputy Cannon might not be 100% opposed to that section-----</p></speech>

It will not.  That is a fallacy and I do not support it at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.949" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire-Ann Martyn" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016110900002#Z00400"><p>Mountrath had approximately 20 pubs when I first returned home.  It now has four.  We have lost the pub.  We have lost the small corner shops apart from the three that remain now.  I do not expect that removing section 20 will mean I will have more alcohol sales.  I probably will not and I am quite happy with what I have.  However, in response to Deputy Heydon, I am concerned about how it will affect us.  It will affect me because of the mix I have to offer to the consumer.  Somebody referred to the rural base.  I draw all of my customers from the rural base.  Basically, I have two bases - rural and social welfare.  That is the nature of the business in my town.  The mix is that when the guy who is working in the timber business up in the wood is going home from work, he calls to my shop.  He wants four cans, a loaf of bread, milk, cheese or whatever it is for the sandwiches the following day.  He is working all day.  If he calls to my store and he wants four cans, he must either be escorted behind a barrier or it must be opened up to give him the cans.  He is not going to bother with that experience for shopping.  He will say, "This is it".  He will probably call to my store between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. but I have lost the mix that he will purchase.  It will mean that not only am I not selling the alcohol, I am also not selling the other products so I do not need another young person to do the 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. shift.  I cannot afford to pay them if I am not selling the product.  That is what would concern me.</p> <p>  There is a second issue with the mix.  Let us say Deputy Cannon is on his way home from work.  His wife rings and says, "Ciar&aacute;n, so-and-so rang and they are calling over tonight.  Will you pop into Centra and get me two pizzas and a bottle of wine?"  Deputy Cannon calls in to do that.  He must ask for a bottle of red wine.  He cannot go down the aisle and choose it.  There is a theatre attached to buying wine.  A person browses and says, "Well, I had that Italian before and I did not like it."  Instead of that the person will be asked to pull across a curtain and say, "I will take that one."  That will remove the pleasant shopping experience which was referred to, in a different context, as walking around in nice floral squares.  This is the shopping experience when one goes into the Centra in Mountrath, so that would concern me.</p> <p>  I have another concern.  I have space in my store.  My contemporaries, Bosco and Gerard, have stores.  They have two drops of alcohol in their stores.  There is no way they can cordon that off, so it will be curtains and screens.  That will prove unworkable for the retailer.  I am also concerned about the costs involved.  The health and safety issues for somebody who is working behind a closed area in terms of personal injury, slips and falls will increase my insurance costs.  That will become untenable for people, so they will not sell alcohol.  Subsequently, they will not be able to survive in terms of the mix.</p> <p>  In 2009, the Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland, RRAI, voluntary code of practice was introduced.  All of us who signed up to that have been proven to be responsible retailers of alcohol.  That is what I consider myself to be.  I am deeply rooted in the community and I know who should not be sold alcohol.  I know that on the day of the leaving certificate results, one increases the age to 21.  I know the young people.</p><p>We do not serve to the kids who are coming in.  We do not serve it before 10 o'clock.  We have bought into that responsible code of practice.  Asking us to put it behind closed doors almost makes it seem as if it is something we should not be selling.  It is still a commodity.  I appreciate that the committee is under pressure for time.  That is where I am coming from.</p></speech>

I am the CEO of Tourism Ireland which, as members know, is the organisation responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas.  It was established as one of the six areas of co-operation under the framework of the Belfast Agreement of Good Friday 1998.  The principal objectives of the company are to increase tourism to the island of Ireland and to support Northern Ireland to realise its tourism potential.</p> <p>  Tourism Ireland operates in 23 markets overseas and, in delivering its marketing campaigns, the organisation works closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland to ensure our promotional themes overseas align with the development priorities of the industry at home.  It is an integrated collaborative approach. I acknowledge the presence of my colleagues from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and Irish Tourist Industry Confederation.  I propose to give a brief overview on overseas tourism to Ireland and speak about some of the factors that have arisen as a result of the recent Brexit referendum.</p> <p>  The island of Ireland has seen five consecutive years of growth in overseas tourism, and 2015 was a record-breaking year when we welcomed 9.5 million overseas visitors to the island of Ireland, delivering revenue of almost &euro;5 billion.  Growth has continued in 2016.  The latest CSO figures for the Republic of Ireland indicate we have had the best ever January to September period, with figures growing by 12% when compared with the first nine months of 2015.  Visitor numbers to Northern Ireland grew by 8% in the first quarter of 2016, the first period for which official figures are available, and industry feedback points to a record summer season.  We have seen exceptional results from North America, Britain, and mainland Europe this year, with important markets such as Italy, Spain, France and Benelux all recording really strong growth.  Britain is the largest single market for tourism to Ireland, delivering 42% of total overseas visitors and 24% of total revenue.  Other priority markets in terms of visitor numbers and revenue are North America, Germany and France.</p> <p>  In marketing the island of Ireland overseas, a number of important factors are at work.  Policy interventions by the Government, such as the zero rating of the air travel tax and the reduction in VAT on tourism services from 13.5% to 9%, have undoubtedly facilitated the introduction of new air routes, enhanced competitiveness and helped to facilitate the kind of growth we see in overseas tourism today.  Continued investment by the Irish Government and Northern Ireland Executive in tourism experiences such as the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, Dublin, Titanic Belfast and the National Trust's Giant&rsquo;s Causeway visitor centre helps to capture the imagination of overseas visitors from throughout the world and keep Ireland in the international spotlight.</p> <p>  Tourism Ireland has also invested in developing a significant digital footprint in recent years and, increasingly, leverages its strength in digital and social media in all markets.  This has yielded considerable marketing efficiencies and created opportunities with new audiences worldwide.  Our global campaigns reach an audience of up to 700 million prospective visitors through traditional and digital marketing.</p><p>Interest in visiting the island of Ireland has remained high among potential visitors in our top source markets.  Perceptions of Northern Ireland as a place to visit for holidays have improved over time.  While interest in Ireland is currently strong, this cannot be taken for granted in a highly competitive global marketplace in which more than 200 destinations compete for business.</p><p> The recent Brexit referendum has undoubtedly posed challenges in the short to medium term and Tourism Ireland has been actively monitoring the implications for the tourism industry on the island of Ireland.  In terms of the British market, the main factors that arise relate to consumer confidence and competitiveness.  General economic uncertainty impacts on consumer confidence which, in turn, has consequences on demand for travel.  According to Oxford Economics, the number of British people travelling abroad to all destinations is forecast to decline by 2.4% in 2017.  This will undoubtedly have consequences for the island of Ireland.</p><p> Since the referendum, sterling has depreciated by approximately 18% against the euro, which has made the eurozone as a whole more uncompetitive.  Given our dependence on Britain as a source market, Ireland is likely to be more impacted than other European countries.  Also, in the context of the depreciation of sterling against the dollar, the UK has become a very competitive destination for potential visitors from the United States in 2017.  This makes our industry&rsquo;s value for money message more important than ever in our promotions overseas. </p><p> The common travel area between Ireland and the UK is a key priority for tourism.  To give just one example, Northern Ireland has seen strong growth in overseas tourism in the recent years, with 950 international tour operators now programming Northern Ireland as part of the island of Ireland.  A total of 75% of visitors from North America to Northern Ireland and 68% of visitors from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland arrive via the Republic of Ireland.  The future of the common travel area is, therefore, vital for our business.</p><p> The British-Irish visa scheme and the short-stay visa waiver programme have provided a significant boost to our marketing efforts in China, India and the United Arab Emirates.  Tourism Ireland and VisitBritain signed a memorandum of understanding in April 2014 with the aim of working more closely together to promote the island of Ireland and Great Britain as destinations to be visited as part of a single holiday.  In the past two years, the two organisations have worked together to highlight the British-Irish visa scheme in China and India.  China is a key example of a country from which the island of Ireland has seen significant growth in visitor numbers since the advent of the British-Irish visa scheme.  This year, we expect to welcome approximately 50,000 Chinese visitors in 2016, thereby reaching the growth target we set for 2017.  We welcome the announcement last month that the short-stay visa waiver programme is to be extended for a further five years to October 2021.  The ongoing status of the British-Irish visa scheme will require clarification.</p><p> Looking ahead to 2017, Oxford Economics has revised its tourism growth forecasts for the island of Ireland downwards for the fourth time since the Brexit referendum.  It has identified Ireland and Northern Ireland as the destinations most exposed to and impacted by Brexit.  This is a matter that Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and our industry partners will continue to keep under review.</p><p> While Britain will continue to be an important market, Tourism Ireland has in recent years shifted its focus towards mainland Europe and North America as our most important sources of holiday visitors and revenue.  This diversification approach will continue as a strategic priority in our corporate plan for the period from 2017 to 2019.  Looking at growing our share of visitors from further afield, a review of new and developing markets is under way, led by Tourism Ireland and working closely with the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Foreign Affairs and Trade, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and representatives of the tourism industry.  The strategy will focus on marketing and on the training and upskilling that is required for the tourism industry to meet the needs of visitors from these markets.</p><p> I returned this morning from World Travel Market in London, the world&rsquo;s largest travel fair, at which Tourism Ireland and 70 tourism businesses from across the island promoted.  World Travel Market attracts more than 50,000 international travel professionals, with 180 destinations all vying for business.  The environment there points to a very competitive marketplace.  I assure the joint committee that Tourism Ireland and the Irish tourism industry is out there fighting for business for 2017, which will be a challenging year for all of us.  I thank members for the opportunity to present today.  I will be pleased to discuss these matters in greater detail presently.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Paul Keeley, the director of business development at F&aacute;ilte Ireland, who will join me in engaging in the committee's deliberations this afternoon.</p> <p>  Members will be aware that 2016 is something of a record year for Irish tourism.  By the end of the year, we will have recorded close to 9 million tourism visitors during 2016, which is an increase of 11% on last year and of almost 50% on the trough of 2010.  All the key source markets are performing well with many recording double digit rates of growth, as Mr. Gibbons outlined.  Our visitors appear to be very happy with their holiday experiences and over the past five years, our value for money ratings have been climbing to new highs.  Employment in tourism is also increasing, arguably at a faster rate compared with many other sectors of the economy.  This is, in large part, the result of the Government&rsquo;s decision to maintain the applicable VAT rate at 9%.  At a local level, many of our most remote communities have recorded their best tourism season in several years.  Initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way have no doubt significantly bolstered their fortunes and those of many other regions.</p> <p>  Although welcome, success such as this can breed complacency at a time when the horizon for tourism is far from cloudless and calm.  The headline statistics are eye-catching and can easily imply a sector on a growth trajectory and without challenge.  The recent performance of tourism has been greatly fuelled by a benign trading environment, as Mr. Gibbons noted, which is characterised by favourable exchange rates, increased air access and adequate industry capacity to accommodate growth.  This environment is now changing and becoming less certain.  Whether Irish tourism can aspire to greater heights or even consolidate its current position will be very much down to strategies of its own making and, in particular, to how it responds to emerging issues at home and overseas.</p> <p>  At home, we are already experiencing difficulties in accommodating visitors in our more densely populated and most visited urban centres.  The hotel accommodation base in these areas is clocking up high occupancy rates.  Of particular concern is availability in Dublin, which is essentially at capacity for most of the year.  With two of every three visitors expressing a desire to spend at least part of their holiday in Dublin and with supply constraints and value dipping, there are implications for how the Ireland destination may in time come to be perceived in terms of competitiveness.  Our analysis, conducted by Fitzpatrick Associates, indicates a respectable pipeline of planned new hotel projects for Dublin.  Unfortunately, much of this is scheduled for completion in two or three seasons from now.  The way in which the tourism sector and local authorities collectively grapple with this acute shortage over the medium term will be one critical factor in determining how tourism across the country as opposed to only in Dublin will perform in the longer term.  Regrettably, this challenge could be lessened by the potentially potent implications of Brexit. </p> <p>  Irish tourism's high dependency on a single market - Britain - has been well documented and was described very well by Mr. Gibbons.  Prior to the economic downturn, every second visitor to this country travelled from Britain.  In the intervening years, this reliance has been reduced to two in five visitors, which remains uncomfortably high in the context of Brexit.</p> <p>  Within Britain, Ireland is very much perceived as an extension of sorts of its domestic holiday market, competing with Scotland, the Lake District and Cornwall.  The weakening of sterling against the euro dictates that the Republic is now also a much more expensive extension of this market in the minds of potential British visitors.  We are seeing as much from our own recent snapshot of visitor attitudes, which indicates a decline in value for money perceptions among British visitors since the UK voted to leave to the European Union in the summer.  The implications are, therefore, obvious.  Within Ireland, Dublin is likely to be affected most given its relatively high exposure to the outbound city break market from Britain.</p> <p>  While Britain may pull out of Europe, Europe will not pull out of Ireland.  Continental European markets offer the best prospects for a more sustainable growth model for the tourism sector over the medium term.  Many businesses are making solid progress in that area.  With the introduction of euro coinage in 2002, fewer than one quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s visitors came from mainland Europe.  This share has increased risen to 36%, equivalent to almost 3 million visitors.  This represents a doubling of tourist traffic over the intervening period.  Critically, these markets also tend to favour regions outside of Dublin which, unlike the capital, are by no means operating at full capacity for most of the season.  These are also relatively high-yielding markets, which significantly outperform the British market in overall revenue terms.</p> <p>  Markets such as Germany and France are enormous travel markets with tremendous potential for Ireland, yet we still only have a modest share of them.  Therein lies the challenge facing the tourism sector.  The British market is obviously too big to ignore and every effort must be made to ensure that Ireland gets its unfair share, so to speak.  Far-flung emerging markets in Asia-Pacific region also offer some opportunities to Ireland but not necessarily any time soon, given the time required to develop new markets.  It follows, therefore, that a very deliberate and targeted strategy to rebalance the order books in favour of the relatively more lucrative continental European markets must be a major plank in the sector's response to current challenges.  This will mean not only making more marketing investment or doing more of the same, but will also require F&aacute;ilte Ireland to increase investment in a number of areas.</p><p>They include, for example, building sales and marketing capability within businesses ready and willing to diversify and gain a foothold in mainland European markets; enhancing the international appeal and multi-lingual interpretation of visitor experiences and expanding trade distribution channels open to selling Ireland to their clients.  It also means leveraging the potential of brands such as the Wild Atlantic Way which we know are already resonating well in Germany and France.</p><p> The recovery of the tourism industry following the economic downturn has been solid and steady.  Most recently, growth rates have been well in excess of what would be labelled sustainable.  However, much of the growth has been facilitated by external factors which can change quickly.  The weakening of sterling is a case in point.  As we head into more uncertain and potentially turbulent times, we must guard against complacency, so often prevalent in boom times, creeping into the sector.  Growing pains within the accommodation sector at home and the prospect of either a hard or soft Brexit for tourism are wake-up calls to be heeded and acted on decisively.</p></speech>

As a key stakeholder in tourism, we work with our industry partners to ensure there are the right conditions for tourism to grow and prosper, thereby contributing to recovery and job creation in the economy.<br/><br/>Having experienced a very difficult downturn, the tourism industry has seen significant recovery in recent years.  It has been underpinned by a number of important Government policy initiatives such as the 9% tourism VAT rate which has made us more competitive when marketing Ireland internationally.  As members will see from the graphic included in the presentation, Ireland&rsquo;s VAT rate is in line with those in other European countries with which we compete.  Currently, 14 countries have a VAT rate of 9% plus or minus 1%, while 21 countries have a VAT rate at or below 10%.  Only five countries have a VAT rate above 13%.  Other important measures introduced in recent years include the zero rate air travel tax and support for tourism initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East and Dublin - A Breath of Fresh Air which are proving to be an enormous success.<br/><br/>While strong tourism growth in recent years bodes well for the industry, continued growth cannot be taken for granted.  This is an island destination and we face some unique challenges in terms of access and competitiveness.  It is vital, therefore, that we have a tourism strategy in place to delivers sustainable, long-term growth and build on the significant economic benefits already delivered in recent years in every town and county.  We are experiencing substantial additional demand throughout the country for skilled employees.  There are tremendous opportunities to pursue a career in tourism, particularly for young people thinking about their future career choices.  We are working closely with the Government, State agencies and education providers to highlight the career options available and develop sustainable training models for the industry.  For example, we are developing new culinary apprenticeship and traineeship programmes that offer candidates opportunities for progression and professional development.  <br/><br/>Our key policy objectives for the continued development of tourism include growing Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and brand abroad, retaining perceived value for money satisfaction, targeting higher spending visitors, continuously improving tourism product quality and increasing sustainable tourism accommodation capacity.  However, we face a number of significant challenges that need to be addressed, including cost competitiveness issues within the economy, the significant risks associated with Brexit and current insufficient levels of funding for tourism marketing and product development.<br/><br/>On the challenges posed by Brexit, the industry is very dependent on the economic environment of our major source markets and remains vulnerable to external economic shocks.  As witnessed by the United Kingdom&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union, there can be no room for complacency.  Brexit poses a particular challenge, given Ireland&rsquo;s heavy reliance on holidaymakers and business travellers from the United Kingdom which accounts for over 40% of overseas visitors.  Sterling has dropped by over 20% against the euro compared to this time last year and this has resulted in a worrying reduction in the spending power of visitors from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  While it is still too early to predict the full impact Brexit will have on the sector, many tourism businesses are already beginning to see a negative effect.  The vast majority of our members are concerned about the implications of Brexit for their businesses.  An added concern is the potential implications Brexit could have for the free movement of people between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  Any disruption to the current arrangements would be detrimental to the tourism industry.  It is essential that we avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland and that we maintain the common travel area and open airspace with the United Kingdom.  <br/><br/><b></b>On investment in tourism marketing and product development, the international tourism industry in which we operate is exceptionally competitive and Ireland fights hard for every visitor and tourism euro earned.  Tourism demand is constantly evolving and as conditions change, we must be ready to respond as an industry.  This requires continuous investment in tourism marketing and product development to ensure our tourism offering keeps pace with global competition.  Tourism has proved to be an excellent investment for the country, with every euro spent in destination marketing by the State resulting in a &euro;34 visitor spend in the country.  A pressing marketing challenge is the need to attract more visitors to the regions.  Reduced marketing budgets have had a negative effect on regional tourism.  The tourism industry continues to experience a three-tier recovery, with Dublin performing strongly, followed by other large urban areas and tourism hot spots.  However, many rural tourism businesses continue to lag behind.  This is further compounded by the disproportionate negative impact seasonality has on regional tourism.  It is time to increase funding for the tourism agencies.  Current low levels of investment cannot be sustained without putting our tourism brand at risk and limiting the capacity of the tourism industry to achieve sustainable growth.  A substantial increase in marketing support is required to reduce our over-reliance on the UK market and safeguard future growth in tourism, particularly in the key European and North American markets.  Further progress is needed before the industry reaches its full potential as a major engine for growth and job creation.  Given the right environment, we believe the industry can continue to grow and create a further 40,000 jobs by 2021, in addition to the 50,000 already created since 2011.  However, this requires continued investment and a renewed commitment to ensure tourism will remain at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s economic policy.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to address it.  We look forward to addressing matters members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.970" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#G00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for giving the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, the opportunity to discuss opportunities and challenges for tourism in Ireland.  The ITIC is the representative group for tourism business interests in the country.  Our members include airlines, airports, hotels, attractions and tour operators, as well as the two State tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.<br/><br/>Without dwelling too long on the past, 2016 will mark the third consecutive year of record visitor numbers from abroad - almost 9 million, with record revenues generated of <i>circa</i>&euro;8 billion and, critically, employment numbers in the industry now in excess of 230,000.  This means that over 45,000 new jobs were created in the tourism sector since 2011, 72% of which were created outside Dublin.  No other industry can match that performance, either in absolute numbers or the regional dispersal of jobs.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the support the tourism sector has received from the Government, particularly the suspension of the airport departure tax and the introduction of the 9% VAT rate in 2011.  These were key factors in the recovery of tourism from the collapse in the years 2008 through 2011.  The VAT rate, in particular, reduced costs and allowed the sector to become much more competitive, the benefits of which are clear to see in new jobs growth and the Exchequer returns.  There has been a level of debate about the 9% VAT rate, but it is important to highlight that it puts Ireland on a level playing field with its European neighbours.  As 17 of the 19 eurozone countries have a VAT rate of 10% or less, the rate in Ireland is of the right size and appropriate.</p><p>We have been active in driving more hotel capacity in Dublin and we are strong advocates for a new brand identity for the Shannon corridor to maximise tourism in that area.  The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, has worked very well and closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland and that collaborative approach has worked well for Ireland.</p><p> As an industry, however, we remain disappointed by the State&rsquo;s lack of investment in tourism with regard to destination marketing funds and product investment funds.  Destination marketing budgets for the promotion of Ireland to overseas markets are down 40% since 2008, while the current five-year capital plan - which is valued at &euro;27 billion - only allocates &euro;106 million to tourism investment.  These two areas need to be addressed as a matter of urgency as otherwise, Irish tourism will not be able to realise its potential.  ITIC is also of the view that the State&rsquo;s ten year strategy, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025 is unambitious and needs to be overhauled.  Only two years into that plan, its targets have nearly been met already so clearly the plan was far too conservative.</p><p> Tourism is a cyclical business and frequently subject to external factors over which it has no control such as political unrest, recession or slow growth in key source markets, terrorism or unfavourable exchange rate movements.  The most pressing external factor at the moment which presents a major challenge to Irish tourism is Brexit.  While the tourism sector is performing strongly, analysis carried out by the tourism industry shows that the implications of Brexit could be far-reaching for Irish tourism.  Brexit, as the most pressing external factor, presents big and immediate challenges.  The most obvious challenge from the UK vote to leave the EU has been the sharp weakening of sterling against the euro and the dollar.  Consequently, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has been severely hurt.  We must remember that the UK remains Ireland&rsquo;s largest source market with a 40% volume share.  Never before has the industry or the State needed to remain competitive and lean to protect its market share and to sustain growth.  There is also a strong case to be made for a Brexit fund for Irish tourism to ensure that market diversification can be achieved and that the British market is sustained.  Sterling has weakened by nearly 20% since 23 June.</p><p> In the medium to longer term it is critical that the needs of Irish tourism are recognised in any new EU-UK deal.  ITIC has identified four key areas to protect tourism in Ireland that need to be addressed within EU-UK negotiations, namely, the common travel area, aviation access, regulatory regimes and cross-Border co-operation.  We argue that the common travel area must be maintained and should any border controls be imposed to allow the UK to manage migration, these should be on the British mainland and not on the island of Ireland.  A hard border that limits the movement of people would be unequivocally damaging to Irish tourism.  Likewise, the preservation of the current aviation regulatory regime of open market access for airlines between Ireland and the UK is critical for tourism to prosper.  With regard to the regulatory environment that is negotiated as part of any new EU-UK deal in the wake of Brexit, the Government must be conscious of not disadvantaging tourism businesses in the Republic of Ireland to the benefit of those in Northern Ireland.  Cross-Border co-operation is vital to be maintained particularly in light of all-island agencies such as Tourism Ireland.  Tourism has been well served by an all-island approach to its marketing and promotion and there needs to be a strong commitment to this going forward in any new deal, with appropriate resources allocated.</p><p> Tourism has shown its resilience.  It has recovered strongly and has delivered jobs right across the State.  There is much more growth to realise.  Given a fair wind and continued support from Government it can continue to grow.  As an indigenous sector, tourism is Ireland&rsquo;s biggest and there is simply no other Irish industry with greater further potential.  Tourism industry assets can never be offshored and there will never be equal alternatives to our unique attractions, from the friendly welcome of the people to the brilliant product, and of course the fabulous beauty of our land and seascapes.  Once Ireland remains competitive, pursues the right policies and investment strategies, and counters Brexit as best it can, Irish tourism will continue to prosper and grow.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.973" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1331" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#H00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee today and thank them for their presentations.  My first question is to Mr. Niall Gibbons of Tourism Ireland.  Will Mr. Gibbons provide a breakdown for the committee of the expenditure by Tourism Ireland between Northern Ireland and the South? I would argue that we rely too much on the British market.  Given the decision of the UK to possibly leave the EU, it is now vital that Ireland expands its market base.  What are Tourism Ireland's plans to replace the current dependence upon the UK market with other markets, such as North America, Germany and France?  Perhaps Mr. Gibbons will also elaborate more on Tourism Ireland's participation at the World Travel Market in London last week.  With regard to the British market, Mr. Gibbons stated the main factors are consumer confidence and competitiveness.  I do not agree with this assertion.  I firmly believe that people visit our shores for more reasons than just price competitiveness.  We need to market the reasons why people visit our shores.  We need to concentrate on our strengths and not focus on the perceived weaknesses.  The current situation around currency fluctuations is, in my opinion, only a short-term issue and will bottom out.  I would always urge Tourism Ireland to concentrate on Ireland's strengths when they market us abroad.</p> <p>  I also have a question for Mr. Shaun Quinn of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  He has said that we rely too much on the UK market.  We should have been planning to extend our market base even before the UK decision to possibly leave the EU.  Will Mr. Quinn outline the specific plans F&aacute;ilte Ireland has in place to expand the market base for overseas visitors?  I completely agree with him that Ireland must never become complacent despite the record number of visitors for 2015-16.  I have spoken to people directly involved in the tourism sectors in my constituency in Louth and the last number of years has been outstandingly good.  Areas such as Carlingford and the Boyne site have seen numbers increase substantially.  Apart from Brexit, what does F&aacute;ilte Ireland see as the major challenge facing the tourism industry over the coming years?  As well as challenges, what does F&aacute;ilte Ireland see as the major opportunities for the sector?</p> <p>  My other questions are directed at Mr. Tim Fenn from the Irish Hotels Federation.  He said that one of the major challenges facing the industry is the current insignificant level of funding for the tourism markets and product development.  Perhaps Mr. Fenn will elaborate more on where exactly this lack of funding is taking place.  A common complaint is the lack of available hotel beds, particularly in Dublin.  Can the Irish Hotels Federation quantify exactly the number of additional beds required and where they are required?  Another big complaint I have heard concerns the raising of hotel prices, especially in Dublin, during busy periods.</p> <p>  I also wish to ask a question of Mr. Paul Gallagher from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation.  He said that the Government's ten-year strategy, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025, is unambitious and needs to be overhauled.  Can he outline what, in his opinion, would be a more ambitious and realistic plan and what are the main elements he would see as requiring an overhaul?  I agree with him that the Government must be conscious of not disadvantaging tourism business in Ireland to the benefit of tourism business in Northern Ireland.  Will Mr. Gallagher outline what are the areas of most concern in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.974" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#H00400"><p>I welcome our guests here today.  It is worth noting that tourism is a critical sector in the Irish economy which contributes significantly to the GDP and in the number of people who are employed in the sector.  I acknowledge the positive policy decisions that have been taken by the previous Government in the reduction of air travel tax to zero and the reduction of the VAT rate.  These measures have contributed positively to this sector over the last number of years.  That said, a recurring theme across all of today's presentations to the committee is the challenge posed by Brexit.  I am delighted that each one of the industry representatives has acknowledged that challenge.  When I raised this with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, he did not see Brexit as being a challenge to the tourism industry, despite the fact that 42% of visitors to Ireland come from Britain and that 24% of our tourism sector revenue is generated from that market.</p> <p>  The presentation by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation outlined how much of a reduction there has been in tourism funding over the years and that the reduction did not stop this year.  In the last budget, we have once again experienced a further cut to the funding for marketing and promotion of tourism.  Compare this with the UK; only a couple of months ago it put together a &pound;40 million fund for the Discover England campaign.</p><p>We are competing with it.  It is also considering how it can improve its visa system and apprenticeship programmes.  It is our nearest neighbour and, make no mistake about it, given the favourable exchange rates between the United Kingdom and the United States, it will try to attract those we have been attracting heretofore.  In that regard, does Tourism Ireland consider we are adequately funded to conduct a serious marketing campaign in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as to diversify in other destinations?  In its contribution F&aacute;ilte Ireland stated far-flung emerging markets offered some opportunities but not necessarily any time soon as they required time to develop.  Why have we not been developing these new markets before now?  Why are we waiting for Brexit to occur before looking to develop new markets?  When 42% of the industry is focused on one country, anyone would know that we should be looking wider afield.</p><p> Tourism Ireland has stated the ongoing status of the British-Irish visa scheme requires clarification.  Exactly what clarification is required?  I would have thought Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland would be well aware of how the scheme is administered and the criteria that apply to it.</p><p> Reference was made to capacity in large urban areas.  It is a serious issue, but are being told today that it will not be dealt with for at least two to three seasons.  What will be done in the meantime?  Is there a plan to move some of those coming to Dublin into the regions?  I represent the midlands region which includes Longford and Westmeath.  Hoteliers, bed and breakfast accommodation providers and restaurant proprietors tell us there is an upturn  - that is not doubted - but it is nothing compared to that in urban settings.  What is being done to ensure people will move further?</p><p> I understand F&aacute;ilte Ireland's responsibility is to market within Ireland and provide funding for critical pieces of infrastructure and the improvement of tourism attractions, while Tourism Ireland's responsibility is to market internationally.  One of the delegates spoke about the quality of the experience of visitors to the country.  Promoting Ireland's Lakelands brand is a key commitment in the programme for Government and I understand a tender has been accepted.  Will the counties included in the Ireland's Ancient East initiative benefit from the promotion of the new Ireland's Lakelands brand?  When will the brand be ready?  Is F&aacute;ilte Ireland happy with the level of funding it has received to support applications for large-scale projects?  I understand the process is ongoing and that a decision will emanate shortly.  </p><p> Hotel and restaurant proprietors tell us that there is a critical shortage of chefs and front of house staff.  This matter used to be dealt with by Bord F&aacute;ilte and the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training, CERT.  There seems to be an abdication of responsibility by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in ensuring there is a sufficient number of qualified staff to work in the industry.  What are its plans to ensure programmes are in place to support those who want to work in the sector?</p><p> In terms of hotels, we are at full capacity in Dublin which is to be welcomed, but this is contributing to other problems.  Again, are we pricing ourselves out of the market?  Will we become uncompetitive?  There is full occupancy, particularly at certain times of the year.  Hoteliers who admittedly have had a number of lean years are coming back and using this as an opportunity to compensate for the losses incurred during the lean times, but we cannot return to a situation where Dublin is known as a high-cost place to visit.  How is the housing crisis feeding into the issue?  Various councils in Dublin are using hotel space to house homeless persons.  Those who are homeless have to be looked after, but is it having a knock-on effect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.976" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#J00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I have a couple of questions.  </p> <p>  One of the delegates referred to a three-tier recovery, with Dublin faring best.  The focus on promoting tourism in the regions does not seem to be sufficient.  We have the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East, but the benefits of these initiatives are not trickling down to places outside the main urban settings.  Certain areas along the east coast are not getting sufficient tourists, given what they have to offer.  They do not seem to be have the same priority in marketing.  They are all lumped into the one package, but, thus far, there appears to have been little focus on certain areas.</p> <p>  Particularly in the light of Brexit, although I would have imagined work would have been initiated prior to it, what plans are in place to include the west coast in the North as part of the Wild Atlantic Way and its east coast in Ireland's Ancient East and at what stage are they?  What particular areas in the North have been incorporated into Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way?  </p> <p>  Reference was made, in the light of Brexit, to the need for a targeted strategy for continental Europe, although I presume that would have been the case.  What programmes and marketing strategies are in place?  Aside from marketing, what else has happened so far?</p> <p>  We are all aware that hotel beds in Dublin are in short supply, particularly during the summer months in the height of the tourist season.  Everyone knows that the prices charged for the few beds that were available were extortionate.  What measures is the industry taking to ensure Dublin will remain affordable and, more importantly, competitive?  The overcharging for beds seems to be a real bone of contention.  What are the occupancy figures for 2016?  Can we get a breakdown?</p> <p>  In the light of Brexit, what other plans are in place to promote tourism?</p><p>It will be more or less affected depending on whether it is a hard or soft Brexit.  Mr. Gallagher's opening statement referred to the State's "People, Place and Policy" document as unambitious.  What is his own vision?  The Irish Hotel Federation said there were 230,000 people employed in the tourism industry.  Is it possible to get a breakdown on those figures?  Are they part-time or temporary positions?  They are impressive figures but it would be useful to see if they are seasonal jobs or whatever.</p><p> As it is my local area, I am going to raise it.  We talk about regional tourism and focus.  The Boyneside trail is a huge programme with great potential for tourism along the east coast from Mornington.  They hope to stretch it eventually to the Border where it is met.  At the minute, Mornington to Drogheda is envisaged.  An application has been made to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for capital funding and, to the best of my knowledge, approval has not yet been forthcoming.  If inroads are to be made into regional tourism, that is exactly where one starts.  With projects like that, one can guarantee that one will bring tourists and revenue in.  There are a couple of other issues locally of which F&aacute;ilte Ireland is aware.  While I contacted it several months ago, I did not get any response with regard to St. Laurence's Gate in Drogheda.  The gate is of huge historical significance and is already a tourist attraction.  However, it is in need of refurbishment to open it to the public.  One has to keep chasing things like this.  It comes back to my initial question about focusing.  If F&aacute;ilte Ireland is focusing, why is progress so slow in these areas, sites and projects of huge tourism potential?  Perhaps, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has the answers.  It could be funding.  Given the set up for the Wild Atlantic Way and the Ancient East, one would imagine that F&aacute;ilte Ireland would be more on top of it at this stage.  On funding for projects that are proven tourist attractions, what is the hold up in funding, promoting and resourcing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.978" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1424" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#K00200"><p>I will try to be brief.  Most of the questions have been asked by other speakers.  I congratulate the witnesses.  It is not too often that people come into these committee rooms with a good story to tell.  The industry came from a difficult situation where it faced huge challenges five or six years ago with the downturn in the economy.  The 9% VAT rate has certainly been a help, but most of the witnesses are self-employed and have gone out there to put huge funding into their own businesses.  It is a very good news story but we cannot be complacent.  That is why we are here today with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the other witnesses to work together to build a brand and add more value.</p> <p>  There are two or three different issues on which I want to ask questions.  Nobody has talked about Airbnb.  People are saying that it is taking over and has affected the homeless.  It has taken a lot of apartments out of the system, but I am certain that if it was not available - in Dublin especially - we would have lost a lot of the tourists coming in.  It is building up that capacity which is vitally needed.  It is an issue on which I ask the witnesses to comment.</p> <p>  The Office of Public Works, OPW, has huge swathes of property around the country.  It is a typical public body in that it sometimes fails to think outside the box.  I see it in my own town where &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million has been put into the abbey yet the OPW closed the bloody thing down three or four weeks ago without telling anyone on the ground.  These are things that should not happen.  I remember a few years ago trying to get permission to take photographs for weddings.  Are the witnesses getting co-operation from these State-owned facilities and from State employees?  If they are not, I would like to put it out from the committee that they should do a lot more.  While a lot has changed, they sometimes lack the capacity to think outside the box the way the industry has done.</p> <p>  I see it myself that it is a problem to get the tourists out of Dublin and down the country.  It is the same to Belfast and is a problem all over the world.  If they go to London, it is hard to get them out to the regions.  Mr. Joe Dolan is here from Carrick-on-Shannon.  What has happened there has been incredible.  It is a small town of 4,000 people which is boxing way above its weight.  There is capacity in apartments and hotels; the whole lot.  It is a brand and is our regional town.  I was chair of Lough Key Forest Park Action Group before I came into politics many years ago.  We received co-operation from the local authority and Coillte because the latter was not allowed to drawn down from the European Regional Development Fund.  It was my idea to bring the local authority on board and it was a joint approach.  We got control of the park and set up a company called Moylurg Rockingham Limited.  It has been very successful with 50 or 60 people employed and the local authority earned &euro;200,000 from it last year.  Are there other projects like that?  This was seen in south Longford with Centre Parcs is coming on board.  Are there more projects we can do, where semi-States do not have the expertise or cannot draw down the funding or think outside the box?  Can we look at those again with local authorities?</p> <p>  I live in a town beside Lough Key Forest Park.  We had two hotels but now have no hotel.  We missed the building of the hotels where there were property speculators building houses and hotels.  Most of them did not make money and the banks have taken them over and sold them off cheaply.  It has probably been a huge problem for hoteliers because it is a non-level playing field where NAMA or the banks are paying for these hotels.  We are in a town now with no hotel.  It is the same in Ballaghaderreen, Castlerea and other small towns.  If we want to get tourists into those areas, we will need hotels.  However, nobody will build a hotel now because one can buy one ten miles up the road.  Is there anything the Government could do by way of a tax incentive or a block grant?  There could be only 15 or 20 of these towns in the country but if they do not get a flagship hotel, they will not survive.  Do Mr. Gibbons or Mr. Dolan have any ideas as to what they would do to address that if they were in government?</p></speech>

All of the points have been raised in the submissions and everybody is singing from the same hymn sheet on the 9% VAT rate, the aviation regulation framework and tourism promotion such as the Titanic Experience and Ireland's Ancient East.  The only flaw I see across the way is that I am looking at six men.  It is ironic in this day of equal opportunities in employment that the females seem to have stepped aside.</p><p>The issue I ask about is Brexit about which every economic sector in Ireland is worried.  We are all up in the air at the moment.  Do the witnesses have plans in place whether the UK goes the hard or soft route?  We do not know when it will kick in because of the court case issues in Britain.  However, the public has made its call and there will be some kind of Brexit.  That has been even more affirmed because of the Trump victory in America.  One gentleman made the point that a Brexit fund should have been put in place in the recent budget for the tourism sector.  However, as Deputy Troy said, there was actually a cut in funding from the Government to the tourism sector.</p><p> Another good point was made about Airbnb, about which there is fierce talk and the conflict in terms of apartments which used to be rented.  I am not in favour of abolishing it.  It is very wanted.  I experience it myself as a Deputy from down the country who finds it a nightmare to get a hotel room in Dublin.  When will the industry sort out capacity and, more importantly, pricing in the hotel sector in the capital itself?  The industry is aware that the IRFU is touting big time for the Rugby World Cup to be hosted North and South.  Is the industry confident that it will have the bed capacity available in that period to carry the major influx we would expect then?</p><p> In the last number of years, there was a major drive by local authorities to operate their own tourism initiatives.  Are the witnesses happy with the way they are going?  Are they doing a good enough job?  I sat on Cork County Council and we had our SPC.  It is all about funding at the end of the day.  Are the witnesses happy that tourism through the local authority mechanism is working correctly?</p></speech>

To all of them I say "Well done" whether in the State agencies, industry bodies or businesses in playing their part in such a huge increase in numbers in the last four years.  Funding is an issue, as has been pointed out.  Funding was outside everyone's control four and five years ago because the money simply was not there.  Supports had to be given in a different way at that time which is where the reduction in VAT and travel tax came in.  Tourism can be supported by more than just direct funding.  It can be supported by some of the measures which were taken at that time.  The witnesses have all referred to competitiveness and value for money, which was a major attraction for people.  That is changing and has changed over the last couple of years in particular.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses enlarge on their previous answers to the following question?  Is there now a greater opportunity for a greater spread of tourists throughout the country?  Are there any figures?  Mr. Quinn said that people want to come to Dublin, which is fair enough, but if the large urban areas are at bursting point, is there something we can do?  I note the Wild Atlantic Way and targeted marketing.  While it was a slow boil, it was wonderful.  The facilities in rural areas now are way ahead of what they were three or four years ago with the greenways and everything else.  Is there an opportunity for more emphasis on the value for money that can be obtained in rural areas or along the west coast in general?  Are there figures to show the number of tourists coming directly to Ireland who do not come through Dublin?  Dublin has been the big story, but I am interested to hear about Knock and other airports.  Knock has grown over the last number of years and there are also Shannon and Cork Airports.  What is the potential there to bring people into the places that can benefit the north west, Carrick-on-Shannon and other areas?  Is there potential there?  Can it be addressed?  When we think of going abroad to particular countries, we think of going to the capital.  Surely, however, it is the job of everybody involved in tourism to educate people that there is better value for money in other parts of the country.</p> <p>  I will not go over the questions that have already been asked on Brexit, but is there any comment on what happened yesterday in America regarding the stock market and the weakness of the dollar?  Is that going to be another obstacle for 2017?  Is there a danger that the growth we have seen from North America could be affected as well as the British tourism market?</p> <p>  I ask all the witnesses for suggestions as to what can be done by the Government.  Funding has been mentioned.  I also ask the witnesses what they can do.  The State agencies will implement Government policy but what will the Irish Hotel Federation and the industry in general do that will ensure the continued growth in tourist numbers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.982" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1394" speakername="Ned O'Sullivan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#L00300"><p>I apologise for arriving late.  I welcome the witnesses and commend everyone involved in one of the success stories of the economy.  As a Kerryman, I note the huge importance of tourism to my county.  I am sure the witnesses are well aware of the recent launch of the Kerry county tourism strategy plan, which is fantastic.  I was at the launch in St. John's in Listowel.  The document is a template for other local authorities nationally.  Our CEO, Moira Murrell, and her team have involved all the players, including hoteliers, restaurateurs and those involved in tourism transport.  Everyone has pulled together, which is what it is all about in tourism.  It is about a co-operative effort.  Like every other county, Kerry will look for its fair share of grant aid, but Kerry people in tourism are proven to be prepared to muck in themselves.  They put their money, time and effort up.  The launch was a wonderful occasion and I would like to see it replicated nationally.</p> <p>  I have a bit of a bugbear on an issue that this may not be the forum to address.  However, I am not a member of the agriculture committee.  A delegation from Horse Racing Ireland recently attended the committee.  I am a fan of horse racing which is huge for the tourism economy.  I would like to see F&aacute;ilte Ireland interface to a greater extent with Horse Racing Ireland on the best way to maximise our racing industry from a tourism point of view.  Horse Racing Ireland has a particular focus on its own work, but there is a wider picture out there in and around racing, whether it is the major festivals at Punchestown, Galway and Listowel, or the classic meetings.  One thing has bothered me.  Listowel has a long-established racing festival.  It is over 150 years old and the seven-day meeting draws huge money and visitors into Kerry during the shoulder season.  At the tail-end of that week last year, Horse Racing Ireland put on a flagship flat programme in Dublin at Fairyhouse and Leopardstown with prize money of over &euro;1 million on each day.  The whole attendance there would not equal the attendance on the big day at Listowel, which is the Wednesday on which the Kerry national is run.  While I am in the wrong forum, I plead with tourism interests to get hold of Horse Racing Ireland to see if it can get the overall picture.  It is not all about horses, but about the economy also.  Perhaps, that is something that could be taken up.</p> <p>  Another issue that I am sure has been mentioned is Dublin's hotel capacity and pricing.  We are in danger of destroying tourism in the city.  There is a Rod Stewart concert coming up on Friday week, which I know because my wife is a fan.  I am lucky in that regard because I have an apartment in Dublin.</p><p>However, I know lots of people from the country who must stay as far away as Portlaoise as they cannot get accommodation closer to Dublin.  There is something wrong with such a situation.  The availability of Airbnb accommodation hides the problem.  If this matter develops into a planning situation down the line then it will give the hoteliers a bigger stronghold. </p><p> The impact of Brexit on tourism has been mentioned.  From our experience in Kerry the British tourist, in particular, is a good spending tourist who loves Ireland, its fishing and camping.  I hope there is a Brexit strategy and I ask the witnesses to address the matter.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.984" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1318" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#M00200"><p>I wish to note Mr. Gallagher's comments on the investment in destination marketing and production.  The figure is serious.  There might have been more investment had results not been so good over the past number of years.  The topic stood out in terms of the presentations made here.</p> <p>  What ideas do the witnesses have for winter tourism?  I come from County Kerry so I know that in parts of the county, excluding Killarney, tourism ceases for the months of October to April.  There is great capacity to improve tourism during these months.  What can we do about tourism at such times?  Can we do more from an ethics point of view?  Can we do more to market Ireland internationally as a destination for winter tourism?  Kerry has spectacular scenery in the wintertime.  Standing on Slea Head looking at the Atlantic Ocean in January is more invigorating and exciting than in July.  The view is spectacular and amazing.  Also, in winter one has quiet pubs.  One can see more of the real Ireland in the off-season than in peak season.  Can we do more to create employment all year around and sustainable industries in the off-peak season?</p> <p>  Rural pubs form an important part of the tourism product.  Are the witnesses concerned about them?  A lot of quiet Irish pubs seem to be struggling, particularly the ones that do not provide food and simply sell cheese and onion crisps and Pink Snack bars.  Such pubs do not benefit from the 9% rate of VAT.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on the matter.</p> <p>  Does Tourism Ireland plan to invite President-elect Trump to Ireland?  A high-profile visit would boost the US market.  I share the concerns that have been expressed about the potential volatility of the US dollar.  I call on Mr. Gibbons to commence.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.985" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Gibbons" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#M00300"><p>A few issues overlap and I shall try to address all of them.<br/><br/>I have just come back from the World Travel Market and 70 companies travelled from here in preparation for the 2017 season.  As many as 180 countries competed against us.  In attendance were 50,000 tourism professionals and 3,000 international media so it was a large showcase.  One of the most interesting presentations we received was from the United Nations World Tourism Organization.  It pointed out that in the first nine months of this year the number of tourist trips around the world had reached 1 billion in nine months, which is up on last year.  Interestingly, the number of trips to Europe has increased by 2%.  Central European countries like France, Turkey and Belgium have been decimated by the tragic events that have happened over the past 12 months.  The big winners in Europe this year have been Spain, Portugal and Ireland.  All of this has led to a situation, over the past number of years, where we have talked about market diversification.  We embarked on market diversification as part of our strategy for 2014-16.  That meant spending a smaller amount of money but a bigger proportion of a smaller spend in North America and mainland Europe.  It brought us to a situation where at the end of last year, the tourist spend from Britain last year was up 9% to under &euro;1.4 billion to the island of Ireland; the USA's spend last year was up 27% to just short of &euro;1.3 billion; and mainland Europe was up 20% to &euro;1.7 billion.  In the past number of years we have identified a series of countries where we have the capacity to grow real holiday revenue.  I refer to countries like Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Benelux and the Nordic countries.  The initiative has paid dividends for us.  The spend by European tourism now to the island of Ireland is well in excess of the tourism spend by British visitors.  This year it is possible that the spend by people from North America may pip Britain at the post at the end of the year but that remains to be confirmed.  For the past three years we have undertaken the diversification strategy and we will continue it for the next number of years. <br/><br/>Approximately 30% of our funding comes from the Northern Ireland Executive and directly from Stormont and 70% comes from the Irish Government.  We have a board comprised of six members from each jurisdiction who approve our business plan.  We are finalising the business plan at the moment.<br/><br/>We shall face a number of challenges in the next three years.  We do not have full clarity on our funding because the Stormont Administration works on a different fiscal year.  We have the practicalities of the fallout from Brexit.  This is because we get a surplus amount of sterling from Northern Ireland - we do not need to use it all in the UK - and because of the collapse of sterling versus the dollar, we already are down &euro;1 million in our marketing spend next year because of sterling currency movements since Brexit.<br/><br/>In respect of the Brexit plan, I want to distinguish between a marketing plan and what has happened arising from Brexit.  There are economic situations that have arisen from Brexit over which we have no control.  Such economic uncertainty gives rise to consumer uncertainty and casts doubt on whether people will travel next year.  Oxford Economics advises us on these matters.  It has told us that the British this year will take about 65 million trips abroad and it is likely to be 2.5% less next year.  Also, the island of Ireland is more exposed because we depend more on the British market than other European markets.  It is entirely possible that we may see a reduction in the number of British tourists visiting here next year.As sterling has moved by between 18% and 20%, it makes the eurozone as a whole more competitive and, thus, poses pricing challenges for 2017.<br/><br/>There are other factors.  I do not know how the Brexit ball will bounce.  I do not know what direction factors such as the common travel area and visas will take until after Article 50 is triggered and negotiations take place.  These factors will not influence whether people visit here.  The real factors are how easily people can get here.  Every week during the summer months people can avail of 237,000 airline seats provided by eight airlines to fly to Ireland and there are 50,000 car spaces on the ferries.  We will continue to promote how easily people can travel here.  We will also continue to promote shoulder season festivals and events.  <br/><br/>Members have asked what will happen post-Brexit and I shall give an example.  The actor, Richard E. Grant, visited here in the autumn because Tourism Ireland is using him in a campaign to highlight Ireland to 5.5 million culturally curious customers who listen to Smooth Radio.  Recently the Lonely Planet travel organisation announced that the Skellig Ring is its destination of choice for 2017.  That aspect was well on show at the World Travel Market over the past three days.  We have targeted the 1.9 million readers of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>over the past number of weekends as they are right in our target market.  This week, Dublin features on the front page of <i>Time Out</i>magazine, which is timely coverage as it coincided with the World Travel Market.<br/><br/>In terms of online coverage, Tourism Ireland is the third largest tourism agency in the world on Facebook with 3.6 million fans and we are second largest in the world on Twitter and YouTube.  This allows us to pump out messages all through the year, both nationally and regionally, on what is on and what there is to see and do.  Such work continues.  An awful lot of good and positive activity is taking place and I do not want it to be overshadowed by the Brexit debate.  We will have to see how the debate pans out.  For the consumers choosing where to holiday next year, it still will be easy to get here.  We must make sure that we offer them good value for money and we must continue to invest in the marketplace.  <br/><br/>We are concerned about our share of voice, which has been in decline in all of our main markets over the past four years due to lower levels of investment.  Ireland's ranking as a destination choice has been in decline for the past five years because of reduced investment in the marketplace.  That is a concern for us but we will continue to make the case for additional funding. <br/><br/>A clarification was sought on the visa scheme.  Two visa schemes are in operation that were launched in the past number of years.  First, the UK short-stay visa waiver programme allows visitors from approximately 15 Asian countries who enter the UK and clear immigration to travel to Ireland with no additional visa requirement.  The initiative has been extended to 2021, which is terrific news for us in marketing Ireland abroad.<br/><br/>Second, the British-Irish visa scheme has operated in China and India for the past two years.  The scheme is being review by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality and we are liaising with them.  The sooner we can get clarity on the future of the scheme the better because it has given us a great platform, along with our colleagues in the UK, in markets like China and India.  Let us bear in mind that we compete with the Schengen zone that is comprised of over 25 countries and provides visa and passport-free travel arrangements between all of those countries.  Ireland and the UK are out on their own competing against mainland Europe in the largest outbound travel market in the world.  As many as 130 million Chinese people will travel abroad this year with perhaps only 50,000 of them travelling to Ireland.  <br/><br/>On the point as to why we were not doing this work before, I can confirm we have been doing it for the past 15 years.</p><p>The bottom line is that Ireland does not have a brand presence in all of these markets.  We work very closely with agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia and Departments such as the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality.  We work as a member of Team Ireland.  We are in competition with other large-scale destinations such as the United States.  Brand USA was launched in recent years and ten year visas are now offered in China.  Japan also offers ten year visas in China, whereas we tend to offer single entry visas for a period of between three months and two years.  One has to look at the competition.  We need a marketing strategy to ensure our enterprises are "China ready" in terms of the language, its food and customs.  There are people who are doing really good work in that regard, including in the Guinness Storehouse and Trinity College Dublin.  We must be serious about our level of investment in these countries against that of our competitors.  </p><p> I will touch on the regions, but I acknowledge our colleagues in F&aacute;ilte Ireland will have much to say about them also.  There has been a great deal more activity in the tourism sector in the regions in recent years.  Initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East have given us critical mass in the international marketplace, but it is very difficult to cut through with small-scale messages.  One needs projects of international size and scale.  New festivals and events such as the Bram Stoker Festival and the New Year's Eve celebrations, anything that is off peak, have been really good for us.  As we are very keen to collaborate with airlines that drive access to the regions, we have conducted many campaigns with Kerry, Shannon, Knock and Waterford airports which provide access from point to point regions in Great Britain.</p><p> We have seen a significant level of activity in European markets, in which we are using a large proportion of our reduced budget.  We have completed market reviews of all our main markets in Europe, in conjunction with our colleagues in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Northern Ireland and the industry.  We have completed market reviews in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Benelux countries, as well as the Nordic countries, in which markets we have seen spectacular growth.  Ten years ago visitor numbers from Germany were about 300,000; this year they well exceed 600,000, although it has to be said our market share is less than 1%.  There is great potential to drive regional holiday business, as these visitors stay in hotels and will hire cars.  Last year 3 million Europeans visited the island of Ireland, an increase of 16%.</p><p> Airbnb has provided a safety valve in Dublin where there has been congestion, with price and availability being the biggest risks in satisfying future demand.  It is a small component of the overall tourism mix.</p><p> We have liaised with the Office of Public Works and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I am sure my colleagues will comment further on the OPW, but we are seeking to exploit what we call secondary sites, places such as Skellig Michael which can only take 180 people a day.  However, there are great opportunities at other OPW sites around the country.  We recently had a meeting with it to discuss the matter.</p><p> On the events of last night, the economy will be the most significant determinant in terms of how many people will travel to Ireland next year.  We will keep that matter under review.  We have a central marketing partnership group.  In respect of events that affect the industry from an economic perspective, we work very closely with the industry and can adjust and adapt marketing programmes.  We have learned a great deal from what has happened in the past ten years and are adaptable and flexible on the marketing side.  </p><p> We are still confident that we can achieve growth next year.  The level growth forecast in 2017 by tourism economists has been halved in the past seven months, arising from the economic turmoil.  We will, however, continue to keep that matter under review and will still have a very strong marketing programme.  We have a sales force.  About 14 companies are travelling to the west coast of the United States later this week, while a sales mission will leave for Australia and New Zealand.  There is really good engagement by the industry in pushing all of the good reasons people should come to Ireland.  A positive is that we are likely to see at least a 10% increase next year in air capacity from North America, with expansion from both the United States and Canada.  Etihad Airways has announced a twice daily year round service to Dublin and we are also likely to see a small increase in air capacity from mainland Europe.  While there are uncertainties, there are also many positives which we will continue to accentuate throughout 2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.987" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Quinn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#N00200"><p>I will follow up on Mr. Gibbons' comments.  There were a few comments and questions about Brexit, on which the issue is the degree to which we are exposed to the British market.  The diversification strategy in play for some years was about reducing the level of that exposure and, if anything, we were ahead of the game, collectively, in the industry in that we were not caught off the hook.  This year we will receive 3.5 million visitors from Britain, but we will also receive 3 million from elsewhere in the European Union.  Therefore, much progress has been made at a time when, collectively, budgets are down 50% on what they were.  Our job is to look at the product and what we have to offer in working with businesses on the ground.  Our contribution to the strategy has been the experience brands, what we call the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and the Dublin Brand.  I hope we will also have a lakelands brand.  When one enters a market in which one is not well known, promoting Wicklow or Westport on its own will not do it as the county jersey does not mean anything internationally.  One needs projects of scale that resonate with the market.  That is what has happened in the case of the successful Wild Atlantic Way and, to a lesser extent, Ireland's Ancient East.  The Wild Atlantic Way initiative was introduced two or three years before Ireland's Ancient East.  I fully understand Deputy Imelda Munster's point that some local areas are not benefiting, particularly in the east and the south, but the story in the west because of the Wild Atlantic Way is completely different.  We are at the early embryonic stage, but what we are doing is on the right track.  The Wild Atlantic Way runs along the west coast; it is a Gaelic Ireland proposition.  That is why it does not extend along the south or to the North.  Tourism Northern Ireland is in the process of completing a strategy for Northern Ireland and we will be talking to see if there are areas in which we can co-operate in the marketplace in a meaningful way.  My colleague, Mr. Keeley, will deal with some of the points raised.</p> <p>  There are mixed views on Airbnb, but it is meeting a need in a growing segment of the marketplace.  We must recognise that certain consumers want to avail of that product, which is fine.</p> <p>  We have signed a strategic partnership agreement with the OPW with which we have a really great relationship.  We are making headway at a number of sites, principally in the east and south, but we hope to make progress across the board.  I assure Senator Frank Feighan that we are receiving great co-operation in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe mentioned tourism marketing by local authorities.  If it is local, that is fine, but, as I said, the county jersey means nothing internationally.  It is the experience brands in Ireland that resonate.  I do not think we are seeing wasteful investment in that regard.  </p> <p>  Deputy Robert Troy made a number of points, as did Deputy Imelda Munster, about the capital grants scheme.  We have a track record of being efficient in processing capital grant applications.  We run a competitive grants process.  I cannot comment, however, on any individual grant application.  If there is a delay in processing, it is purely due to the sheer numbers of applications submitted.  We received a much higher volume that we had anticipated, but we intend to make the first allocation under the scheme before Christmas.</p> <p>  Let me confirm clearly that there has been no abdication of responsibility on our part in the training of chefs.  We invest about &euro;4 million a year across ten institutes of technology, fuelling upwards of 500 chefs per annum.  In addition, we are working with the Irish Hotels Federation and others in developing a new apprenticeship scheme through SOLAS.  That is the new model through which we believe we will be able to increase turnover.  I am aware of the shortages in some parts of the tourism industry, most notably the restaurant sector, in which apparently there seems to be an unusually high turnover of staff.</p><p>The expert skills group which concluded an analysis on this clearly showed a turnover issue in some sectors.  From my point of view, as a public servant with responsibility for investing taxpayers' money, rather than investing more money in training for people to leave we must improve retention rates.  There is no abdication, in fact we are fully committed to it.  Perhaps Mr. Keeley will speak about the lakelands and winter tourism seasonality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.989" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Keeley" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#O00200"><p>I will begin by linking the issues of regional spread, season extension and diversifying the risk from the British marketplace.  A pretty holistic response is taken to this and Mr. Quinn has already alluded to it.  The first thing we had to try to do was to better inform the international consumer and the international buyer about different flavours of Ireland.  The Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin give three very distinct flavours of Ireland and they have given buyers and consumers a much better sense of what they are being asked to opt into.  We work with Tourism Ireland's teams on marketing these regional propositions on international markets, most specifically in Europe but also in Great Britain because notwithstanding Brexit it is too big a marketplace to just walk away from.  Even in the fourth quarter of this year, part of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's industry budget will be spent through the Tourism Ireland team in the Great Britain marketplace to make sure we stay vigilant.</p> <p>  Approximately 65% of hotel bed nights sold are in the domestic marketplace.  A big challenge we have is working with industry throughout the country to get it geared up to sell internationally.  For small businesses in particular, the complexity and international distribution challenges can be a bit overwhelming.  We work with businesses on the type of consumer the business is best suited to, the markets they are best focused on and the distribution channels which serve them best with regard to getting access to those markets.  A big stream of work for us is working with them on their ability to gear up and deal professionally with international buyers to ensure we are gearing up more and more businesses to get active internationally.</p> <p>  We have a team that works with these businesses.  If we work with businesses on the ground to develop new products and get people out of the traditional hubs, then we must give the international consumer and the international buyer a reason to go to them.  Through the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin we are working on the ground with small businesses to develop new products and new experiences.  We work with them to get these onto the international shop shelf, for want of a better term.  We work through the market teams and international distribution channels to secure distribution for new products.  This includes products such as the Wild Atlantic Way.  This year, we have worked with six groups of industry to develop a seasonal offering that will take us into the winter shoulder and earlier in the spring, but there is little point in bringing out the businesses to work on developing these products if we cannot get them carried by international buyers.  We also take on this work.</p> <p>  It is a full circle of developing new products and new experiences, getting the products to the marketplace, getting more businesses active internationally, building better relationships with international distributors and, last but not least, trying to dial up the advertising tap so if the product is available we begin to create consumer awareness and draw it through.  If we can do this, it is how we will start to generate regional spread.  I can cite any amount of anecdotes about small businesses which perhaps were struggling to get access to the international marketplace but, by virtue of being able to plug into the three brands, have been able to give the international buyer a reason to pull into their site and attraction.  We have seen this in terms of businesses which were part-time and have gone full-time and businesses with two or three people which have added an additional two or three people.  This piece is working.  It is about getting regional and seasonal spread and diversifying across a number of key markets.</p> <p>  A specific question was asked about the lakelands and we are quite excited about this.  It has the potential to be the fourth brand.  As Deputy Troy correctly picked up, we have appointed a consortium to work with us on the project and we have a good mix of skills.  We do not believe the answer is just marketing.  An agency will work with us on brand and product development and an economic consultant will also work with us on this.  Almost inevitably, we will arrive at a product deficit and we will need to make the case for investment.  Having a sound economic argument to back it up will be important.  We also have RedC on board as part of the consortium to work with us to ensure whatever we do is researched thoroughly with the international consumer and international buyer to ensure whatever we bring forward we can have the confidence it has being robustly researched and will stand up in the marketplace.  Specifically, we are looking at the area that lies between Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way.  We are working from 30 km east of the Wild Atlantic Way to 10 km east of the Shannon.  All the counties in Ireland's Ancient East and to the east of the Shannon are being included in the current scope of work.</p> <p>  The starting point is not geography or naming or branding.  The starting point has to be what this part of the world has in terms of product that can excite the international buyer.  The challenge we are set is that it needs to be comparable or better than what is available from the Wild Atlantic Way or Ireland's Ancient East.  We must have a product that is of interest to the consumer.  We must then figure out how to position it and make it attractive and exciting from the perspective of an international buyer.  From there, we will move to branding and naming solutions.  All this is within the scope of work, and we are due to have the final set of recommendations for the project by the end of March next year.</p></speech>

We have been recovering, but our industry, no different from any other part of the economy, is suffering from growing pains.  We speak about capacity and prices in Dublin.  Dublin has 18,900 bedrooms which are sold every night.  During 2015, the occupancy rates in Dublin were 82.2% throughout the year.  This was the highest in Europe, along with London.  At the same time, average room rates in Dublin were the 15th highest in Europe at &euro;112.  This year, our occupancy rates have increased.  We do not have final figures yet for the full year, but we believe London has dropped so we will be on our own at the highest occupancy rate and we will be a long way off the top with regard to the average room rate.</p> <p>  The key point about Dublin is we do not have capacity.  What happens in Dublin, like anything else, is when only a few rooms remain the prices may change a little, which is what gets all the press attention.  With regard to competitiveness, Dublin would not be full if it was not competitive.  The prices charged for Dublin day in, day out on any of the booking engines or metasearch engines are great value.  There is no doubt there is an issue with regard to capacity.  Earlier, we were asked to comment on how many rooms there might be.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has done a report with Fitzpatrick's and it ranges from 5,000 to 7,000.  We must ask ourselves how this came about.  Five years ago, we had a crash and nobody expected the recovery to happen so quickly.  In the interim, all the money that might have gone into investment found its way into the land of distressed assets.  It was much cheaper to buy a hotel that was on the market.  In fact, one could buy an existing hotel for half the cost of building a new one.  As a result of the recovery, we are at a stage where it is great to see an increase in activity in the market.  The market is beginning to happen.  Sites are available and we have developers and hoteliers, and we will see an increase.  There will be growth in the capacity in hotels in Dublin in the coming three to four years.  Perhaps the difficulty will be that in the coming year or two years, it will not be as much as we would like.</p><p>We have to be mindful of the fact that tourism does not sit on its own.  We were asked to comment on whether Airbnb was a safety valve.  One has to be extremely careful because this is a major problem worldwide.  In Ireland it was traditional to have bed and breakfast accommodation, some lady or gentleman would rent out a room in their house and the money would help in sending their children to college or whatever.  Now apartments and whole properties, not just rooms are being taken out of the residential market.  The residential market is full.  When one takes properties out of the residential market it contributes to other problems in the residential market.  Today is not the day to go into this issue, but it should not be lost on the members present.  Planning is key.  If one plans to build for rental short-term private accommodation that is a business, it should be covered under appropriate planning.  It should not be a case that somebody is allowed to take property out of the residential market and use it for business without appropriate planning.  We are conflicted on this but the local authorities should take a serious look at it.  If they do not, we will end up with the same problems they have in New York, Paris and Barcelona and tourism will not be well served by this.</p><p> I will now deal with the marketing spend.  I will not go over the detail but the way we see it is that there has been a 45% drop in the marketing spend.  We are losing share voice.  The return on investment to the Exchequer is phenomenal and is not just about the amount of money that goes into the Exchequer each year from tourism, it is about the fact that it is creating economic activity in parts of the country where no other inward investment or other entrepreneurs can have a meaningful involvement.</p><p> In terms of the Rugby World Cup in 2023, we think there is a wonderful opportunity that Ireland and the IRFU could be in the game to host it.  We are working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the same as we worked with the FAI, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and other agencies for the UEFA Euro 2020 bid, which was successful.  We would hope that would happen.</p><p> A question on rural pubs is slightly left-field for us.  Rural pubs are an integral part of communities and they are also an important part of tourism.  I suppose we were very happy to see that in the past two budgets that the excise duty was not increased.  The reality is that every increase - and the excise in Ireland is one of the highest in Europe if not the world - takes money out of the pub.  It makes it more difficult for the publicans to survive.  I suppose the other aspect is the rateable valuation, where the revaluation which certainly affect us also affect the pubs.  If one wants to help the pubs, one would ask for a reduction in excise duties for on-trade sales and ensure that local authority rates are rolled out right across the county.</p><p> The seasonal and regional aspects of the tourism business are key.  Mr. Dolan will speak on that topic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.992" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Dolan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#P00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to speak to the committee.  Without repeating all of what has been said, Ireland is doing very well in terms of numbers, revenue and so on but the growth in tourism has been inequitable.  It is inequitable in terms of when people are coming and where they are going.</p> <p>Regionality and seasonality are major issues.  I own and operate a mid-range and mid-size hotel employing 60 people in County Leitrim.  I am well positioned to comment on this.  I will use a few different headings that were mentioned already to illustrate that inequitable distribution.  I would not be still in business if VAT was not realigned with my competitors in Europe.  I do not think the 9% VAT rate is a reduction; it is a realisation of what is a realistic rate of VAT.  In terms of Brexit, as I am located quite close to the Border, what people do not realise is that the British market, while not the highest yielding market in terms of revenue, is our closest, largest market and is most accessible.  It responds rapidly in marketing terms but what is most important in a regional context is that the British visitor has the widest, deepest penetration into rural Ireland in terms of the far-reaching rural parishes and during off-peak times of the year.  We can never lose sight of that.  The more regional and rural one is, the higher the dependency one has on the British market and on tourism in general.  Believe it or not, tourism in rural Ireland is more important in non-traditional places than it is in Kerry because it is the only show in town.  Personal incomes from tourism is relatively higher in Boyle, Ballaghaderreen and Mullingar than it would be in Killarney because it is the only show in town.</p> <p>  There is a temporary pinch in capacity in Dublin at present, there is insufficient capacity but Dublin's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity.  There are people coming to rural Ireland who would not otherwise be there.  It is not all gloom.  It is a temporary inconvenience that will work itself out in a couple of years in any event.  That is assuming there are no major catastrophes internationally, which appear to be happening with increasing frequency and enormity in recent years.</p> <p>  The lakelands programme is a significant marketing programme for rural areas.  It is the fourth brand proposition that has come into the markets.  That covers off everything.  Tourists are not interested in parochial or county boundaries.</p> <p>  Government has served us very well and we look forward to the continuing partnership.  Tourism is the most efficient growth engine for economic development and employment generation, but it is also the most fragile so we must respect it as well.  I see the argument that we have done so well with limited marketing resources but the analogy is that if one is running on an empty tank, when the tank empties, it grinds to a halt.  We must not be complacent.  We must keep our foot on the pedal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-09a.993" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gallagher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016110900002#P00300"><p>I will try to answer some of the questions directly.  I was asked if we have a line of sight on the number of full-time, part-time, seasonal jobs.  I am afraid I do not but if I can find them, I certainly will furnish the information to the committee.  Of the jobs growth, there are about 43,000 jobs, some 72% are in the regions.  That tells the story about the health of tourism around the country.  I would love to see the season extended and the pattern is starting to show that seasons are getting longer so that visitors are coming more in the autumn and spring than they would heretofore.  Some of the key drivers are activity-based holidays, water in particular.  We have such significant benefits in terms of our natural resources and they are major attractions.  Some of the barriers to seasonal growth in tourism are the closure of visitor attractions, which close down or are open for a shorter period.  Daylight impacts on people's days, so the day can be quite short.  While the pubs are important, going to the pub at 4 p.m. can be done on one or two days in a row but one could not spend a week doing it.  I agree with Mr. Dolan's point that Dublin's weakness in having insufficient rooms is an opportunity for the rest of the country to do better.  There is some active programming by tour operators whereby instead of the arriving tours staying the first night in Dublin, they are being taken elsewhere.  One will see that around the country in places such as Waterford, Drogheda, Kilkenny and so on that are full on a Friday night out of what I would call traditionally Dublin business.  That is very good for the regions.  Let me assure Senator Feighan that this will, in a sense, drive the OPW to do things a little bit differently because the visitors will be on the ground.  The business operators in the regions will see the need to keep these people engaged and entertained and experiencing our products.  They will drive the OPW to change its opening hours to reflect patterns of consumption.  That is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  In regard to Airbnb, I would go a little further than my colleagues.  I believe Airbnb should be regulated.  I think the Revenue should have line of sight of Airbnb, where it is at a scale that is a real income.  There were some shock stories on the radio recently about people having 40 properties in Airbnb.  I see it as a displacement for families to set up and live in urban areas and around the country.  The long-term outcome of that will be that school attendance will fall and schools and shops will not remain open and communities become stripped of other very essential services if Airbnb is allowed to take hook.</p><p>I do not believe it should be allowed to trade unfairly.  As yet we cannot see the size of it.  During busy periods Airbnb is incredibly large, especially in Dublin, and on quiet nights it is particularly small.  It expands and contracts very quickly to meet market peaks.  It should be done.</p><p> I was asked about the tourism policy document that I have critiqued as being out of date already.  I do not have an answer as to what the targets should be.  Next year the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, will undertake wide-ranging research by way of in-depth interviews with the industry's top 100 business leaders.  For the first time the tourism industry will write its own plan.  ITIC will deliver tourism's plan for tourism and we will do it on a five-year window because anything over five years will quickly become irrelevant.  We will try to follow the agribusiness which has been very successful in writing plans, but of course that is very dominantly anchored around some very large agribusinesses that can afford to produce these plans.</p><p> I was asked about seasonality and regionality.  One of the other drivers is around the idea of capital investment.  The industry has been lacklustre - I do not mean the agencies, but rather the private sector part of the industry - in being prescriptive about what we might need on the ground.  In the first quarter of next year, ITIC will carry out fairly compelling research to try to identify capital infrastructure, which if undertaken in the regions in appropriate scale, could happily and I think will, anchor new activities for people to do and see right across the regions.  There are plenty of areas where it could be better.  The midlands brand or the Shannon corridor brand has been mentioned.  When one gets to Galway and goes right, people in Donegal will also feel the same about tourism not having reached its potential.  We hope to address that.</p><p> I am happy to say there is no dissent among the tourism body.  We work very closely with the agencies.  We are in a very fortunate position.  We are a fairly "go-to" crowd.  We tend to make things happen quite quickly.  I do not think any other industry would reflect the level of co-operation we share and enjoy.</p><p> What does the industry do for itself?  We do not rely on the State organisations, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, to help us paddle our canoes.  We paddle with them, but we also contribute to that success.  I will give a Dublin example.  The Dublin hotel community this year and into next year will contribute &euro;600,000 towards the marketing of Dublin in the UK, particularly around the Dublin brand, A Breath of Fresh Air.  Many active people in the industry serve on marketing partnership groups.  They go out to the different overseas markets to engage with the industry in those markets about what is necessary for them to drive business to Ireland.  Mr. Gibbons has mentioned the central marketing partnership, which really is an extension of what was the tourism recovery task force, which, in itself, managed to turn around tourism's fortunes from 2010 onwards, where we lost 1 million British visitors in about 18 months.</p><p> To put some perspective on our success, the visitor numbers from the US to Britain have declined by about 1.5 million at the same time as we have doubled ours.  They would like to join Tourism Ireland in marketing Ireland and Britain in the United States.  Members of the committee will be glad to know that we will not do that.  That gives an indication of how proactive the industry is and how compelling the industry has been in its ability to turn around its competitiveness, its offering, the quality of its product and particularly in support of the brands that F&aacute;ilte Ireland delivers.  Those brands have been enormous hooks on which Tourism Ireland has been able to engage the markets to sell Ireland in a new way.</p><p> As Mr. Quinn said, county jerseys going out to sell Ireland is more about the county feeling good about the county than actually driving visitor numbers to Ireland.  I would share his view.  When tourism spend is fractured to do that activity, it has no benefit except that we all just feel great.  Employing people and having Exchequer returns are far more beneficial to tourism than wearing jerseys - except for the green jersey.</p></speech>

I have never seen an organisation or a group of organisations working so well.  They are a credit to the country.  They are doing a phenomenal job.  As Mr. Gallagher said, the State agencies and the industry work really well together and have created tremendous success.  I may not be 100% correct in this but I understand that every &euro;1 spent in Ireland by a foreign tourist generates something like &euro;1.52 for the Exchequer.  A 52% annual return is phenomenal.  The State is benefitting significantly from the work and effort of the organisations represented here.</p> <p>  Those involved in tourism in Ireland are winning in an industry that is the most diverse and competitive in the world.  People have many choices of where to go and what to do on holiday, and they are looking for variety and change.  We need to increase the market.  However, we are not out of the recession years.  We have an image and we suggest things are great.  As far as I am concerned, from an economic perspective things are not great.  Some people mentioned earlier that we have a three-tier economy and that is particularly true in the tourism industry.  Mr. Dolan mentioned Leitrim, and it is very true about Leitrim and central Ireland.  The Wild Atlantic Way has been a phenomenal success.  I commend the imagination, creativity and entrepreneurship of Mr. Gallagher, Mr. Quinn and the team in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, together with Mr. Gibbons and his team in what they are doing to market that worldwide.  I do not know how Mr. Gibbons does it - I get his tweets and they are from all over the flipping world.  That is absolutely huge.</p> <p>  The Wild Atlantic Way is doing very well.  The efforts and plans regarding the lakelands and so on are critical.  As Mr. Dolan rightly said, tourism is the mainstay of many small areas not just for pubs and bed and breakfasts, but also for local bus hire companies and so on.</p> <p>  I return to the macro view.  A significant amount of joined-up thinking is required.  There is a plethora of organisations dealing with tourism in Ireland.  Transport is critical for tourism.  Is there a tourist transport strategy or can the organisations represented here influence tourism transport?  The OPW was mentioned.  The tourism industry is very much in the OPW's hands regarding our national parks and heritage, which are obviously important from a tourism perspective.  The Leader programme is involved with tourism.  The Western Development Commission is involved in tourism.  Local authorities are doing their own thing when it comes to tourism.  We do not have proper joined-up thinking and strategy to support what the State agencies are doing on a national and international level, and what the industry is doing.  I may be wrong on joined-up thinking, but I do not think I am.</p> <p>  I mentioned regional strategy.  I am a bit concerned about price inflation and we do not want to go back to the price inflation we had in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  We got significant adverse PR over that.  Tourism Ireland, in particular, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland had a lot of work to do to counteract that.  I was on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland at the time and it was a significant issue.</p> <p>  Another issue at that time related to the markets.  We were very heavily dependent on the internal market at that time and we were beginning to go into a recessionary period.  There was big concern about how the hotels and wider tourism industry outside Dublin could cope because we were heavily dependent on the local market.  I ask Mr. Keeley if that has changed and if so how.  Have we sheltered ourselves a bit in that regard?</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about CERT, third level colleges and SMEs regarding the training and quality of the product.  They also spoke about the marketing side of it.  Most businesses in the tourism area are SMEs - bed and breakfasts, small bars and so on.  While tourism is a part-time income for them, it is a critical part-time income in order for them to survive.</p><p> I have a couple of points on Brexit.  I am using the delegates' figures so they may correct me if I am wrong.  The income from the tourism industry in the year is &euro;7.5 billion.  Some 24% of that comes from the United Kingdom.  Oxford Economics states this revenue will reduce by 2.5% in the coming year.  If these figures and my calculations are correct, they represent a &euro;45 million reduction for tourism in Ireland next year just as a result of Brexit.  I am trying to quantify it.  I want to know whether I am correct in that.  The loss of &euro;45 million is a lot of money but, compared with &euro;7.5 billion, it is not huge.  Mr. Gibbons referred to growth next year.  It still looks like we are in a good position.  I am trying to quantify the effect of Brexit in regard to the overall picture.</p></speech>

The expenditure on the island of Ireland last year attributable to international arrivals from the United Kingdom was just short of &euro;1.4 billion.  Oxford Economics has done a lot of work for us on the cost of Brexit.  The total number of British people travelling abroad every year is forecast to decline by 2.5%.  It is not just a matter of travel to Ireland.  Brexit has economic consequences that move beyond Britain.  I alluded in my speech to the fact that Oxford Economics has revised downwards its forecast for tourism growth four times this year.  If its forecasts are correct - economic forecasts are not always right - the reduction in tourism revenue is likely to be in the region of &euro;120 million by comparison with last April and May.  It is not just the British market that is affected; Brexit has economic consequences that spread beyond all markets.  It has economic consequences for growth in general.  That said, the figures are based on economic forecasts, and these change.  I am attaching a health warning to them.  They are the only projections we have.  They are the best in the class but it has not always been a great class in the past five or six years.</p></speech>

There is a greater consequence for the island of Ireland because our dependency is greater.  If I come back here in three months, this figure could have changed again.</p></speech>

I am happy to furnish members with a copy.  We have explored the role of public transport in tourism as something of an unknown.  If one is standing in Killarney waiting for people to step off a train, it is probably quite evident that it is a tourist train but, beyond that, there is not really very much buy-in in the sense of determining the function.</p> <p>  Some of the recommendations in the report are on a centralised ticketing portal, particularly one that can be accessed overseas so people can plan their itinerary before they arrive here.  It is envisaged to have ticketing across different platforms or modes of travel, which would be joined up.  There was an exploration to address the necessity for tourists to keep returning to the hub in the east in order to proceed elsewhere.  The east is the looped gateway all the time so if one goes from Dublin to Cork, one has to come back to Dublin to go to Galway.  It is a matter, therefore, of finding better links to keep people in the regions rather than having them return to the hub of Dublin continually.  There are many other recommendations.  The report is pretty good.</p></speech>

From our perspective, it is the bread and butter of what we do.  I am very conscious that, in trying to unlock growth in the regions, the product lies in individual businesses and the warmth of the welcome lies in individual communities.  As Mr. Quinn stated, we have put in place strategic partnerships with a number of the State agencies, including the OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Waterways Ireland and Coillte.  More important, we absolutely welcome local authorities becoming alive to the potential of tourism as an economic engine in their counties.  Having that appetite to engage with tourism is fantastic.  We work on the ground with local authorities, Leader programmes, chambers of commerce, etc., to try to ensure that, in unlocking stretches of the Wild Atlantic Way or Ireland's Ancient East, the impetus comes from the ground up.  Pride of place, a sense of place and a sense of everybody pulling together become critical.  I would like to believe there is no complacency in this space at all.  It is no coincidence that many of the tourism hotspots will also do well in TidyTowns competitions.  There is no tension between the chambers of commerce and the local authorities.  Everybody is pulling together.  From our perceptive, the county jersey makes a lot of sense when trying to mobilise the supply side.  It is not terribly relevant to international marketing but, in building from the ground up, working the networks hard is critical to the product development effort and unlocking the kinds of products and welcome that enable buyers to freshly programme new parts of the country.  It is absolutely central to what we are doing.</p></speech>
