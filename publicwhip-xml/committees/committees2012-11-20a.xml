However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  The committee is particularly interested in hearing the approach Mr. McKenna intends to take as chairperson of Coillte.  I invite Mr. McKenna to make an opening statement, if he so wishes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McKenna" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000003#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting me here.  My background is in manufacturing in heavy industry, information technology and health care.  I worked with Abbott Laboratories for the last 25 years of my career, where I was group general manager for Ireland.  As part of that, I was involved in extensive overseas development with the company.  Sidelines to my career include acting as an executive director of CII and FUE and then of IBEC when the two bodies merged into one.  I was both deputy president and president of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland for two years.  I headed up the committee within Abbott which set up the European works council and was chair of that committee for three years until I retired.</p><p>  This will be my third term in Coillte.  During that time there have been six different Ministers, 18 directors and two chief executives.  During my second 10-year term, which ended on 8 October, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, approached me in September and asked me to consider staying on for a period, particularly during the process of evaluation with a view to selling the harvesting rights for 50 to 80 years.  I have consented to that and was reappointed to the chair on 9 October for a period of two years.  I have agreed with the Minister that I will stay in the chair until at least December of next year to see this process through.  He and I will sit down in October of next year to determine the next course of action, depending on the outcome of the process that is currently underway.  </p><p>  I agreed to stay on because of my familiarity with the company and my respect for both it and its executive group.  As I said at the management conference in February, Coillte was a good company when I joined it and it is now a great company that is well on its way to becoming world class.  There is no reason why Coillte cannot be one of the leading fibre technology companies in Europe within the next seven years.  All of the pillars that can make it successful, from my experience with working with multinational companies, are already there.  We have a very good strategic plan.  We also have a very good innovation plan, currently in its infancy at only four years old, which has already delivered spectacular results.  That plan, if adhered to, will deliver significant products to address the environmental and energy efficiency demands that are coming down the line.  </p></speech>

I thank Mr. McKenna for his opening statement, which was short and to the point.  I have concerns for Coillte going forward, particularly regarding the indications of a sell-off of part of the assets of the company.  Has any definitive decision been made regarding the amount of assets that will be sold?  A major concern is what happens to the land afterwards.  If parts of our forests are sold off, does it mean that the land is in the hands of whatever company buys it for a period of time?  Is there any indication of what period of time companies would have control over that asset?  What is the situation with regard to any metals that may be underground?  Who would have the rights to that?  Has any exploration been carried out to determine if there are such resources in the land being considered for sale?  That is an issue of enormous concern to many Deputies and Senators.</p><p>  I find it mind boggling, given that Mr. McKenna's report - though short - is so positive that the Government of the day is going to sell off an asset that is performing exceptionally well.</p> <p>Reference was made to &euro;2 billion in exports in the past 12 months and, in itself, that is an indication of the potential.  I find it difficult to understand why there is a proposal to dispense with it when such potential exists.</p></speech>

Is there a timeline by which this must be completed in terms of having the block of harvesting rights ready for sale?  Terms of 50 and 80 years have been knocked around but I am unsure whether they are for 50 years or 80 years.  Do these arrangements come with an option to renew?  Clearly the details of any deal are rather important.  I assume that all the large companies interested in buying such harvest rights - there are several such companies throughout the world - have their eyes keenly on this sale and they will be looking to see what will come of it.  I assume they would negotiate for an option to renew.</p><p>  What is the position in respect of water or carbon rights in the case of any sale?  Will Mr. McKenna provide clarity because I cannot work it out in my head.  Forgive me for not understanding.</p><p>  The Irish Forestry Funds is a private investment firm.  What is the relationship or where does it sit in the whole forestry business in Ireland?  Will Mr. McKenna explain where it fits in respect of Coillte?  Clearly, it could become a buyer with other partners.  Anyway, we do not know who the buyer will be.</p><p>  I understand there was an intention to combine Bord na M&oacute;na with Coillte.  Did I misunderstand that?  Perhaps Mr. McKenna will offer some clarity.</p></speech>

He appears to be suitably experienced to continue in the role at what is a crucial time for Coillte as it prepares for the future.  Mr. McKenna referred to the main pillars being in place for a bright future and to aid innovation.  Will he expand more on how Coillte is innovating and on how it will change and adapt for future markets?  What challenges does Mr. McKenna envisage facing this positive future?  What are the potential pitfalls to block it from taking place and how does Mr. McKenna intend to deal with them?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McKenna" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000004#E00500"><p>I will answer Deputy Ferris first.  It is my understanding that even if the harvesting rights to the fibre on the land were sold, the land is not being sold.  That is my understanding of the direction of the Government.  Certainly, the instructions for the evaluation of the process that I was given by the Minister related purely to the evaluation of harvesting rights for 50 to 80 years, which is two crop durations.  Also, we received an instruction that in the process of that evaluation we should determine the feasibility of the remaining businesses and their ability to remain viable and profitable without recourse to State intervention.  At this stage all our evaluations have totally excluded any proposal to sell any land, aside from the small parcels of land that the business sells mostly to county councils and so on for road widening and other aspects.</p><p>  A question was asked about mineral rights.  I am not a lawyer but it is my understanding that irrespective of the sale of harvesting rights, and even if the sale of the land went through, any minerals under the land would remain the property of the State unless the State licensed them out.  To my recollection the only exploration carried out in my tenure has been the feasibility of deposits for road building and so on.  As far as I know there has not been any exploration for minerals.  The Government has made a decision in principle to sell the harvesting rights for 50 to 80 years only, but it has charged us with determining the feasibility of the remaining business in future as well.  That is part of the process we are undertaking the moment.</p><p>  A question was asked about the potential for a merger or whatever between Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.  That was voiced at one stage in the programme for Government but, to my knowledge, it has not been developed beyond that.  Certainly, we have had no request to evaluate the potential benefits or otherwise of a merger.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000004#E00600"><p>I asked some other questions, including one relating to the timeline for any sale.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McKenna" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000004#E00700"><p>Basically, we will finish the process we are working on now with our advisers at the board meeting next week.  In conjunction with NewERA it will then be given to the steering group which was set up by the Government.  My understanding is that sometime during the first quarter or early in the second quarter of next year a decision will be made with regard to whether to proceed and on process around that, whatever the decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000004#E00800"><p>I also asked whether there would be option rights for any buyer as part of a sale?  Is that standard practice?  The other question I asked related to the private company, Irish Forestry Funds, and its relationship with Coillte.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McKenna" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000004#E00900"><p>The process by which the actual harvesting rights would be for sale has not been determined yet, other than the evaluation that is under way.  No one has indicated whether there will be an extension beyond the 80 years.  We have received clear instructions relating to 50 to 80 years, which is two crop durations.</p><p>  Irish Forestry Funds is an investment fund which invests in immature forest for development and sale.  It is simply that.  It is an investment vehicle which buys and then sells at the appropriate price.  I do not believe it would have the financial capability to be a serious bidder on its own for the business as it stands, but it may merge with other groups if and when the outline of the request for tender is issued.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000004#E01000"><p>Mr. McKenna said the fund invests in immature forests.</p></speech>

They own the fibre, which they buy, and they sell it whenever.  That is the principle under which any harvesting rights sale would be made.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McKenna" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000004#E01500"><p>Innovation takes many forms.  Primarily, there is innovation in the way we run our forests more efficiently, in how we harvest them and in how we identify the value within the forests.  There is significant innovation within our manufacturing plants with regard to new products that will meet the environmental and regulatory issues coming down the road.  Mr. Gunning and Mr. Egan were before the committee some time ago.  They pointed out to the committee where our products end up but that is simply the tip of the iceberg with regard to the type of product that we can produce.  However, to get to that stage our Kilkenny plant needs a significant investment.  When it was built we were a minority shareholder and then we bought out the majority shareholder some years ago.  It was built for one purpose and one product, mass-produced.  The cost structures in Ireland and the needs of our markets in Europe no longer require that type of product.  It is a commodity product.  We cannot compete with the Eastern Europeans at the same level.  Therefore, we must shift our focus from commodity-type products to specialty-type products.</p> <p>We were working in joint ventures with many institutions and organisations in the United Kingdom, which will guide us to the type of product that will deal with the regulatory and environmental issues that are coming down the road.  </p><p> Within four years we have developed new products that are contributing about &euro;12.5 million.  I can give the committee a simple demonstration of what the board has said to the company.  In seven years' time we want to double the sales out of the company, but in seven years' time 50% of the company's current products will be obsolete.  So, if sales are to increase from &euro;200 million to &euro;400 million, then &euro;300 million will have to come from new products, so the company needs to be primarily focused on that.  Otherwise it will be dead in the water and the market will not take its products.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000005#F00200"><p>I welcome Mr. McKenna and wish him the best in his position as chairman of Coillte.  I come from Kilkenny and I am aware of Smartply in south Kilkenny, which employs approximately 350 people, and Medite in Clonmel.  They are two innovative companies and I have seen the new products they are hoping to produce.</p><p>  Smartply is looking for investment of nearly &euro;80 million for a new plant, which would guarantee the jobs in the company.  If Coillte sells the harvesting rights on its land for 50 to 80 years, will the two companies, Medite and Smartply, be included in that sale or will they be kept in Coillte as independent companies?  Where will they source their raw material?  If Coillte's harvesting rights are sold will these companies be guaranteed supply or will they have to seek raw material on the open market? </p><p>  Forestry requires a heavy capital investment because forests must be constantly replanted.  I note that Coillte's profit last year was &euro;19.9 million.  I have seen the figures for the last few years.  Companies such as Smartply and Medite were very profitable during the building boom.  Their profits went down, but they are now on the way back up with new products.  Does Coillte give a set percentage of its profit back to the Government?  I think it is negotiated with the Minister of the day.  If harvesting rights are sold off, what is the future for these two companies?  Where will Smartply get its investment of &euro;80 million?  If the companies are sold with the harvesting rights, Coillte will not want its balance sheet to show that it invested &euro;80 million in Smartply as this would make the company unattractive to a buyer, who would be buying a company with a debt of &euro;80 million.  I have been to see Smartply and I think the investment should be made.  I know the sale of harvesting rights is holding up the decision on that.  Could Mr. McKenna clarify the position?</p></speech>

If the members of the committee were Coillte's very wealthy shareholders, would Mr. McKenna recommend that we sell the forestry rights?  Coillte seems to be working well.  It is a company to be admired.  I ask Mr. McKenna to look inside himself and give us an honest answer to that hypothetical question.</p></speech>

Coillte forests are used for many activities, such as mountain biking, walking, hiking and so on.  If the harvesting rights are sold, will the public continue to have access to the forests?</p></speech>

Coillte is a semi-State company that is about to undergo change.  In the next couple of years more than 50% of the supply of timber will come from the private sector, as opposed to State lands.  No matter what else happens, we all agree the State will still own the land.  The question is complicated, and I am glad to hear Mr. McKenna say no recommendation will be made at least until the third quarter of 2013.  This is not something that should be taken lightly.  I have serious concerns about making sure the sector as a whole is best served by the next move.  I live in Wicklow, so I am probably as aware of this matter as anyone else.</p><p>  At the end of this process there will be a change in the structure of the forestry industry.  What will Coillte's role be as primary manager or as manager of harvesting rights and in the interaction between the private and public sectors?  How can we secure supply for timber processors, both private and Coillte's own, and the biofuel industry, which is a sector we have not mentioned?</p><p>  We have not mentioned the extensive recreational and other uses of forests, which have major potential in the area of tourism, among other areas, if they are managed well and serious consequences if they are not.  Mr. Gunning and Mr. Egan outlined the seven discussion points that are being considered.  It is almost like having to decide the right combination to advance.  We have a long way to go on that.</p><p>  As chairman of Coillte - he will probably be in the chair, whether he likes it or not, when this process is completed - what does Mr. McKenna think would be the best structure for the forestry sector?  Given his vast experience in other areas, particularly with Abbott Laboratories and others, he probably has a vision.  I feel he has been asked to stay on as chairman because he has that vision, and I would like to hear it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McKenna" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000005#F00600"><p>Yes, I have a vision.  All of us who work in the organisation have a strong belief in the strength of the company.  We are, however, beholden to our shareholder, which has asked the board to undertake a process of evaluation and determine the feasibility of selling the harvesting rights while maintaining the viable organisation left behind.  That is the process we are in at present.</p><p>  Even though the board is in total support of the Government's position on this, when a decision is put to the board it must give due consideration to the impact of that decision on the organisation, on its employees, on stakeholders such as sawmills and transport companies, on recreational users and on biodiversity and the environment.  This is very complex.  It is not like selling a self-contained unit of an organisation.  No matter what way one looks at this, its tentacles reach out into all elements of our society. </p><p>  With regard to guaranteeing supply to our operations and to sawmills, the process would have to include an explicit guarantee of supply to all users of fibre out of the forests.</p> <p>It would be unacceptable to approve a process that did not carry that guarantee.  </p><p> With regard to the SmartPly and Medite operations, SmartPly requires an investment of approximately &euro;85 million which the board approved in July.  It is being considered for approval by the relevant Departments.  It should be noted that this plant was built to produce one product and its equipment is reaching the stage of metal fatigue.  That is normal in this 24 hour, seven days a week process.  In the past two years, in particular, because of the economic and market environment, we have shut it down and opened it up again in a pattern in order to balance our stocks according to market requirements.  This has exacerbated the metal fatigue issue.  It is the opinion of the board and the company that without investment, the organisation probably has a life cycle of three to four years and will cease to operate after that period because it will be unable to function.  The investment is important for two purposes, the first of which is to maintain the operation and the usage of fibre from our forests because the back spin into Coillte is very important financially.  It is also very important to the sawmills because we take out the sawdust.  It is extremely important, therefore, that the investment is made at this point, as otherwise, if in a couple of years time a decision is made to sell the operating plant, it would be extremely difficult for anyone to purchase an operating plant with a utility-type product with an uncertain life cycle.  The main issues are the continuation of the operation and the ability to produce the type of products that meet market needs.  We are designing such products in co-operation with our external partners.</p><p> With regard to a dividend, the board is of the view that Coillte is not like other semi-State organisations.  Our dividend is paid back every year as capital investment in forests.  Since 1988 Coillte forests have only been cash-positive on two or three occasions.  All of the money is ploughed back into them, at an average figure of &euro;35 million a year.  The board has always held the view that this is a significant ongoing dividend to the State.  A bigger dividend in cash, frankly, would entail less reinvestment in forest operations.</p><p> Part of the process involves the recognition of the right of the public to access the public areas of the estate, no matter what the location.  This will be in focus in the process and one of the options that will be developed.  The maintenance of public access costs in the region of &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million a year in expenditure on roads, pathways, the development of new cycle paths, etc.  That cost is part of the dividend.  The cash dividend is paid by Coillte in agreement with our banks.  It was notified to our shareholder when Coillte negotiated the new bank covenants this year.</p></speech>

The chairman has stated that if the investment is not made in SmartPly, the plant will close within three to four years because it will not be viable and the product it produces will not be needed.  If the investment is not made, the plant will be obsolete.  If the investment is made, what will be the millstone that will be around the neck of Coillte?  It seems SmartPly and Medite will not be part of the sell-off, if it occurs.  They will remain as separate companies within Coillte.</p></speech>

It is also my guess that a sizeable section of forestry will not be sold off because it is not considered as viable for potential investors.  If Coillte is left with forestry that is of no great value and if a sizeable number of assets will be sold, there will be job losses.  That is inevitable.  It is also inevitable that Coillte will find it very difficult to run a profitable organisation.</p></speech>

I agree that a percentage of our estate is non-economic because it was planted in the 1940s and 1950s as part of community work projects.  The areas in which the trees were planted do not lend themselves to good growth in fibre.  Should the harvesting rights be sold, a percentage of the estate will transfer to the new Coillte.  That is all part of the process which is very complex.  There are implications for employment and transport companies.  The Government has asked us to ensure all of these issues are highlighted in the report when it receives it in order that all of the facts will be available when a decision is made, one way or the other.</p></speech>

Should the decision be made to dispose of the harvesting rights, all of these, as well as the non-commercial forests, will be included in a new company.  The board has to ensure that when the evaluation process is finished, all of the risks and implications are included in the report in order that the Government or the Minister and the Government can make a decision based on all of the facts.  It is hoped it will be before the steering committee in December.</p> <p>There will then be a three-month review period.  We anticipate that in the first part of the second quarter a decision in principle could be made by the Government.</p></speech>

What is the extent of Coillte's involvement with wind farms and the production of wind energy?  To what extent is it inhibited from implementing any plans it may have to invest in wind farms as a result of a lack of venture capital?  Does Coillte propose to enter into joint ventures with other established wind energy companies?  Coillte owns land in some of the windiest areas of the country.  The difficulties relating to the visual amenity aspects and obstacles relating to planning and development, etc., would simply not apply in the context of constructing wind farms in these areas.</p><p>  I understand that is necessary to have a wind corridor before one can construct a wind farm.  In that regard, Coillte could cut down a tract of trees and put a wind farm in place in the middle of a forest.  To what extent could this aspect be explored from the point of view of the company obtaining a return as opposed to merely limiting itself to developing and maintaining forestry?  How can we exploit the fact that there are companies which are interested in investing in lands which Coillte owns?  How open would the company be to such investment?</p></speech>

In the first instance, our enterprise division is primarily concerned with wind energy, telecommunications and land sales for commercial reasons.  We own some very good sites which are extremely efficient in the context of wind energy.  To date, we have entered into joint ventures in order to develop sites and facilities.  We do not operate wind farms or at least we have not done so up to now.  The company is determined to continue to develop appropriate sites with co-partners.  We normally exit the process once a site has been developed and we then take the profit back into the company and invest it in another site.  There is plenty of capital available for the right projects.  The major part of the process relates to obtaining approval in respect of connection to the grid, etc.  We are working to obtain such connection in respect of various sites at present.  When connection is achieved, we develop the relevant sites with our co-partners.</p></speech>

I wish to investigate further the relationship between the board and the executive in respect of this process.  I understand how a board and an executive work in the context of normal semi-State companies.  However, at our previous meeting in relating to Coillte the executive provided details in respect of this process.  The board's position is much the same as that of the executive.  Given that the shareholder has taken a decision to evaluate certain things, what will be the board's input into the process when the report is forwarded to the steering committee?</p></speech>

It will have met all of its advisers prior to the report being submitted to NewERA and the technical group.  The board and the executive work closely on this.  I certainly spent a great deal of time working with the chief executive in respect of it.  Representatives of the board will also be invited appear before the technical committee.  When a decision is made and is put to the board for approval or otherwise, it is at that point that the board will be obliged to exercise its statutory and fiscal duty with regard to the impact on the organisation, the employees, etc.  There is a process whereby the board will ultimately determine the legality of any such disposal.</p></speech>

The committee is very interested in this matter.  There is cross-party concern in the context of ensuring that whatever happens will be in the long-term best interests of the forestry sector.  We must also bear in the mind the public interest in light of the significant amount of land at issue here.  We will be inviting before us a number of interested parties from the private sector who will be given the opportunity to place their opinions on the public record.  We will not complete our hearings by the end of the year.  During the review process, we hope NewERA and the steering group will take cognisance of what comes through.  I know there has already been engagement with the latter.  However, this committee is a public forum by means of which individuals and stakeholders in the sector can avail of the opportunity to place their observations on the public record.  Mr. McKenna will be made aware of when those meetings will take place.</p><p>  I thank Mr. McKenna for giving very clear and frank answers to the questions, with the exception of that posed by Senator O'Brien.  However, I do not believe the Senator expected an answer.  We wish Mr. McKenna well for the next two years.  His hopes of an early retirement next October might be dashed.  As this process evolves further, he is probably as well placed as anyone to provide a considered opinion.</p><p>  Is it agreed that the joint committee will inform the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, that we have concluded our discussion with Mr. McKenna and will forward a copy of the transcript of this meeting to him for information?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Since May 2011 approximately 50 new clubs have been set up around the country which gives an indication of how important young people in rural areas consider agriculture and wish to be involved in an organisation such as Macra na Feirme, which provides them with opportunities, respects their views and opinions and lobbies on their behalf.  As president it is my job to represent their views and opinions and to lobby for them.</p><p>  I am a dairy, beef and tillage farmer.  I farm in partnership with my father in the south of Cork.  It is a very challenging time for young farmers but among the challenges there are huge opportunities which we will outline in detail.  I am aware that the committee has met several of the other farm organisations.  Overall, we are supportive of their main policies for the future agriculture budget.  Today we will focus on the young farmer element within the budget.  The greatest challenge for the industry continues to be structural change.  Budget 2013 must facilitate the readjustment in primary agriculture and as a result both drive competitiveness and increase exports.  The main structural barriers are the age profile of farmers and land mobility.  According to the Department, in 2010 only 5% of Irish farmers were under 35, approximately 6,200.  To put it another way, there are as many farmers under 35 as there are over 80.  It is a damning statistic of which no one in the industry can be proud.</p><p>  By contrast, the demand for education is at an all-time high.  Greater numbers of young farmers seek to start up farming in their own right and they are looking for other options in the coming years.  To facilitate that we must maintain the few tax reliefs that are currently in place to curtail the reduction in young farmers and to encourage the transfer of land to the next generation.  Land mobility is an area of great concern to young farmers.  Traditionally, the unique family farm model we have in this country has facilitated land fragmentation.  There are approximately 3.5 parcels of land per farm in this country.  A specific recommendation in the Food Harvest 2020 document outlines that the Department should consider policy options to address increasing land fragmentation.  Those would include support mechanisms to aid consolidation such as the introduction of a targeted roll-over relief for land sales.</p><p>  We recently undertook a study with the IFA, the Agricultural Trust and the Department on succession and land mobility.  Some of the initial findings were that 48% of those surveyed have no identified farm successor.  The report is nearing completion and will be circulated to the committee upon publication.  The document will help Macra na Feirme and other stakeholders such as the committee to shape new policy and incentives to encourage greater land mobility.  Collaborative arrangements such as farm partnerships or shared farming must be further developed and expanded.</p><p>  From a young farmer&rsquo;s perspective budget 2013 must facilitate taxation, investment, land mobility, education and competitiveness.  Under the taxation heading we are looking at two reliefs, namely, the young farmer stamp duty relief and agricultural relief.  The stamp duty relief is vital to encourage the early transfer of land to a young trained farmer.  To complement that, we seek the continuation of agricultural relief at its current level of 90%.  On the basis of a 20% reduction from 90% to 70%, a 100 acre farm worth approximately &euro;10,000 an acre is worth &euro;1 million.  The 90% rate will allow a farmer to reduce the tax liability on the farm to &euro;100,000, which would bring it under the tax net.  If that was to change to 70% the tax liability would be &euro;300,000, which means that a 20% reduction would have a tripling effect on the other end, which would bring such a farm into the tax net and it could be liable for a tax bill of in excess of &euro;15,000.  For a 150 acre farm the tax bill for a young farmer taking over could be up to &euro;60,000.  That is a sum of money no young farmer could face paying at a time when there are no incentive schemes or installation aid for them.  I will hand over to Mr. Joyce who will speak on investment and land mobility.</p></speech>

My name is John Joyce.  I am chairman of the agriculture affairs committee of Macra na Feirme.  I am also a full-time beef and sheep farmer in north Tipperary.  I started farming with my father straight after agricultural college.  I have availed of many of the reliefs and I know how important they are to young farmers.  Without installation aid they are of even more importance.</p><p>  In addition to what Mr. Jagoe outlined, another relief of concern is 100% stock relief, which is due to expire at the end of December 2012.  This relief allows young farmers to offset an increase in the value of their stock against tax liability.  We seek that it would be extended up until 2020, not just for one or two years, in order to further the objectives of Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  Partnerships are another investment initiative.  The Department must remove any remaining obstacles to partnerships, including allowing just one disadvantaged area aid payment.  Many other collaborative arrangements could be introduced to help land mobility and the transfer of farms to younger people.  Macra na Feirme is a proactive organisation.  In terms of the problems in agriculture, the elephant in the room is land mobility.  Anyone involved in agriculture will see it that way.  As a young person I invested heavily in my farm and I developed it as much as I could.</p> <p>The biggest problem I envisage at present concerns land mobility and getting my hands on land to expand.  This is the same for any other younger farmer.</p><p> While we can all talk about emigration and young people with no jobs, we must realise the agriculture colleges are full to the brim with young people who want to start off in farming.  We have the land in Ireland to farm and produce food.  It seems that nobody has dealt with this issue for years.  As Mr. Jagoe stated, there are more farmers over 80 than there are under 35.  We seek long-term land leasing and tax exemptions for those over 40.  Initiatives such as the various supports for young farmers, including new entrants to the dairy quota scheme, are required. Macra na Feirme proposes a new low-end restructuring relief.</p><p> With regard to my business, land mobility is a key factor for anybody who wishes to increase farm size.  Many young farmers' parents may not be old enough to retire.  We do not want to push people off the land or to be seen as land grabbers.  Macra na Feirme was one of the first organisations in the country to consider this issue and I hope it will be able to deal with this in the next few years.  The problem does not arise this year alone; it will be a problem for years.  We do not want farmers to vacate their farms but to retire from their farms with dignity.  Many people refer to pensions and pension funds, but people have a pension in their own farm.  There are many arrangements worldwide, from share farming to long-term leases, that we could adopt.  I hope that between the two generations, we can move forward and work something out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Jagoe" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000009#K00200"><p>Support is required for education and training.  As Mr. Joyce stated, the agriculture colleges are full to the brim.  It was not too long ago when Teagasc was trying to close down some of them.  The colleges are full along with many third level colleges that are focusing on agri-food, agri-business or science.  The graduates are going out to work among the 300,000-strong workforce.  They are working directly in the agri-industry.  There is spin-off employment for those who provide services to that industry.</p><p>  Recent proposals for means testing must be opposed.  The land that a farmer farms is his or her equipment that aids him or her in generating income from that farm.  The idea that a farm itself should be used in determining whether a son or daughter may avail of potential student grants is ludicrous.</p><p>  Macra na Feirme continues to educate and train its members in many different ways.  For example, just last week we saw a group finish a very intensive dairy directors' programme, which was run in conjunction with ICOS.  The very intensive programme is giving our members the opportunity to further their skills and education.  This is the second year of the programme.  Students in last year's course spent three or four days in Holland with FrieslandCampina, a very successful co-operative.  It was a case of working with and listening to our counterparts in Holland to understand how they work.</p><p>  Mr. Joyce referred to efficiency programmes, including the dairy efficiency programme, DEP, and BTAP.  These are very successful programmes and they have encouraged 6,000 dairy farmers and 7,000 beef farmers to enter schemes.  We want to see the schemes expanded to include sectors such as the sheep and tillage sectors.  The DEP is coming to an end.  We encourage the committee to facilitate an extension of the scheme to encourage new entrants to join discussion groups.</p><p>  I ask Mr. Edmond Connolly, our chief executive, to make a brief statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Edmond Connolly" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000009#K00300"><p>I would like to say a few words about the organisation of Macra na Feirme.  We are supporting a new breed of agricultural entrepreneurs.  They are intelligent, well-educated young farmers who are ambitious and have very high expectations.  They are buying into concepts such as the need for sustainable, intensive agriculture, favourable economic horizons for food, and the scope for technology adoption to improve prosperity.  However, young farmers need excellent support services, both social and technical, and this is what Macra na Feirme provides.  We are fulfilling this role in a variety of ways.  We have an excellent club and county structure, and this is primarily volunteer led.  We have a very small, dedicated team of professionals that supports the volunteers.  There are 14 full-time staff equivalents.  We have young farmer development groups in every county.  We have discussion groups, dedicated training programmes, such as the young dairy directors' programme with ICOS, leadership training and other programmes.  We are involved in industry study visits throughout Ireland and abroad.  We are involved in personal development programmes, including public speaking and debating, and various others.</p><p>  I make these remarks in the context of very high levels of youth unemployment.  There are serious issues arising in society regarding mental illness, particularly among the young.  There is a need for balanced regional development.  This has been long acknowledged by the State.  We are operating in an environment in which a small amount of support for a national organisation could have a considerable multiplier effect by way of delivering support services for rural young people.  It would be very much aimed at furthering their continuous professional and social development.</p><p>  We are very fortunate to be supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs through the youth services fund.  The allocation is relatively small, amounting to less than &euro;500,000 this year.  However, it is being cut continually, thereby seriously undermining our ability to deliver our services.  I am sure most organisations and interest groups say this.  However, with what we regard as a tiny amount of seed capital, organisations that are volunteer led and which have a considerable volunteer network &ndash; we have a volunteer army supporting young farmers &ndash; with a small dedicated team of professionals can achieve so much.  Our membership has increased over the past three years, as Mr. Jagoe said.  Fifty new clubs have arisen in the past 18 months.  Our participation levels have increased, as have our activity levels.  We are active at local, national and international levels.  A very small amount of seed capital could result in considerable dividends for the Stage in respect of the well-being of a sector that is part of the productive economy.</p></speech>

In a sector that is growing and expanding, we are seeking the Government supports to ensure we can capitalise on the opportunities that arise.  We do not want our highly skilled and motivated young farmers emigrating to work in other countries when their skills and expertise can be used here to make Irish farming more efficient.  Budget 2013 should facilitate file transfer and support the next generation of farmers.  The economy needs young farmers to deliver for it, but the budget for 2013 must deliver for us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000009#K00600"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentation.  They largely pushed an open door as far as many of us are concerned regarding the future of Irish farming and encouraging young people into the industry.  It is quite frightening to realise that only 5% of farmers are under 35.  The figure is similar to that pertaining to farmers over 80.  This is alarming and we must determine how to deal with it.  Both Government and Opposition parties have an onus to create initiatives whereby young people are encouraged into the industry and elderly people are encouraged to step back.  The loss of both installation aid and the early retirement scheme, both of which complemented each other, had a detrimental effect in this regard.  It is necessary to put in place schemes that make up for the deficit.  This is of considerable importance if more people are to become involved.</p><p>  With regard to the abolition of the milk quota and the opening up of the market in that regard, do the delegates believe the ability to restructure will complement the forthcoming opportunities?</p> <p>Unless restructuring is forthcoming through land mobility or whatever, it does not appear as though the potential and opportunities can be realised.</p><p> On education and creating obstacles regarding the assets, that is, the actual farms being a hindrance to people accessing a proper and full education, I am a great believer in the huge benefits from such education, more so now than ever before because farming has become so professional and technical.  I note my own son attended Pallaskenry Agricultural College.  I grew up on a small farm at a time when the world was a very big place and the educational side of it was learned from previous generations.  How do the witnesses envisage the potential for the future in this regard?  Mr. Jagoe mentioned the proposal that assets be included as part of the means testing process for the education programme.  Certainly, this issue must be examined and if one is going to means test in this regard, it should be based on income and not simply on an asset on which one is working.  I believe that makes logical sense.  Land leasing tax exemptions will be of crucial importance to make available farms for the younger people to take over.  Were people in their late 50s or 60s able to lease their land and have such tax exemptions it certainly would be an encouragement to an extent and would go some way towards compensating for the ending of the early retirement scheme and so on.</p><p> A long time ago, I learned how to speak in public when a member of Macra na Feirme.  I can recall being a member back in 1967 or 1968, when it undertook public speaking campaigns.  That was the first time I ever spoke in public and was the last time for a long time thereafter.  Consequently, I wish all the witnesses well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000010#L00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions today.  In common with Deputy Ferris, I find myself in agreement with many of the points made, particularly in respect of capital assets for student grants and the need for this to be related in income and not just for farmers.  This is a potential issue for all small businesses and business people nationwide and, hopefully, it will not be an issue.  As for land mobility, it is important to acknowledge the moves that were made in last year's budget.  The witnesses themselves observed that not all of them come at a huge cost but they involve some thinking outside the box.  Moreover, they will require the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to consult with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, because many of them pertain as much to finance as they do to agriculture.  However, progress must be made in this regard.</p><p>  As for land mobility and land consolidation, the recent construction of motorways through my constituency of Kildare South in the area around my home left a huge problem whereby small parcels of land were left on either side of a motorway.  Were changes introduced to the tax system to provide some relief in this regard, one could have a system in which it would make more sense for such small parcels of land to be consolidated as farmers could carry out a swap.  As this is not happening at present, it would not really be tax foregone as such transactions would start to happen.  The position is similar in cases in which a young farmer might take over a holding in which there are out-farms.  It would make much better sense for such a farmer to try to consolidate that holding.  We must make an effort in this regard because it is too prohibitively expensive for this to happen at present and consequently it is not happening.</p><p>The witnesses referred to partnerships and I seek their views on my perception that dairy partnerships are the only ones which really are on the table at present.  It is very important that progress be made to broaden out their use to the beef and other sectors.  However, some people are scared away from the partnership model because it entails quite a big commitment.  However, I refer to scenarios involving young farmers in particular, who might not have a huge amount of land themselves but who might have elderly relatives or neighbours with land who do not have the wherewithal to undertake a really intensive programme.  Do the witnesses have ideas on measures short of partnership but which encompass that sharing mechanism and on what could be done to try to facilitate this by the Government?  Even if it is not a full partnership, there may be measures the Government could introduce that would not entail a massive cost but which could help or surmount some of the difficulties.  I acknowledge there are difficulties and fears in this regard and some farmers do not wish to participate in such schemes.  I seek the witnesses' views on the subject and in general, I thank them for their presentation.</p></speech>

As Deputy Ferris noted, they are pushing at an open door in this meeting.  On the issue of stamp duty relief specifically, given it is a relief that already exists and which is due to expire, has Macra na Feirme been given any indication?  Is Macra na Feirme in the dark or do the witnesses know what might happen to this relief?  In a broader context, it was interesting to hear Mr. Connolly use that language of the agricultural entrepreneur and perhaps it being a move away.  Mr. Joyce then noted young farmers were not land grabbers.  To what extent can Macra na Feirme afford to devote the time and efforts needed to educate and to move the culture away from the fact that land was, and always has been, held dearly?  As this always has been difficult, how much work would it entail?  Whatever about legislation or grants or other measures, I refer to facilitating the work that is done locally by Macra na Feirme in discussions, by educating and by having that conversation.  Obviously, Macra na Feirme is already doing much of that and the witnesses referred to leadership training, industry visits and public speaking.  Can Macra na Feirme run a concerted, obvious campaign - perhaps it already is doing it - to state this is where matters are heading and young farmers are not land grabbers?  Can they state  they seek to do it with dignity but that both ends are needed?  It does not matter how many rules are put in place or how much assistance is given unless the culture is changed and in truth, the witnesses are the only ones who can encourage such change.  This sort of ties in but is slightly different, in that I wonder whether Macra na Feirme could take more of a psychological approach in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1124" speakername="Michael Comiskey" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000010#L00400"><p>I thank the lads for their attendance and it is good to have them back before the joint committee again.  We now have met a number of times in the lead-up to the budget and everyone hopes there will be no cuts.  Hopefully there will be none, although one is told there must be more than &euro;100 million in cuts somewhere within the agriculture budget.  Certainly, for farmers on the ground and coming from a farming background myself, people are expressing the hope there will be no further serious cuts.  The witnesses touched on the issue of land mobility, which is very important.  Especially on foot of the abolition of dairy quotas from 2015, there will be an opportunity for young farmers in particular to expand.  I was approached some time ago by a neighbouring farmer who was living beside a farm that was planted in forestry.  It involved 60 acres of the very best of land by the standards of County Leitrim, that is, it was good limestone-based land.  The farmer in question wondered whether it would be possible, after the crop of timber was extracted, for this land to be turned back to farming.  He was even prepared to swap poorer land for it.  I raised the issue with the Minister and with Teagasc and I note the Minister could make an order in such a case to take back that land.  It was very good land that was planted perhaps 40 years ago or more and it will create a great opportunity for any farmer but for a young farmer in particular who sought to expand.  In this case, he was making more, albeit poorer, land available for forestry.  I have raised this issue number of times</p><p>  The witnesses mentioned the dairy efficiency programme, DEP.  My first thought was they were talking about a Belgian blue bull because I do not come from a dairy background.  All such initiatives, including sheep discussion groups and beef discussion groups are very important for everyone because we can all learn.  When I am not at home myself, I send my own sons to participate in the BTAP programme.  They will learn more and will have better ideas for the future.  In any event, some sort of a scheme will be needed in the future.  While I acknowledge this may not happen in these difficult times, it will be necessary to consider a farm retirement scheme in the future to encourage those older farmers to hand over the land.  It is very sad to learn that only 5% of farmers are under 35.  When in place, the farm retirement scheme was great and perhaps in two or three years' time, hopefully we will find ourselves in a position to be able to re-introduce such a scheme and to give young farmers a chance.  However, I agree wholeheartedly with the points made by the witnesses and will work with them to ensure there are no cuts or at most minimal cuts in the agricultural sector.</p></speech>

Having spoken to them before, I appreciate where they are coming from.  I welcome the fact that they will soon have their report to hand on land mobility.  I hope that it will be a robust document in the sense that it will give a clear indication as to how we might proceed.  As regards land mobility in particular, if we look at all the tax incentives that are already there - including young trained farmer relief, agricultural relief in capital aquisitions tax, capital gains tax, retirement relief for a farmer handing over land - they were not created yesterday or the day before.  They have been on the go for a while, yet we still have a major problem concerning the reluctance of farmers who own land to pass it on or making arrangements to do so.  Part of the difficulty is that there is no way we can identify that those arrangements are there.</p><p>  I agree with Senator Comiskey that the early retirement scheme was helpful but we did not see everyone clamouring to avail of it either.  Are there some preliminary views on it?  We get all sorts of reports back, including farmers who will not give over their land because there are no pre-nuptial agreements and they do not know how the land will be divided.  They will therefore allow their son or daughter to farm with them but it all carries a health warning because they obviously do not believe in romance or have been around too long to believe in it.  </p><p>  Another issue has been brought to my attention at clinics in Mayo.  It is the question of people still having difficulty getting planning permission to build on a holding for a son or daughter who is the heir apparent to the land.  They wish to be in a common sense location near outhouses, rather than being on part of the holding that is ten or 12 miles away just because the planning decision requires that.  In some instances, houses were built as a commodity that was sold.  People have come to live in areas where it was probably envisaged that it would only be for the farmer's son or daughter to assist with the continuity of farming.  That is a real problem for some farmers.  Some people are tearing their hair out because they have issues in dealing with local authorities.  Younger people obviously want to build such houses, so I would be interested to hear what Macra na Feirme has to say about this.  A lot of tax incentives have already been tried, so what is the overriding feeling?  I appreciate that Mr. Jagoe will not give me a final answer until he has the report.</p></speech>

To be fair, it is more of a local authority issue.  Given the presentation and the members' response, the underlying theme has been centred on getting farm land into the hands of young, trained professionals with an enthusiasm for the career and the job.  Looking at all our objectives for growth in this sector, with the quotas gone, I think members will agree that it is a different presentation from the others in so far as the witnesses have concentrated on incentive measures to allow the industry grow to where it becomes product-based and income-earning.  Various aid schemes, such as the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme or TAMS and the single farm payment, are built around that.  However, the principle is that one has a productive, profitable farm business.</p><p>  It was also interesting to hear what Mr. Connelly said about the wider dimension Macra na Feirme plays in Irish society.  That cannot be underestimated.  The committee would be interested in Macra's ongoing discussions with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  If Macra wants to present specific correspondence to us we will be able to reflect on it and maybe support its efforts.  That is not being party political.  If Mr. Jagoe wants to reply to any particular points that have been raised, including the planning permission one, he is welcome to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Jagoe" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012112000011#M00300"><p>I might come to Deputy Mulherin's comment last because it is something that is affecting me at the moment.  I will start with Deputy Ferris's point about the ability of the dairy herd in Ireland post quota.  Teagasc estimates that there is at least an extra capacity of between 15% and 18% within the current dairy herd, including calving patterns and milking later in the year.  In recent years, due to the super levy, farmers were drying off cows in September or October, and as early as August last year.  Therefore somewhere between 15% and 18% will be achieved through the natural herd as it is.</p><p>  According to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, the figures for next year show that roughly 3% extra heifers will be calving in the spring.  That should not pose a super levy situation next year considering the bad summer we have had.  However, for the following two years that figure will grow by approximately 8% and 12%.  If these figures continue upwards it will result in us achieving the 50% figure.</p><p>  Positive efforts are being made on the ground by co-ops.  Last week, we saw Glanbia passing its first vote for the joint venture between the plc and the co-op to expand its business.  We see the same happening at Dairygold.  In west Cork, Carberry has extra capacity within its own capacity.  Following its new acquisition of north Cork, the Kerry Group has less capacity.  In Galway, following Connacht Gold's acquisition of Donegal Creameries that capacity is now there on the ground, barring that south-east Dairygold and Glanbia corner.  That will be built in the coming year, however. </p><p>  As regards means testing, I do not have the figures to hand.  This year, Teagasc has implemented the first stage of a new means testing course.  It is in its first year and it will be interesting to see how that will proceed at the end of this year.  The number that will be availing of student grants coming from farming families is relatively small, but these young people do need support.  The Deputy is right to say that it should be based on income rather than on assets.</p><p>  As young farmers we are anxious to have land transfers but that is not happening, so we need to promote long-term leasing further.  As the committee is aware, the whole conacre system in Ireland is proving to be a real headache for farmers, given the new CAP forthcoming in 2014.  The conacre system has been there and in recent years long-term leasing has not been pushed or encouraged enough.  Much of that has to do with the accountants, solicitors and auctioneers working with us, who can potentially lose business by farmers having long-term leases.  That is because the relationship goes between both farmers instead of between the farmer, accountant or auctioneer, whatever the case may be.  These are matters that we will have to address.</p><p>  Senator Hayden mentioned farm consolidation which we are pushing hard on our agenda.  We are proposing a new form of roll-over and are targeting young farmers under 35.  If they buy a nearby farm to consolidate their farm and sell an out-block of land to purchase that, there should be no tax implications for the sale of that land.  That information is in the document before the committee.</p><p>  We want to see partnerships expanded into other sectors.  I am in the milk production partnership and the benefits of such a partnership are immense.  One has increased scale, efficiency and productivity, as well as a different skills set and mindset, which is all fantastic.  If these partnerships can be expanded into beef, sheep and tillage farms there are endless possibilities and opportunities for them.  In addition, the quality of life that goes along with it is crucial. </p> <p>I know of two dairy farms in Kilbrittain, west Cork, which have a beef partnership in action.  However, there is no legislation in place for them to go ahead.  There are many examples of these unofficial partnerships across the country which would prefer if there were some legislative framework to give them some recognition.  We are also very much for other collaborative arrangements be it in equity or other areas.  For example, I have received telephone calls from five young farmers, one girl and four lads, who could not go home farming because the farms were either too small or there was a sibling there already farming.  They were looking for other options to go into farming.  For the past five years, these five farmers have been seeking ways of getting into farming, not as a farm labourer but as a farm manager or to go into partnership.  They cannot find these opportunities in Ireland.  One of the farmers, who happens to be a friend of mine, has farmed over the past several years in New Zealand and Australia.  There he would be given a list of opportunities if he wishes to take up farming in either of these countries.  Here in Ireland, that mindset is not the same.  We are willing to go to whatever lengths to get young people into farming or expand enterprises but information and education must be targeted at the older farmer because there is a lack of knowledge at that level.</p><p> Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe raised the issue of stamp duty relief about which we are very much in the dark.  It is up for renewal at the end of this year.  That is why it is at the top of our agenda.  The relief encouraged the transfer of farms to young farmers before they reach 35 years of age.  The culture among older farmers needs to be changed.  Young farmers are bursting to get into farming and expand farming enterprises.  They want to take on the world but the education campaign must be targeted at our senior colleagues.  We must work with them and help them to change this culture.</p><p> Senator Comiskey raised the issue of putting land already used for forestry back into agricultural production.  That is quite hard to do.  The legislation is probably the simplest part of it.  Putting such land back in dry stock or dairy production is very difficult to do.  While I like the Senator&rsquo;s sentiment, I do not believe it is possible.</p><p> On Deputy Mulherin&rsquo;s point about planning permission, I applied for planning permission for a house on 3 January and only received it last week.  It is a very vexing issue for young farmers.  I am farming in partnership with my father now and looking to take over the farm ultimately.  It took me 11 months to secure planning permission for a house next to the farm.  The process nearly saw me have to locate the house a mile from the farm and even at one point next to another farmer&rsquo;s farmyard.  This was absolutely ludicrous.  I was looking for a modest house, not a mansion, but it still took 11 months to secure planning permission on my own farm.</p><p> There are some preliminary results from Macra&rsquo;s land mobility study.  One interesting one is the need for a secondary income after retiring.  Many farmers find the income they generate is absorbed into the business.  Many farmers are concerned they will not have any further income once they transfer a farm.</p></speech>

The IFA, the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and various agricultural trusts are also involved in it.  While we know its preliminary findings, it is a question of what we will do with them.</p><p>  On Senator O'Keeffe's points about my land grab comments, as young farmers we could say we want the land.  However, we understand these older farmers were pioneers in their day too.  Not alone that but they also need a secondary income and many of them need to be occupied.  Rural Ireland is being depopulated.  One only has to go to a local shop to see the majority of the population is made up of old people.  It would be disappointing for the sake of not rejuvenating agriculture that these lands would be left idle or abandoned.</p></speech>

I agree Macra does not want to be painted as a land grabber but there are some people who may take the view it is.  The educational aspect of this debate must fall on Macra&rsquo;s shoulders.  That is why I asked what Macra had done in this regard.</p></speech>

If Macra is to push this agenda to its fullest, it will be taken by the older farmer that it is young farmers only going for land grab.  That is why we need buy-in from all stakeholders.  The IFA came on board with this study because it realised the problem out there, as well as the other stakeholders.  Macra will be very much behind the scenes driving this issue to the forefront.  We want this land for productive reasons.  Just because the land is for production does not mean we have automatic rights to ownership.</p></speech>

Has Macra any concerns about how the ending of the milk quota system will affect prices?  This could be damaging to people who have already invested in dairy production.  Rural isolation and loneliness is a serious issue, which I know from bachelor small farmers in County Kerry.  I recall Senator McAleese several years ago, along with the GAA and the IFA, tried to put in place a programme to deal with rural isolation.</p> <p>I seek their views on that because, obviously, Macra na Feirme is the future in that regard.</p></speech>

However, the benefits have not been pushed enough or publicised enough.  As I stated earlier, there was the conacre system in Ireland.  There are farms dating back generations where the farm is going back to the same farmer every year under the conacre rule.  Long-term leasing would be more efficient and effective financially for all parties concerned but for some reason that does not happen.  That is a mindset that must change.</p><p>  On the issue of future milk prices, the price collapse to 21 cent per litre in 2009 occurred within a quota scenario.  We still are in the quota era.  The price is up in the region of 32 cent per litre at present but volatility is here to stay.  If one speaks to the milk processors, they will say there is a one-in-three-year volatility cycle.  Please God, it will not be next year.  Next year seems to be the year in which prices could go down, but then markets are not up at present.  Ireland's milk pool is roughly 1.5% of the overall world supply.  If we double that, our milk pool will be somewhere up around 1.8% of the world's milk supply.  We are still a relatively small player within the world milk pool.  In contrast, every processor in Ireland is going after value-added products and that is where the premium is at present.  For example, the Middle East and Africa are areas in which demand for protein from milk products - whether that be cheese, milk or whey - is growing significantly, and that must be good for Ireland.  Ireland is producing nearly 17% of the world's baby formula, which is fantastic.  That is the product that comes directly from Ireland and does not include Irish products being blended abroad in countries such as China.  Ireland is becoming a big, big player but we need support from the relevant institutions as well.</p><p>  Mr. Connelly mentioned the work we are doing with regard to rural isolation.  Nearly every second day we are approached by organisations that wish to work with us.  We cannot manage that because, as he stated, we have the equivalent of 14 full-time staff.  We are primarily volunteer-based.  I am a volunteer and so is Mr. Joyce, along with 8,000 more around the country, champing at the bit to do whatever we can at a local level.  We can do so much.  Mr. Connelly will expand on that.</p></speech>

As Mr. Jagoe stated, we are being approached by organisations that are dealing with the acute aspects of rural isolation, such as mental health problems.  As we keep saying to them, what we can do is what we are set up to do - that is, to get young people involved in Macra.  The biggest antidote to the threat of isolation and mental health issues is to get people involved in social networks, encourage them to partake of further training and allow them to meet people outside their own immediate areas.  We see it constantly - members of Macra who perhaps two years ago were very quiet blossoming within a couple of years.  I welcome the Chairman's comments with regard to support from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs because I genuinely believe that volunteer-led organisations such as this can achieve so much more than attempts by the State to put acute services in place.  If we can mobilise the volunteers and reach out to increasing numbers and get them involved, that would be our biggest contribution and by far the most effective way of dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

It is interesting to see the other aspects of the priorities.  I have just been approached by members of the Irish Farm Management Association, of which I am probably a lapsed member.  They have reconstituted themselves and are interested in coming before the committee.  Mr. Joyce made the point that young farmers do not want to be seen as land-grabbers, but the men and women operating farms, who tend to be older and have been around for a while, can have a vision about land mobility and the availability of land because a significant number of them operate on land they do not own in the first place.  Maybe their perspective on it is compatible with Macra na Feirme's, and that is something we should develop.</p><p>  The Minister will examine many of the priorities Macra na Feirme listed.  In many cases - such as the example of stamp duty relief - it is the Department of Finance that needs persuasion to grasp the concept of what it would do by forgoing revenue.  Often it is merely a matter of allowing transfers take place, because at present there is no money transferring and no revenue coming in either way.  That is the job.  Macra na Feirme makes a strong argument for that.  It is certainly something the Minister would welcome when he makes his case to the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

As we know, products that have come from Burma to date have had increased tariffs imposed on them because of the use of forced labour practices.  Given that the recommendation is to lift the restrictions and bearing in mind that support has been given by the International Labour Conference, it is important the committee dealing with foreign affairs examine this matter.  I recommend that we make a recommendation to it, obtain its advice on what is happening in Burma and determine whether it supports the lifting of the tariffs, for the reasons given.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Muiris O'Connor, head of policy and planning in the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  We have provided the committee with a written statement, which I will try to summarise.  The HEA fully appreciates the important role the higher education system plays in the economic and social development of Ireland.  Particularly given the subject matter of today's discussion, we appreciate the role of the sector in developing Ireland's intellectual resources, especially technological competency and the capacity to innovate.</p><p>  The responsiveness of the sector to the needs of enterprise generally is well reflected in the breadth of programme provision across higher education from level 6 to level 10 of the national framework of qualifications.  As a matter of policy and practice, institutions adapt existing programmes and develop new ones on an ongoing basis in response to student and enterprise demand.  All institutions undergo rigorous strategic planning processes involving input from a wide range of stakeholders, including employers.  The institutes of technology have a particular role in supporting the business community in tangible and practical ways.  Their programmes are closely aligned to the needs of industry.  Employers are usually represented on the course development boards.</p><p>  Without wanting to convey complacency, I believe the higher education system has responded and is responding well to a wide range of skills needs, and has done so down through the years.  As a country, however, we need to focus constantly on the outcomes we achieve in the sector and how they address national priorities.  It is worth advising some caution.  We must not assume that the primary role of the higher education sector is to provide job-ready graduates for enterprise.  The danger inherent in that approach is that the skills of our graduates would quickly become obsolete.  Given the rapid pace of technological advancement and globalisation within the knowledge economy, the skills needs of industry are continually evolving, particularly in technological domains.  The preparation of skilled employees must involve a partnership between higher education and employers.  The key requirement of graduates and, consequently, the institutions is core or generic skills in areas such as literacy, numeracy, information processing, communication and creative thinking.  The core skills are as important as technical skills or discipline-specific knowledge.</p><p>  Graduates will also need to forge careers across a range of sectors during their working lives.  Therefore, adaptability to change is also a vital quality required of graduates.  The role of the employer is to take these graduates and provide them with the next level of education and training appropriate to their industry.  The responsiveness of institutions to the evolving skills needs of industry is reflected in academic development and reform through actions such as the increasing modularisation and semesterisation of courses at undergraduate level, leading to greater opportunities for interdisciplinary study.  At postgraduate level, the rolling out of structured PhDs and other developments, such as a graduate research education programme, is facilitating the provision of research and soft skills training and the direct involvement of industry partners in programme delivery.  The importance of original research and innovation to economic renewal is understood by all in higher education.</p><p>  The responsiveness of the higher education system is also reflected in the Springboard programmes and the ICT skills conversion programmes.  Launched in 2011, Springboard provides higher education opportunities from NFQ levels 6 to 10 on a free-fee basis to unemployed people in areas of employment growth.  Building on the success of the 2011 programme, which provided almost 6,000 free places in higher education institutes across the country, the 6,000 places on the 220 courses offered in 2012 will help to address skills deficits across a broad spectrum of enterprise sectors, including ICT and others, as listed in my statement.</p><p>  I will conclude my opening remarks with specific comments on the three areas of skills needs that the committee identified in its invitation to today's discussion.</p> <p>With regard to information communications technology, ICT, we recognise the deficit in graduates with high level ICT skills within Ireland and internationally and the importance of these opportunities for the advancement of Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise strategy.  We are greatly encouraged by the recent trends in the demand for ICT programmes from students and more broadly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, through the Central Applications Office, CAO, system, and these trends are outlined in more detail in the written submission.</p><p> In support of these positive trends, the ICT action plan launched in January 2012 represents a whole-of-government response to addressing the deficit in ICT skills in which the higher education sector is playing a key role.  As part of the implementation of the plan, a key target of which is to double the number of ICT graduates by 2018, the ICT skills programme of the HEA is supporting the delivery in partnership with industry of 23 new one-year graduate conversion courses in ICT, providing 818 free places on courses offered by 16 higher education providers.  Featuring accredited work placements, these courses are equipping graduates with core computing and programming skills as well as with a range of specialisations in niche areas of growth potential such as cloud computing and web development.</p><p> In light of the high demand for places on these courses, I am delighted to inform members, if they are not aware of the development, that at the end of last week, the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills issued a call for proposals for further courses to be provided under the ICT skills programme in 2013.  This places a strong emphasis on the quality of industry-academic partnership in the design, development and delivery of programmes.  In the context of today's discussion, this is a really positive development.</p><p> The HEA&rsquo;s Springboard initiative, in which one third of all places are on ICT courses, is also having a positive impact on the supply of ICT graduates.  To date, there have been 750 graduates from ICT courses at NFQ levels 6 to 9, with a further 2,000 ICT graduates expected before the end of 2012 and during 2013.  A review and report on early employment outcomes is under way in respect of those who have graduated thus far and will be available shortly.</p><p> On foreign languages, vital importance for the economy of enhancing our skills base in foreign languages is acknowledged but is less well understood in terms of student demand patterns.  We have seen modest growth in undergraduate enrolments in foreign languages taken as a single subject in the period between 2007 and 2010 and we understand that modularisation and semesterisation of undergraduate programmes is increasing the opportunities for students across all disciplines to study a foreign language as an accredited part of their degree.  The HEA is undertaking research to establish a comprehensive and accurate picture of all foreign language programme provision in Irish higher education.  Preliminary results of this research indicate that European languages, as well as Chinese and Japanese, are studied as a component of a very broad range of disciplines across business, the arts, the humanities and the sciences.  Rather than being the primary focus of study, they comprise parts of other programmes.  The priority will be to mobilise student demand for the language learning opportunities that increasingly are available.</p><p> On food production and technology, as indicated in the report by the expert group on future skills needs, Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally, the food and beverage sector is key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth.  This is reflected in the wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in food production and technology that are offered at NFQ levels 6 to 10 across universities and institutes of technology in Ireland.  These all have benefitted from the growing demand for science and technology programmes in Irish higher education.  In addition, a number of part-time courses in the area are being provided through Springboard 2012, building on the 247 places allocated in 2011.  A total of 125 people graduated in the summer of 2012 from Springboard food and beverage courses, with a similar number completing courses and due to graduate before the end of 2012 and during 2013.</p><p> To remain reasonably within time, I will truncate my remarks by stating we anticipate the national strategy for higher education, the implementation of which the HEA now is leading, will lead to greater effectiveness overall in the higher education sector and particularly in respect of having the higher education sector deliver on major strategic national objectives.  I wish to mention one relevant point.  In the concluding paragraph of my written opening statement, I note that engagement, together with teaching as well as learning and research, is one of the three pillars on which the national strategy is based.  This is engagement in its widest sense but engagement with enterprise is a key element.  Recognising this, within the next week I will appoint from within the HEA's current resources a senior member of staff to take a lead role in enterprise-higher education liaison.  The key focus of the role will be to develop an overarching HEA strategy for engagement with specific reference to engagement with the enterprise business sectors to promote proactively the enterprise engagement strategy within the HEA, to support the creation of an enhanced level of understanding of enterprise needs and to promote proactively the enterprise engagement strategy in the higher education system as a whole for the purpose of achieving identified outcomes.  I apologise to the Chair if I have overstayed my welcome.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned Costello" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112000004#E00300"><p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to discuss these important issues relating to skills in ICT, foreign languages and food production and technology.  I also thank the joint committee for its recent review of ICT skills demand, the launch of which I had the opportunity to attend a few weeks ago.  In preparing for this meeting with colleagues, we were conscious of the need to avoid excessive duplication in our submissions to the joint committee and, therefore, in the accompanying Irish Universities Association, IUA, submission, we thought it would be helpful to begin by considering the general labour market position, both overall and on a sectoral level.  In this regard, I am particularly grateful to my colleagues in the F&Aacute;S skills and labour market research unit, who are responsible for the publication, Monitoring Ireland's Skills Supply.</p><p>  The enterprise needs into which the joint committee is inquiring span industry and services and these sectors are of enormous importance in GDP and exporting terms.  While by and large, they are characterised by high levels of productivity, it must be remarked that such growing productivity, combined with the effects of the recession, in some respects militates against their employment performance.</p><p>  In that regard, employment in the industrial sector declined at an average of 4.6% per annum, with total employment contracting by 61,000 in the period since 2006.  That is the overall sectoral position but within that picture, however, there are positive signs.  In particular, employment in the food and beverages industry recently has bucked the trend by expanding by 13% between 2010 and 2011.  Likewise, employment in medium to high technology manufacturing expanded by 4.6%, albeit that the pure high technology employment figure did not fare quite as well.  Clearly, the labour market in the sector remains somewhat volatile.  Employment in knowledge intensive services, the complement to manufacturing, performed better overall, with total employment averaging 815,000 in 2011 and growing by an average of 1.2% per annum since 2006.</p><p>  If one turns to ICT specifically, the segment performed better than the overall sector average, growing employment by 1.5% per annum on average.  However, there has been a notable increase in employment recently in that the sector added 6,000 jobs between 2010 and 2011.  This was an increase of 8.5%, which clearly is an improvement on the historical trend.  From previous experience, which is relevant to matching skills supply and educational output, it is known that the ICT sector can be both volatile and cyclical.  Therefore, it is difficult to state whether the current highly encouraging increases in employment represent a genuine deflection point in the curve of growth and whether this upward trend will continue, but of course we are optimistic that it will.</p><p>  A challenge for both industry and the higher education sector is the interface between skills and labour shortages.  In this regard, in the sectors under review, it is likely that the shortages are a mix of the two.  Our submission refers to the various vacancy surveys, which indicate that employers frequently seek staff with both a minimum of two years' experience and specific skills, which can be in quite narrow sub-disciplinary areas of technology.  This brings into focus the importance of conversion courses, to which Mr. Boland referred, part-time education and internships, and that there are more routes into such jobs than simply directly from third level.</p><p>  Before speaking in detail about education outputs in their specific sectors, I refer to section 4 of our submission, in which we provide a breakdown of employment by sector and both enrolments and graduations by discipline.  This was supplied to demonstrate the function of higher education is to meet the overall skills needs of the economy.  In that regard, it can be seen from the tables contained in the submission that the sectoral make-up of employment is quite well matched by a similar diversity in the overall intake and output of higher education.</p><p>  However, reverting to sectoral issues, there are strong levels of participation in science, mathematics and computing, as well as in engineering, which make up 18% and 8%, respectively, of the total undergraduate enrolments.  At postgraduate level, computer science as a discipline accounts for 31% of total full-time science, mathematics and computing enrolments.  In meeting the skills needs of the economy, there are elements of push and pull at work, in the sense that increased labour market demand influences student choice and, at the same time, increasing supply can have a positive momentum in the creation of new firms and new jobs.  In the latter regard, we refer in our submission to the increase of 63% in Central Applications Office science, technology, mathematics and engineering applications between 2008 and 2012.</p> <p><font color="#2F2F2F">We also refer to how investments in research in the education sphere are paying off.  This is reflected in an increase of almost 2,000 in the numbers of researchers working in business between 2001 and 2009.  That is the latest data we have.  The success of the national research and innovation strategy is also reflected in the growing proportion of new FDI projects in the research space and the expansion of Irish multinationals, such as the Kerry Group's recent announcement of a major research and development project to be located in the Naas region.  These efforts will be further focused by the outworking of the research prioritisation exercise and we reflect that in the submission. </font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F"> In terms of meeting future skills demands of the economy in the technology sector, we place particular emphasis on the importance of mathematics as a foundation discipline and we refer in our submission to the importance of bonus points for mathematics in increasing the uptake of mathematics and increasing attainment in the leaving certificate on foot of it.</font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F"> As regards the languages issue, it is more difficult to pin down than ICT skills which map well to individual disciplines in higher education and lend themselves to the kind of initiatives that are now being pursued under the ICT action plan.  This has surfaced in the EGFSN skills for trade report, on which we are actively engaging with the universities.</font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F"> Encouragingly, because of modularisation it is likely that there is more exposure on the part of students to language education than the EGFSN report may have been able to capture when it was undertaken.  It is also worth noting that HEA data from 2007-10 show a welcome 12.9% increase in undergraduate student enrolments in foreign languages, where these are taken as full degree programmes.  This is despite stagnating or decreasing number of students taking foreign languages during the same period for the leaving certificate.  Clearly, that is a pipeline issue that needs to be addressed. </font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F"> Finally on this topic, we also refer to the importance of internationalisation in higher education.  This encompasses foreign students studying in Ireland and also study abroad by Irish students.  I might mention a development that has happened since we made our submission.  We are concerned about the increase in the visa charge which was announced recently by the GNIB.  The doubling of that charge will not do anything for our competitiveness in the international education market. </font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F"> I am conscious of time, so I would like to conclude by referring briefly to the issue of broad skills.  We refer in our submission to the industry round table, which is a high level reflection of the constant interaction between the universities and industry in identifying matters of common concern and addressing them.  Our submission includes a progress report from the last round table meeting. </font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F"> One issue that arises regularly is the importance of transversal skills such as creativity and problem solving.  In this regard, it is vital that education does not become overly instrumentalist and narrow.  This was a concern raised with us by the Minister for Education and Skills when he asked us to look at selection and entry mechanisms for higher education.  As part of that work we are looking at how common entry routes to university can be expanded, both to broaden the first year experience and also to facilitate upstream change in the leaving certificate.  For balance, we are also looking at whether we can better incentivise strategically important subjects going beyond what we have done with bonus points for maths.  We are therefore looking both at the broad and the specific.  In that regard, we will be reporting to the Minister on those issues by year end.</font></p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Murphy" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112000005#F00300"><p>I wish to thank the Chairman and other members of the joint committee for the invitation to participate in today's discussion.  With me today is Mr. Denis Cummins, president of Dundalk Institute of Technology.</p><p>  At the outset, we compliment the joint committee, and particularly Senator Clune, for its work in reviewing the information and communication technology skills demand.  I intend to keep our opening remarks quite short and would point out that the institutes of technology have a stronger presence in STEM subjects - that is science, technology, engineering and maths - than in languages and food production which are mentioned in the committee's invitation.</p><p>  When IOTI met with the committee around this time last year, we gave a comprehensive overview of the work we were undertaking to try better to match skills supply with skills demand.  As a member of the Forf&aacute;s expert group on future skills needs, I am also conscious of the significant contribution of the work of that group to this important debate.</p><p>  Whilst today's discussion will understandably focus on ICT skills gaps and how best to address them, we should not lose sight of the positives.  The fact is that, today, the ICT industry in Ireland employs over 90,000 people and the top ten technology companies in the world have a base here.  Those companies say they are not here just for the favourable corporation tax rate or EU market access.  Collectively, Ireland is doing quite a lot right but we should always be conscious that we can and must continually improve. </p><p>  I will cite an example of some of the improvements that have been made since we last met the committee, involving my own institution, Cork Institute of Technology.  In 2011, CIT initiated the first masters degree in cloud computing in the world and we have just produced our first 65 graduates in that discipline.  The success of this programme has meant that it is oversubscribed both nationally and internationally.  When I say internationally, we have had students from Russia, India, America and China.  Not only is the programme's subject matter cloud computing, but it is also delivered by the cloud even to the stage where the labs are virtualised. </p><p>  Critically important, however, is the fact that the programme was developed and continues to evolve in collaboration with the EMC corporate centres of excellence worldwide, so that it remains a high quality, relevant and state-of-the-art programme.  The lecturers are drawn not only from academia in Ireland and abroad but also from the industry.  The students are attracted by the fact that a state-of-the-art programme is being delivered here. </p><p>  Similarly, in response to the twin issues of a shortage of graduates in IT with language skills, Dundalk lnstitute of Technology has developed an honours degree programme to produce software professionals who have a high level of proficiency in French.</p><p>  The committee's ICT report highlights many of the issues which the institutes of technology encounter on a daily basis.  We agree with the conclusion in the committee's report that it is crucial to bring a greater understanding of ICT, and in particular ICT as a career choice, to the second-level classroom and curriculum.  For a long time now, we have been cognisant of this vital link and the institutes have many initiatives in this area.  Perhaps the most notable of these initiatives right now is the CoderDojo movement, which is supported and hosted by institutes of technology around the country.  While these initiatives are important, they are no replacement for the integration of ICT, and computer programming in particular, into the formal curriculum.  The IOTI would support and facilitate any such initiative.</p><p>  We also believe that there is a constant need to devote attention and resources to the continued professional development of teachers in the use of ICT in teaching many subjects.  In referring to continued professional development we are not talking about the development of content.  There is plenty of content.  We are talking about the delivery by teachers to students, not just a once-off course but continuing professional development.</p><p>  ICT is a broad field and careers in ICT are many and varied.  They range from multi-media and design through to support and administration, management and strategy, and software engineering to name just a few.  It would be misleading to give the impression that a very high level of mathematical competence is a prerequisite for all, or even most, ICT careers.  However, there are fundamental building blocks of knowledge which are common to the fields of mathematics and ICT, including problem synthesis and problem solving.  This is why IOTI broadly supports the direction being taken by the project maths initiative, which primarily focuses on developing the students' skillsets in these fundamental areas.</p><p>  As well as improving ICT literacy, the institutes believe it is important that second-level students are given a sense of what a career in ICT could entail.  To this end, we have sponsored and brokered enterprise-to-school relationships allowing second-level students to tour ICT facilities and bringing ICT professionals - very often our graduates - into schools to speak to students.</p><p>  A related area of activity concerns the many ICT entrepreneurship and innovation competitions run by institutes of technology for second-level schools and students.  These serve the twin purpose of improving ICT skills as well as giving the student a sense of what it would be like to be an ICT professional.</p><p>  Turning to the recruitment of school-leavers into third-level ICT courses, the figures still remain relatively low in comparison with the high water mark of the mid to late 1990s.  In the last five years, however, we have seen a 40% increase in the numbers undertaking studies in ICT-related programmes.  Past experience has also shown us that this increase will result in a more engaged and committed cohort of students, and this will ultimately lead to improved retention and completion rates.</p> <p>As well as the standard cohort of school leavers, all the institutes have been active in providing accessible and flexible programme delivery to encourage a broad range of non-standard students to pursue information and communication technology, ICT, programmes.  The committee earlier heard about the Springboard programme run by the Higher Education Authority.  One useful and productive initiative is the ICT skills level 8 conversion programme which commenced this year and is in the middle of its first cycle.  This programme provides the opportunity for professionals and graduates who already have a level 8 degree in a discipline other than ICT to improve their skills by providing them with a level 8 qualification in ICT.  Nationwide, there are more than 700 students enrolled in these programmes and there is significant unmet demand from prospective students for additional places and courses.</p><p> In general, these students are above average in their commitment and motivation, leading to positive outcomes in programme completion and employability after graduation.  These conversion programmes were built with the ICT industry, which also provided many internships.  Many of these internships are now turning into permanent jobs.  It has been a success for students coming off the live register, taking a course and securing employment at the end.</p><p> Another good example is the programme in Dundalk Institute of Technology which specialises in the area of health care computing.  This programme was developed in consultation with the medical device industry.  This industry is cognisant of the safety-critical nature of medical device software and the ongoing requirement for graduates who are well versed in highly effective software practices.  We believe the proposed graduate skills conversion programme will be equally successful in providing similar reskilling opportunities to a different cohort of students.  We encourage the roll-out of this initiative as soon as possible.  Initiatives such as these have the highest potential for addressing skill shortages in the ICT industries in the short to medium term.  We would encourage not only their continuation but their expansion.</p><p> We thank the committee for its work on the ICT skills issue and we are very happy to participate in today's discussion.</p></speech>

Meeting skills continues to be our tradition to this day.  We see it as part of a continuum of creating new industries and supplying those who work in them.  Appendix 3 of our submission lists 57 businesses that have come out of technology transfer activities in DIT, meaning we are intimately related to them.  In every programme we initiate, there is industry participation in its development and ongoing revalidation.  Industry and professional bodies are embedded in the creation of our programmes, particularly in those we deliver through Skillnets and Springboard.  We also validate the programmes of other providers such as IBEC&rsquo;s CPD diploma in management and the Digital Skills Academy CPD diploma in digital media production.</p><p>  We will accelerate these developments in our new campus in Grangegorman where we will have much more opportunity for bringing these activities together.  This will allow us to develop new provision in ICT, as well as languages and food technology.  This will also see more cross-disciplinary work.  We have a strong corporate partnership network.  My office is directly charged with ensuring DIT has links at the highest levels with major employers.  The focus of the corporate partnership network is the tourism, energy and ICT sectors.</p><p>  ICT makes up 50% of courses at DIT and it accounts for 24% of the national overall ICT programme total, which makes us a significant provider.  There are 2,000 students registered on ICT-related programmes coming out of the Springboard initiative.  These are construction people converting their quantity surveyor or building project management skills, for example, into skills for the ICT sector.  Our masters programme in software development is organised with Ericsson and its 50 graduates are guaranteed jobs with the company.  Again, some of these people came from the construction sector.  Our international ICT sales programme, which has been generously supported by Enterprise Ireland, has had 500 graduates, many of whom are working in the ICT sales sector.  DIT is also an international leader in digital marketing.</p><p>  We have 1,200 students in food production technology courses covering disciplines such as culinary arts as well as food engineering and the development of food manufacturing processes.  We also have a programme in food product development funded by Springboard.  One of the skills deficiencies identified in the food production technology area is supply-chain management or getting the product to market.  We have very strong programmes in this area with over 270 students enrolled in them.  DIT is also the home of the National Institute for Transport and Logistics.  Since we sent in our submission, the Positive2Work Skillnet, which is made up of small to medium-sized enterprises in the retail and food sector, is concluding discussions with us to offer a CPD diploma in logistics, supply chain and supervisory management for 30 students, which will be made up of employees in the food industry, with a route on to the part-time masters in business studies we offer.  Another development in the food industry is the movement towards nutraceuticals.  There are many highly developed companies in this area already in Ireland and DIT provides a BSc in nutraceuticals with over 100 students.</p><p>  The teaching of foreign languages is embedded in many of our programmes.  In DIT, a practically oriented institution, a language is a prerequisite for all 2,500 students; the languages include Italian, French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Irish and English.  Many of the programmes have been developed to ensure students spend a semester abroad studying.  For example, Irish students will learn Chinese in China for a year as part of a programme of international business and Chinese.</p></speech>

The committee is interested in ICT skills and many of the institutes assisted in preparing a report for the committee on this area.  The ICT action plan is welcome and is well regarded by industry.  The conversion courses are doing very well and it is encouraging that Mr. Boland said these would expand.  As Dr. Murphy said, those who take on these courses are very committed.</p> <p>It is very positive.  Certainly, the committee intends to keep that to the fore and examine it regularly.</p><p> The committee is looking at this area to gauge the interaction between industry and higher education.  I accept there must be education in a broad sense as well as giving students the capability to think for themselves and perhaps change their career path as they go through life.  When the expert group on future skills needs was before the committee to discuss ICT, it pointed to languages and the food sector.  In the foreign language area, PayPal stated it could not get the graduate skills it needed in this country.  The expert group stated we should have a foreign language policy across all education sectors.  Does anybody care to comment on that?  Would they agree?  I accept that languages are difficult to extract but, none the less, it arises time and again that the lack of foreign languages among graduates is an important issue.</p><p> In the food and drink sector, we received a submission recently in which it was stated the author had to fly to Heathrow, take a room there and interview applicants because he could not get the necessary skills in this country.  In 2009, the expert group to which I referred outlined in a report on the food and drink sector that the deficit in skills was in supply chain management, operative skills, commercial acumen and innovation - many of the types of skills mentioned today.  In the report, the group called for the establishment of an inter-agency, third level institute and industry forum to discuss and address the ongoing skills, trading and development needs of the industry.  Has that been put in place?  There is much information from and engagement between those in industry, and that would help as well.  There are others who have questions as well, but perhaps the witnesses would address those areas.</p></speech>

I got a sense from the four presentations that those most connected to this problem and most connected to business are the institutes of technology, ITs, that is, Dr. Murphy, Mr. Cummins and their colleagues.  Even from their presentation, they seemed to hit on exactly the areas at which the committee is looking.</p><p>  I have a couple of questions.  First, to all of those present, a key issue is guidance at second level in order that students are fully prepared and given the appropriate information at second level before they even get to the ITs.  What are their thoughts about the changes and the cuts to guidance provision and does it have the potential to exacerbate the problem with skills?</p><p>  On my concern about complacency, I welcome the appointment of the enterprise liaison person, but it is November 2012.  Is Mr. Boland telling the committee that the HEA had not even thought before 2012 that it might be handy or worthwhile to have an enterprise liaison person, and if not, why?  We are almost five years into the crisis and enterprise is supposed to be at the heart of the rebirth, regardless of politics.  The HEA is only now making that appointment, welcome as it is.  Where has it been?  Who has had that function for the past five years?</p><p>  Mr. Boland commented that the ITs had responded well.  How many places in the HEA and IT system were construction related in 2007 and how many are construction related today?</p><p>  On foreign languages, the expert group highlighted a concern about an anticipated lack of suitable candidates in languages.  Surely, we should have seen this coming.  Some of the languages they cite are European languages.  Twenty years ago, in various referenda, we were told we all had to learn German.  They are citing a shortage of proficient German speakers.  We are talking not only about Chinese or the languages of the BRIC countries but also about traditional European trading languages.  What exactly are those present doing in that regard and how did a situation arise where language deficiency was the cause in many cases for 500 of 1,000 jobs having to be filled from outside the jurisdiction?  There is a preference for native speakers, but surely we cannot have that.</p><p>  What interaction do the groups have with IDA Ireland on its work?  When IDA Ireland is out pitching this country, does it engage with them at any level on the skills they can provide?  If IDA Ireland is pitching Ireland as a destination, can it tell from the HEA, the Irish Universities Association, the DIT or the ITs what exactly is in the system?</p><p>  The institutes of technology sector seems to be the one sector which is on top of the issue about which we are concerned.  In a previous committee, we visited Dundalk to look at the work Dundalk Institute of Technology was doing in renewables.  That was four years ago and Dundalk was ahead of the curve then.  I am well aware of IT Sligo and GMIT.  They are so ahead of the curve.  Athlone IT has a fantastic course, which I gather is about to be pulled because of lack of funding, that allows electricians who are no longer in demand to convert their skills to manufacturing positions.  There is nearly 100% employment out of that course and they are concerned about the funding of it.  I say to the IT sector to keep at it because it seems to be on top of it.  Perhaps the others could learn from the IT sector in terms of its connectivity with industry.</p></speech>

I also commend Senator Clune on her work in this area on what is now, I suppose, an all-party report on this issue.  I thank Senator Clune for her contribution and lead on the issue.</p><p>  To put the matter in context, between quarter one of 2007 and quarter one of 2012, the economy of the State lost in excess of 300,000 jobs.  That is where we need look.  Sometimes we can look at issues as a panacea and, while obviously important, they are not a panacea.  Having said that, the information and communications technology industry gained 9,200 jobs over that period and now employs more than 75,000.  As a sector, it is still the second smallest employment sector and employs 4.2% of all employees.  When one sets that against agriculture, forestry and fishing, where 27,000 jobs have been lost, it provides the context.</p><p>  We all would accept that there is a need to grow all sectors of the economy and to tackle structural employment and growing levels of unemployment.  No doubt long-term unemployment is a big issue.  Some 60% of those unemployed have been out of work for over a year.  It strikes me that most of the focus, at least from the bodies, is on degree level and research and development.  That is okay, but not all jobs in the agrifood sector or even the ICT sector require degree level intervention.  We need to look at re-skilling and the unemployed.  The committee visited Waterford a couple of days ago and heard from the city enterprise board about FETAC level courses, for example, in the horticulture sector.  We need to look at a swathe of persons who are long-term unemployed, who have skills and in whose case it is merely about re-skilling, and not necessarily about degrees.</p><p>  I refer to the all-island potential here as well.  It is obvious the skills within the ICT language sector are highly mobile.  There is obviously an all-island labour market because we are an island, but there is limited funding to all third level institutions across the island.  What steps are the third level institutions in the State taking to develop all-island approaches to skills shortages in both jurisdictions to ensure we make best use of resources?</p><p>  On early development of language and ICT skills, the institutions of technology submissions look at the development of skills within second level.  This is something on which we spoke to Senator Clune in the formulation of her report.  What is the role of the third level sector in supporting teaching skills in curriculum development within primary and second school?  When one looks at ICT, STEM and language skills developments, I am somebody who started off very young with computers.  I started off with the Commodore 64 and worked my way up, I assume, the same as many others in this room.</p> <p>Dr. Murphy referred to CoderDojo, which is a very good concept.  We would like to see ICT as a curriculum issue at second level.  </p><p> To put the issue in a wider context, certain regions of the State - the south east being a good example - were heavily dependent on manufacturing over a period of 30 to 40 years.  There was little incentive for a young person growing up 30 years ago to remain in school or continue to college because he or she could, for example, get a job in Waterford Crystal or the foundry.  There was little focus on developing opportunities in terms of skills and training.  That needs to change because we are in a completely different space and we have to start in primary and secondary schools.  I am a great believer in innovation, creative thinking and thinking outside the box.  Third level is important but students at primary and second levels have to be given the space and encouragement to get there.  How can the third level sector assist in making that a reality?</p></speech>

I presume this co-operation is the outworking of earlier decisions as to what skills would be needed.  We have existing provisions in management of technology and innovation and new programmes are coming on stream in the area of logistics and supply chain management.</p><p>  It is important that appropriate guidance be provided at second level but how best to provide it is a decision that needs to be taken in the context of second level education overall.  Whether it should involve one set of guidance counsellors or permeate the curriculum more broadly is a moot question because if one corrals guidance to one area it does not permeate the curriculum.  The curriculum should set subject context and application.  One application of knowledge is career development.  We also need a much broader range of guidance because often the reason individuals pursue certain careers is because of role models, including parents, uncles and brothers.  That can have as great an influence on where people study as formal guidance.</p><p>  In terms of links with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, we offer a number of programmes for Enterprise Ireland and are actively involved in our technology transfer programme.  We have strong engagement with inward investors through IDA and organisations like the American Chamber of Commerce and other chambers of commerce in respect of construction programmes.  Companies actively participate in the committees that work on the inception and development of new programmes.  It is a critical part of our work.  No programme exists in DIT unless there is demand for it.</p><p>  On the broader issue of employment, issues arise in terms of addressing social and educational disadvantage which can appear at a wide variety of points in life.  These issues are not simply confined to teenagers but discussing them would take more time than is available to us.  I draw members' attention to our mature student access programme, which assists those who would not normally expect to participate in higher education.  We currently fund the programme by recycling the resources we obtain from international students.  Previously it was supported by philanthropy.  The programme has not been a burden on the State, therefore.  It gives access to courses at a variety of levels and enables students to find their own levels.  It is oriented towards a redirection and reinvigoration of where people are coming from.</p><p>  The numbers involved in the built environment programme has decreased by approximately 700 in the past several years.  DIT is the largest provider of built environment education in the State.</p></speech>

The number of places at the beginning of courses probably decreased by 120.  Other institutions have ceased entirely to provide such programmes and we are one of a limited number of providers in certain areas, such as architecture.  The growth in ICT and food is comparable with the decrease in built environment.  There has been a shift from areas in decline to subjects growing in popularity.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Boland" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112000008#J00700"><p>Senator Clune asked about the connection between higher education and enterprise and how one could know what the other was doing.  It is a complex issue, to state the obvious.  My experience in the Higher Education Authority suggests that, by and large, if the demand exists the higher education system will meet it, whether in one or multiple institutions.  ICT is a good example of this.  During the slowdown in demand for ICT skills, the system left in place a large part of the infrastructure which meant the institutions were ready to respond quickly when demand picked up again.  In respect of languages, there is little point in the institutions providing places by themselves if there is insufficient demand elsewhere.  Senator Cullinane spoke about a whole of education approach.  In that context, the issue of guidance is important.  I cannot comment on the cuts because I do not know enough about them but getting information to young people and, more importantly, their parents on potential opportunities is important in these disciplines.  I do not want to be overly confident but there are positive signs in the ICT area.  Judging by the growth in demand the message that good careers can be developed appears to be reaching home.  A similar exercise needs to be done in regard to languages but it is probably a slow process.  It is a question of taking a whole of education approach.  Overall, the higher education system tends to be flexible in responding to emerging needs.</p><p>  In regard to the implied criticism of the HEA's efforts on enterprise liaison, it would be fair to criticise us if we had done nothing before now.  In fact, however, the HEA is represented on the expert group for future skills and we have a close relationship with IBEC, with which we are developing a national employer survey.  We also manage the ICT skills conversion, Springboard, courses and we invest considerably in the higher education system through the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTI, and the Irish Research Council.  A considerable amount of work is both informed by and supportive of enterprise.  I envisage that in our new role we will have an even bigger impact on this area by bringing it together in a more co-ordinated way.  Rather than inventing something that is entirely new we are trying to increase our impact.</p></speech>

The representative associations are all very fine - I used to work for one - but they are not at the coal face.  Education needs to benefit from experience at the coal face.</p></speech>

I have no capacity to appoint an external person.  However, the way to embrace their direct knowledge is to bring the direct knowledge into the HEA, and we have a plan in that regard.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned IDA Ireland's involvement and how it engages.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland were closely involved in the design of the ICT call and they also have advised on internships for higher education students.  They are very much involved in that area.</p><p>  I will get the Deputy the figures on construction workers; I do not have them with me.  Mr. O'Connor will deal with the industry forum Senator Clune raised.</p></speech>

There is not an equivalent group in the food and drinks sector but we are aware of the employment opportunities in that industry through their feeding into the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  Those opportunities featured in and informed the allocations under Springboard where there are many opportunities for skills conversion and training at levels and in skills relevant to those industries.  We are also confident the growing appetite for science, technology and engineering courses reflected in the CAO will provide sustainable workers for the food industry and the opportunities that will exist in the coming years.</p></speech>

In the submission, we mentioned, for example, the DCU enterprise computing initiative, which addresses a specific skills need in a particular computing area.  Those examples are found in institutions generally, including computer summer schools for secondary school pupils.  There is also strong participation in the CoderDojo movement.  It is not a purely IT event and the first Galway event was held recently with a huge attendance.  We are fully involved in the ICT action plan in the same way as the institutes of technology.</p><p>  However, it is important we have diversity in the higher education system.  A central plank of the higher education strategy is that all institutions should not look like all other institutions and there is an orientation within the university system towards level 9 and level 10 complementing undergraduate education.  That is of huge importance to the technology sector and the future of the country because, in recent years, a significant proportion of IDA foreign direct investment, FDI, projects have been in the research area, not just in technology industries that have a research component but in pure research and development projects.  We are active across all the major sectors.  The SFI CSET programme and the Tyndall Institute in UCC are critical components in embedding and expanding those industries in Ireland.</p><p>  We attempted to show in the submission that much of what goes on in the technology sector is churn and change and that happens constantly.  At an individual institutional level, there is huge day-to-day contact between companies and people at the coalface who design and deliver programmes.  Much of that happens through the research and commercialisation interface.  That is one of the major areas.  It is not only down to FDI because we have the EI technology centres as well, where groups of companies come together to define a technology need with ITs and universities and address it.  There is a rich web of interactions.  The people who come to our university-industry round table are chief executive officers and other senior figures within the industrial sector.  They are not the representatives of the industry representatives associations.  They talk to us directly about their priority needs.</p><p>  I will not comment on the policy regarding the guidance issue because it is a policy decision taken by the Department in the context of resources.  It is clear that the strongest driver of educational provision is the labour market.  As Mr. Boland said, our education system is good at equilibrating supply and demand and when the labour market wants something, students and their parents, who are the main guidance counsellors, vote with their feet and there is a change in behaviour.  That is occurring now in the technology sector, but there will be always be an element of friction in the system.  There is an effect where a demand emerges and, for example, there is a quick increase in employment in the ICT sector but there is inevitably an element of frictional lag before the system catches up.  Sometimes that works the other way and there is an overshoot, as happened during the dotcom bust when significant provision was laid on in response to a major acceleration in demand before the labour market opportunities dried up and we were left with many people on courses for whom there were no jobs.  One can never get this mathematically right but the rebalancing of construction skills with ICT skills is happening across the system as a whole and, therefore, provision responds flexibly and dynamically, but there will be narrow instances of specific skills needs and we have to hone in on them and find ways to address them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Murphy" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112000009#K00400"><p>I thank Senator Clune and Deputy Calleary for their kind words and their engagement.  In some ways, we are always surprised because we regard engagement as built into the DNA of ITs.  It is what we are supposed to do and what we hope we do.  We recognise teaching and learning, innovation, research and engagement with industry at all levels.  People have concentrated on the level 8 conversion but we operate at all levels from level 6, the higher certificate, up to level 10.</p><p>  With regard to active engagement with industry, industry engages with us in course development, updating and developing new courses, providing lecturers in specialised areas where we may not have that specialisation, and providing work placements and internships, as we have seen in many of the conversion programmes.  It is a co-ordinated effort, part of which is linked back to the IDA, because we are conscious that we are part of the IDA's mission to go out, sell and attract.  All of us tend to work with regional IDA offices, which are intimately familiar with what we can do.  If there is a good prospect, we will discuss with officials how we can upskill, train and supply what is needed.  That has worked successfully, as evidenced by FDI.</p><p>  As industry and ICT, in particular, has become more sophisticated, that engagement has changed from upskilling, continuing professional development and providing new graduates to innovation and research.  Nowadays, the forefront of research very often is not within higher education in ICT, it is within the industry itself.  The industry operates on much different timescales.</p> <p>It is also much more protective of its intellectual property so it cannot be measured by the research metrics of publication, etc., and we are very conscious of that.</p><p> We are cognisant that we will offer the skills programmes at level 6 and will also work with our further education suppliers in order to allow people to progress from FETAC into higher education as such.  With the development of SOLAS and with the education and training boards we will see a much closer progression as such built.  However, it does exist and should exist.</p><p> On the question of guidance counsellors, as with the HEA, one does not like to be drawn into another sector and making comments and criticisms.  Members will see from our presentation that we were very conscious that guidance counsellors can describe what an ICT career is like, but getting the student to go out and see what an ICT environment means.  Having professionals from the ICT industry come into the schools is the best way to supplement real guidance.  It is impractical to expect any guidance counsellor to be an expert in the myriad of careers that students may progress to pursue.</p><p> Like DIT, CIT would be a big provider to people to the construction area.  The Deputy is correct in pointing to a 50% to 60% fall-off in entry the construction programmes.  Internally we are trying to maintain those programmes because as the Deputy mentioned, there could be shortages down the road.  Closing programmes is not an option and is not a sensible long-term strategy, so we want to stay there.  We also have to deal with redeploying our staff.  As I am sure many other institutions have done, we have gone into the area of sustainable technologies and energy which are quite closely related to construction on the basis that there will be an industry demand for refit.  We try to redeploy and we have also tried to stay there because we believe there will be shortages in the longer term.</p><p> I will ask my colleague to comment on the language issues and the all-Ireland issues.</p></speech>

It is no longer just a skill, but a fundamental part of any student's education.  For students becoming an adult and surviving regardless of where their careers take them, we are firmly of the belief it needs formal inclusion in the curriculum.</p></speech>

In his opening comments Dr. Murphy gave the example of Dundalk Institute of Technology, where we developed a programme in computing for the health-care industry.  We have industry advisory boards that operate at the level of programme boards.  We have also identified other potential ICT programmes in areas such as green computing, computing for the aviation industry, ambient computing and specialist computing for the entertainment industries.  They came as a result of the direct engagement we had.</p><p>  Senator Clune and Deputy Calleary asked about languages.  It is true that the numbers applying to do language options are very small in our colleges.  As Mr. Boland mentioned, they tend to be combined with other subjects.  So we offer computing with languages and business with languages, rather than an intensive programme in language itself.  A key factor is that in order to become really proficient in language the student needs to spend some time in a country where the language is spoken, ideally through an Erasmus programme either for a semester or for a year.  We have difficulties in encouraging students to travel.  Irish students are less mobile than their European counterparts.  It is our experience and the general experience of colleges that we receive more students than we send out.  I believe there are financial and other issues.</p><p>  Senator Clune mentioned PayPal, which is based in Dundalk a couple of hundred metres from the campus.  That company has difficulty in recruiting and its chief executive, Louise Phelan, has stated that it only wants to recruit native speakers, a point reiterated by Deputy Calleary.  We have been able to help the company recruit because we have many international students from China and other parts of Asia as well as European students.  However, they are not Irish people.  So it is a challenge to get more students to study languages to a level at which they can be proficient - I do not know how one gets to the level of being a native speaker other than by living in the country.</p><p>  Senator Cullinane asked about the all-Ireland approach.  We have worked very closely with the University of Ulster and Dublin City University, mainly on innovation and enterprise support programmes and research.  We have a number of initiatives in areas such as renewable energy and ageing.  However, they would mainly be enterprise supports.  The big challenge for us is to recruit students from Northern Ireland.  There is very little student mobility at present from Northern Ireland.  Given Dundalk's location that is clearly something we are interested to change as is the case for the institutes in Letterkenny and Sligo.  The issue is addressed in our strategic plan.  The numbers at present are very small - we have more students from Beijing than from Newry, which gives an indication of the challenge.</p><p>  This year I was very encouraged in that for the first time students from a Protestant school in Northern Ireland came to our open day.  There are obviously historical and cultural issues that need to be addressed, and now is a better time than in the past.  However, there are also some very practical barriers for students coming from Northern Ireland.  The A-level course is a different model from the leaving certificate and the first undergraduate programmes here are typically designed to build on a leaving certificate, which is generally one year shorter in terms of a cycle and A-levels tend to specialise at that stage.</p><p>  Another practical difficulty is how students from the North are scored.  The scoring system does not favour students from Northern Ireland.  The best student from Northern Ireland with, for example, three A-levels, can only score a maximum of 450 points whereas a student from the Republic can score 600 points and there are other practical barriers.  However, we are interested in recruiting more students not just for the economic benefits but also for the better understanding of different cultures that would result from students mixing and studying together.</p></speech>

There has been an extensive effort to increase participation in Erasmus on the part of the institutions, IBEC and the HEA.  Encouragingly there was an 18% growth in students participating in Erasmus between 2009-10 and 2010-11.  This was an increase of nearly 400 students to more than 2,500.  They travelled to 30 of the 32 participating Erasmus countries and approximately 20% of them undertook a work placement as part of their Erasmus periods abroad.</p><p>  The Senator also asked about a more integrated approach to policy on languages, which we would welcome.  Just as with the work we have been doing on selection and entry to university, the better we can join up all parts of the education system pipeline, the better it will be.  The work the HEA will do on giving us a better picture of exactly what is going on across the sector as a whole will be very helpful.  Clearly the whole geopolitics of where our markets are is changing.  However, we do not see that reflected in the education system as a whole, particularly from second level into third level, which is a major structural issue and is something that we agree needs to be considered.</p></speech>

Someone remarked that the broad needs of the economy might be better served by the institutes of technology sector rather than the university sector.  The backdrop to this is that the institutes emerged from the vocational sector.  For example, Dublin Institute of Technology emerged from City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, CDVEC.  The vocational sector was a 19th century movement in Europe and its rationale was education, training and employability.  It always kept an eye on the workplace and the patterns of the labour market and trained people in that direction.  Employability was the rationale on which the sector operated.  It is still probably part of the culture.  The universities always had a more detached view of the economy.  They remained quite aloof, which was part of their tradition.  There was a tension between the marketplace and the university, one that has caused difficulties for the latter and made it redefine its role in society.  I am sure that resolving and responding to this issue have not been easy in terms of universities' traditions and history.  My observation is intended to outline the backdrop of what the groups involved are doing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1156" speakername="Mary White" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112000011#M00500"><p>I will reiterate my colleague's comments on the contribution of the institutes of technology.  I received a scholarship to attend the college at Bolton Street in 1962.  We did not feel as though we were attending a university.  The institutes' contribution to the economy down the years has been well recognised.  I commend our guests in this regard, including Mr. Costello.</p><p>  Regarding the issue of languages, the Seanad was privileged to be visited by a Nobel laureate of economics, Professor Christopher Pissarides, who works out of the London School of Economics and Political Science, LSE.  I raised a question about the policy decision to make students spend so much time learning Irish when so few leave second level able to speak it.  Our young people's contemporaries on the Continent learn English as a second language.  They are bilingual.  We must address this issue.  I am not saying we should not promote Irish, but people cannot speak it even after spending a certain amount of time every day learning it.  There is also a deficit in terms of speaking European languages.</p><p>  What is the perspective of the HEA on the progress towards the target of doubling the annual output of ICT graduates?</p><p>  I commend Mr. Cummins, president of Dundalk IT, on his role in the Louth Economic Forum, with which I am familiar.  The forum has an action plan on the third level sector and supporting economic development in the north east.</p><p>  With regard to Senator Clune's document, I raised the matter of drop-out rates among ICT students.  What can be done about it?  Professor Pissarides made a point that struck home in terms of my personal experience: young people should have the privilege of finding out what they are good at and studying it.  If they get that chance, they will really try.  It is a beautiful sentiment.  Although I received a scholarship to Bolton Street, I hated my course, but I put up with it.  I was lucky in that I always had a job, but I attended UCD at night to study a subject that I enjoyed more.</p><p>  What can be done about the high drop-out rate among first year ICT students?  Dr. Murphy stated that there was a significant unmet demand from prospective students for additional places and courses.  As there is a quick and effective way of obtaining ICT-qualified graduates, where is the blockage in securing the additional places for the unmet demand?  I wish Professor Norton the best of luck in his second quarter with the infrastructure at Grangegorman.  That campus is a star, as it accounts for 24% of national provision at degree level in ICT, amounting to some 2,000 students.  What is his opinion of what can be done about the drop-out rate?  Is it that young people are not able for or interested in it?  It seems to be a waste.  When we examined the Forf&aacute;s documents some months ago, this struck me as a major issue.</p></speech>

The sector has unquestionably been one of the great successes of the Irish higher education system and has contributed significantly to meeting skills needs in the economy.  However, that praise should not come at the expense of the universities.  The country has been served well by an element that we need to retain, namely, a diverse system of institutions.  I mean "diverse" in terms of the types of outcome they achieve for their graduates and the types of people they attract.  To praise the one should not be to take from the other.  The two sectors are important sides of the same coin, but the higher education strategy challenges them to work together better so that the best of both sectors can be harnessed, particularly in terms of addressing their regions' needs and the wide range of demand from level 6 to level 10.  The institutes of technology have done well, but the universities are no slouches in this space either.</p><p>  I will touch on the question of learning Irish and other languages briefly.  It is a policy minefield.  I am not an educationalist, but the key element in learning Irish seems to be an incentive.  If one does not see the need for or value of learning a language and one does not use it, there is no incentive to excel in learning it.</p></speech>

We are aware of other countries, but parents should have their children learn other languages early, as is the case in other countries.  Does Mr. Boland know what I mean?</p></speech>

There is definitely something about the way Irish is taught or where it lies in the curriculum that does not give optimal outcomes.  However, I am not at all knowledgeable in this regard.  I will ask Dr. O'Connor to deal with the matter of doubling the output - we are close to it - as well as the ICT drop-out rate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muiris O'Connor" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112000011#M01000"><p>I cannot give a definitive update on the target.  Work is ongoing between the HEA and the expert group on future skills needs to assess our progress in that regard.  On the basis of an initial analysis, I am confident that we are on target.  In fact, we may exceed the target.  However, we are not concerned.  As Dr. Murphy observed, there is a significant unmet demand.  The employment outcomes for graduates are good.  We will keep an eye on this issue.</p><p>  In addition to assessing the output of graduates, the expert group is taking stock of industry's ICT skills.</p> <p>It is striking that the ICT graduates are in very high demand, not just in the ICT sector but throughout the economy and that may result in a recalibration of the target.</p><p> Dropout is an issue that affects computer science studies in higher education systems in Ireland and elsewhere more than most.  It is the area where we had the highest rate of dropout when we looked at the issue in the progression report in 2009.  There are a number of reasons including a hangover from the dot-com boom and the drop in entry points being the most critical.  We are very confident that the very steep escalation in CAO entry points for computer courses will lead directly to improved outcomes.  The motivation of students has been greatly enhanced by the employment opportunities of which people are now more generally aware.</p><p> There is no blockage since last Friday's announcement of further places in the ICT skills-conversion programme.  The Springboard courses will run again in 2013 with at least the same scale as in 2012.  That will result in a further 2,000 additional ICT graduates in 2014 and 2015.  That will encompass the full range of qualifications from level 6 to level 9.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned Costello" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112000012#N00200"><p>I might just follow Dr. O'Connor with some slight contextualisation of the dropout on the ICT side.  There is a strong correlation with mathematical attainment in the leaving certificate, which is why we believe that is an issue that must be addressed.  Dr. O'Connor is correct that when points fall, as they did, because of demand, it meant that students could get in with fewer points, which was reflected in non-progression rates.</p><p>  On the point Deputy Conaghan made-----</p></speech>

Our university system is better in terms of employability of graduates.  Narrow disciplinary focus does not equate with employability.  We have highly employable graduates and all the OECD data show that the returns to higher education and to higher qualifications in higher education are very high in Ireland.</p><p>  Senator White raised an interesting point about a student finding out what he or she likes and pursuing it.  That underpins much of our thinking about broader entry routes.  While that again might seem slightly contradictory to meeting narrow skills needs, it offers potential for students to enter a more broadly based route into university, find out what they like within that broad discipline and specialise in it from second year onwards.  There is the reality that I often see reflected, which is that many of us start off at primary degree level in things that we do not end up pursuing for life and we go on and achieve other qualifications.  Indeed I have experience of that, myself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian Norton" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112000012#N00500"><p>I am grateful for the kind comments on Grangegorman, but I stress that it is not an end but a means to an end.  One of the ends is the idea of new routes and new opportunities in higher education.  Students should be aware of other opportunities and be able to grasp them.  New programmes can then emerge that begin to combine languages and different disciplines.  The Grangegorman project is about creating the flexibilities that enable institutions such as DIT to continue with the strong traditions the Deputy identified earlier.</p><p>  As sadly I am not Irish I do not feel the capacity to comment on the Irish language issue, except to make the observation that in other jurisdictions where second languages are taught, that second language is taught in such a way as to get a facility for the acquisition of language.  There may be something in the way that the Irish language is taught that creates an ability to acquire other languages and their understanding.  That is often why one ends up with a multilingual situation elsewhere.  That might be a comment out of ignorance more than anything else.</p><p>  I wish to reiterate some of the earlier points about dropout rates.  It relates to maths ability and additional points requirement, and it is about motivation.  DIT, for example, has a very professional learning teacher technology centre that works with colleagues in a particular discipline, looking at the pattern of assessment, how students engage, etc., to ensure they are fully engaged in their studies.  Most of the dropout is in the first semester of the first year and it is about adjustment from second level to third level and finding oneself.  After that it is very low.</p><p>  Dr. Connor mentioned that there are many more places in conversion courses.  In previous rounds, for example, where there have been other providers which have not had a complete uptake of places, some of them have been transferred to DIT so that demand has taken up.  We would do as much in the conversion area as resources would permit and there are always resource limits to these things.</p></speech>

There is considerably more behind the scenes than people might see in a headline discussion.  It was worthwhile and we will discuss it with Ministers also.  It is about prioritisation and matching resources with the demand.  In all areas the institutions have adapted to give students a choice to move quickly into an area, to specialise early or to take a longer route.  I also compliment them on their daytime and night-time courses.  We need to have flexibility on course choice and method of studying.</p><p>  I have a view on student dropout.  Given the pressures coming out of second level, there is not enough time spent preparing students to adapt to third level education.  It is a completely different world in terms of what they are supposed to do and taking on responsibility for themselves.  We should probably make greater use of summer holidays to get people ready.  They should have more career courses and spend more time abroad in certain areas.  They should spend more time in fourth and fifth year before the final push on the leaving certificate.  It is clear there is a big difference between leaving second level in June and arriving in third level in September, and not enough is done on preparing them for that.  We might engage with the witnesses on that topic in future.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses for attending and I believe the meeting was very worthwhile.  What we discussed feeds into the report by Senator Clune.  We hope to have a rolling report every six or seven months and we will also engage with the Minister next week.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to put them on silent mode.  They must be switched off because otherwise they will interfere with the broadcasting equipment.</p><p>  The first item on the agenda is an exchange of views with the European Union Affairs Committee of the Latvian Parliament.  I am delighted to welcome a delegation from the Saeima, the Latvian Parliament.  It comprises Mrs. Zanda Kalnina-Lukasevica, chairperson of the EU affairs committee, and Mr. Vjaceslavs Dombrovskis, chairperson of the economic, agricultural, environmental and regional policy committee.  We are also joined by the Latvian Ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Peteris Karlis Elferts.  You are all very welcome.  The delegation is on a short visit to Ireland in advance of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January 2013.  During its visit to the D&aacute;il and Seanad the delegation will also meet representatives from the agriculture and finance committees.</p><p>  The purpose of the delegation's visit to Ireland is to gain an insight into the priorities of our forthcoming Presidency.  Latvia has started the preparations for its Presidency which will happen in 2015.  Issues of particular interest to the delegation are the EU budget, the position with the multi-annual financial framework, Cohesion Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy.  The members of the delegation also wish to talk about the future of Europe and particularly the eurozone and the euro crisis.  That is certainly something we would like to discuss.  Latvia is still willing to join the euro at the end of 2014.</p> <p>We look forward to a discussion on that.  I would also like to discuss the youth guarantee and youth unemployment.  I invite Mrs Zanda Kalnina-Lukasevica, chairman of the European affairs committee, to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

It is already a tradition of the European affairs committee of our Parliament to pay a visit to the Parliament of the forthcoming EU Presidency.  We have close economic and social ties with Ireland and therefore it is necessary to have deeper interparliamentary co-operation.  We hope we will be able to develop it.</p><p>  We are happy to see the Irish Parliament actively involved in the EU policy-making process.  This is the approach to be taken by countries with parliamentary democracy.  Domestic policy and legislation cannot be separated from the process of shaping EU policy and legislation.  We hope the upcoming European Council will bring us all closer to a sustainable and fair multi-annual financial framework for the EU, meaning the Irish Presidency will continue fulfilling a significant and important task of leading negotiations on the programming of EU financial instruments.  In this respect, we hope for productive co-operation.</p><p>  As the Chairman mentioned, discussions on the multi-annual financial framework on economic growth in Europe is central to our work.  Today, the most important task is to create favourable conditions for economic growth and jobs.  Therefore, this discussion is important in seeking ways to create stability and confidence in the European economy and confidence in the euro.  Strengthening the role of national parliaments, and especially co-operation between parliaments, can help us to reach these goals.  Therefore, we are happy to share our views on the multi-annual financial framework, the cohesion policy and the Common Agricultural Policy.  My colleagues will share our views in more detail.</p><p>  Last but not least, during Ireland's previous EU Presidency, Latvia acceded to the European Union.  During the forthcoming Irish Presidency, we look forward to a decision on Latvia's accession to the eurozone.  It is a significant development from one Irish Presidency, when we entered European Union, to the next, when the decision on our accession to the eurozone will be taken.</p></speech>

Both are small countries and both have spent some time in recent history struggling to regain their national identity after being part of an empire.  It is only 20 years since Latvia left the Soviet empire.  The third similarity is the commitment and drive for economic development.  Since Latvia joined the European Union, Ireland has been a special country for us.  We have been inspired by Ireland's example of rapid economic development and have always sought to emulate it.  In our period of high economic growth, we liked to call ourselves the Baltic tiger, after the Celtic tiger.  Many similar things have happened to the two countries since that time and there are many ways in which we are alike, although not all are as we thought they would be.  Latvia has had a painful emigration record over the past ten years; 10% of the population left to look for jobs and better lives in other countries, with the United Kingdom and Ireland representing two major destinations.  There was a major economic crisis similar to Ireland's, with financial globalisation, excessive capital flows, reckless borrowing, a real estate boom and resulting shadow cities, a large percentage of bad loans and the recapitalisation of major banks by Latvian taxpayers.  There is also the painful experience of adjustment under a fixed exchange rate, just like Ireland.  We have gone through some painful fiscal consolidation.  Public sector pay has been cut by 35%, on average, over two years.  Now, perhaps, an example we can set to Ireland and other countries in a similar predicament is that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  After finishing with fiscal stabilisation, Latvia had some robust growth, in the order of 4% to 5% of GDP, for two consecutive years.</p></speech>

Mr. Dombrovskis is correct that Ireland and Latvia share many similarities.  We are two of the smaller countries in the European Union and, like Latvia, Ireland has a population of 4.5 million.  The history of Ireland is not dissimilar to that of Latvia.</p><p>  Mr. Dombrovskis mentioned that 10% of the population are living abroad because of the economic recession.  Many of our young people, in particular, have emigrated or are in the process of emigrating.  Also, many Latvians are in our country.  There are many Latvians in my constituency and they work very hard.  They are well liked by people here and they contribute greatly to Irish society, so they are very welcome.</p><p>  Perhaps the witnesses can arrange between themselves who is best placed to answer my questions.  My first concerns the euro and the hope of Latvia joining the eurozone in 2014.  What do the witnesses think of the current proposals for a banking union?  I refer in particular to the potential changes to the voting rights of the supervisory board and the movement from one vote per member state to votes based on population.  What is the position of Latvia on that point?  What do the witnesses think of the financial transactions tax?  Do they expect to see it come into play in Latvia in the near future?</p><p>  Youth employment is an issue for Ireland during the Presidency.  We are seeking to make progress on the youth guarantee and the witnesses are probably aware that proposals will be made in December.  Do the witnesses have thoughts on how a youth guarantee will work in Latvia?  What is it considering in this regard?  I will provide more information on our Presidency later.</p></speech>

I want to frame a number of questions on the theme of working together at national parliament level and how the witnesses see that developing over the coming years.</p> <p>As the Chairman said, we share some common goals and objectives and some common concerns in regard to the development of the European project.  I am very interested in how we can develop links, as smaller states within the European project, to enhance our capacity to see the kind of issues common to us advanced rather than decry the development of two of the largest states effectively guiding us through the crisis, as has happened over the past year and a half, which I regularly do through this committee and in other areas.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on how best we can further develop the network of smaller states?  Do they think COSAC is a good way to do that?  Should we try to do more bilateral work or should we work around particular issues of common concern?  Should a number of smaller states meet outside the COSAC framework under others headings which are relevant to individual states?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vjaceslavs Dombrovskis" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012112000004#C00300"><p>We are fully committed to joining the euro on 1 January 2014.  Of course, we are counting on Ireland's support.  Our compliance with all of the Maastricht criteria is looking pretty good.  We are complying in terms of inflation.  Our level of public debt is slightly more than 40% and our budget deficit will be 1.4% next year.  Even interest rates seem to be falling into line.</p><p>  I refer to the specific question the Deputy raised in regard to banking union.  We fully support the initial proposal for the single supervision body, Union-wide insurance of deposits and single regulation.  I think we have some pretty common views on that.</p><p>  In regard to voting rights, unfortunately, I am not fully familiar with the detail of this, so I am giving my personal opinion.  It certainly makes sense for the smaller countries to push for something which may resemble the American system of balancing the interests of the large populous states <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i> those states which are less populous so as not to allow a situation where a few very populous countries could effectively dictate to the others.  That should be built into the voting structure.  How it should be done is a good question but it definitely should be done.  </p><p>  In regard to the financial transaction tax, our position is somewhat reserved at the moment.  We have a relatively large and what I would describe as a two-tiered banking system in which we have a few largely foreign Scandinavian banks, which are the retail banks.   We also have quite a few smaller banks which largely service our ex-colleagues in the former Soviet Union.  We look at the proposal for the financial transaction tax with some caution.  If it is along the lines of taxing advanced financial instruments, like derivatives, that probably would not be of that much concern to us because it is not something our industry is into but it remains to be seen as to what exactly it will be.  </p><p>  On youth unemployment, we have that problem in Latvia.  It is not dissimilar to Europe and, I am sure, to Ireland.  I am afraid I am not that knowledgeable about that as it is somewhat outside the competence of my specific committee.  One would have to get into the area of active labour market policies and so on and I am not that familiar with the details of that.</p></speech>

Total unemployment is approximately 12% and youth unemployment was approximately 20% during the deepest part of the crisis, but it is not anymore.  We created several specific programmes for youth.  An example, which was quite successful, was that we created a special programme together with our former state President and we called it "possibility for the future".  The idea was to invite companies, government agencies and local government agencies to provide internships for youth.  If one is not able to get a real job and to be paid, sometimes it is because one does not have any experience.  Providing an internship gave people experience in the jobs market.  Young unemployed people were very much interested in the project.  Of course, there were many other programmes as well.</p><p>  The question on developing better co-operation between parliaments and whether we need special co-operation between the parliaments of smaller states is a very good one.  Sometimes it seems quite attractive to have special groups comprising smaller countries or Nordic or southern countries but I am not so much in favour of having specific divisions because it is a challenge for Europe to stay integrated and not to create two to five tiers.  There are many questions to be answered, including how to involve national parliaments more and how to create better co-operation.  </p><p>  We decided to create a reflection group comprising the chairpersons of European affairs committees and we will meet next Monday in Copenhagen.  </p></speech>

CAP and the issue of unemployment are issues at which we will look during our Presidency.  I will give a very quick overview of the priorities of the Presidency.</p> <p>The first is the restoration of stability within Europe.  Key for us is making progress on the issue of banking union and bedding down the European semester.  The second is to secure agreement on the budget; therefore, the multi-annual financial framework is of key importance to us, particularly, as Deputy Timmy Dooley said, the CAP, on which we want to ensure there is agreement, as well as on the multi-annual financial framework, as quickly as possible in the first few months of our Presidency.  The other key aspect is human rights in order that there will be a human rights dimension to the Presidency.  Perhaps most important, we will be pushing forward with an economic growth and job creation agenda.  We will be looking at full implementation of the Single Market Act, the digital and the blue economy which the Cypriots have been prioritising in the past few months, and trying to make it easier to create jobs, particularly for younger people.  When we last spoke in Cyprus, we discussed Latvia's efforts four or five years ago to generate more employment and start more businesses.  We spoke about how Latvia had reduced bureaucracy to make it easier for people to set up businesses.  Perhaps these efforts might be outlined to other committee members.</p></speech>

It has been in place for a very long time - we all know the reasons - including when we entered the European Union.  We encountered it as a necessary evil.</p></speech>

For example, Latvia is the country that receives the smallest direct payments, which are abysmal.  According to the Commission, they are just 53% of the EU average.  Therefore, we are out sync with the other countries when they are discussing the CAP.  For us, the main concern is that the very small direct payment is due to an historical anomaly.  The direct payments are tied to productivity, which depends on economies of scale - the larger the farm, the higher the level of productivity.  Very small farms, therefore, have very low levels of productivity.  The Baltic states spent some time under the control of the Soviet Union, when farms were collectivised.  In the early 1990s they were broken up.  Therefore, in a period of a few years in the early 1990s we went from having about 300 large collective farms to having 50,000 or 60,000 small, fragmented farms, with the resulting effect on productivity levels which were used in the calculations for direct payments.  In a sense, we are being punished for being occupied by the Soviet Union and taking part in collectivisation experiments.  This is not exactly fair and our major concern is to have our level of direct payments at least at the same level as that of Romania and preferably 80% of the average.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012112000005#D00500"><p>I join in welcoming the Latvian delegation.  I was interested to read in the briefing material provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that Ireland did not recognise the incorporation of Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia into the USSR.  This is acknowledged in Latvia and fosters our bonds of friendship.  There is an historical friendship between our two countries and a sense that we are both small nations with common interests and that we should work together.  Smaller states should support each other and there is that sense between the two states.  The fact that so many Latvian nationals live here also makes for a connection between the two.</p><p>  As Deputy Timmy Dooley said, the CAP is a vital national interest; it is important to the survival of the people.  In European terms, there is a need for food security; it is important that enough quality food is created to feed an ever increasing world population.  There is a rationale for the Common Agricultural Policy at a macro level.  We have an increasing global population that needs to eat and wants quality food.  As such, the CAP must support and encourage the production of that food.  It is also important, with respect to Mr. Dombrovskis's latter comments on smaller farms, that while we support and encourage our smaller farmers, that we also support a level of production to meet future requirements.  We must balance support for our very small farmers, which is admirable and right, giving them the capacity to develop and supporting a level of production that will meet targets to feed the population.</p><p>  As far as possible, countries should have domestic discretion on how they can spend the money when they receive their envelopes, allowing them to adjust their spend to meet the requirements of the agricultural sector and economic objectives in general.  We hope to receive support from Latvia on the Common Agricultural Policy and maintaining the amount of money allocated to it in order that it is not reduced within the multi-annual financial framework.  We should at least be able to reach agreement on this but having Latvia's absolute support is important.  We could then discuss its distribution, but, first, we must secure the amount allocated.  After that, we can strike a balance in the distribution between supporting production to the degree that we can feed our people and encouraging small units and farmers.  That is the objective.</p><p>  The Chairman referred to our similar high rates of unemployment.  The rate is 13% in Latvia, while ours is somewhat higher.  We have a joint interest in addressing the unemployment problem.  I ask for Latvia's support during our Presidency for our initiatives to tackle unemployment.  The T&aacute;naiste told us last week that we would place the unemployment problem and solutions to it, particularly youth unemployment, centre stage.  We seek the active support of Latvia on that issue for all of sakes.  There is no issue more important because unemployment affects the dignity of persons who are unemployed and their quality of life in a massive way.</p> <p>It also has enormous economic effects.  The cost of supporting unemployed persons is just one part of the problem.  Those who are not earning adequate money cannot spend and there is a lack of productivity and genius in the economy.  It is, therefore, a crucial issue for all of these reasons and I stress that it will be central to our Presidency.  I would like to have an absolute assurance that it is a central issue for Latvia also.  Actual initiatives need to be taken to deal with unemployment, specifically youth unemployment which has been mentioned by the Chairman.</p><p> As Latvia has been in an IMF programme, it has experience of the situation Ireland is in.  The question of the separation of banking debt and sovereign debt, in the interests of the alleviation of the hardship of the people, is an important one in this country.  It is important for us that the international agreement achieved on 29 June becomes part of concrete reality.  We would like to receive the support of Latvia in that regard.  We have a community of interest because Latvia has a similar agenda.  It is interesting that there was also a property bubble there.  It seemed to build in a similar way.  If I understand the situation correctly, prices went out of control in the construction sector.  We all have to try to take steps to prevent this happening in the future.  We need to construct our economies on a more production oriented basis and focus on real jobs in areas such as agriculture, tourism and trade.  </p><p> It is great that the delegates are here and they are very welcome.  My fundamental objective is to welcome them like everyone present would like to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012112000006#E00200"><p>Like my colleagues, I welcome the delegation.  All of us, including the Chairman, have encouraged similar visits in the past as they help us to ensure we have a better understanding of each other's positions when dealing with issues at European level.  I have felt for a long time that the level of interaction between the Members of national Parliaments is not nearly sufficient.  Such interaction takes place at Government level, at Civil Service level, at European Parliament level and at Commission level, but it does not take place at national Parliament level.  One of the bulwarks of the Lisbon treaty was that extra powers and strengths were to be given to national Parliaments.  I saw it as a contradiction in terms to be looking for greater integration which would, in effect, give more power to the European Parliament and the other European institutions, while trying to give more power to national Parliaments at the same time.  It was obvious that these two goals were on a collision course.</p><p>  Like other speakers, I express my feelings on these issues by examining Ireland's position on the Common Agricultural Policy.  The food industry is to the economy what wine and cars are to the French economy, or what engineering is to the Italian and German economies.  It is vital.  Almost 90% of our produce is exported.  It is often said there is not enough food to feed the population of the world, but it is interesting to note that there is adequate space and potential to produce food for at least 3 billion more people.  That is a fact.  It could be done if the space available was utilised properly.  Rather than curtailing agricultural activity in areas with the climate best suited for food production, we should be developing and advancing the agriculture industry in such locations.  That is the upside.</p><p>  Like everybody else, we need our vital interests to be maintained in the discussions on the Common Agricultural Policy, the budget and the multi-annual financial framework.  If the European Union does not have a budget, it will have a problem.  It is obvious that in such circumstances, the largest countries with the most resources will ultimately win out.  It is in the interests of the smaller countries, in particular, for a strong financial commitment to be made in terms of a budget.  That should not be undermined further in discussions that might take place in the context of the WTO.  That has happened in the past also.  Major players on the European scene have entered into arrangements with third countries which have benefited certain regions of the Community more than others.  I am not sure that Ireland or Latvia will be high on the agenda when such negotiations take place.  We have common cause in such areas.</p><p>  I would like to put Ireland's economic downturn in perspective.  We were faced overnight with a situation where two thirds of our annual revenue disappeared.  In 24 hours 66.66% of our revenue, because it was coming from the construction sector, disappeared overnight.  It continued to fall afterwards and still continues to do so.</p><p>  My colleagues have made interesting comments about job creation, an issue about which we have spoken at meetings of these committees for a long time.  It is of fundamental importance that we get back to creating jobs.  How will that come about?  Do we feed money into it directly, or do we encourage growth?  It is obvious that we will need growth.  I predicted two, three or four years ago that there would be a contraction because of the direct hit the economy had taken.  I thought everything would have to close down and we are lucky we did not go far.  At the same time, there is no growth.</p></speech>

We are doing better than we thought we would.  In our current position, if we want to go the extra mile and do the extra job that has to be done, we will have to hit the sector that generates money in the local economy.  That is the danger area.  It is interesting to note that the IMF and the ECB are not <i>ad idem</i> on this issue.  In recent times the head of the IMF and Jean-Claude Juncker had a public disagreement on the issue of whether Greece, for example, should be given greater latitude to achieve its targets.  If there is not the potential within the economy to produce what is required to meet the current target, what should one do?  The only thing one can do is elongate one's debt in a way that will make it possible for one's target to be met.</p><p>  I would like to speak about the interesting position the country is in.  It is obvious that we have been used by the European Union as a case in point - a living guinea pig - in economic terms.  There is no doubt about the ability of the country to recover ground.  When there is recovery, it will happen quickly enough.  We have to get to the tipping or balancing point where growth begins to kick in again.  I refer to the point at which growth does not lead to inflation in the economy or displace people's jobs which are already tenuous but is sufficient to draw people into employment and away from the unemployment register.  </p><p>  I cannot finish without engaging in my usual rant.</p></speech>

The concept laid down by the founding fathers of Europe was like the motto of the Three Musketeers - "one for all and all for one" - but whether we like it, it is a fact that it has since been lost.  Some countries, perhaps including Ireland from time to time, have ceased taking ownership of the European project.  It is as if we are not part of the European Union at all.  Many commentators throughout Europe refer to the Irish, Greek and French problems as if they were not part of the European scene for which we are all responsible.  Either we take ownership of and responsibility for the project, or we do not.  We cannot stand out and say we have no responsibility, any more than any state of the United States can do so.  We cannot decide to opt out because we think we have no influence.</p> <p>Texas wanted to opt out of the United States a long time ago but was prevented from doing so.</p><p> The European Union must have a single currency throughout its territory.  There is no use in making excuses about it.  The United States would not function with a multiplicity of currencies and a combination of currencies would not be better than the current system with the US dollar.  It is for this reason that the dollar remains stronger than other currencies, although the euro is also a strong currency.  I have spoken for a long time and note the Chairman has refrained from interrupting me, possibly owing to my age. </p></speech>

Ireland has our full support in seeking to preserve the size of the Common Agricultural Policy budget.</p><p>  At the peak of the recession in Latvia unemployment reached 20% of the population.  It is three or four years since we reached that peak, but employment growth remains sluggish and the rate of unemployment is still between 14% and 16%, depending on how one counts it.  The level of youth unemployment has been declining very slowly.  With the youth unemployment rate much higher than the average unemployment rate, it is a priority for us.  </p><p>  To address the third area identified by the Deputy, we had very similar challenges to those faced by Ireland when the second largest Latvian bank failed, largely due to its inability to pay down large syndicate loans to the international financial markets, whatever they are.  Latvian taxpayers have taken on the full burden of recapitalising the bank in question, resulting in the public debt increasing by more than four times as a percentage of gross domestic product.  Since 2007, Latvian sovereign debt has increased from less than 10% of GDP to 42% or 43% of GDP.  Latvia also fully supports all elements of the banking union, as outlined in the original report, including common deposit insurance and supervision by a single authority. </p><p>  I am very much inspired by Deputy Bernard Durkan's speech about the problems of Europe.  It is important to realise, as I did in my previous life as a professional economist, that there cannot be a single currency without solidarity on sovereign debt, bank provisions and many other matters.  The position is exactly as the Deputy stated; the system cannot work without adopting a "one for all, all for one" approach.  This is what the European Union should be about.  I fully share the Deputy's vision.</p></speech>

This means closer integration and greater solidarity.  We are all aware of the problems arising from proposals to reduce the cohesion policy envelopes for member states.  Solidarity is also tied with job creation in regions and countries.  In previous years we did considerable work aimed at assisting economic development in the most depressed region of Latvia which is located on the border with Russia and Belarus.  This required the creation of several new programmes and the implementation of a number of structural reforms.  We used Cohesion Fund moneys and redesigned investment from cohesion policy to enhance the ability of people in the region to set up their own companies.  What was needed was a specific education and training programme to improve human capital in the region.  We used Cohesion Fund moneys to provide this training and create specific education programmes.  A second element was reducing bureaucratic barriers.  We introduced a new form of enterprise - micro-enterprise - and it is now possible to set up a micro-enterprise for 1 lat, which is equivalent to &euro;1.50.  Previously, setting up a company cost approximately 2,000 lats or &euro;3,000.</p></speech>

A large number of small companies and significant levels of self-employment were the result.  This measure allowed people to create a job for themselves and perhaps other members of their families.  This approach has worked and employment in the region is improving.  However, measures of this nature must be implemented alongside education and training programmes.  Sometimes people become used to working as an employee and are reluctant to create their own companies.</p></speech>

We have some abysmal rates of personal income taxation.  The combination of all personal income tax and social taxes that must be paid amounts to 46% of labour costs in Latvia, whereas the Irish equivalent figure, if I am not mistaken, is about half the Latvian figure.  We have been working on this issue and a rate of simplified taxation has been introduced for a certain sum.  Only minimal taxes are paid on 500 lats or slightly more than &euro;700, with no questions asked.  We have also been purposefully trying to reduce the taxation level applied to the workforce.  As of 1 January, we will reduce the personal income tax rate by 1% and it will be decreased by 5% in the next three years.</p></speech>

The Latvian ambassador, Mr. Elferts, recently made an excellent presentation at a conference in Maynooth on the European debt crisis in which he presented the view of a non-eurozone member and outlined the difficulties experienced by his country.</p><p>  It is interesting that Latvia wishes to join the eurozone.  In the light of the current problems in the eurozone, will Mr. Dombrovskis elaborate on the reasons it is considered to be in his country's interests to cede the power to set its own exchange rate by joining the euro?  Despite not being a member of the eurozone, I understand Latvia adopted the same policy as eurozone members on supporting the banking system.  In the case of Ireland, the decision was made - or made for us, depending on which side one takes in the debate - that no Irish bank could fail and we had to recapitalise the banking system from our own resources.</p> <p>My understanding is that Latvia supported a large Latvian bank out of the resources of its taxpayers and that went directly on to the Latvian sovereign balance sheet.  Given that Latvia did not have a body, such as the ECB to deal with when it made that decision, why was that template chosen as a means of supporting its banking system, as opposed to a model of allowing the bank to fail?  Why does Latvia wish to join the eurozone?  What was the reason that template was chosen for supporting its banking system?  A growing discussion is taking place on the idea that austerity is self-defeating, that one does all these things without ever catching up because the loss in tax revenue that is caused by a decrease in economic activity means the deficit continues at the same level or narrows only by a small amount.  Latvia went through a series of budgetary adjustments that were eye-watering in comparison with what we have done in Ireland.  What progress was made in that period in regard to its budget deficit as a result of those measures?  </p></speech>

Why join the euro?  There is a broad-based answer to that question and there is a somewhat narrow-based answer as to why one should devalue if one has a chance.  In broad-based terms the reason one would want to join the euro is because it is much more than the euro.  As the Deputy said this is about the future of Europe.  The Europe of a single currency cannot survive without, in essence, the institutions of federalism.  Do we want to have more European integration or less?  If the answer is that one wants to be part of a more integrated Europe then a single currency is a feature of that more united Europe.  Therefore, if one wants to be at the core of that Europe and not on the periphery, where we have been for quite some time and know the price, hence our choice in the broad base.  In the narrow sense, why devalue?  I used to be a professor of economics at the Stockholm School for Economics in my previous life before the Parliament.  The theoretical case for this so-called internal devaluation is very weak.  Recently I read the biography of Winston Churchill - I do not know how popular he was in Ireland.</p></speech>

The now popular John Maynard Keynes in his own time wrote the essay on the economic consequences of Winston Churchill, reciting the failure to leave the gold standard, the eurozone of the time.  The gold standard was a system of fixed exchange rates which was widely criticised at the time.  At the same time, that particular historian has noted that the failure to leave the gold standard, at least for Britain, has played quite a decisive role in the destruction of its industry, especially advances in radar and the aeroplane industry led to the weapons which helped Britain withstand the World War II.  Latvia has paid a tremendous price for the internal adjustments.  In whole figures, GDP fell, cumulatively by 25%, unemployment topped 20%, and 10% of the population left the country, therefore the price is high.  At the same time there has been no denial about the effect on industry.  Many people were forced to restructure, to look for new ways of doing things, as a result of which we now have a qualitative difference.  The industrial sector is more oriented towards exports and has become much more robust, as a result of this gruesome experience.  The answer to this is far from being settled as to whether one should opt out for the relatively painless way or whether we should opt for more suffering but which may do some good in the long run.</p><p>  In regard to the banking system, the topic is quite controversial in Latvia as to the extent to which the Latvian taxpayers had to cover the risks of those players in the financial system who gave money to the commercial bank.  I can only say that most likely the roots of this go back to the previous wave of crisis in east Asia, Indonesia and so on where it is well known that banks were allowed to fail effectively and the results were quite disastrous.  Now it appears the pendulum has swung in a different direction in that there has been the risk of disruption to the financial system and the disruption to Ireland's economy was considered to be so high that the banks were saved.  Whether in retrospect that will be judged to be the right decision is not for me to say at this moment.</p><p>  Is austerity self-defeating?  The answer to this depends on where one lives.  For example, in a small country such as Latvia while at the moment not in substantial public debt, the trust of the international financial markets is quite important, otherwise it can get into the vicious circle of failure to regain the trust and being punished by higher interest rates - high interest rates mean the need for more austerity which we may fail to achieve resulting in a further erosion of trust and so on.  If regaining the trust of that financial system is through austerity, that would strike me as the right way to go.  For the large countries, the calculus may be might be quite different because the financial markets cannot invest on Mars, they would have to invest somewhere.  There is going to be the same anchor of the central countries which, as we have seen recently in the case of Germany, are being paid to borrow<b>, </b>therefore, they will have to settle some way.  Some large countries may have to use that to have a different kind of policy in order to help the other countries.  Some countries will always be able to tap into the financial markets, unless there is the option to invest on Mars, which is still not available to the best of my knowledge.</p></speech>

The initial levels of deficit were in the region of about 10%.  We were lucky to have some very good friends so we got the rescue package from the IMF but most important from the European Union, a good example of the all for one, of which the euro package was about one third of our GDP which was an unprecedented and remarkable rescue package that we have received and which made this adjustment possible for us.  The budget deficit for the next year is planned to be 1.4% of GDP.</p></speech>

Latvia wants to go down that route, which is exactly what Ireland has done.  It is very interesting to see this from a country looking to join a project that I am convinced will not only survive, but will prosper in a decade or two.  It is interesting that Latvia wants to join the eurozone while others within it predict its demise.  I am sure they are wrong, but it is interesting to hear your view on that.</p></speech>

At the risk of over-simplifying, one could say that too many resources were put to work in one particular sector, such as construction.  The basic problem is that many or most of the people involved need to requalify and find a job somewhere else, which is a concern.  This is a problem that can hardly be solved by movements in currency.  The problem is on the ground.  People need to be helped to find their way into another industry.  This means, of course, we need to help industry create jobs for these people.</p></speech>

It is on the record that we want to have this tragic case fully investigated as quickly as possible and that remains our intention.</p><p>  I wish to address the situation relating to the Irish Presidency.  Ireland's engagement with its European colleagues has been brought into focus by the rapid onset of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  In just 42 days, Ireland will take over the Presidency from its Cypriot colleagues.  Preparations are well under way and work is intensifying at all levels.  My Department&rsquo;s main objective will be to progress the EU legislative agenda.  Ireland will be responsible for advancing legislation critically important to promoting public health as well as innovation and research.  This is a very important agenda for Ireland as many of the world's top medical devices companies and pharmaceutical companies are located in this country.  Europe is losing opportunities to conduct clinical trials and further research and development.  It is envisaged that the key legislative proposals for Ireland to progress will be in the areas of clinical trials, medical devices, serious cross-border threats to health, and tobacco.</p><p>  Two themes, namely, health and well-being, and innovation and research will inform the Presidency health programme.  In addition to progressing legislative priorities, the Presidency will hold two high-level conferences in Dublin.  The first conference will deal with e-health and will run in parallel with the World of Health IT conference and exhibition and which will coincide with e-health week.  The second conference will deal with the future of brain research.</p><p>  The December EU Council will take place in Brussels on 6 and 7 December 2012.  I plan to attend on day 2 when health issues will be discussed.  The agenda for the Council will be presented to the committee of permanent representatives on 21 November 2012.  Therefore, it is not possible to be absolutely sure of what will be included on the agenda.  It is expected that the Cypriot Presidency will outline its achievements in the health area, including: progress made on dossiers on the health for growth programme; serious cross-border threats to health; medical devices; clinical trials; the transparency directive; food intended for infants and young children; and food intended for special medical purposes. </p><p>  At the December meeting I hope to meet with the new Commissioner, Mr. Tonio Borg, from Malta, if his appointment is confirmed.  I also plan to meet ministerial colleagues from the other trio-partners, Lithuania and Greece, and to meet fellow Ministers from other member states.  I am very concerned that the tobacco directive be progressed.  I will do my utmost to garner support for that measure, notwithstanding the recent changes in the Commission.  The Council will provide an opportunity to outline Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency plans which I have outlined to the committee.  Ireland has held the Presidency very successfully on a number of occasions in the past.  Ireland will not hold the Presidency for another 14 years so this coming Presidency is crucial.  We must aim to make it a good opportunity for the good of our own citizens and for the citizens of the EU in general.</p><p>  I  have had many opportunities to engage with my ministerial counterparts, including most recently at the June Council under the Danish Presidency which I attended.  This was a productive meeting.  We had a useful orientation debate on the serious cross-border threats to health and a lunchtime discussion on the joint procurement of vaccines. </p><p>  The European Union is at its most effective when it moves forward, with all member states working together, to deliver results for Europe&rsquo;s citizens.   I am looking forward to the opportunity the Presidency presents to drive forward the EU health agenda.</p></speech>

I will revisit that matter at a later stage in this discussion.</p><p>  I wish the Minister well for the Irish Presidency.  It is a very important responsibility for the country and for the promotion of health in the European Union.  A few issues arise.  This committee discussed medical devices, the issue of PIP implants and the need for a quality control system to be in place across the EU to ensure strong oversight of the licensing of such medical devices.  This is an area where it will be necessary to take action to reassure people.  This is a key area for strong oversight to ensure that devices are scrutinised and licensed.  There needs to be a mechanism to allow consumers to vindicate their rights and to apply for compensation.  </p><p>  I refer to the issue of the threat to health from tobacco.  Last week, Senator Professor Crown's motion that this should be a smoking-free Parliament received some support.  The issue of tobacco is a key area for this Presidency.  The Minister said that the subject of food intended for infants will be on the agenda of the Council meeting.  Will obesity be discussed?  I ask for clarification on those issues.  I wish the Minister well and I hope it will be a successful Presidency from the point of view of legislation and the position of Ireland in Europe.</p></speech>

I join with earlier speakers in hoping that the six-month period of the Presidency will be beneficial to Ireland on many levels.  I note from the Minister's comments that he expects the priorities under the health heading will include clinical trials, medical devices, serious cross-border threats to health and tobacco.  All of those, with the exception of the latter, will certainly be reported on at the conclusion of the Cypriot Presidency.  They are all part of ongoing work being handed on to the Irish Presidency.  Has the Minister given consideration to initiating a particular focus on any given area during the course of the six-month Irish Presidency?  I commend to the Minister the whole area of rare diseases.  This is invariably an area that is not addressed because of the small numbers directly affected by any disease.  However, the collective impact of all the recorded rare diseases demonstrates that it is an area that needs to have urgent and particular address.</p> <p>We would serve those individuals, their families and the wider community - not only in Ireland but also across the European Union - well if we were to take such an initiative.</p></speech>

At the recent meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and again in the Minister's presence in the Seanad, I stated that there is much merit to the idea of the European Union committing to a long-term strategic goal of eradicating all commerce for profit in tobacco.  It is a given that if tobacco were discovered for the first time tomorrow, it would not be legal.  Chemicals which are far less dangerous to people's health are routinely banned in a way that tobacco has not been.  It has become socially acceptable because it has been available, in Europe at least, for 400 to 500 years.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the principal driver behind the tobacco addiction epidemic which still sweeps Europe is the huge profits which can be obtained.  These profits are used to fund attempts by public relations companies to influence public policy and into various forms of advertising which are legislated for differently in the many jurisdictions that comprise the European Union.  It is obvious that the screw is turning with regard to such advertising but the reality is that it should not be acceptable or possible to sell a cancer-causing, addictive toxin to anyone.  We have already created a website by means of which we are collecting support for the notion that tobacco should no longer be legal by the year 2030.  We picked a date so far in the future because it will give tobacco farmers an opportunity to learn how to grow other crops.  They will be growing such crops in a world which will be increasingly short of food.  Investment houses, hedge funds and pensions funds will also have an opportunity to diversify their investments out of tobacco.  In addition, tobacco companies will have a chance to learn to repurpose their factories and make new products.  Given that the bully pulpit afforded by the Presidency of the European Union will be at our disposal next year, we will have a great opportunity to advance this matter.</p><p>  I ask the Minister to pay attention to the potential collateral damage to which the forthcoming data protection regulations could give rise in respect of cancer research.  I will be delighted to brief him in greater detail on these regulations.  Although clearly not the aim of those who drafted them, the regulations to which I refer could have a very negative impact on cancer and other forms of research.  I wish the Minister well during the six months of our Presidency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012112000004#C00500"><p>I am very concerned with regard to matters relating to quality assurance in respect of medical devices.  Patient safety is a major issue, as is that relating to people being in a position to vindicate their rights.  I am in absolute agreement with Deputy Kelleher in this regard.  The point regarding food for infants actually relates to regulations to make such food safer.  I believe our Cypriot colleagues may guide the relevant legislation through the Parliament prior to the end of their Presidency.  This is not certain but if they do so, the onus will no longer be on us to have it passed.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to our initiating debate on matters that are of concern to us.  There are two issues on which I wish to focus in this regard, namely, autism and the effect of the economic downturn on health services across the EU.  I am of the view that these issues warrant debate.  With all the economies of Europe under pressure, we must try to protect health services.  By doing this, we will hasten the economic upturn.  It is necessary to have a healthy workforce in order to have a healthy economy.</p><p>  In respect of Senator Crown's points, from a professional point of view I would love to see a complete ban on tobacco sales in the EU by 2030.  I will certainly explore whether such a goal is achievable with the Senator and others during our Presidency.  The data protection proposal to which he alluded will also be examined in the first half of next year.  Europe is very aware of the fact that we are losing out in terms of clinical trials as a result of the red tape which obtains.  This legislation does not just relate to economic benefits, it also relates to reducing the level of red tape while improving and enhancing patient safety.  I always welcome the opportunity to highlight the benefits of being involved in clinical trials from the patient's perspective.  Not only does one obtain access to cutting-edge medicines, one is also subjected to a level of supervision not normally associated with course of treatment in the general health services of any country.  These are two benefits which we should promote, particularly in the context of people's willingness to become involved in such trials.</p></speech>

On the Minister's priorities for Europe and specifically that which relates to the provision of health services in the current economic climate, I am of the view that it would be useful to include the abuse of alcohol in this regard.  If there was less abuse of alcohol, there would be less pressure on our hospitals.  I do not know whether the Minister will be able to fit this into his programme of work.</p></speech>

In so far as is possible, we will certainly discuss alcohol abuse as another matter which needs to be addressed.  We may try to promote the idea of a uniform approach to this problem being taken across Europe.  I must be careful and advise Deputy Dowds and other members that there is only so much one can achieve.  If one seeks to dilute one's aims to a huge degree, the effectiveness of one's Presidency will become suspect.  I am of the view, therefore, that we should focus on some of the major issues, while also dealing with a number of the smaller ones - accept that certain of these are hugely important to us - then we can make serious progress.  From the public health perspective, the one about which I am really concerned is the tobacco directive.  This was well advanced before the resignation of Commissioner Dalli and we want to ensure that it will be expedited by the new Commission.  We want to create the opportunity to progress this matter in a serious fashion during our Presidency.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister will be able to use the Presidency of the EU to advance care in this country.  When I have questioned him on this matter, he has suggested that cross-Border solutions will apply in respect of those in the north west - where there are no cardio-catheterisation facilities - who require stenting procedures.  Radiology services are also absent from the north west.  In my opinion, the Presidency will provide an opportunity to deal with these issues.</p></speech>

I do not believe it will have an effect one way or the other.  The agreements we have in place with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, APMI, which represents the generic producers, both last until 2015.</p> <p>We have prescribing initiatives in place now which will involve six pharmacists in the General Medical Service payments board who will be examining general practitioners' prescribing habits and advising them on how to improve it.  To put it bluntly, if a patient has a condition which is costing &euro;400 per month to treat and an examination reveals that the same result can be achieved for &euro;200 by prescribing similar but different drugs, obviously that is to the benefit of other patients who can then avail of that resource that is saved.  In terms of the answer, I do not envisage the Presidency improving it but I see our costs in regard to pharmaceuticals improving over the period the Deputy mentioned.</p><p> Regarding Senator MacSharry's question, the more interaction there is, the more opportunity for interaction with the Northern Ireland Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Poots MLA, but the Minister and I have had several discussions on that.  He is extremely open to it.  He is a pragmatic individual and the two of us intend to take a tour of the cross-Border facilities, not just to see the big items such as the hospitals but the ones people might not think of, such as a community nursing unit in Lifford with the possibility of affording a service to people across the Border in Strabane, a GP who might be isolated in Blacklion availing of a roster across the Border, the issue of ambulances, and an air ambulance service stretching up the whole length of the coast whereby if they had an air ambulance they could cover the north west, we could move down the coast with our cover in a more concentrated fashion.  There is a host of possibilities and all that will continue apace.</p><p> On whether the European Union affords us some increased activity around that, I would like to think it will but we will be looking to co-operate in every way we can, particularly in terms of some of the ones the Senator mentioned which are big ticket items such as cardiology, oncology and radiotherapy, but also on other issues which do not spring to mind immediately but which can make a huge difference to the populations either side of the Border.</p><p> Senator Colm Burke asked about the cross-Border initiative on health care.  We will pursue that through the EU, as has been the case in the past.</p></speech>

I remind members that the Minister and Mr. O'Brien will make opening remarks, followed by questions from the Opposition spokespersons, and we will then have a question and answer session.  I call the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  The opening statements have been circulated and the members have them in front of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012112000005#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the joint committee for this opportunity to discuss health service issues.  Both I and my Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Alex White, will provide as much information and clarification as possible.</p><p>  While I propose to keep my opening statement brief to allow more time for discussion, I must refer to a number of landmark developments that have recently come to fruition in the health service.  I have no doubt my two Ministers of State will wish to speak to them as well.</p><p>  The major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State, which was just mentioned, was recently brokered with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA.  It will have a value in excess of &euro;400 million over the next three years and will mean significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a reduction in the drugs bill to the State, greater access to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, which has always been a concern, and an easing of financial pressure on the health service in the future.</p><p>  The agreement is of major benefit in two broad ways.  Approximately half the value is related to reductions in the cost of patent and off-patent drugs.  The other half is related to the State securing the provision of new and innovative drugs for the duration of the agreement in the current exceptionally difficult economic climate.  We have discussed in the past that the Chief Medical Officer will initiate a new process around this involving not just the pharmaceutical companies, the policy makers, which is the Department, and the service providers through the Health Service Executive, HSE, but also clinicians and patient groups because we must realise there is a finite sum of money and if we are to make room for new drugs, the older drugs have to reduce in cost to allow that to happen.  There is always a problem with that dynamic because some of the companies that are producing the drugs are not the same companies that are producing the newer drugs.</p><p>  In addition to the new agreement with the IPHA, the Department of Health and the HSE have completed discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland, APMI.  This group represents the generic drug industry and the agreement represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in generic drug prescribing.</p><p>  Savings in 2013 will be in the region of &euro;15 million and that figure will rise in subsequent years.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, will want to address that when he makes his contribution, but I would say there may have been a sense that the enthusiasm for substituting for generics was somewhat diminished by the fact that many of the generic drugs were either the same price or a few cent less in price.  That has been addressed through this agreement.</p><p>  These landmark agreements come as legislation aimed at reducing the cost of generic drugs makes its way through the Oireachtas.  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution.  I hope it will be enacted before the end of the year and it is currently being passed through under the watchful eye of the Minister of State, Deputy White.  It will deliver further significant savings in the cost of medicines for the health service and for the private patient.</p><p>  Our agreement with the private health insurers on the accelerated payment of &euro;125 million to publicly funded hospitals in 2012 is a major part of our budget control as well.  I am delighted it has been possible to reach agreement with the private health insurers in this regard.  The arrangement will deliver a once off cashflow benefit in 2012 in the order of &euro;125 million, providing much-needed funds for the hospitals.  The money is a once off payment in respect of private patients who have been treated in publicly funded hospitals but where the detailed claims have not yet been received by the insurers.  The effect of the arrangement will be to reduce the over-run in the HSE.</p><p>  I fully acknowledge that the public hospital system has unacceptably long delays in regard to income collection, especially the completion and sign-off of claims by hospital consultants.  To address this situation the HSE has instructed hospitals to reduce the value of claims awaiting signing off by consultants and also to target completion of the highest value claims.  It is not that they will reduce the value of the claim but they will reduce the number of claims that are outstanding.  In fairness, I hope the insurers also will co-operate in this regard.</p><p>  The recent Cabinet decision to develop the new paediatric hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus activates the most important capital building project in the State.  It is a key priority for the Government and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.  The decision to choose the St. James's site was led by clinical considerations.  Co-location with St. James's and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital on the St. James's campus will provide the excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.  The estimated cost of the development in the region of &euro;500 million is considerably less than the projected cost of building the facility on the campus of the Mater Hospital.</p><p>  Publication of the strategic framework for health reform, which occurred last week, is a very important moment for us because it lays out very clearly the main health care reforms that will be introduced in the coming years as key building blocks for the introduction of universal health insurance.  People have sought the plan for a long time and, in many cases, we have mentioned aspects of it but it is now laid out in a clear document with actions to be taken and a timeline around all those actions.  It is called Future Health and it contains a set of specific actions that will prepare the way for universal health insurance.  Future Health will bring about a major reshaping of the health system by restructuring our delivery service and improving our organisational, financial, governance and accountability systems in the primary, community and hospital care sectors.  These changes will be introduced in a step-by-step manner on the basis of good evidence.</p><p>  A White Paper on universal health insurance to be published in 2013 will provide the basis for more detailed actions.  We have already commenced communicating this to those in the system.  We had meetings in Cork and Waterford with both service providers and the health forum and yesterday we had similar meetings in Naas, Tullamore and Dr. Steevens' Hospital.  We will go to the west later this week to Sligo, Galway and Limerick and the following week to the north east of Dublin to involve all those areas as well.  The point of this is that we engage with those in the system.  It is a two-way conversation.  It does not stop there; they will have an input back to us.  This is very important from the point of view of ensuring we do this in the best possible way because while we can see all the road signs, we cannot see all the potholes.  The people working on the ground can see them better than us and know best how to deal with them.</p><p>  From the actions outlined above, the members will note that I am determined to press ahead with the health service reform promised in the programme for Government.  Robust governance and management arrangements will be crucial to drive, manage and monitor implementation of the reform programme.</p> <p>I will therefore establish a programme management office in the Department of Health to act as a central overarching and co-ordinating function for health reform.</p><p> These major initiatives which I have outlined are positive developments.  However, I must also refer to the serious challenges facing the health system, the scale of which surmounts anything previously experienced.  The HSE is facing a serious budget deficit and is still required to make significant savings in the current year.  The contributing factors to the overrun include increased hospital activity.  While one might complain about certain activities that are elective, one certainly cannot do anything about a 6% increase in emergency department admissions.  Those are the most acutely ill people in society.</p><p> There is increased expenditure on medical cards and drugs, which is a result of the economic downturn.  Although we planned for 105,000 additional medical cards, we have issued in the region of 150,000 so far this year.  The income from private health insurance has declined, which is also reflective of the economic downturn.  The number of staff who availed of the grace period to retire was much greater than that provided for in the national service plan and that had an impact in terms of lump sums that had to be paid out.</p><p> However, a programme of measures has been initiated to address this deficit.  In addition, I have put in place a financial improvement and new programme management arrangements which will transform the way financial management is handled across the health system.  This will strengthen governance and improve consistency and continuity in financial reporting, performance management and data collection.  That is easily said but this is a major area of concern and this is the first time it has been tackled in a serious fashion.  It was pretty worrying and astonishing to find when we reviewed the situation that only 10% of the people in charge of the financial end of the service have a finance or accountancy qualification.</p><p> It is clear that further savings are required in the health sector and the 2012 health sector action plan prepared under the Croke Park agreement contains a demanding set of measures.  They include a comprehensive review of rosters, changes in skill mix, productivity improvements and a focused approach to reducing sick leave levels.  Further significant cost reductions will be required in 2013 and 2014, requiring substantial savings to be made to the cost base of the health sector.  My Department is working intensively with the HSE on a range of substantive proposals for submission to Government in the context of the 2013 Estimates.  Both my ministerial colleagues and I will be happy to answer questions from the committee on these and other issues in greater detail during the course of the meeting.</p><p> Putting the patient first in a real way is at the core of what we are doing.  Everything we do must be focused on improving the outcomes for patients.  In the past there has been far too much focus on inputs &ndash; how much money, how many doctors and how many nurses.  We need to measure outcomes for patients because that is what the service is about.</p><p> Concern has been expressed by several committee members, and we have all expressed our sympathy to the family of the late Savita Halappanavar, but I must inform the committee, as the Taoiseach did, that there have been changes to the membership of the team in Galway investigating the incident.  I would like Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien from the HSE to address the issue during the course of his opening contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.257" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012112000006#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to be present.  I am joined by Ms Laverne McGuinness, national director for integrated services, Mr. Liam Woods, national director for finance, and Dr. Philip Crowley, national director, quality and patient safety.  We will all do our best to respond to the questions of members.</p><p>  Before I get into the general details of the opening statement I would like to take this opportunity, in common with members of the committee, to extend my deepest sympathy and condolences, and that of the HSE itself, to Ms Halappanavar&rsquo;s husband, family and friends on their tragic loss.  Yesterday, the HSE set out the details of the investigation into the death of Ms Savita Halappanavar.  Professor Sir Aralkumaran, an independent expert in obstetrics and gynaecology, is chairing the investigation team.  Professor Sir Aralkumaran is head of obstetrics and gynaecology and deputy head of clinical sciences at St. George&rsquo;s Hospital, University of London.  He is also the president of the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology with more than 40 years&rsquo; experience, 30 of which are in clinical and academic obstetrics and gynaecology.  Professor Sir Arulkumaran conducted an inquiry at Northwick Park Hospital following ten maternal deaths at that facility.</p><p>  It is important that the members of the investigation team comprise expertise in the relevant disciplines of anaesthesia, midwifery, obstetrics and gynaecology to review the full range of clinical care provided to Ms Halappanavar.  It is also deemed essential that the team includes an independent patient representative, which it does.  The HSE announced such an expert, multidisciplinary team yesterday.  However, the HSE is taking into account the concerns of Mr. Halappanavar and in that regard the chairman of the investigation team has sought a meeting with Mr. Halappanavar to discuss his concerns.</p><p>  The HSE is also currently reviewing the membership of the investigation team and members will be aware that the Galway-based members of the team, as announced yesterday, have stood down in the interests of the investigation.  Other appropriate experts will be appointed to the team in due course.</p><p>  On behalf of the HSE I would like to reassure the public, and in particular Mr. Halappanavar and his family, that we are most anxious to expedite the investigation so that we can establish all of the facts and address any possible safety concerns that may arise as a result of the investigation and that could have implications for women attending at our maternity services.</p><p>  The financial report for the HSE for September shows a deficit of &euro;399 million, 4.4%, against a spend this year to date of &euro;9.543 billion.  The main contributors to this are community schemes at &euro;180 million, hospitals at &euro;207 million and community services at &euro;22 million.  There are some minor offsetting balances that give a total deficit of &euro;399 million.</p><p>  September is the first month this year in which there has been a reduction in the deficit reported, which indicates that the cost containment measures in place are having the effect of reducing spend rates.  However, the financial situation of the HSE continues to be extremely challenging.  The community-based schemes continue to run significant deficits, which increased by an additional &euro;29 million in the month of September.  The HSE has a range of measures in place to reduce the year-end deficit.</p><p>  Activity continues to grow across the majority of HSE services placing considerable demand on resources.  The position, as of September, compared to the same period in 2011 shows that.  The Minister has already mentioned the 6% increase in emergency attendances.  Emergency admissions have increased by an additional 7,091, or 2.5% in the first nine months of 2012 over 2011.  The number of inpatient treatments is up by an additional 2.3% or 10,260, and the number of day case treatments is up by 1.8% or 11,257, giving an overall 2% increase in inpatient and day case activity.  GP out-of-hours contacts are up by 3.4%, over 24,000 compared to last year.  The number of individuals covered by a medical card as of the end of September was 1,838,603; an additional 144,540 individuals were issued with medical cards since December 2011.</p><p>  The increased service activity levels place considerable pressure on available resources and capacity within the system.  The HSE continues to face significant financial challenges to year-end in areas such as child care, acute hospitals and community drugs schemes based upon the demand for services.  Health service staff resources at the end of September stand at 101,743 whole time equivalents, a reduction of 11,028 or 9.78% since staff numbers peaked in the health system in 2007.  The organisation is currently operating well within its current approved employment ceiling of 102,936.  The recruitment embargo remains in place for funding reasons until the end of December 2012.</p> <p> In recent weeks the HSE, together with the Department of Health, has been involved in negotiations on private health insurance income, consultant contracts and the cost of drugs.  The Minister has spoken about the detail of private health insurance income.  In addition to that deal, there are a number of initiatives in train to improve income collection.  I have emphasised to all hospitals the importance of addressing the issue of income collection in conjunction with the insurers in order that as many resources as possible will be available to the health system.  We have set hospital targets for income collection.  Hospitals have been instructed to bring down the value of claims awaiting consultant action, and they will also target the highest value claims.  This issue was also addressed by health service employers and the two consultant representative bodies at the Labour Relations Commission.</p><p> An important feature of the proposals agreed between the parties was a commitment on the part of all consultants to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurance companies.  Consultants will be required to complete fully and sign insurance forms within 14 days of receipt of all relevant documentation and to co-operate with the secondary consultant scheme, whereby a secondary consultant involved in a case can sign the claim form if the primary consultant has not signed within a reasonable timeframe.  They will also be required to support the implementation of electronic claim preparation.  Health service management is proceeding with implementation of this and other measures, having regard to the relevant provisions of the public sector agreement.</p><p> We have awarded the contract for the rolling out of an electronic claims management system on 11 HSE sites to replace the current paper-based system.  This system is operational at six sites and a further three are expected to be operational shortly.  I expect the range of measures outlined will contribute towards improving the collection of income outstanding to the public hospital system.</p><p> On 17 September, following detailed engagement between health service management and the consultants' representative organisations, the Labour Relations Commission issued a comprehensive set of proposals regarding the implementation of the Croke Park agreement by consultants.  The consultants' organisations are either balloting or have completed the consultation process on the proposals.  Rulings on three outstanding issues have been received from the Labour Court.  Management will be meeting the parties concerned to make progress on implementation of the recommendations.  In the meantime, the HSE and HSE-funded agencies were advised by the HSE's human resources unit to commence implementation of the full scope of the proposed agreement, with effect from Monday, 5 September, under section 1.23 of the public service agreement which provides for employees and unions to co-operate in implementation during the consultation process.</p><p> The Minister has spoken about the cost of drugs.  Let me refer to the crisis pregnancy counselling services, particularly the issue that has arisen regarding information provided by these services.  We provided members with information last week, as requested, but I will provide a further update.  Based on the findings in an internal review carried out by the HSE, I have established an independent investigation which will be chaired by Ms Bridget McManus, former Secretary General of the then Department of Education and Science.  The terms of reference are being finalised with the chairperson and I expect that the investigation will be concluded as expeditiously as possible.</p></speech>

It is important that the people and parliamentarians have confidence in the investigation into the incident in Galway.  It is a question of putting the patient at the centre.  I welcome the changes announced today.  I have two questions for Mr. O'Brien on the investigation.  When will it commence?  When will the composition of the panel be finalised, given the changes announced today and Mr. O'Brien's opening remarks?  It is important that we reassure people about the quality of maternity services.  It is a question of focusing on patients and all others concerned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012112000007#F00500"><p>I welcome the delegates.  I, too, welcome the Taoiseach's announcement of changes to the personnel investigating the tragic death of Ms Savita Halappanavar, as I was very concerned when I heard about the composition of the panel.  I do not want to cast aspersions against or question the integrity of the eminent individuals originally appointed to the investigation team, but I believed they were being compromised almost immediately by being put on the panel.  It is regrettable that the original decision was made, for a number of reasons.  As the Minister rightly stated, we want to get to the truth of the matter in a manner that is completely impartial and independent.  We were told there would be discussions with Mr. Praveen Halappanavar on the investigation.  If there had been, those appointed to the investigation team would not have been appointed.  There have been strong expressions of concern about the composition of the team.  Mr. Halappanavar has expressed views publicly through his solicitor.</p><p>  There are a number of reasons this issue is very important.  The first is the tragic death of Savita and our desire to find out exactly what happened.  There ought to be absolute independence to give confidence to everybody using or who will use maternity services.  By and large, we have an excellent maternity system, staffed by the most highly qualified and eminent individuals, be they consultants, midwives or other nurses.  It behoves everybody to ensure there is an impartial, independent investigation for everybody concerned, including the family, service users and service providers.</p><p>  I was amazed and completely disappointed at the outset that people could compromise the investigation by including in the investigation panel individuals who had close associations with the personnel working in Galway.  We must be conscious of the fact that many staff are very upset about what happened.  We must take this into account.  Therefore, I welcome the change in personnel.  We want an expeditious, impartial and independent investigation.</p><p>  With regard to the opening statements of the Minister and Mr. O'Brien, I have major concerns about some of the issues raised and some of those omitted owing to time constraints.  There is an overrun of &euro;399 million and we are asking the insurers to assist with the cash flow of the Department of Health and the HSE in terms of up-front payments for treatments provided.  Clearly, there is a major difficulty with respect to the sustainability of the budget and how it is put together in the first instance.  A huge budget deficit is to be carried over into next year when savings of an inordinate order have already been identified as necessary.  Clearly, this year's HSE budget was unsustainable from the word go.  </p><p>  Reference was made to full cost recoupment for private patients in public beds.  This would obviously have placed a considerable burden on insurers and, ultimately, premium holders.  Consider the escalating price of private health insurance.  There is always price inflation in medicine and it normally runs well ahead of the consumer price index.  Clearly, there is a considerable problem.  Major difficulties are encountered by ordinary families in that they are simply unable to pay the increasingly higher premiums demanded by insurers.</p><p>  Reference was made to the next step, namely, the strategic framework for health reform and the move to universal health insurance.  What is happening goes against the grain of everything the HSE and the Department of Health should be trying to do, that is, encouraging as many people as possible to take out private health insurance, at a sustainable and affordable rate, according to the principles of risk equalisation and community rating.  People are giving up cover all the time.  Younger people are dropping out, thus placing the burden of community rating and risk equalisation on older generations.  This is simply not sustainable.  With regard to the move towards universal health insurance, the Minister must take one step forward to try to address the haemorrhage of people from private health insurance which is placing additional pressure on the public health system.  The move towards universal health insurance is aspirational because every day people are downgrading their health insurance plans, thus creating considerable extra difficulty.</p> <p> The issue of home helps is another area to which reference has not been made.  To be clear, there is no relationship between what the Minister and Mr. O'Brien are stating in public and what is happening on the ground.  I genuinely mean this as what is happening regarding the withdrawal of services for those who rely on home helps simply does not equate with the press releases being sent out stating no one will be denied a service.  Thousands of people are being denied services that would sustain people at home for a longer period.  Even at this late stage, the Minister and Mr. O'Brien should try to revisit this issue.  I acknowledge the sum involved is &euro;8 million and that the health budget is under significant pressure but there have been repeated cases of people simply not being able to access a home help service they had heretofore.  This is putting significant pressure on individuals' ability to remain at home, on their quality of life and on families who are trying to sustain people at home and out of long-term residential care.  Clearly, the Minister and Mr. O'Brien must address this issue because what is being stated publicly and what is happening on the ground are at absolute variance.</p><p> On the broader issue of the strategic framework for health reform, this could yet be the best seller for Christmas.  However, it will be found in the fiction department because there are neither costings nor an outline of precisely how the Minister intends to achieve his goals contained in the strategic framework.  For example, the Minister speaks of universal health insurance and in the strategic framework, he already has identified a form of universal health insurance.  At the same time, however, members await the White Paper on universal health insurance as to the model on which it will be based.  If a major shift is envisaged in how we fund health services and how universal health insurance is to be introduced, it clearly will be desirable for the people, the Department and the Legislature to have a discussion on what form of universal health insurance is being proposed.  While a White Paper is forthcoming, at the same time we already have in place a strategic framework for universal health insurance.  There is a difficulty with people trying to buy into this particular framework document when they are not even quite sure of the funding model that will be available to fund the move to universal health insurance.  The cart certainly is well before the horse for this proposal.</p><p> The Minister referred to a move to primary care, investment in primary care and what flows therefrom.  How far down the road have we gone regarding the issue of access to GPs and free GP care?  As far as I can ascertain, we are no further advanced in providing access to free GP care than was the case two years ago.  There were legal problems and complications in respect of the long-term illness scheme but, to date, there has been no major move in that regard other than "Live horse, get grass" in 2013.  I fully understand the budgetary constraints on the health services but, clearly, the move to universal free GP care and then to universal health insurance was a very important stated policy on which we have not progressed very much further.</p><p> Finally, I again ask who is responsible for the budget?  Is the Minister for Health or is Mr. O'Brien responsible in respect of accountability for the budget itself and for ensuring the reining-in of the deficit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012112000008#G00200"><p>At the outset, I wish to use this opportunity to again convey my sympathy to the family of the late Mrs. Halappanavar.  Perhaps it is too soon to give an answer but with the indication at this meeting of the change in membership of the investigation team, has there been a response from the legal representative of the late Mrs. Halappanavar's husband, Praveen, as to the acceptability of the new composition of the investigation team?  I am anxious to learn what Mr. O'Brien has to say on that.  It is very important to recognise the investigation team must be seen to be independent and must have the confidence of both the bereaved family, which is of significant importance, and the wider public and this must be addressed.</p><p>  I have a number of questions.  In response to my proposal that we might consider initiating address of some particular areas in the course of the Irish Presidency of the European Union next year, the Minister indicated two such areas.  I welcome that the Minister does indeed intend to focus on particular areas.  He mentioned autism and went on to speak of the impact on health of financial difficulties domestically and across Europe.  While they may not be the exact words the Minister used, that roughly is the representation of it.  I absolutely welcome this, particularly in respect of autism.  I again ask the Minister to consider the area I had highlighted and to not allow it to fall off the table, that is, the issue of rare diseases.  Ireland has more than its fair share of such diseases and <i>per capita</i> across a number of them, quite a high incidence on a comparative basis with other member states of the European Union.  It would be very appropriate that Ireland would indeed take up the issue of rare diseases.</p><p>  As for the second of the two points of which the Minister spoke, namely, the impact on health of financial difficulties, it is against a backdrop of reports that appeared both yesterday and over the weekend that further cuts are anticipated in the health budget, of the order of approximately &euro;900 million.  This is more than I had expected we would be obliged to face.  Moreover, a further 3,231 staff are set to leave the service.  Can the Minister confirm these figures?  Can he comment on both these issues?  Does he not agree these further cuts will have further devastating consequences on the impact of the delivery of services and on the impact on health of financial difficulties which he hopes to address in the course of Ireland's Presidency in the first six months of 2013?</p><p>  As for some of the replies the Minister has given to the joint committee in response to various questions posed, I wish to address question No. 8 on the national bowel cancer screening programme.  I am particularly concerned there is little hard evidence of readiness in respect of the roll-out, which is supposed to happen before the end of next month or that is what one had been led to believe.  As the Minister indicated in his reply, it is anticipated that the first round will take up to three years to complete.  Can the Minister outline in detail for members the proposed phases that will lead to full implementation?  I again invite the Minister to comment on the case I have highlighted with him previously, with the support of the Irish Cancer Society, of the need to encompass a wider age group from the outset, that is, the 55 to 74 age group, to maximise the potential of this screening programme.  In recognising that more than 2,000 cases are diagnosed annually and that this is the cause of approximately 950 deaths annually across this jurisdiction, everyone agrees early detection is hugely important.  Moreover, earlier detection leads to more effective and less costly treatment.  Can the Minister advise us precisely where the 15 candidate colonoscopy units will be located?  The joint committee will understand if he cannot do so this afternoon but I ask him to circulate the information naming the aforementioned units to members.  As for the symptomatic service, what state of readiness exists with regard to the anticipated 5% to 6% of those who go through the screening programme and who then will need to have ongoing referral?  Can the Minister name the hospitals that are in a position to respond to this additional number of people who will require address of diagnosed issues in respect of bowel cancer?</p> <p>Bowel cancer has the second highest cancer incidence and is also the second highest death-causing cancer.  We can only expect with the advance of the screening programme polyps are going to be identified in an ever greater number of people.  What state of readiness is the hospital system in to take this on?</p><p> Regarding staffing for mental health and acute psychiatric services, I note with concern that a minimum nursing staff floor, a bottom line, does not apply but ceilings do.  The HSE stated in a reply to a parliamentary question to me that total agency staff in Dublin-mid-Leinster mental health services came to 7.5.  I must correct that figure; it should be 16.5.  Some 11% of the workforce in our mental health services are temporary or agency workers.  There is a permanent staff of 465, 16.5 agency staff and 39 temporary staff in Dublin-mid-Leinster mental health services.  With the further anticipated reductions in staff and the continuation of the recruitment embargo, will the HSE give us some certainty that it will have adequate staff to cater for future mental health needs in the region?</p><p> The &euro;35 million earmarked for the creation of 414 posts in mental health services by the end of this year has been knocked on the head with only 17 posts filled, three in the child and adolescent mental health area and 14 in general adult mental health services.  These are statistics I have taken from replies to parliamentary questions.  It is a concern that we are not providing adequate staff to carry out these important roles in mental health services.</p></speech>

The manner in which the HSE inquiry into her death was announced and the composition of the inquiry team has compromised it from the very beginning.  Will the Minister establish an independent public inquiry into this matter?  I was disappointed to see the composition of the inquiry team but was not surprised.  From my contact with the HSE over the past several years, I have found it to be an arrogant body.  Whoever took the decision to have three consultants from University Hospital Galway on the inquiry team is certainly not in touch with reality.  It is important and essential that the inquiry is in no way compromised.</p><p>  It is clear now, if it was not clear up to now, that the budget for the health service is totally inadequate.  The system is bursting at the seams and a high standard of service is not available to patients despite the best efforts of HSE staff.  The health service is simply underfunded.  The HSE outlined the growth in admissions to accident and emergency departments and the issuing of medical cards while there are serious cutbacks, bed closures and significant numbers on trolleys in accident and emergency departments.  Last Thursday, for example, there were 287 people on hospital trolleys across the country.  Up to a 1 million home help hours have been cut this year and elderly people have been badly affected by this.  The promise of free general practitioner, GP, care has not materialised.  There is the prospect of further cuts amounting to &euro;1 billion next year with a further 3,000 job losses.</p><p>  Austerity needs to stop and the health budget needs to be increased.  People are entitled to a reasonable level of services.  In the past I have pointed out there is significant wealth in the country with a top 5% of the population considerably increasing its income and assets during this recession.  They do not pay their fair share of taxation.  They should be made to pay it so that we can better fund health services.</p><p>  In a reply to a parliamentary question on hospital network structures, I was informed there has been extensive consultation on this process.  What consultations have taken place?  Which civic society organisations and patient representative organisations were consulted?  Were there requests for submissions from the wider public?  In my view there has been a constant lack of consultation by the HSE concerning the services it provides.  There is certainly consultation within the HSE and hospitals on services but no wider public consultation.</p> <p>What is the position on the draft report on the hospital networks?  Has the strategic board seen this draft report?  Has it been approved by the board?  Has it been sent to the Minister?  What is the current position?</p><p> Finally, I want to raise the question of beds at the Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles.  A number of commitments have been made - one by the Minister approximately 12 months ago and one by Deputy Coonan approximately three weeks ago - that these beds would reopen.  The reply to my question would suggest that there is no question of these beds being reopened, either this year or in the coming year.  The Minister committed to opening those 22 beds.  That has not happened.  Deputy Coonan stated approximately four weeks ago that in three or four weeks' time eight to ten beds would reopen at the Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles.  Is it going to happen?  What is the position in that regard?</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher raised several issues which others have raised.  Perhaps the committees will accept a composite reply which will save a great deal of time.</p><p>  I agree, paraphrasing the old saying, that justice must not alone be done but must be seen to be done.  The same can be said of this inquiry.  Not only must it be independent; it must be seen to be independent, and there can be no perception of a lack of independence.  It is worth spending a little time on this issue because others also raised it.  This is a difficult and traumatic time for the family of the late Mrs. Savita Halappanavar.  This procedure will be very difficult for them.  In so far as I can, I want to accommodate their wishes.  Equally, we have a duty of care to the women who use the services in this country to expedite this as quickly as possible to ensure that there are not any unsafe practices at that hospital so that there is no risk.  Members have spoken about a public inquiry.  A number of persons have called for that.  The problem with a public inquiry is that it will certainly take much longer and the answers will be much slower to come.  The changes that have taken place, as Mr. O'Brien outlined, allow for a real sense of independence here.  Hopefully, we will be able to expedite this as quickly as possible.  People have mentioned a timescale of three months.  I hope it will be completed much quicker than that.  In light of that, we can review the situation.</p><p>  I must point out that there will be a coroner's court hearing as well, which is also something that takes time.  It is really important that we get to the truth in a clear and transparent fashion that stands up to scrutiny, not only the scrutiny of the family of the late Mrs. Halappanavar but also that of the Irish people and of the world.  That is our aim.  Patient safety must always be to the fore of my conscience.  I want to be able to give an assurance that the service is safe, and that is not in any way to be pejorative about the service provided at the hospital.  We merely need that reassurance.  We need this investigation to be independent and to be seen to be independent, and we must allow the HSE to get on with its business as quickly as possible.  Everybody has the height of regard and respect for Professor Sir Arulkumaran, his bona fides and the experience he brings to this.</p><p>  On the more general issue of the budget and the cost of services, I made it clear that I do not want to cut services to patients or clients who need them and who have been assessed as needing them, but I am determined to cut the cost of services.  That is something we must consider, and there are many ways of approaching it.  We have examined many efficiencies and we have achieved them through measures such as the clinical programmes, but there comes a point at which we must examine how things are organised in terms of rosters.  I believe the new consultant agreement at the LRC is a key part of this, as consultants will now be available any five days out of seven, including in the evenings and at night.  This will ensure that senior decision-makers are there so that decisions will be made more quickly and with less regard to and reliance upon tests.  The leadership that is shown in this regard will continue throughout the service in other areas where rosters are concerned.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher also raised the issue of full cost recoupment for all private patients in public beds.  We were quite cognisant of the fact that if we were to introduce this across the board immediately, the system would fall over.  One could be looking at a &euro;250 million cost to the insurance sector, and it just could not bear it.  The figure of &euro;75 million was always in the budget under this heading.  We have more than achieved that, which allows us bring in this measure on an incremental basis.</p><p>  I want to talk about why private health insurance is so costly in this country.  I have instructed the new leadership of VHI, through its new chairman and CEO, to address this under four separate headings.  The first of these is more robust auditing.  Everybody in this room has heard anecdotal evidence of subscribers looking at the bill paid by the insurer and declaring that he or she did not have this or that done although it has been paid for.  We need more robust auditing.  Something that has never happened - which in my view is astonishing - is clinical auditing, in which the treating physician is challenged as to whether the treatments given and the tests carried out were necessary.  That must be done.  Then we must look at how the VHI is billed per day, even by the public sector.  I want to change that to billing per procedure so that hospitals that are effective and efficient get their patients in on the day of procedures and home as soon as possible, as long as there is no co-morbidity that needs to be taken into consideration.  Those are the hospitals that will thrive.  Those which are inefficient and do not do so will not thrive.  As a form of quality control, we also will be watching readmission rates.  The last area to consider is what we pay consultants for the procedures they carry out.  Why are we paying at the same sort of rate for procedures that used take two hours to do but with new technology now only take 20 minutes?</p><p>  There are a host of areas in which we can save money and reduce costs to the consumer.  It is about getting back to that principle of reducing the cost as opposed to reducing the service and focusing on the outcomes for patients, not the inputs.  We are always talking about inputs; it is time to talk about outputs for the patient.  It is a question of whether the outcome for the patient has improved rather than how many doctors were at the bedside at the time.  From memory - I was trying to see if I could get the figures for this - private health insurance costs increased at a much greater rate over the period 2008 to 2011 than they have since.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned home help and home care services.  He is quite correct.  I was concerned about that last week.  I had taken soundings from many TDs and Senators who hear about people's problems and there were number of issues arising.  When we took the decision that this had to be done, there were certain issues with regard to the process that had to be fulfilled and I was not happy when I heard from many backbenchers that this was the case.  I have made it clear to the HSE, which has taken this on board and is redoubling its efforts, that no one's hours should be taken away without a full assessment - not a desktop assessment - of his or her case.  No one should be informed of a decision by voicemail; direct contact is vital.  Only in exceptional situations should this be carried out by letter.  It was suggested that a clear mechanism should be put in place for reviewing individual decisions.  This is something that many backbenchers felt they could not get around.</p> <p>How does one appeal a decision that was seen as absolutely unfair?  A designated individual is to be appointed in each integrated service area with responsibility for ensuring such reviews are carried out in as timely a manner as possible and an escalation process to a senior manager will be put in place in order that cases can be properly reviewed.  We have already put in place a weekly reporting arrangement to monitor reductions in home help hours and I have directed the HSE to provide more comprehensive reports every Monday.  Each integrated service area will nominate a senior official to deal with Oireachtas Members' inquiries about home help and home care packages because Members were experiencing difficulties in contacting an identified person in the HSE to make their case and organise an appeal.  Standardised guidelines for the provision of home help and home care packages are to be applied throughout the country.  It became clear during the course of our investigation that in some areas of the country home help was, in fact, home care, whereas in others home care is clearly related to more needy cases in terms of assisting people to get dressed, wash or go to the toilet.  A standard definition of what constitutes home help and home care will be agreed.  Just as we faced difficulties with the fair deal scheme because people were receiving long-term care under differing criteria, even though they were supposed to be using the same assessment tools, we have to introduce uniformity across the system.  That is the benefit of having a national organisation.  It will slow the process down, but I am more concerned with ensuring people receive the services for which they have been assessed than with meeting our targets for budgetary savings.</p></speech>

The lack of communication between the HSE and the people who require services has been appalling and does a disservice to all of us.  It is not good enough to leave a voice message stating X or Y will happen.  It is welcome that the review will not be a desktop exercise, but I hope it will be communicated to the individuals who make decisions at local level that they have to be humane in their approach, as opposed to sending a cold and calculated computer printout.</p></speech>

We have discussed the issue on a number of occasions.</p><p>  The issue of structural reform was raised.  This is important.  Deputy Billy Kelleher is particularly concerned about universal health insurance and that the report has not yet issued and that the model has not been agreed to.  It is described in the programme for Government as a multi-insurer model.  The universal health insurance group is advising us on the best way of implementing it.  The funding was always going to be a combination of insurance premiums and central funding to allow for community rating and risk equalisation.  Legislation on risk equalisation is before the D&aacute;il as one of four separate health related Bills.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, will outline the reasons the long-term illness legislation has been delayed.  As the Attorney General would point out, this has transpired to be difficult legislation because we are moving from an income threshold assessment of eligibility to disease entity eligibility criteria.  This task has proved to be more complex than was originally expected.  However, the funding issues can be addressed.  </p><p>  On who is responsible for what, Mr. O'Brien is the Accounting Officer for the HSE and responsible for the budget.  I am accountable to the Oireachtas for it.</p><p>  I will answer the questions from Deputies Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Healy before deferring to the Ministers of State, Deputies Alex White and Kathleen Lynch, and Mr. O'Brien.  I will refer the questions on the roll-out of bowel cancer screening and the plan to widen age groups to Mr. O'Brien.  </p><p>  In regard to the candidate colonoscopy units, top of the list is Cavan General Hospital.  The list also includes Kerry General Hospital; Louth County Hospital, Dundalk; Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore; Ennis General Hospital; South Tipperary General Hospital; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Wexford General Hospital; Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown; Letterkenny General Hospital; Mayo General Hospital; Mercy Hospital, Cork; Sligo General Hospital; St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin; and Tallaght hospital, Dublin.  Mr. O'Brien will deal with the question in a more comprehensive fashion.  He will also speak about our readiness to deal with referrals.</p><p>  In regard to the issue raised in question No. 21 and the comment that there is no floor for staff, there is, particularly in respect of mental health services.  I will refer this question to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and Mr. O'Brien.</p><p>  Deputy Healy asked about a public inquiry.  I have dealt with that issue.  If I set up an inquiry, I do not think I would have the power to compel witnesses to appear before it, whereas the HSE has such powers because the individuals concerned are its employees and it forms part of their contracts.  I would have to pass legislation to give me the requisite powers, which would only create further delay.  I ask that the HSE be allowed to get on with its inquiry which I believe is independent and let us see the results and the level of transparency before we make further demands for inquiries.</p><p>  I am not sure what question the Deputy was asking in regard to the significance of the budget, but he alluded to the number of trolleys.  The budget presents a real difficulty for us, but we are meeting the challenge.  We have addressed many of the inadequacies in the HSE identified in the Ogden report by implementing the measures it recommended.  Mr. O'Brien can speak further about the issue.  Notwithstanding reductions in budgets and personnel, the men and women working in the health service have not only maintained a safe service but have improved it, with a 25% reduction in the number of patients on trolleys, an 85% reduction in the number of patients who have to wait one year or longer for inpatient treatment, a 91% reduction in the number waiting nine months or longer and an 18% reduction in the number waiting three months or longer.  The number of children on the waiting list for inpatient treatment has also decreased by 1,800.  For the first time we have defined the full outpatient waiting list.  At 385,000 people, it looks like a staggering, almost overpowering, figure, but it is not.  We will deal with it in a fair fashion and the same way as we addressed the issues in emergency departments and inpatient treatment.  It should be borne in mind that 200,000 people are seen as outpatients every month.</p><p>  The report on hospital groups is to come to me through Mr. John Higgins.  I have to remind people that the hospital groups will operate for a trial period of a couple of years and that there will be plenty of time to report on problems and find out what works.  It will be 2015 before hospital trusts are formed.  These are the legally binding institutional arrangements.  </p><p>  I will refer the question on the Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles to the HSE.  I know there were plans to make funding available to address issues in the hospital.  I made it clear at the meeting that I would seek to have beds reopened on the basis that it was a modern facility and that we needed rehabilitation services.  I did not specify the number of beds at the time, but Mr. O'Brien may have something to say about the matter.</p><p>  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to address the questions on the long-term illness legislation.</p></speech>

GP care without fees would be a more accurate way of describing it because nothing is free.  The intention is to provide care that is free at the point of delivery.  It is not true to say we are no further down the road or that major progress has not been made.</p> <p>The legislation to give effect to the first phase of free GP care is at an advanced stage and since my arrival in the Department six weeks ago, I have had a number of meetings with officials in respect of the legislation.  As the Minister said, it is not without complication.  Since the last health Bill, our medical card system has been predicated on eligibility, which has to do with income and hardship.  The legislation will change the basis on which we provide a GP visit card and that will be predicated on, as the Minister indicated, certain designated or chronic illnesses.  It stands to reason that changing the basis on which these cards are awarded will require attention.  Despite how complicated it is, I assure Deputy Kelleher and the committee that the legislation is at an advanced stage.  I hope to meet officials again later this week.  It is close to being ready to be published.  There is always frustration, which I share as a new Minister of State at the pace of change.  We want to bring forward these changes, including universal health insurance, by the end of this D&aacute;il and we have set the target dates of 2015 and 2016, but it is unrealistic to set specific dates, for example, in 2013 for the delivery of particular projects.  We were asked about this last week by journalists.  We are pressing on as hard as we can.  It will be in earnest of our good faith when the legislation is published.  There will be progress and I assure the Deputy that we are working hard to bring it about.</p><p> I agree with the Minister regarding universal health insurance.  Deputy Kelleher reasonably asked whether there would be a debate.  There is no constraint on anybody having a discussion.  The Minister said the programme for Government sets out an agreed course and last week's document elaborates on that.  It does not purport to be the last word on every aspect but it is consistent with what is in the programme.  I hope that document will engender debate and input, including political input, into this important issue.  Nobody is saying there cannot be discussion.</p></speech>

There is a floor for the number of staff employed and the Mental Health Commission makes sure that is the case.  We should be grateful to the commission.  Ms McGuinness will outline the details of the numbers.  We are reviewing the Mental Health Acts because so much of the service will be moved into the community.  As Deputy Healy will be aware, significant work has been done in Clonmel and south Tipperary.  Deputy Mattie McGrath has told me it has been hugely successful.  I have taken notes of everyone's comments and I have written after Deputy Healy's name: "It will all end in tears."  That is his general view of the health service.  We also hope to get the Mental Health Commission to cast its eye on community-based services, which will ensure the balance between them and acute units is equalised.  We want to make sure there is an equality in delivery of services both in the community and in the acute units.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is correct that, at the end of the October, 17 posts had been filled.  Another 28.5 candidates have been asked to take up posts and that process is being progressed.  In addition, 275 candidates had been given offers and we are currently going through Garda clearance and checks and they will come in, while 67 other positions are being posted by human resources division.  Of the 416 posts, 28 are not in active progress.  We said in our service plan that we would progress to fill them in the final quarter of the year.  We are confident we will have a significant number of them in by the end of the year with some more at the beginning of next year.</p></speech>

Since 20 August this year, I have assumed all the responsibilities associated with the post of chief executive officer of the HSE, which includes the responsibility as its Accounting Officer, and it is expected that will continue to be my responsibility for the financial year, 2013.  In that context, I have an obligation to take all steps necessary to improve the financial position of the HSE.  We set about a number of things during the summer to do that.  We have talked about the negative consequences of some of those this afternoon.</p><p>  The Minister made reference to the Ogden report.  We have seen the health service take out &euro;2.5 billion over recent years and lose almost 10,000 staff, yet there have been considerable improvements in activity and performance in a number of areas.  The financial component of the HSE has also suffered attrition due to the antibodies that developed in the past decade to ICT projects.  The HSE is without an enterprise-wide financial solution and I pay tribute to the work done by the relatively small band of financial managers in the executive, recognising as the Minister often says, that while we invest significantly in the training of medical specialists, we have not distinguished ourselves in investment in management training and so on.  In response to the Ogden review to work alongside and support the internal cohort of financial managers, we have brought in additional personnel resources through procurement to beef that up in terms of a medium-term financial management turnaround process to work with our existing team of financial staff to build on the strengths they have and develop more robust systems for the future, not just in the context of the work we have to do today, but in the context of what we know from the framework and Government policy more generally are the future organisational arrangements for the health service, which create particular contexts and needs.</p><p>  It is intended that when the national colorectal screening programme is fully implemented, the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged between 55 and 74 on a two-yearly cycle but as 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged between 60 and 69, the programme will begin with this age cohort.  That has been the policy for some while.  That is a population of approximately 500,000 and it is anticipated that the first round will take up to three years to complete.  I was heavily involved with both BreastCheck and CervicalCheck and, typically in all screening programmes, the first round takes longer than the steady stage screening cycle.  Over time, the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55 to 74 age cohort but, at the moment, there is no predetermined timetable for that.  The Minister has outlined the list of candidate colonoscopy centres and the process of approving those units to go live is under way, the key objective being to ensure the screening programme does not interfere with symptomatic colonoscopy services in these hospitals.  The national cancer screening service, NCSS, is confident there will be adequate capacity to provide this important part of the programme and the Deputy may be aware that, under the targets commonly referred to as the special delivery unit targets, although they are HSE targets, significant improvement has been achieved in access to colonoscopy services.</p> <p>I do not have the figures with me but they are in the performance report and I can supply them.</p><p> A key feature of the bowel screening programme is that where a referral for a colonoscopy occurs, which will be to one of the candidate centres, in the vast majority of cases treatment, such as the removal of polyps, can be provided during the course of that colonoscopy.  The programme is already in test mode and a limited number of patients have been randomly selected so their samples can validate the processes.  It is planned that the first call letters will be issued before the end of the year, which means testing will commence early next year, with regard to the response to these call letters.  I spoke to those responsible for the programme recently and they are very confident the roll-out will proceed.</p><p> I will ask Ms McGuinness to speak about the position on home helps.</p></speech>

It is also correct to state this has not been applied appropriately in all cases, and where this has happened the situation has been rectified.  We have identified in each local area a person to whom public representatives can go and this list is available and has been circulated.  In addition, all managers have been advised that an assessment should be carried out by a public health nurse or a health professional and no reduction should be made in the absence of this assessment.  Messages should not be left on answering machines and where possible people should be contacted on a personal basis.  This is not always possible.</p></speech>

I can confirm that at present there are no plans to open further beds in the facility before the end of the year.  However, the position will be actively reviewed in the context of the 2013 service plan, as with all matters of this type.  Perhaps an over-expectation has been created about this location with regard to a Deputy in the area, and I have arranged to meet him to discuss it in the very near future.</p><p>  I wish to turn to the review under way in Galway and I will ask my colleague, Dr. Philip Crowley, to speak when I conclude.  It is very important to stress that while we have an excellent national record with regard to maternal mortality, unfortunately maternal mortality is a fact of our service and as a result of this established protocols are in place for carrying out such reviews.  A number of such reviews are conducted each year and others apart from the matter we are discussing are ongoing and incomplete at present.</p><p>  The typical protocol at first line is that the reviews are carried out by the institution in which the death occurred, so the inclusion of members of staff of an institution is not unusual or aberrant.  In this instance, those who saw coverage or read reports of the media event yesterday in which the professor who will chair the review took part will know he made clear that he had asked for persons not involved in the care of Ms Halappanavar but who had significant knowledge of the processes and procedures of the hospital in question to be part of the review.  Consequently they were included.  I welcome Deputy Kelleher's acknowledgement that their agreement to step aside, which I will discuss, is in no way a reflection on them or their professional integrity.  Given the particular circumstances arising we were of the view it would be beneficial to bring in a distinguished international expert with significant experience of carrying out such reviews to chair this review on an independent basis and we did so.  People will agree he is an excellent choice for the role.  As I stated, he had a particular view about the resources he needed to be available to him.  We are very anxious to get to the bottom of what happened in Galway and we recognise the necessity of securing the full co-operation of the family.  It is in response to their concerns that we discussed the matter with the chair of the review and the Galway personnel involved, and by mutual consent they have stepped down from the role and will be replaced by others with expertise in the relevant disciplines from outside Galway.</p><p>  A question was asked about the level of contact we have had with the family.  Mr. Halappanavar is represented by Irish-based solicitors whom we have contacted to seek direct contact with Mr. Halappanavar but this has not been made possible at this stage.  I understand of course the significant distress Mr. Halappanavar is undergoing and the difficulty that may be presented to him in making himself available to us.  It is for this reason that a renewed effort has been made today and the independent chair of the review group has sought a meeting with Mr. Halappanavar.</p><p>  I have an absolute obligation as the director-general designate of the HSE in any and all circumstances to inquire into an event of this type.  It is absolutely in the public interest that we get to the bottom of what happened, particularly in the context of the broader allegations in circulation which are of concern to our population as a whole.  Consequently I must make arrangements for this review to proceed.  The team is in Galway.  I hope Mr. Halappanavar and his legal advisers will come to the view the best course of action now is for him, if he can, to make himself available to the chairman so his evidence and that of other members of his family can be brought to bear so we can get to the bottom of what happened, in particular so we can ensure any lessons that need to be learned can be learned and applied.</p><p>  We will have to consider how best to proceed with the review in the event this does not happen because, as I stated, I have an obligation to pursue this review.  I can absolutely guarantee, for the benefit of anyone who may be listening, including in particular the friends and relatives of Ms Halappanavar, no attempt whatever will be made to avoid getting to the absolute truth.  Whatever we find out we will find out, and whatever must follow from that will follow from it.  However, we need Mr. Halappanavar's full co-operation and if he is listening to, hearing about or reading my words I hope he will find it possible to meet the chair of the review in his interests, in the interests of the review and in the wider interests of the people of Ireland.</p></speech>

The purpose of this in the first instance is to ensure if any elements arise in the investigation which suggest there could be any potential risk or harm to any other woman attended our maternity services that we address it immediately and that we do not await the end of an investigation or an inquest process which can take longer.</p> <p>It is our policy to investigate ourselves when adverse events occur.  As Mr. O'Brien stated, in many instances this may be done effectively by local staff in a local institution with national incident management team oversight and with our audit and review to ensure that our policies, which are based on evidence and best international practice, are pursued and that the investigations are done in such a way that the root causes are found, addressed and subjected to recommendations.  We pursue this process in all instances.</p></speech>

I was not aware that 1.8 million people had medical cards.  Every week, a number of people contact me about availing of medical cards.  In most cases, they are successful.  I am glad to see that an additional 144,000 medical cards have been introduced to the scheme.  Once my constituents enter the system, they are happy with and have trust in the service they receive.  The difficulty lies in trying to enter the system.  Perhaps we need to promote more the good news story on page 4.</p><p>  Are there plans to increase the age limit for women availing of BreastCheck?</p><p>  The committee has held a number of meetings on obesity.  One doctor told us that mothers were not breastfeeding and, as a possible result, children were becoming more overweight.  Are there plans for an information or education programme?  Are there plans for a parental information programme on children's nutrition and preventing obesity?</p><p>  I wish to ask about specialised not-for-profit charities, in particular the LauraLynn House palliative and respite care service, which does good work but is under pressure, and a body that will interest the Chairman, namely, the organisation that trains guide dogs in Cork.  The latter is also under pressure and has needed to withdraw dogs from children with autism who have had them for a number of years.  Due to cutbacks, dogs are not being trained and children cannot avail of the service.</p></speech>

It is a great tragedy.  The public, particularly the parts of it serviced by the hospital group, wants the truth about and the facts of the case as soon as possible.  An impression is being given that maternity services in this country and the hospital group are unsafe, but that is not the case.  The group's standards meet the best international standards.  Anything that can be done to facilitate the completion of the investigation and to reveal the facts of the case needs to be encouraged.  I hope that the family can participate in the inquiry.</p><p>  The Minister referred to a 6% increase in emergency department activity and mentioned that admissions from emergency departments had increased by 2.5% in the first nine months of this year.  Are the changes to community supports and the failure to fill the community nursing vacancies and so forth having an impact in this regard?  Will the Minister focus on this issue during the next year to try to remove some of the pressure?  The issue of home help is tied into this matter.  From the figures supplied to me by the HSE, an approximate average of 5.68 hours has been taken from individual clients since the beginning of September.  Up to 12,500 clients may have had their hours reduced.  This puts pressure on emergency services.</p></speech>

First, I welcome the independent investigation into the allegations around our crisis pregnancy services.  I also welcome the changes that have been made to the investigation into Savita's death.</p><p>  My second point may seem trivial.  I understand the professionalism and the protocols, namely, what must be done to tick boxes from a professional organisation's perspective.  Where this type of investigation is held, they are usually into real tragedies involving real human beings.  Politicians and organisations such as the HSE are constantly abused for being "desensitised".  Can the HSE humanise its press releases or the language used in any investigation that is necessary?  Serious offence has been caused, not just to Savita's family, but to the majority of Irish people by yesterday's announcements.</p><p>  I wish to ask about the financial overview.</p></speech>

I expected it to be much more.  I am delighted that private health insurers have agreed to make a one-off and up-front payment of &euro;125 million.  What will be done about the amount of money that remains outstanding?</p><p>  There is a &euro;400 million overspend.  The Minister stated that the HSE's range of measures will reduce that deficit by the year's end.  I am being asked about what those measures are.</p><p>  I have asked the Minister to reduce the attendance fee of &euro;100 at Louth County Hospital.  On 29 June 2010, the hospital stopped functioning as an acute hospital.  The paediatric, obstetrics and trauma services were transferred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  The hospital's opening hours are 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., but there are rumours in the area that it will close at 5 p.m. seven days per week.  If the fee was reduced, many patients would present at Dundalk, thereby helping with the trolley situation at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.</p></speech>

I wish to give my condolences on the sad death of a beautiful woman and a lovely unborn child.</p><p>  I will move straight to question No. 23.  I wished to raise many issues, but there is not much that one can ask in two minutes.  The question relates to 2008 and 2009 and I have raised it at this committee numerous times during the past 17 months.</p> <p>It is about the Hollybrook Community Nursing Unit in Inchicore.  It has been ready for use for the last couple of months but, unfortunately, it is lying dormant.  There is not enough time to deal with many of the questions, but I will ask a few.  If the Minister cannot reply now, I would welcome a reply to them as soon as possible.  Are the beds in Hollybrook new or replacement beds?  What does this mean for the people who are on the waiting list for the beds under the fair deal?  If the patients are transferred directly from St. James's Hospital, which has been mentioned, what will happen to the people on the fair deal scheme who are on the list and have expressed their interest in Hollybrook?  Can the Minister provide a time frame for the opening of this unit?  Will he clarify if there are talks under way with the new chief executive officer of St. James's Hospital to transfer the patients to Hollybrook?  Between 2008 and 2009 the community of Inchicore and the surrounding area was given a commitment by the HSE that 18% of the beds would be allocated to people living in the area.  Will the Minister or the HSE clarify, if possible, that this will still happen?  People in the local area are very worried.  We bought into this in 2008 and 2009 and it is crunch time now.  It would be most helpful if the Minister would answer those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012112000015#O00200"><p>I did not submit questions so I do not wish to catch the Minister on the hop.  I wish to make a few general points and put a question about the Halappanavar tragedy.  The Minister and our colleagues will be aware that Ireland has extremely low maternal mortality.  In some years there are no maternal deaths and in most years there is one or perhaps two.  Most western countries that have varying degrees of legalised abortion have similar rates.  It is more an index of social issues and of health status than being specifically to do with abortion.  When these deaths occur they are incredible tragedies.  They are among the worst deaths that any doctor, nurse of family member would ever have to deal with.  It means a totally natural and beautiful phenomenon, childbirth, being destroyed by one and sometimes two deaths.  It can be argued that very occasionally one would be prevented by termination of pregnancy.  For that reason it could also be argued that we need legislation.  The rarity of maternal death, which has been quoted as an argument for not legislating, is not a valid argument.  Even if we prevent one death every two, three or five years because the appropriate legislation is in place, that is sufficient grounds for having the legislation.  We pass legislation on all manner of matters in these Houses that never saves a life.  If we can pass a law that might save somebody's life every three or four years, it is critical that we do so.</p><p>  The committee structure is manifestly unsuitable.  Ireland is small and it is well known in medical legal circles that because of the small medical community in the country it is often difficult to get Irish doctors to take part in medical legal disputes.  Selecting three people from the consultant cohort of 122 consultants in Galway was <i>ab initio</i> a mistake.  It would probably be a good idea to have more of an international presence on this committee.  I am not saying we should not have some Irish doctors but it would be important to have a more international presence.  Is it appropriate to ask who or at what level or what organisation or structure within the HSE picked that committee?  There is a certain degree of accountability implicit in coming to that conclusion.</p></speech>

Also, at the launch of the Home and Community Care Ireland group in recent weeks, the group reported it could make savings of up to &euro;280 million on home care while creating more hours for home carers.  What is the Minister's view on that?</p><p>  I also have a question for Mr. O'Brien.  In respect of the centralised buying conducted by the HSE in its procurement unit or in the individual areas, such as my area in Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan and so forth, are any of the procured materials, be they dry goods, food or the like, invoiced to individual hospitals at a margin to the HSE?  If there is a margin, how is that calculated?  Will Mr. O'Brien comment on that?</p></speech>

I will remind him of them.  With regard to the reports of a &euro;900 million cut in the health budget for 2013 and the projected further loss of more than 3,200 staff across the health service, I was citing the response the Minister gave me when I stated that nursing floors do not apply.  That was in the reply I received to question No. 21 relating to mental health.</p><p>  Again, perhaps the Minister would take on board the proposition relating to rare diseases.  It would be a terrible miss given that we only have a chance every 14 years to hold the EU Presidency.  It is something that would have a massive impact.</p></speech>

I pointed out that this is a temporary arrangement for two years.  A report will come to me and it will have to be checked by my Department from the point of view of patient safety, patient services and financial implications.  There will be ample opportunity for all those groups to be consulted on the working of the groups as they apply over the period of two years for which they will be in trial before we go to the permanent situation of hospital trusts.</p><p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the &euro;900 million savings that must be made next year are a combination of programme for Government commitments, increased pressure through demographics and the carry forward of the deficit.  It is a challenge but it is one we will meet.  Regarding the 3,200 staff, or 6,400 over two years, these are proposals from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are still in negotiation with that Department with regard to how they will impact on health.  As I said earlier, I am focused on cutting the cost of service, not cutting the service to people who need it.  I wish to maintain as much service as possible so I am looking at how to cut the cost of service.</p><p>  Senator MacSharry asked about home help and increases in emergency department activity and admissions.  That is highly unlikely.  The figures we have are up to September-October.  The issues surrounding home help and home care have only come to pass since about October, so they could not have any impact.  Basically, it is due to demographics.  As people get older they tend to get more illnesses and cancer.  That is the reality of life.  However, we hope to address that through more emphasis on prevention and well-being and more care of chronic illness in the community.</p><p>  I agree with Senator Crown's comments about the rarity of maternal death in this country.  However, that is no argument for delay in addressing the ABC case.  This is a tragic incident that occurred in one of our hospitals and it must be investigated expeditiously for the reasons outlined, not just to remove any uncertainty for Mrs. Halappanavar's family but also to assure women, who are expecting a child and will have to use services at a hospital, that the service there is safe.  The ABC case is a separate issue.  The Government has commissioned a report on it from the expert group.</p> <p>I will be bringing it to Government next Tuesday and I hope the Cabinet will agree to its immediate publication.  There will be time for a long discussion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, with no time limits so that everyone has the opportunity to express themselves.  In the past, some of the discussions and debates were limited, with two or three minutes per contributor.  This issue is too serious to allow that format but we are not holding the debate to delay proceedings.  We have Friday sittings so we should use them.  We should make sure everyone gets to speak on this, that all political parties have the opportunity to digest it and that the broader public has the opportunity to become engaged through access to the report.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about Hollybrook, which was built for the specific purpose of looking after the people from the area of Inchicore.  Earlier this year, the HSE proposed to relocate current services, including staff and patients, from St. Brigid's Hospital in Crooksling as it was not compliant with the HIQA standards.  This would enable the closure of St. Brigid's Hospital in Crooksling.  However, having regard to the wishes of patients at St. Brigid's Hospital and the need to maximise the level of service provision in the region, the services at Crooksling will be maintained and an alternative avenue of opening the Inchicore unit is being explored.  Crooksling has been modified in terms of the model of care possible after the reduction from four to three units.  In light of the public sector moratorium and the significant additional reduction in staff numbers required over the coming two years, it is essential all possible approaches are considered in respect of how the unit may be opened.  One option is through use of a public private partnership agreement.  The model has been used successfully by the HSE to open a 100-bed unit for older persons in Ballincollig, Cork.  The unit delivers real cost benefits and value to the system, which would not be possible through direct employment.  I visited the unit and the patients are happy.  There is a great range of services and the Chairman of this committee knows it well.  It is operating at a cost of &euro;5.2 million when the estimated cost of the HSE operating it was &euro;7 million.  The HSE is also considering the Inchicore unit in light of the recent decision to locate the new children's hospital on the St. James's Hospital site.  In these circumstances, the future of the long-term care unit on the St. James's Hospital site must be considered.  Many of the people in the unit are from the area and its environs.  Any decision on either unit will be taken in the best interests of the existing patients in the local area.  I hope that clarifies the situation.</p><p> Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick asked about private health insurance and generic drugs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, apologises as he had to go to the Seanad to reply to an Adjournment matter because another Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, had to leave and was unable to reply to it.  The generic drugs market is quite small in comparison with what it might be.  Reference was made to the producers of the drugs and decreasing prices by way of agreement.  Generic prescribing legislation and drug reference pricing legislation will allow us to make more savings in this regard.  The more generic drugs, rather than branded drugs, that are prescribed, the greater the opportunity for cuts to occur.  What saves most money is doctors not prescribing when there is little indication to do so and something is more likely to be a viral illness than a bacterial illness.  On Northern Ireland television, there was a great advertisement years ago suggesting one does not need a pill for every ill.  People sometimes feel they have wasted their money when they go to a doctor unless they get a prescription.  People should remember one has paid for a professional opinion on health and the reassurance that brings.  In any event, when free GP care comes in - and it will despite what many people believe - that issue will be easier to address.  We now have a new prescribing advisory council, with six new pharmacists gone into the payment board to examine GPs prescribing, to help them be more cost-effective and to advise them if they are out of kilter with their colleagues in various areas of prescribing.</p><p> Reference was made to private health insurers and the outstanding moneys.  Mr. O'Brien can respond to that.  Some of it is insurance money but more of it refers to other fees due to hospitals or overnight stays.  Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick also referred to reducing the attendance fee at the Louth County Hospital.  Perhaps we can discuss that in a different forum.  We do not want people to start heading to Louth County Hospital because it is cost free instead of going to their GPs.  Some reduction may be in order but we will have to discuss the technicalities at a later date.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to mental health.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-20a.315" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="18:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012112000016#P00300"><p>The strategic framework referenced earlier contains a specific commitment to increase the age range for BreastCheck to encompass the 65 to 69 age range.  The framework envisages it happening before 2015.  I think it will be in 2014.  A number of questions concerned the connectivity between what we might loosely called cutbacks elsewhere and the impact on emergency unit attendances.  The number of attendances at the emergency unit reported relate to a period that predates the impact of the recent cuts so it is unlikely there is a direct connection.  In other jurisdictions, particularly our neighbouring jurisdictions, there is an increase in emergency unit attendances, presentations and admissions.  There is a great challenge for health services in Europe in respect of emergency unit avoidance measures and how to redirect to an appropriate alternative persons whose best care may not be in an emergency unit.  That is a priority for us as we examine the resources available to us and the increasing utilisation of emergency units.  What is more important is that those who present at emergency units are dealt with expeditiously and appropriately.  This is why we have a focus on reducing the number of people recorded on trolleys as awaiting admission.  Significant progress has been made this year although we are not satisfied that we are where we need to be.  In the coming year, in particular, we will focus on the reduction of the journey time through emergency units in order that the great majority of patients are either sent home or admitted within six hours.  In other jurisdictions they managed to reduce it to four hours but they have been working on this for longer than our programme has been under way.</p><p>  With regard to the questions on financial matters, one question concerned procurement, another referred to cost saving measures and a third referred to the make-up of outstanding insurance claims.  I ask Mr. Liam Woods, the director of finance, to address these.  The overrun reported in the month of September in community schemes was, in a straightforward manner, the cost of the increased number of medical cards over and above the numbers provided for.  The sum of &euro;29 million is part of a cumulative figure of the year to date to the figure of &euro;180 million to the end of September.  There are no measures available to us to curtail costs because they are demand-led schemes.  The cost containment measures are outside that area and I will ask Mr. Liam Woods to address that also.</p></speech>

Perhaps her comment on crisis pregnancy services was to welcome the investigation.  The questions put by Deputies Naughten and Mitchell O'Connor relate to Mr. Tony O'Brien rather than me.</p></speech>

The answer to that is "No" and if there is any incident the Deputy is aware of, I would be interested to hear about it.  There is no such policy.  We are a cost-based organisation and there is no attempt to do what is suggested.</p><p>  In terms of the specific deficits on schemes in the year to date, I do not have the data with me but they are published and available on the website.  I can get a copy for the Deputy for all schemes.  High-tech schemes and the long-term illness scheme are the biggest single contributors to that.</p> <p>The data are in our published report and I will send a copy to the Deputy.</p><p> At the end of October there was &euro;206 million in outstanding claims due to the HSE.  The work under way that the Minister and CEOs referred to in terms of accelerating income is with a view to receiving &euro;125 million of that.  The Deputy asked about older claims and the target is to collect the older claims within that &euro;125 million.  It is all inclusive.  The &euro;125 million target for this was in the service plan and is now being delivered.  The entire issue is being addressed.</p></speech>

The national average is about five hours per person and reductions are in the range of half an hour to an hour.  Since the reductions commenced, 72,000 hours have been cumulatively reduced across the country.  It is important to note the balance of that and where it has been.  The majority of hours reduced have been in the south, 59,000 hours, but in Cork alone 82,000 home help hours are delivered over and above what should be delivered according to the service plan.  A further 12,000 hours are being delivered in Waterford over and above what should be delivered, and an extra 20,000 in Wexford.  That is why the proportion is so high.  In the west, the cumulative figure for the reduction is 9,000 hours.  There is high level of over-delivery in the west too, particularly around Sligo-Leitrim, where there are 30,000 hours delivered over and above what should be delivered.  North Tipperary and east Limerick have 17,000 extra hours, Donegal has an over-provision of 17,000, Limerick has an over-provision of 14,000 and Mayo has an over-provision of 6,000.</p></speech>

That is why Ms McGuinness is going through the details.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's commitment that 18% of the beds will be ring-fenced for the people of the local area, not just in Inchicore but in Ballyfermot and Kilmainham.  If they are not going to be new beds, we must ensure the people who are in the Fair Deal system at the moment get the chance to stay in the communities where they live.
