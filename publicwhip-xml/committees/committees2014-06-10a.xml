The Minister will brief the committee on two items, the agenda for the Agriculture and Fisheries Council next week and his views on the sub-committee on fisheries report on promoting sustainable rural coastal and island communities.  The Minister has an hour and three quarters and I will try to divide the time equally between both items.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I call the Minister to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000003#D00500"><p>Next week's meeting will the final Council presided over by the Greek Presidency.  Next month, Italy will assume the Presidency.  As with all end of term Councils, the agenda is long.  This reflects the custom at the end of each rotating Presidency to take stock of developments over the previous six months.  The bulk of the items for discussion are progress reports outlining the state of play on dossiers discussed since January last or conclusions drafted by the Presidency for approval by the Council on those dossiers.</p><p>  I am happy to go through the agenda but many of the issues are still being discussed in the preparatory body for the Council, the Special Committee on Agriculture, SCA, which is meeting in Brussels today to clear up technical issues and reach agreement on the less political points.  This means that the final agenda for next week&rsquo;s meeting may change in the light of developments today and members might bear that in mind as we go through the issues.</p><p>  The first item is the future of milk policy.  From Ireland&rsquo;s point of view, the key issue for discussion is item 8, the report of the Commission on the development of the market situation in the dairy sector.  Under the terms of the milk package, which is the set of accompanying measures agreed in 2011 to complement the exit from milk quotas, planned for next year, the Commission is obliged to submit a report to the Council by the end of June on the milk market situation and the functioning of the milk package.  This report will only be released later and, therefore, I am unable to brief the committee on it but the key focus of discussion is likely to be on the Presidency&rsquo;s proposed Council conclusions on the future of the dairy sector.  A draft of these conclusions was discussed this morning at the SCA but the outcome was inconclusive.  We will have to wait and see what happens before the Council.</p><p>  The situation in the dairy sector has been discussed at every Council under the Greek Presidency.  It is no surprise to hear that Ireland has been vocal during these debates.  The position is that the Council is divided on the steps that should be taken in the run-up to, and following the abolition of quotas.  Ireland is among an increasing number of member states that are arguing that the soft landing envisaged for expiry of quotas is not happening in all member states.  It is certainly not happening here.  We have lobbied for measures to be taken to address this, notably through an adjustment of the butterfat correction coefficient.  Our allies on this include Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Poland, Luxembourg, Estonia, Belgium and Latvia.  However, another large group of member states, including France, Spain, UK, Sweden and Italy, are opposed to taking action.  Some are linking this issue to the policy direction to be taken after quotas expire - in particular France  - and there are subtle hints that some, at least, would like to see the reintroduction of some form of supply control in case of a crisis in the sector.</p><p>  I will argue strongly at next week&rsquo;s Council for immediate action to address the short-term issue of the soft landing and I will be unequivocal in my opposition to reintroducing any form of supply control when quotas cease next April.  I favour intensive monitoring of market prices and the rapid deployment of existing instruments such as intervention prices, aids to private storage and so on should a crisis occur.  The key issue on the milk package, which is the most important issue for us next week, is countries that were not overly keen to abolish milk quotas are trying to use the butterfat correction coefficient to negotiate market controls post-quota abolition should the price fall.  In other words, they would like countries such as Ireland, which are planning to increase output, to be curtailed from doing so should the price fall and we will vehemently oppose that.  We have been preparing for four years for quota abolition.  Our farmers have invested heavily, and continue to invest, to do this while our processing sector has spent the guts of &euro;500 million in preparation for the change.  Most of the markets we are planning to expand into with the increased volume we will produce are outside the EU.  They include China, Russia, the Middle East, north Africa and so on.  Even though we are planning for rapid growth, the overall percentage this will contribute to the Union's milk pool is relatively small.  There will be price volatility in the diary sector, whether Ireland produces more milk, but we will not tolerate a scenario where Ireland will be penalised because it could become the fastest growing producer of milk in the EU following the quota abolition.</p><p>  The problem is we are trying to negotiate the butterfat correction coefficient.  That is the only flexibility the European Commission has without having to go back through a co-decision process to help ease us out of quotas.  The commission has the power to change a technical measurement tool such as the butterfat correction coefficient and that would give a country such as Ireland an additional 2% in milk quota this year, which would help us reduce the super levy fine that many farmers will be subject to because they are planning for expansion by building their herds and so on.  This year, we will not have the advantage of the additional 1% in quota that we secured last year and the year before as part of the soft landing policy, which is why the butterfat correction coefficient would be useful for Irish farmer to reduce the fines.  I will answer questions on this later.</p><p>  The next item is school fruit and school milk schemes, which are relevant to Ireland because they have helped to finance programmes such as Food Dudes and the milk scheme that has been available to primary schools.</p> <p> Items 4 and 5 concern the Commission's proposal to merge the two separate EU-funded school schemes, the school milk scheme, promoting consumption of fresh milk, and the school fruit scheme, promoting consumption of fruit and vegetables among schoolchildren.  The Presidency will present a progress report on this proposal.  The key issues outstanding are the scope of products that should be eligible for these schemes and how funding for the school milk element will be allocated between member states.  We favour broadening the scope of products to include cheese and yogurt.  We also believe that funding for the milk element should be allocated on an objective basis according to the population of schoolchildren as a proportion of the overall population.  Ireland is unusual in that it has more schoolchildren per head of population than any other country in the European Union.  If not, we are certainly in the top two or three.  School fruit is already allocated on that basis, but most member states would prefer allocation based on the historical use of funds, for obvious reasons.</p><p> The next issue relates to producer organisations in the fruit and vegetables sector.  The Presidency will present draft Council conclusions on how the producer organisation provisions in the fruit and vegetables sector have worked since the regime was reformed in 2007.  The draft conclusions welcome the Commission's report, share its assessment that producer organisations are spread unevenly across the EU, and highlight the need for a clear, unambiguous and simple set of rules for sharing best practice and the effective use of market management measures.  We fully support the text.  One of the ambitions of the new CAP between now and 2020 is to create stronger producer organisations that can negotiate collectively for farmers and primary food producers, and more effectively than has been the case in the past.  That is not so relevant to the dairy sector, but it is hugely relevant in beef and fruit and vegetables. </p><p> The next item is an optional quality term, which is "product of island farming".  I suspect that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Deputy Pringle and some other Deputies from coastal communities that contain islands might be interested in this.  The Presidency intends to present draft Council conclusions on the case for an optional quality term, "product of island farming".  In other words, it would be a new category of food production in the European Union.  Notwithstanding that a Commission report was sceptical about the benefits of such a term, some member states are keen on the idea, namely, Greece - whose Presidency it is, which is why it is pushing it.  I have an open mind on this.  While there has been no demand to date from island communities here for a particular labelling structure of this kind, I believe that we should do all we can to address the disadvantages associated with island farming.  I have already shown my commitment to island farming by providing in the draft RDP for a top-up under the new scheme for areas of natural constraint.  However, some member states are opposed to the idea of introducing an optional quality term for island farming, so we will wait and see what happens next week.  If we can get something out of this for island communities in Ireland, I am all for it, but there are problems in terms of what it means for PGI status, for example.  It is an issue where we should look for an opportunity.  It does not solve all problems, but it is an option worth pursuing.  </p><p> A possible item for discussion and adoption is a draft decision authorising the opening of negotiations on agreements between the EU and third countries on trade in organic products.  This is about ensuring mutual recognition of organic production systems between the EU and third countries, with a view to enhancing the EU&rsquo;s export opportunities and protecting against imports that are not authentically organic.  This issue has existed for some time and we hope to resolve it. </p><p> Ministers will also have an exchange of views about the implementation of CAP reform at a national level, and I will be outlining Ireland&rsquo;s plans in that regard.  As the committee will know, I have made a number of detailed announcements concerning both Pillar 1 direct payments and our rural development plan.  I thank the committee for its very useful submission on the RDP.  I have already taken on board a number of its proposals, notably concerning organic farming, which will receive a significant increase in support, and locally led environmental schemes. We plan to expand what has worked - in the Burren, for example - to other parts of the country through a competitive process so that the best projects are financed.  We also intend to support our on-farm investments and the new GLAS scheme as far as is possible within the funding envelope.  I know that the committee had proposed higher top payments in relation to GLAS, but we are trying to get as many farmers into it as we can as well.  Let us not forget that this is a scheme that, when it is fully up and running, will be worth about &euro;260 million.  I know that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is concerned about delays to payments, but perhaps we can deal with the detail of that when we have our question-and-answer session.  I can assure him that there are no delays on our side. </p><p>Of course, the draft rural development programme is not finished yet, although we are at an advanced point.  The strategic environmental assessment is under way, the consultation period for which closes on Monday.  We aim to submit a draft RDP to the Commission by the end of this month and thereafter there will be a period of negotiation and discussion with the Commission before the plan is approved.  That may take a number of months; in other words, we might not have the RDP approved until close to the end of the year.  If one is opening a GLAS scheme and planning on bringing in 25,000 or 30,000 farmers, it will take a number of months to manage that many farmers applying for one scheme.</p><p> There are two fisheries items on the agenda that are of relevance to Ireland, but perhaps we can discuss fishing separately at a later stage.  If there are any other questions that members have on LPIS, penalties or beef round tables, I will happily answer them, but I do not want to hog the entire meeting.  Perhaps it is appropriate to open the meeting to questions at this stage. </p></speech>

Perhaps we could limit our questions or comments to three minutes each, because we have a substantial agenda to get through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000004#E00300"><p>On the milk situation, I note what the Minister said about efforts to reverse the policy.  My main concern is that some people might become involved in huge investments in milk without doing proper price sensitivity tests and factoring in enough volatility.  There is always a temptation on the part of people who go to invest to think that they have considered the best scenario and the worst scenario, but the worst scenario is not as bad as the really worst scenario.  I would be worried particularly about young people investing without enough capital, being totally or highly dependent on borrowing and then running into trouble.</p><p>  Will the Minister tell us how many children benefit from the milk and fruit schemes, and will the new proposal make it simpler to administer at a national level?  Are the benefits of the scheme focused on those who are most in need? </p><p>  On the term "island farming", can the Minister confirm that a farmer would have to produce and process on the islands?  That is my understanding of it.  If that is so, it is relatively irrelevant in the context of the Irish islands.  A second issue is whether islands connected to the mainland by causeways and bridges might still be considered islands.  One drives on to Achill Island via a bridge, for example.  Can the Minister confirm that?  Thirdly, what is the maximum size of island allowed?  There was always great debate on this in Europe, where we have Sardinia, Corsica, Ireland and Sicily with 5 million people and so on.  I am not sure that the idea is of any relevance to Ireland when one considers the scale of European islands.</p> <p>The Western Isles and the Shetland Islands in Scotland are much bigger than our islands.  Scotland has smaller islands but I am referring to the bulk of the islands.  Will the Minister comment on this?  I am not convinced it is hugely relevant.  Store cattle produced on an island are taken to the mainland, as happens everywhere else.  Other produce is minimal and is consumed on the islands.</p><p> My views on the CAP package are well known but I seek clarification on several issues.  Under the GLAS conditions for commonages 50% of farmers must join on the same day for Tier 2.  Is this active farmers on a commonage or all landowners?  There is a huge difference between the two.  Is this with regard to 50% of those who submitted an area aid application or 50% of those who own a share in the commonage?  Whether or which, in most commonages this will be unworkable.  Will it be possible to return to the individuality of the previous CAP?  If we cannot do so the vast majority of commonage farmers will be locked out of the GLAS scheme.  I cannot see the Minister getting 50%, or 80% for Tier 1, to join with a total farm on the same day.  It is crucial to get clarification on this today.</p><p> Another issue which arises with regard to commonages is the regulation seems to contain an indication that a farmer who does not put sheep or cattle on the commonage would no longer be able to claim that land.  In the past many farmers had a handy arrangement.  For example, if Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and I were in a commonage and both of us also had enclosed land, and he had sheep on the commonage but I did not bother putting sheep there, which suited him because he could put more sheep there, until now both of us could claim a single farm payment on all our farms, like any other farmer, so long as they were in good agricultural and environmental condition.  The regulation seems to indicate that if I did not actually put livestock on the commonage, even if it was kept in good agricultural and environmental condition by our combined efforts, I would not be able to receive any single farm payment, not only for the commonage but also for my own land.  Is this a fact?  The regulation seems to be less than specific but it seems to open up this possibility.</p><p> If the CAP opens at the end of this year, based on previous experience it will take several months to prepare plans and submit applications so farmers will join at some stage in 2015.  From a reply the Minister gave to a parliamentary question the indications are the first payment of 75% would be received at the end of the first year of the scheme.  This means, if one is lucky, one's first payment will be towards the end of 2016 and the 25% will follow in due course.  This is if the Department can handle 25,000 applications promptly.  It took the Department five or six months to handle 6,000 agri-environment options scheme payments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000005#F00200"><p>There were reasons for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000005#F00300"><p>Perhaps the Minister will explain them to us.  It did take five months.  If 30,000 farmers suddenly seek new GLAS plans the planners will have to work promptly.  There are other factors which could cause delays.  Time will prove me right that it will be late 2016 before the payments start to flow.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned that much is in the rural development plan.  Does he mean expenditure to the end of 2022?  The Minister stated &euro;260 million is available for GLAS.  Does he mean for payments to the end of 2022 or 2020?</p><p>  Farmers have been severely penalised because of the LPIS issue, which should not have happened because it was not the farmers' fault.  They had no way of measuring with the accuracy now required.  There seems to be a big issue with regard to Europe imposing penalties on Ireland which could affect the country's agriculture budget.  Why did the Ministers, in the negotiation of the CAP, not revise dramatically the entire penalty regime to ensure it was not that severe on countries and individual farmers?  It seems to be overly severe.</p></speech>

The Minister's presentation makes clear the divisions between the big powers, with Britain, France, Spain and Sweden on one side and Germany on the other.  The Minister also stated some will want to see the re-introduction of some form of supply control.  The quota was the supply control.  Has the Minister seen an indication something similar will be introduced to limit the-----</p></speech>

The UK does not.  The countries seeking more supply control post-quota in the instance of price volatility are essentially speaking about Commission intervention in a way which would limit the growth potential of countries seeking to expand.  This is something we cannot support.  The UK is against the butter fat correction but it is not in favour of more supply controls post-quota, whereas Spain and France are.  Different countries are in different positions.  The Deputy is right that there is a strong block which is not overly keen on quota abolition, and it will seek significant market intervention tools for the Commission, which I do not believe is in Ireland's interest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000005#F00600"><p>Is it fair to state the concerns regarding supply control are determined by the market value of the produce?  Many people are concerned that an increase in production will mean the price will drop.  At present milk prices are very good at 38 cent or 39 cent a litre, but just over a year ago the price was 23 cent or 24 cent a litre.  Huge investment has been made on the island with regard to intensification and an increase in production.</p><p>  The Minister stated he aims to submit the draft rural development plan by the end of this month, after which there will be a period of negotiation.  Is it possible for the committee to have sight of this?</p></speech>

The committee should know what I am sending to Europe.  An environmental assessment is under way and we will engage in consultation at the end of this process, which will be Monday.  We must try to take account of people's submissions and finalise the document by the end of the month.  We also have a timescale for the Pillar 1 submissions on, for example, how we will manage direct payments for farmers.  The date in that regard is August.  We have a great deal of work to do in the coming months.</p></speech>

All one needs to do is read the front page of today's farming section in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Glanbia has cut 2 cent per litre, sparking further price reductions.  We are in line for a great deal of price volatility.  If we are not careful, there could be a bubble similar to the one that existed in the building industry not so long ago.  Not enough is being made of that prospect.  If production is increased, there will more than likely be a reduction in price, yet the cost of production has not decreased.<br/>For obvious reasons, the Minister was vague concerning the options on the table in terms of the butterfat coefficient.  What could help to ensure an even softer landing?<br/>Returning to the issue of price volatility, it will have an impact for a number of years.  Will anything be put in place over the easing-in period following the quota's removal?<br/>Turning to Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the Minister stated that the Commission might not make a decision on the reform for a number of months.  Will that delay the commencement of GLAS beyond this year?</p></speech>

These were welcomed at the time, but prices have continued to go through the floor, as highlighted in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Compared with last year, the average price for a steer has fallen by &euro;300 and the average price for bull beef has fallen by more than &euro;400 per head.  Are Bord Bia and the Department doing enough to promote Irish beef in England and our other markets?  Talk is one matter, but we need to walk the walk as well.</p></speech>

However, it only holds 0.6% of the market into which it is supplying milk formula and so forth.  Even after its expansion, its share will decrease to 0.4%.  This is a strong argument that there should not be price volatility in the markets into which co-ops supply.  The co-ops will not affect the European market.  We need to show where our co-ops are selling.  We cannot allow a situation in which, even with an increase in production, our market share when we sell outside the EU decreases because of increases in demand.</p><p>  I feel strongly about milk schemes in schools.  We are not doing half enough in this regard.  Children are not encouraged to drink milk and there are issues with sugar.  What possibility is there of Irish products being promoted to children in schools?</p><p>  The Minister mentioned single farm payment penalties.  This issue keeps appearing.  An independent commission should hear appeals.  There is a growing concern among farmers that their only independent hearing will be before a court.  That is not good enough.  Has the Minister figures on the number of appeals in recent years that ended up in court and the cost and results of same?  Perhaps what I am hearing does not bear out, but the figures would be interesting.  We should have a proper discussion on the single farm payment's rules and their interpretation.</p><p>  In light of farm audits, are internal audits of the inspectorate's procedures necessary?  I have been approached with an increasing number of cases that I will bring to the Minister's attention.  The issue is causing a great deal of concern and fear.  The fines are draconian.</p><p>  Will Pillar 2 not kick off until 2015?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000006#G01000"><p>I remember when headage and so on were introduced in respect of sheep.  Coming from a drystock part of the country, all I saw in the midlands for six months was a mass invasion of sheep.  Everything turned white.  I use that situation as an example.  I am apprehensive about what will happen in the dairy industry.  There are Food Harvest 2020 targets and so on, but people might get into the industry who do not have the necessary expertise, technical abilities or appreciation of what lies ahead.  The level of capital investment required is mind-boggling.</p><p>  Deputy Deering referred to how dairy processors were reducing prices.  Once one does it, we can be sure that the other three or four large processors will reduce their prices by the end of the week.  The processors are defending this decrease on the basis of weaker international markets in the past six months.  Two year ago, there was a rush into bull beef and it is now having consequences.  People are picking up the pieces after significant losses.  I am all in favour of the Food Harvest 2020 targets, but the Minister must ensure that Teagasc and everyone else are up to speed so that people do not walk into a disaster blindfolded.  Deputy Ferris made this point.  It is easy to make a considerable investment.  Deputy Deering rightly referred to it as a bubble.</p><p>  The Minister must continue to fight on the dairy front.  If he can get the butterfat coefficient adjusted in the way he wants, it would lead to a 2% increase in the milk quota and represent a major victory.  We should all support the Minister 100% in his efforts in that regard.  He is making significant friendships and so on, which is how the system works.  He has brought Germany, one of the large players, on board, but it is a pity that some of the others have not come on board as well.</p> <p>In Europe, one needs two or three of the big players.  There can be many smaller examples but the bigger players are required to bring something over the line.  I wish the Minister well.<br/>I have been a great proponent of the appeals system, and anybody reading the D&aacute;il transcripts from 2001 or 2002 knows I spoke at length about it then.  As a barrister, I had a particular interest in it.  The Minister's Cork colleague, Mr. Joe Walsh, brought it through.  I have had the view that there should be only one appeals system, which not only just looks independent, but is independent in practice.  I have just come from a social welfare appeal this morning and that was independent; I represented a person and somebody else represented the Department.  The system in question should have a quasi-judicial person from outside the agricultural sphere.  As the record from 2002 shows - it is 12 years ago now - I was spokesperson for agriculture at the time and I still hold to that idea.  It is funny how life can turn back in some ways.  I remember attending an appeal process and setting a cat among the pigeons.  I was representing somebody in a difficult appeal and I sought some record of proceedings because I intended to bring the matter further in the event of loss.  An appeals process should take that into account, allowing a person the opportunity to bring it to the next stage in the event of dissatisfaction.<br/>I am concerned about the fine, as the estimate is &euro;170 million or &euro;180 million.  We are finding it difficult to get money to deal with issues at a human level so that is a significant sum to be absorbed from the national purse.  It would be very difficult for an individual farmer to bear the brunt of this, as we know the national purse or the farmer will be the only two sources for the funding.  I have a round figure and the Minister's number may be more exact, and that is why it is better for the Minister to come to the committee to inform us.  Has the Minister considered how this can be appealed in order to lower the figure?  This is critical to the Department's Estimates and everything could be thrown off kilter by these fines.  I know it could take a while for the issue to be finalised, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, could be the Taoiseach at that stage.  The matter must be fought vigorously as the <i>ex post facto</i>rationalisation of a position pertaining on the ground now is easy through micro-management but the Department and the farming community dealt with the issues in good faith at the time, based on the level of identification that could be worked out.  People are now being punished because of better imaging, etc., so there is a strong legal argument to be made in that respect.</p></speech>

Will we be ready for GLAS in 2015?  There is also concern about the 80% figure for commonages, which would present a problem for some.  A number of people on commonages may not get into the scheme.  Where we have exported beef, particularly along Border counties, there have been penalties and those customers will not return to buy cattle.  I know the Minister is probably dealing with the question of major penalties on animals which come from the South but are slaughtered in the North.  It is a problem.  There is a similar process here.  There is also the question of the number of animal movements and the penalties applying when moving from one herd to another.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000007#H00400"><p>There have been many questions and I would like to try to answer most of them.  I will give the official position on the &euro;180 million as I am very annoyed about it.  We had a clear understanding with the European Commission that this would not happen, and we intend to fight this vigorously.  I believe we will be successful.</p><p>  My Department received a letter on 14 May from the Commission audit services indicating that it proposed to exclude &euro;181 million from EU funding to Ireland in respect of the direct aid scheme years from 2008 to 2012, inclusive.  In effect, this amounts to a 2% flat rate penalty on the funding received for all direct aid in Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 for the five years in question.  It should be borne in mind that the amount of EU funds under review is in excess of &euro;9 billion.</p><p>  My officials attended a bilateral meeting with representatives of the Commission audit services on 25 July 2013 to discuss the finalisation of clearance audits covering five years of payments.  During this meeting the Commission audit services was advised that we would review all land parcels in Ireland used for single payments and other direct aids, identifying and excluding all ineligible features.  That is what was required as the mapping system allowed us to do so.  The process would allow audits to be finalised based on the calculated risk rather than a flat rate correction, which is what the Commission is proposing.  My Department reviewed the LIPIS database of 900,000 parcels and submitted the figures for ineligible features to the Commission on 5 February 2014.  In other words, the process was completed as agreed.  By that time, my Department had already commenced the collection of retrospective amounts from farmers to off-set any calculated bill.  I was in constant discussion with farming organisations on this process, indicating that if we did not do this properly, we would be fined a flat rate figure.  Many people questioned whether that was a serious threat but everybody knows now how serious it was.  That is why we worked as thoroughly as we did, and we had formal and informal discussions about that more than once.</p><p>  The Commission audit services carried out a conformity clearance audit in March this year to verify the extent of the control work completed on the LIPIS database.  Following the audit mission, the Commission auditors confirmed both verbally and by e-mail that the correction would be based on an assessment calculated on risk, as previously discussed and agreed.  The imposition of a 2% flat rate correction in the letter of 14 May by the Commission audit services was a complete surprise to me and is neither justified on the basis of the findings of the audit mission nor from the justifications that the Commission have relied upon or on which it has applied the flat rate correction.</p><p>  I cannot be any clearer than that.  This is part of a negotiated settlement and I have spoken directly with the Commissioner about this because of our total surprise arising from this.  It comes against all the evidence we have from previous conversations, and it has been made very clear to me that this is part of a process in which we are involved to dramatically reduce any flat rate penalty that may apply to Ireland.  We will vigorously defend our position because of the thoroughness we adopted.</p> <p>That has not been without pain for farmers in Ireland in terms of both disallowances as a result of mapping accuracy and retrospective payments.  We will certainly not sit back and allow a situation where we are penalised on the double.  The &euro;181 million is just the start of a long discussion.  I can assure the committee we will not be paying anything like that if we make our case effectively, which we will.</p><p> With regard to milk, it is important to point out that the amount of milk Ireland produces will not dramatically change the world price for dairy.  Consider what has happened in New Zealand since the mid-1980s when quotas were introduced in the European Union.  In 1984, New Zealand produced the same amount of milk as Ireland.  Both countries produced 5 billion litres of milk per year.  We are now at approximately 5.5 billion litres while New Zealand produces 19 billion litres per year.  New Zealand dominates the traded dairy markets globally.  In that period it has quadrupled output and the price of milk is higher now than it has ever been.</p><p> The only way one can measure where the price is going in this sector is through what we anticipate global dairy consumption will be and what we anticipate global dairy production will be over the next five to ten years.  At present, dairy consumption is increasing by approximately 2% per year and dairy production is increasing by between 1% and 1.5% per year.  That suggests that in the longer term we will see strong pricing for milk.  However, there will be ups and downs, depending on seasons, how much milk is in storage, Fonterra auctions in the United States, how much milk powder is put on the market and at what time and so forth.  People should not panic when they see the milk price dropping by 2 cent per litre, although one does not like to see that.  Farmers producing good quality milk are getting 48 cent or 49 cent per litre at present, but that will not be case forever.  It will be up and down, and we must plan for that financially.</p><p> With regard to the point made by Deputies Deering and Ferris in terms of putting a business plan together and the investment, one of the downsides of the expansion in New Zealand is that many of its dairy farmers are essentially working for the bank, not for themselves.  They will be working for the bank until they retire.  We do not want a generation of Irish dairy farmers to be in that position five or ten years hence.  That is the reason Teagasc is currently holding financial management seminars across the country specifically on dairy expansion and the business plan required for that.  Teagasc is telling farmers to put their business plan together on the basis of 28 cent to 30 cent per litre for milk.  It is being that conservative.  I am not saying prices will go to that level but that we must be very cautious and conservative in the business plans we put together.</p><p> In my view, milk prices will be well above that figure.  I believe that over the medium to long term there will be incremental increases in dairy prices, but there will be weak and strong periods and we must plan for that.  We must look at different pricing models, for example.  Dairy farmers should consider locking in 40%, 50% or 60% of their milk for two or three year pricing contracts, which are available now through the big co-operatives, so they can prepare for the volatility that may come.  In case anybody thinks we are not planning for this, we are.  I have met all the key banks in Ireland - there are effectively only three - and there is a very clear understanding of the banking responsibility here.  Dairy farmers need capital to invest in expansion and growth, some of which will be grant-aid assisted through the new targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, programme, but the banking system must be cautious as well and insist on proper business plans and efficiently run dairy farms.</p><p> On the cost of inputs for dairy farming, we can improve and we are improving.  Yesterday, I launched the Carbery greener farm initiative.  Over a one year period 20 farmers, by measuring inputs such as fertiliser, water, energy and feed costs, have saved an average of &euro;5,000 per farm.  The highest earner is over &euro;10,000 while the lowest was approximately &euro;3,000.  There are significant things we can do in terms of efficiencies in running farms and managing more efficiently, both from an emissions point of view and also from an efficiency point of view in respect of inputs and outputs.</p><p> For almost five years we have been preparing farmers, processors and markets for a rapidly expanding milk production driven industry over the next five years.  The previous Government started it and we have continued it.  Yes, there will be some mistakes but I believe Ireland is as ready as it is going to be for the dairy expansion.  It will provide a very exciting future for many dairy farmers.</p><p> I have a final comment on dairy.  Some people have been inaccurately quoting how big our dairy herd will have to grow to deliver on the potential of Food Harvest 2020.  There are approximately 1.2 million milking cows in Ireland.  We anticipate that the figure will grow by approximately 300,000 between now and 2020, an increase of 20% to 25%.  That means we will need 3,000 extra people physically milking cows.  The rule of thumb is one person is required per 100 cows.  That is the reason we are developing new courses for people who wish to go into the dairy industry, who do not have any land or herds but who wish to work with expanding farmers and their families in terms of increasing herd size and so forth.  This is doable, but it must be planned and managed.  However, regardless of whether we do that, there will be price volatility and what Ireland contributes to a global milk pool will not determine milk prices one way or the other.  New Zealand over the last 30 years is a good example of that.</p><p> To refer to the other questions - I do not wish to be accused of ducking any - I agree in principle with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said about island farming, but I mentioned it because I was seeking feedback on it.</p></speech>

That is part of the problem.  The Greek Presidency is trying to get agreement in principle here.  Trying to define islands is one of the big problems we have had.  I suspect that nothing significant will be decided next week, but let us wait and see.  I will keep an open mind on it.</p><p>  On the issue of commonages and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, I wish to clarify the timing of GLAS.  There have been some accusations in press releases and so forth suggesting that we are contributing to red tape and it is causing a problem.  It is not.  GLAS is the biggest new scheme in the rural development programme.  The big demand from all farming organisations and all public representatives I have spoken to is to allow as many farmers as possible into the scheme from the outset.  We have tried to build the scheme to allow 25,000 to 30,000 farmers into it at the start.  That has some consequences.  However, before we can let anybody into the scheme, we must get it approved by the Commission.  The deadline for countries to submit their rural development programmes is the end of July, so the Commission will not even start looking at the draft submissions until then.  It will largely not be working through August as that is a holiday period.  It will be September before it starts working through the proposals in earnest and I suspect that, if we are lucky, we will get approval at some time in late October or November.  That is my guesstimate.  That would allow us, hopefully, to open a GLAS scheme in December for applicants.</p><p>  We are talking about 30,000 farmers but there are not many farm advisers in the country.  There are between 400 and 600.  One must then calculate how many plans must be put together by each of those advisers and the organisation of that across the country, because there will be farmers in every parish who will want to get into GLAS.  That process will take a number of months.  Then we must ensure everybody is eligible after they have applied.  After that we must go through the checks because this is the same as any funded scheme from the European Commission.</p> <p>We cannot pay out money until we are sure people qualify.  That is going to take some time and that is why I have said that we will work towards getting as many payments out as we can next year, within reason and budget.  Those payments will continue from December of next year, or towards the end of next year, into January the following year.  We will try to get as many payments done as we can and as early as we can.  I can assure the members that it will not be because of a lack of effort on our behalf.  It would have been much easier to start with 5,000 or 7,000 farmers, get them up and running, and then have phase 2 for another 10,000 and phase 3 for another 10,000.  We are trying to get as many farmers as we can in from the outset.  We will work hard to facilitate that because that is what farmers have asked us to day.  We will not delay, I can assure the committee, once we get Commission approval.</p><p> In terms of commonage, I have been asked some good questions on it and shall address them.  First, people have quoted the 80% rule to me.  I also read, in one of the farming publications last week, another statement that farmers who are on commonage land, unless 80% of the commonage group that are involved in farming that commonage land sign up then no one will get a payment.  That is simply not true.  We have tiers 1, 2 and 3.  In other words, if we have to choose between who is first in then farmers that can get 80% agreement on a commonage will automatically be first.  Farmers who can get 50% agreement on a commonage will also be in but not on the first tier but because we are allowing 30,000 farmers in we will be well into the third tier of farmers.</p><p> The second matter refers to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question.  Nobody on commonage will get payments unless he or she qualifies as an active farmer and that definition has been clearly defined in Pillar 1 payments.  If somebody is a carpenter in New York but historically has had a share in a commonage and is getting payments but that is not going to happen in the future.</p></speech>

AEOS was introduced and one could only get 75% of the payment after the first year following checks at the end of the year and so on.  The exact terminology was used in the parliamentary reply to me.  It seemed to indicate to me that one would not get a GLAS payment until one had completed year 1 and they had done the checks and then one would receive the remaining 25% as with the AEOS scheme.</p><p>  The Minister's news is great if it is true.  Is he saying that under GLAS, farmers will get 75% once they have checked they are eligible and at the commence of the scheme rather than after the first year?</p></speech>

Also, they cannot get any payments until it is shown they are eligible, they pass the necessary tests and we do the necessary inspections.  They will then get a 75% payment and that will be followed by the 25% top-up payment after all controls have been completed.  The guidelines were laid down by the Commission.</p></speech>

There will probably be a four or five month period in order to get everybody in or between 25,000 and 30,000 people.  We will then have to go through a series of checks before we can pay out the 75% of payments.  I hope that will be done towards the end of next year or at the very start of 2016.  I think it will span that period.  Then there will be the final payments when all checks have been completed.  That is my understanding of how the scheme works.</p></speech>

With AEOS one had to wait until after the first year was over and the final checks were done.  It was only then one received 75% which was followed by a  25% payment.  The Minister seems to be giving us good news, and great clarification for everybody, regarding the new GLAS scheme.  Once one joins the scheme - say mid-year 2015 - that before one ever does anything on the farm the farmer will be paid 75% of a pre-payment.  If that is fact then it is very welcome and I congratulate the Minister on negotiating such a scheme.</p></speech>

At the commencement of year 2 where one has qualified and received 100% the previous year, when one commences year 2 does one get 75% at the commencement of year 2 subject to having done everything one was meant to do to get the 25% final payment for year 1, 25% at the end of year 2 and the same for years 3 and 4?  That information will clarify the point that has been made here.  Once the scheme is up and rolling, and I am in the scheme, I will get 75% of my year 2 payment at the beginning of the year and 25% when I am assessed at the end of the year.  Is that the way the scheme will work?</p></speech>

People do not necessarily get payments at the start of the year.  We will endeavour to get payments out before the end of year.  Sometimes, as has happened in recent years, payments spill over from one year to the other and, therefore, span two different budgetary years.</p></speech>

In other words, if &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is allowed into GLAS, and approved on 1 August 2015, will he get 75% in August 2015 or does he have to wait until he has completed one year in the scheme, as he must do so for AEOS at present, in order to get the first 75% payment?

Farmers who are not happy with the departmental appeals system, which is a separate appeals office from everything else in the Department and operates independently, can go to an outside committee chaired by Mr. Padraig Gibbons.  He used to be the head of Connacht Gold and was a very popular choice.  One third of the LPIS appeals going to the departmental appeals system are successful.  We have an active appeals system that is functioning, working for farmers and listening to what people are saying.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about the broader appeal system for all disallowances and penalties from regulations to cross-compliance.  It is a separate issue but I want to provide reassurance on LPIS.  The independent appeals system outside the Department is functioning and working for farmers.  That is not to say that everyone will like the outcome of cases but it is independent.</p><p>  It would be unrealistic to suggest that because we set up a beef forum, which is working well, it will start setting prices for beef.  We must get real.  The market determines beef prices, as does the share of margin that each link in the chain gets, including farmers, processors and retailers.  My job is to ensure farmers are protected in that chain because the others are big enough to look after themselves.  The beef forum is the first time the Government has put in place a structure that allows each of the players and all of the State bodies involved, including Bord Bia, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, Teagasc and the Department, to be involved in discussions.  We have blunt and direct discussions and a series of decisions taken will be beneficial to the beef sector.  This includes increased promotional activity, the consideration of the direct contacts between farmers and those they are supplying, and an improved communication structure so that farmers understand the spec issues and quality issues asked of them.  There is confusion and annoyance in the farming community that the spec has been changed, particularly in the lead-in to winter last year.  We also have to respond to retailers' demands, many of which are uncompromising, in respect of meat being imported to the UK.  Beef prices in the UK have dramatically reduced in recent weeks and it is not a major surprise that we have seen some weakening of prices.  We will continue to work on this and both beef forum meetings have been useful.  Most of the players involved share that view.</p></speech>

The response was that it was possible someone could have handed over information in a factory but I do not have evidence that it happened.  If it is there, I am open to seeing it.  We are putting a beef pricewatch application on the Department's website so that everyone can access detailed information on what is being paid for what grade of animal in every factory line in the country every week.  Accusations about a cartel can be examined in terms of facts and figures.  The forum is needed to get past rumours, accusations and megaphone diplomacy.  Farming leaders are rightly standing up for their members and processors are standing up for their sector but there is no real conversation in terms of trying to solve issues of mutual concern.  Factories need a steady supply of good quality cattle in spec, farmers need to get a fair share of the margin available and we need to make sure this happening.  If there are issues in respect of access to information that factories should not be getting, we raise the issues, resolve them and put systems in place to ensure they cannot happen.  It is a case of improving the overall performance of the sector, which is what the forum is all about.  We have shown seriousness because the Minister chairs the forum and in future he or she will be directly involved in the discussions and debates, which can be heated.  That is the way it should be.  We should have the discussions there rather than outside that room.</p></speech>

A profile of the herd from the Department is now available to livestock farmers in respect of age, gender and breed.  We must make sure this is not used as a tool to manipulate the market, which is the concern of Deputy Martin Ferris.  We have given the matter a fair hearing and I thank the officials who accompanied the Minister.  We will now have a rotation of officials.</p><p>  I welcome Deputy Harrington, who is the only member present of the Joint Sub-committee on Fisheries who is not a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Some of the Senators have been called to a vote in the Seanad.  Having published this report, the committee continues to seek time on the floor of the House to discuss the matter but we welcome the fact that the Minister is here for direct engagement with the sub-committee on this work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000010#L01100"><p>I would like to have attended the committee before now.  I want to give a statement on what we are doing in the inshore sector and provide a direct response to what we are doing on each of the sub-committee's recommendations.  We took positive action on a majority of the recommendations.  Some require consideration and I will provide background information on that.  In the case of some recommendations, I do not have the power to do anything because it concerns a different Department or a decision has already been taken.  I thank the members of the Joint Sub-committee on Fisheries for the opportunity to discuss the recommendations made in its recent document, "Report on Promoting Sustainable Rural Coastal and Island Communities", published in January.</p> <p>The sub-committee produced an excellent report, which I have carefully examined.  Many of the recommendations will be central to my own work in moving forward and dealing with the challenging issues facing rural coastal and island communities.  I have given consideration to the recommendations in the report.  The recent strategy which I launched for the inshore sector was significantly informed by the report and by discussions we have had on the sector.  The report makes a total of 29 recommendations, many of which have been taken on board and are part of the work programme I have put in place.  Others merit further consideration and some fall within the remit of other Departments and may warrant discussion with other Ministers.</p><p> In terms of ongoing, pre-existing work in my Department, I draw attention to a number of investment programmes.  As part of the annual fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure programme, I allocated &euro;3 million this year for local authority harbour development and marine leisure programmes.  This funding facilitates investment to improve facilities in rural, coastal communities.  A total of 13 coastal local authorities have been requested to provide additional details on specific projects submitted by them for consideration for funding.  In 2013, 70 projects around the coast benefited from this programme.  Earlier this year, as part of the Government&rsquo;s co-ordinated response to the unprecedented damage caused by the winter storms, I announced &euro;8.5 million in funding for a once-off programme to repair 115 publicly-owned piers, harbours and slipways damaged by these storms.</p><p> I have noted the committee&rsquo;s recommendations on industry representation for the inshore, coastal fishing fleet.  I also have been concerned for some time at the lack of formal representation for this part of the fishing industry to participate in fisheries management decision making.  Inshore fishermen are more reliant on non-quota species such as lobster, crab and a range of bivalve shellfish, so the conversations on quota management with offshore fishing representatives do not address inshore challenges.  For that reason, I announced last month the establishment of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, for the inshore fishing sector, built on a foundation of regional forums.  The national forum will be representative of the under-12 m fishing fleet, that is, fishing boats of less than 12 m overall length.  The focus will be on fisheries management within six nautical miles and facilitate two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies and initiatives.  The national forum will be founded on a regional network of forums based on the FLAG, Fisheries Local Action Group, regions.  This regional approach recognises that there are separate inshore needs in different regions around the coast due to variations in fishing seasons, stocks, and so forth and that one-size-fits-all models may not work well for inshore challenges.  Each FLAG area has been asked to support the setting up of a regional inshore forum, RIF, to be representative of the local inshore fishing industry of its region.  Financial assistance will be provided for out-of-pocket expenses to representatives on the forums.  Each RIF will nominate two delegates to represent the region at the NIFF.  RIFs can develop fisheries management initiatives relevant to their region and put them forward at the NIFF for wider industry consideration.  Full terms of reference and guidelines for the forums are currently in preparation.  I look forward to receiving proposals from the NIFF concerning inshore fisheries policies.   </p><p> At the time I announced the forum structures, I also announced funding schemes relevant to inshore fishermen in coastal communities and the islands.  These schemes are dedicated to supporting the inshore fisheries sector which, taken together, represent a package of &euro;1 million and is in addition to the &euro;600,000 in co-funding by the Government and the European Fisheries Fund available to the coastal and island communities through the FLAGs.  The shellfish pot replacement scheme, administered by BIM, is providing 40% of the cost of replacing lost pots through fixed payments of &euro;24 per lobster or crab pot and &euro;12 per shrimp pot.  Due to the limited uptake of the original scheme, I have extended it, more than doubling the pot limits from 50 to 200 for boats less than 12m length and from 100 to 250 for boats from 12m to 15m in length.  Existing applicants to the current scheme will automatically be increased to the supplementary pot limits and a call for new applications is being advertised.</p><p> The new sustainable inshore fisheries scheme will provide funding for environmentally-friendly fishing gear and equipment and support for improvements in the areas of quality, hygiene and standards on board, which is a really important issue for the inshore fleet.  Many inshore fishermen operate on boats that need an equipment upgrade and we want to be able to support them in that regard.  In addition, the scheme will increase the grant aid for voluntary v-notching lobsters from the existing maximum of 55% to a new maximum of 75% to entice more fishermen to participate in this worthwhile conservation activity.  We have also introduced a limit on the maximum size of lobster that can be caught because the bigger the lobster, the more it breeds.  However, we will compensate fishermen to the tune of 75% for throwing back big lobsters, which amounts, more or less, to the full cost.  This will encourage the breeding programmes which are necessary to start building up lobster stocks which are under undue pressure at the moment.  We are also looking at pilot hatchery projects and expect the RIFs to bring forward proposals on same.  We are willing to put money into such projects to make sure they work.  I had a really interesting conversation with staff at the aquarium facility in Dingle a year ago about the potential of hatcheries, particularly for lobsters, and I want a proactive approach from the RIFs to develop such projects sooner rather than later.  </p><p> Regarding aquaculture, I have noted carefully the recommendations made by the sub-committee.  All applications for aquaculture licences are considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act.  Decisions in individual cases are made only following the most rigorous assessment of the technical, scientific, environmental and public policy aspects of each application.  I have noted the recommendation on the allocation of resources for the processing of aquaculture licenses and renewals.  My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of Natura 2000 areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU birds and habitats directives.  The appropriate assessment process represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of all aquaculture applications having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation.  </p><p> Regarding sea lice and the call by the sub-committee for the publication of the results of the Marine Institute&rsquo;s inspections, the existing position is that Ireland&rsquo;s sea lice control protocols are operated by the Marine Institute and involve regular inspections of marine fin fish sites by Marine Institute inspectors.  These protocols are more advanced that those operated in other jurisdictions.  The inspection regime is totally independent of the industry.  Data obtained as a result of inspections is published and made widely available.  Treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.  Results of inspections are provided to the farm operators within five working days.  Results are also reported to the Department and to other interested parties such as Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Overall results and trends are published annually.  The sub-committee's call for publication, therefore, is already catered for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.91" nospeaker="true" time="15:40:00" ><p>I have noted the recommendations on the development of the seaweed industry.  This industry has significant potential both in terms of farmed seaweed as well as gathered wild seaweed, as long as it is harvested properly.  My Department is responsible for the issue of aquaculture licences in respect of the cultivation of seaweed.  However, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for the issue of licences in relation to seaweed harvesting.  Both Departments maintain ongoing communication on foreshore matters.  It is important that both the farmed and wild industries have maximum synergy and accordingly I am asking my Department to engage with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to ensure effective co-ordination in licensing both sides of the industry.</p><p>On fisheries and aquaculture development, I must have regard to the Common Fisheries Policy, taking account of environmental sustainability as well as economic, social and employment benefits, and a wide range of environmental and food safety legislation.</p><p>In addition, stakeholders need to be afforded opportunity to express how proposals may affect their interests.  There are a number of existing structures for engaging stakeholders, soon to be joined by the newly-announced inshore forums, which are an appropriate location for dialogue on issues addressed in the report.</p><p>I look forward to discussing the committee's recommendations in further detail.</p><p>In respect of recommendation No. 9, safety at sea, we have a national inshore fisheries forum which is progressing in tandem with BIM's new approaches to safety at sea.  I will also comment on recommendation No. 11 which refers to minor fishing offences.  We are currently preparing legislation on fixed penalty notices, which means that in place of prosecutions there will be administrative fines.  On the question of inshore industry representation, recommendation No. 20, I have answered that in the course of my address.  In terms of the lobster and shrimp fisheries, the package we have announced goes a long way to addressing the concerns in recommendation No. 21.  The same applies to fin fish standards.  Recommendation No. 16 concerns licensing resources and recommendation No. 17 refers to sea lice controls.  Recommendations No. 13 flags funding and No. 27 refers to data collection of inshore fisheries.  Recommendation No. 4 deals with training and BIM provided 19 certified courses in 2013.  The number of courses is growing all the time.</p><p>In regard to recommendation No. 2, marine governance, I chair the marine co-ordination group which brings together all maritime interests.  Next week we will have our first national maritime conference, assessing progress on the targets around ocean wealth, which is a major integrated maritime policy document launched by Government last year.</p><p>In terms of local authority infrastructure and community policy, we have responded to many of the recommendations in the report.  In terms of issues that are under consideration, the recommendation on landing statistics, BIM and Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, have responsibility for compiling data, and improvements in that area are currently being examined by both agencies.</p><p>I have partly answered the recommendation on seaweed licensing and it is under consideration at present.</p><p>On the question of the standard evaluation of grant aid systems, we are governed by EU rules but there is a new European Marine and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, which I hope will be announced this week and this will deal with the supports for the seafood and fishing sectors for the next six years.  We have negotiated very hard to try to get the best outcome we can for Ireland from the new fisheries fund.  I expect that the result will be very good for Irish fishing in terms of increased funding to support the seafood and fishing sectors in the range of changes they must make to be consistent with the Common Fisheries Policy.</p><p>However there are some things that we cannot do, for example the recommendations in the report on salmon stocks, salmon fishing and salmon heritage licensing.  I was in Donegal recently and when one goes to places such as Greencastle one will get many requests to allow traditional fishing methods to be used again.  One will also get similar requests from the fishing communities in west Cork, and when I was in Castletownbere recently people raised this issue with me.  One will also get similar requests from those in Dunmore East and Kilmore Quay, on the entrance into Waterford Harbour and people who want to get back into the salmon industry.  Let us be clear, I do not make decisions on salmon fisheries.  That is the role of the Department of Communications. Energy and Natural Resources.  Whether that is right or wrong is a debate for another day with another Minister.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is also responsible for inland fisheries.</p><p>In regard to the recommendation on social protection, and a call for an examination of PRSI, I  will send that recommendation to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  Who knows where she will be in a few weeks time, but I will certainly pass it on to her in the meantime.</p></speech>

Let there be no doubt but that we have take the report of the sub-committee very seriously.  I have taken its recommendations seriously and I hope that is reflected in what we have announced since its publication.</p><p>  For far too long the inshore sector has essentially been operating in a way that is unregulated and does not have proper representation in terms of impacting on policy and as a result has not got the political attention or priority that the sector deserves.  A significant number of people are employed in the fishing industry.  I hope that with the formalised structures in place it will allow us have many more discussions on policy, funding and support so that we can protect the stocks that everybody relies on as well as being able to make sensible policy decisions to allow the sector to be more profitable.</p></speech>

We accept that some of the recommendations are not within the gift of the Department, in particular, the recommendation on PRSI, because the Department of Social Protection was not represented on the committee.  We have already made representations separately to the Minister for Social Protection on that specific point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.95" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000012#N00500"><p>The Minister mentioned the reopening of the compensation scheme for people who lost pots during the storms in January.  Does the Minister have an indication as to whether the take up on the revised scheme is any larger?  Is he willing to reconsider the requirement to have a receipt for the original lobster pot, which was not required for the shrimp pot and in my view was the major inhibitor for people taking up the scheme?  My understanding is that the number of applications for the scheme is very small.</p><p>  I welcome what the Minister has done and I recognise his commitment to do something for the inshore fishermen.  I particularly welcome the idea of setting up the forums, because one of the major obstacles was the lack of a representative body, that we, the public representatives could meet.  </p><p>  The Minister did not refer to all of the recommendation.  There is a recommendation on the mackerel quota that there would be a more equitable distribution of the mackerel in the event of extra quota becoming available.</p><p>  The second issue is a long burner but we must start on this long and tedious route, that is recommendation No. 14.  It recommends that we would look for a national 12-mile limit and that the small boats would not be confined to remaining within the six-mile limit.</p> <p>It also recommends that the fishing limit for smaller boats be extended from six miles to 12 miles.  The proposed arrangement to protect the inshore fisheries industry would apply across the European Union and thus requires the agreement of all member states.  It provides that all EU vessels under a certain size could fish within the 12-mile limit, subject to the normal rules, while larger boats would be prohibited from doing so. <br/>Recommendation 18 relates to producer groups and assisting people to sell collectively.  Recommendation 21 relates to the regulations to be introduced for lobsters.  It had been proposed to change the size of lobster that could be caught. <br/>Recommendation 26 proposes the establishment of a new body, perhaps with the title &quot;Comhairle na Mara&quot;, which would have responsibility not only for fishing but related areas such as the marine, leisure activities and so on.  As in the case of Comhairle na Tuaithe, the new entity would invite all the players to the table.  As such, it would be slightly different from the forum to which the Minister referred as I understand it would be a fisherman's forum.  The new body would consider how, in line with the Department's document Harnessing our Ocean Wealth, the sea could be exploited for communities in a sustainable manner.  As with Comhairle na Tuaithe, Comhairle na Mara would bring together statutory, voluntary and industry groups to try to advance this objective. <br/>I have had discussions on seaweed with officials in the Department.  As the Minister is probably aware, there is a major tussle taking place in counties Mayo and Galway about whether the rights to collect seaweed should remain where they have always resided, albeit on a <i>de facto </i>basis as I accept that many people did not bother acquiring harvesting licences.  All those in the area who own the land believe they also own the seaweed and nobody has disabused them of that belief.  Some of them clearly own the seaweed because this is explicitly stated on their folios.<br/>I have copies of folios submitted to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which state clearly that the owners have appurtenant rights to the seaweed.  The Department has indicated it will revert to me with the legal advice it receives on the issue of appurtenant rights.  Most people, particularly those with the types of folios I described, believed they owned the seaweed and were rather shocked to learn that, in the dead of night, as it were, a State agency, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, applied for a licence to harvest 40,000 tonnes of seaweed.  If this application is granted, it would effectively cede ownership of the seaweed and allow &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to sell it to whomever is willing to buy it at the right price.  Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who is, I understand, responsible for this issue?  This case has the potential to cause serious harm to the industry by removing harvesting rights from small local operators and placing them in the hands of a large multinational company that bought Iasc Mara Teoranta.  This company could seek to outsource harvesting rights to outsiders who could replace the excellent traditional industry that has been carried out in a sustainable manner for the past 50 years.  The local harvesters have not caused any environmental damage because they are very careful in harvesting.  </p></speech>

This is a positive aspect of the debate between the joint committee and the Minister and his officials.</p><p>  The Minister stated he will increase the pot limit from 50 to 200 for boats of less than 12 m. in length and from 100 to 250 for boats of more than 12 m. in length.

We tried to take into account that some smaller boats lost more pots than large boats, a point Deputy Ferris and a number of others made in the D&aacute;il.  As a result, we quadrupled the limit for smaller vessels from 50 to 200 and increased the figure for larger boats slightly more than twofold, from 100 to 250.  All those who applied to the scheme, which was a relatively small number, can qualify for compensation for more pots provided they have the data required.</p></speech>

We do not want to significantly increase the number of pots in use through a scheme of grant aid.  Overfishing of lobster is already taking place in some areas.  We want people who can show they have lost pots before being able to replace the pots they have lost.  The problem is that it is very difficult to have a grant scheme that does not require proof of loss.  It will not be sufficient for someone who does not have records to ask us to believe he or she had 300 pots.  While we obviously want to try to help everybody, we have to be able to show - the scheme will be audited - that we are only paying out for pots we know were lost.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked the reason this requirement applies to lobster pots but does not apply to shrimp pots.  It was intended that it would apply to everything.</p></speech>

The boats are registered, which means I cannot claim to have lost pots because I do not have a registered boat or potting licence.

I welcome the announcement of the establishment of the inshore fisheries forum for onshore fisheries.  What is the timeline for it to get up and running and how does the Minister envisage it will work?  If the regional forum presents policy to the national forum and the national forum adopts it, will the Department, as happens in the case of the POs, accept the policy from it and implement it or will a certain degree of management be handed over to the regional forums?</p><p>  On recommendation No. 7 on the mackerel quota, which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has raised, I would like to hear the Minister's response to that.  I would like to hear his response to recommendation No. 10 in regard to the heritage licences.  The traditional fishermen were strong in calling for some action to be taken on that.</p><p>  On the replacement grant for potting, one of the issues raised with the committee was that fishermen cannot afford to spend their money before they get the grant aid and before they access finance to replace pots.</p><p>  On the V-notching programme, why is it still being maintained on a voluntary basis?  Is there a rationale for that?  Should it be a compulsory programme?</p><p>  Does the Minister's Department have a view on the potential for the control of seaweed harvesting in terms of one operator getting control of a foreshore licence in regard to the harvesting or what is his view on such consolidation of seaweed harvesting?</p></speech>

I particularly welcome the establishment of the inland fisheries forum.  Even though groups from throughout the country appeared before the committee and they had individual issues on a regional basis, three quarters of the issues they raised were the same issues.  The only difference is that they were expressed with different accents.  They discussed many of the same types of issues but they were very fragmented.  I hope the establishment of the forum will address in some part the representation which covers 80% of the vessels in the fleet.  A huge handicap for that segment of the industry and for decision makers is that there has been one voice representing it or one policy in respect of it.</p><p>  The Minister might elaborate on the recommendation on the heritage licences.  Those in the inshore fleet who have licences for non-quota species do not have a protection against other fishermen who might come from different segments.  They are exposed in areas that are under significant pressure.  Is there any way to protect them, whether through a track record or a heritage licence as mentioned in the report?  There are vulnerable individuals in that sector.</p><p>  I welcome the V-notching programme.  The report on the V-notching of lobster has been very much welcomed by the industry.  I have not met anybody who has criticised the 75% funding for V-notching.  It will be very progressive and I hope it will be taken up enthusiastically by the industry.  On the hatcheries, and the Minister mentioned lobster, are there any proposals that he might consider for seeding for scallops in some of the bays?  That is something that might be worth considering.</p><p>  Another issue, touched on in the report in terms of training which the Minister might examine, is BIM's budget for staffing in the fisheries training centres.  While there is a growing interest in training and growing numbers in the training centres, that needs to be matched with greater resources for instructors and mariners to assist in getting higher level tickets to the industry in terms of navigation or safety in particular.  I understand that the greatest potential for loss of life is among those in the inshore fleet.  A greater investment in the regional fisheries training centres through BIM would be welcome.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned that this part of the industry was unregulated.  I believe it is very much regulated but that it is under-represented.  Even though most of it is in a non-quota segment, it did not have the same representation or the same voice as the POs.  The Minister might have an opinion on the structure of the POs.  When we have freedom of association it is difficult to change the structure of the POs.  We have a pelagic PO or a demersal PO but there is certainly an inshore PO.  Would the Minister see the IFF ultimately developing into a structure more akin to a PO structure?</p></speech>

I commend him on his initiative on the inshore fishing strategy which he has adopted in response to some of the recommendations that were highlighted in the document prepared by the subcommittee, and that must be welcomed.  Some of the issues related to it have been raised by members.  The forum is an excellent idea and hopefully it will lead to a more joined-up, grassroots-upward viewpoint being filtered into the Department, which is something that needs to happen, and the Minister acknowledged that in his address.</p><p>  I have a few questions on the lobster and crab issue.  I welcome that the grant aid has been extended.  That issue was raised by the committee.  New applications are to be advertised.  Have they been advertised yet?  Has the grant scheme being advertised yet?  The grant scheme is currently capped at 40% of expenditure and that is proving to be problematic for many of the small potting fishermen.  Can the Department consider increasing that grant aid?  There may be EU state aid guidelines that preclude that, but is it something that can be considered or, as an alternative, can some arrangement be put in place with credit unions or processors to help fishermen who are under pressure and finding it difficult to cope?</p><p>  I agree with the Minister that the lobster species are under threat.  They are in danger of being overfished and that is because many of the traditional fishing opportunities available to fishermen locally, whether it be salmon fishing or other fishing opportunities - I am not laying the blame at the Minister's door for that as that was done by the previous Government - have been removed.  One of the issues we raised during our deliberations and which is contained within the report is the need to consider a heritage licence which would be very restricted and would be available for fishermen who may wish to fish traditional fishing opportunities that are available.  Obviously, salmon fishing is one but other fishing opportunities are also available.  That is something that should be explored.  What is the Minister's view on that?  I accept that it crosses over into another Department.</p><p>  The salmon fishing opportunities available currently are only available to the angling fraternity and some rivers are closed in that respect, but the biggest danger, as any angler would advise, to salmon migrating up river are the seals in each of the estuaries.  I was at an estuary in north Donegal last weekend where 12 seals were spotted and the local anglers would tell one that the salmon do not have a chance of getting up river.  The seals are very acclimatised to being able to pick up the salmon.</p> <p>I realise salmon are protected under the European habitats directive but I believe the matter needs to be examined.  Why should a fishing opportunity be destroyed with seals in bays?  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, need to examine the possibility of operating a seal cull.  I am unsure whether that is something the Minister is interested in examining, but it has been done in other jurisdictions and it should be examined here in conjunction with the opportunities that a heritage licence would bring.</p><p> I understand the grant aid issue is being considered under the new Common Fisheries Policy.  What is the Minister's view?  Will grant aid for fishing vessels only be available for vessels that are over three years old?  Will it be restricted to upgrading those vessels or will grant aid be made available for purchasing newer or more up-to-date vessels?</p></speech>

There was a recommendation that local authorities carry out an audit of access to the various piers under their control.  We have previously discussed the fact that the Department makes available funding for bricks and mortar work to be carried out on piers and for construction work but it does not fund consultations, preplanning work and so on.</p></speech>

I suppose this is a matter for local authorities but can anything be done to fund the preplanning work?  I imagine Country Clare is not unique in this regard and there are several projects that could do with works but the local communities cannot get them to the stage where they can apply to the Department for funding.  This is partly because it is not a priority for local authorities.  I appreciate that local authorities are under funding pressure, as is every other level of government.  Carrying out the works that would enable local authorities to apply to the Department is not a sufficiently high priority for them.</p><p>  Another point relates to the regulatory processes and delays and duplication in licensing.  Has any progress been made in this regard?</p></speech>

It relates to fluoride.  The Minister will head off to his European Union meeting next week.  I had to leave earlier when we were discussing the milk quota and we have been discussing fisheries up to now.  What is the Department's position on fluoride?  Is the Department doing any studies or looking into the science on the effects of fluoride on aquaculture and agriculture?  I am such an admirer of the Minister's Origin Green project and the Food Harvest 2020 policy.  We are the only country remaining in Europe that insists on putting fluoride into our water.  It was a 1960s initiative that was all about cavities.  Now we all have toothbrushes and we know bad teeth come from gum disease and not cavities.  The matter has been discussed in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il many times.  I would hate if the policy had a long-term effect on any of our larger visions or plans around this wonderful island and what we produce.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014061000015#Q01000"><p>I will address Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's questions first.  He asked about the advertising for new applicants for the scheme.  That is either happening today or it is about to happen and, therefore, it is rather difficult to give an assessment of the take-up.</p><p>  Reference was made to mackerel allocation.  There has been a significant increase in the mackerel quota this year, largely linked to a political negotiation with Iceland and the Faroe Islands with a view to getting the political deal across the line.  This is the basis of it as opposed to relying on any scientific data, although some scientific data from ISIS has facilitated the process.  To secure agreement, everyone will get more mackerel in the short term.  In my view that is only for the short term and within a short number of years we will be back to where we were last year in terms of mackerel quota in Ireland.  As a result of the increasing quota, everyone gets a greater percentage.  The split is 87:13 between the pelagic fleet and the polyvalent fleet.  Everyone benefits from an increase in the overall amount because everyone gets a percentage.</p><p>  I believe we would have gone through a very difficult process of negotiation - one must do so when one wishes to change allocation criteria and percentages - and had we done so I believe it would have been legally challenged.  In any event we will be back to where we started in terms of the overall quota available for the fleet.  I have decided not to do that for the moment.  We have enough to deal with in terms of the implementation of the CFP, the decisions on how we spend the new fisheries fund - we will get news on it this week - and the negotiation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the associated co-funding element, without having on top of that a renegotiation of the percentage split of mackerel, which would turn into a long, difficult and drawn-out process.  I have decided not to do that this year.</p><p>  The possibility of an extension of the six mile limit to 12 miles was raised.  If I could do that, I would.  We tried to secure that as part of the CFP.  We looked for support for such an initiative but did not get any.  If we could increase the exclusive zone from six miles to 12 such that only our boats were allowed in, I would do so in a shot.  We are always looking for such opportunities at a European level.  However, as the Deputy is aware, we need support from many other countries to secure something like that and it was simply not available.</p><p>  Lobster size regulations are based on recommendations from the industry and the science of the Marine Institute.  It is simply a fact that a very large male lobster and larger female lobsters produce more offspring than smaller lobsters.  Often large lobsters are not valued according to their size and weight.  Ideally, we want older larger lobsters producing many offspring in areas that are protected, where possible.  Certainly, we want female lobsters being put back and V-notched and we compensate people for that.  We also want large male lobsters being put back as well.  I am referring to large lobsters over 127 mm.</p><p>  There is an issue for parts of the west where lobsters are considerably bigger, particularly around the Aran Islands.  Concerns have been expressed to me specifically on this issue.  This is the type of issue I am happy to discuss and negotiate with regional forums.  If we have larger average lobster sizes in one part of the country versus another, we can consider applying different maximum sizes to different areas, depending on what suits the stock in those areas.  However, we must get the feedback and data before we can do it.  At the moment, the perceived scientific wisdom is that the cut-off point should be 127 mm and that is what we are going for.  Of course people are getting compensated for putting them back.</p><p>  I am keen for V-notching to be compulsory.  However, I would prefer this to come from the industry because otherwise it will be an enforcement nightmare.  I would love to see the regional forums feeding into a national forum and for the national forum to make a recommendation that V-notching would be compulsory in the lobster industry.  We would gladly implement it then and support that approach.  It makes sense on every level.  However, we do not have full buy-in for that.  Without such full buy-in we could announce a law but we would spend an absolute fortune enforcing it.</p> <p>I would much rather self-enforcement within the industry where possible, through the regional fora and the structures set up as part of those.  Hopefully everyone will buy into that and soon it will become mandatory for everybody, particularly now that there is a 75% compensation for putting V-notched females back.  I would like it to develop but the industry must make it happen.</p><p> I would rather not comment on the seaweed rights argument because I have not spoken to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about it.  I do not want to step into the area for which the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is responsible.  I will talk to her about it.</p><p> In respect of the replacement of pots and the 60% that fishermen must pay, we did a deal with Bank of Ireland.  It said if we provided 40%, it would match that and provide 40% of the capital required by people looking for that funding, which leaves fishermen to find the remaining 20%.  That was a recognition that a banking provision was required to finance this area.  I expect AIB or Ulster Bank would do the same.  This is a matter of investing in the industry and creating good faith around it.  In relative terms this does not involve huge sums of money, although it is significant for many who fish in this category because many would not have overdraft or loan facilities in place.  I have an assurance that Bank of Ireland, particularly, and I suspect the other banks, will at least match what we are doing by making loan or overdraft facilities available to enable people to avail of grant aid.  It is important for people to know that.</p><p> In response to Deputy Harrington, I hope we will get some recommendations on the scallops.  I hope we have started the ball rolling on that issue.  That was the idea behind hatcheries for lobster.  People could see the Department was willing to support initiatives of that kind.  Let us see some more initiatives coming from the sector that can work in suitable regions.  If that means seeding scallops, we will by all means consider that, if it makes sense to put public money into it.</p><p> As for heritage licences, salmon fishing is not my area but we should consider ways to create new income opportunities for inshore fishermen.  In the UK, for example, a significant line fishery has developed for mackerel which is labelled and marketed differently from mackerel caught in large trawls.  Many restaurants in the UK will buy only line-caught mackerel and will pay more for it because it is sustainable and because of the quality of the fish brought in.  We have a big enough quota allocation to support a growing line fishery in different parts of the coastline, where through working with organisations such as Bord Bia, we could create a strong market in Irish restaurants.  I would like to see more work on that, and if I am around long enough, we will do work in that area.  For better or worse, this Department does not make decisions on salmon.</p><p> The training centres are an issue and I would like to see more links with the National Maritime College in Cork, which has a fantastic infrastructure, particularly on safety in navigation.  The resources there are second to none anywhere in the world, and there is no reason fishermen should not access that.  That does not mean we should take them out of Greencastle or Castletownbere.  We should not.  There should be investment there but that training could be supplemented by time in a National Maritime College that has the infrastructure to improve training in that area.  The inshore forum is not a PO, it is a consultative forum.  It is there to bring forward policy ideas and hopefully I will give it some ideas and get feedback.  It may develop into a PO.</p><p> If there are only 12 seals at the entrance to any harbour, one is doing well.</p></speech>

I get mixed reports on seals and their impact on wild fisheries.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara is assessing that, but we are not in a position to decide on seal culls without a lot of science to back it up.  That would be a very unpopular thing to do among the broader public, even though I am sure some fishermen would support it.  Before we could even consider it, we would need very sound science and data.  That will primarily be a decision for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.</p><p>  We do not have grant aid for boats in the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.  That ended in 2003.  We will be able to spend money on upgrading certain equipment on boats that improves the quality of fish, safety and the quality of the work environment on boats.  I do not think there will be a fleet renewal fund coming through the fisheries fund because the Commission would vehemently oppose that.  It is concerned that there is already far too much capacity in fleets across member states, relative to the available stocks.  First, we need to rebuild stocks and then move to increasing catch capacity by making the investments.  There is a provision to take some boats out of the system in the new EMFF.  Once we know how much money we have to spend, the industry needs to sit down with all the representative bodies, POs and fora to work out how to get the maximum value for the Irish seafood and fishing industry from the available funds.  I hope there will be a significant increase on what was available for the past seven years, and although the overall fund is down by 10%, I think Ireland&rsquo;s share of it will dramatically increase.  That may be a bullish prediction but I would be very disappointed if that was not the case.</p><p>  On the local authority audits, we have only &euro;3 million to spend this year, a relatively small sum, for approximately 70 different projects across local authorities around the coastline.  If we have only that much to spend, we want to see bricks and mortar improving infrastructure as opposed to people spending a fortune on consultants.  If we had a lot more money to spend, which hopefully we will soon, we would spend it on more than fixing and building new facilities.  For the moment, I want to concentrate it on activity and improving water access infrastructure for the fishing industry and for marine leisure.</p><p>  My views on fluoride should be reasonably well known.  We need to reconsider our fluoride policy.  I have made my views known in Cabinet.</p> <p>The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has committed to setting up an international panel to examine the appropriateness of Irish fluoride policy.  There are many in his Department who would defend that policy very strongly as a good public health policy while others question it.  We need an independent assessment and recommendations on which we can act.  It is relevant to say that the water used in most agricultural activity does not have added fluoride because it comes from wells on the land.  Fluoride is only added, by and large, to the public water supply available to urban populations.  That was a decision taken for good dental health reasons many years ago.  I do not think politicians should be making decisions here without the science to back them up.  However, I agree that the majority of countries in the developed world have moved away from the policy of adding fluoride to water, the exceptions being New Zealand, Australia and parts of the United States, which continue to add fluoride to drinking water, and they maintain that it is the right policy.  This is not a black and white issue but there is a commitment by the Government to have an independent group of credible people to look at the policy and to make recommendations on which we will act.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to mackerel and line mackerel.  Many restaurateurs are prepared to pay a lot more for scallops that are dive-caught rather than dredged.  This should be borne in mind when developing sustainable markets.</p></speech>

Up to three years ago there had not been a licence granted for about five years in any area of aquaculture.  Two years ago I signed off on about 130 licences, with 134 last year and this year it will be more than 200 licences.  This shows we are making progress, but all these bays must first be assessed because they are all Natura 2000 designated areas.  Before a licence can be considered, an assessment of the bay in question must be carried out and then the impact of the granting of a licence on the ecosystem must be assessed.  This involves co-ordinated work between my Department, the Marine Institute and NPWS.  We are working as quickly as possible to assess those bays.  I know that people who want to expand their businesses are frustrated with the delay in areas such as Donegal, west Cork and along the west and south coasts.  I assure members that this is a major priority for me because, in my view, this is an industry with the capacity to grow significantly and in a sustainable way.  We have a better licensing system now than any other country in the European Union, but it is a slow process as a result of the assessment procedures.  We can take some comfort that when people are issued with a licence, it will stand up to scrutiny from the EU or from any other body because of the assessment process.  Many other countries will find that the Commission is taking a closer look at the operation of their licensing systems, just as it has looked at our system in the past.</p></speech>

I invite the Minister to make his presentation to the committee on the country-specific recommendations for Ireland, following which we will have a question and answer session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014061000002#A00400"><p>As the members probably know, up to this year Ireland was not involved in these country-specific recommendations because we were within the troika programme and much of the commitments and assessment of our national policy was done by the troika overseen through those quarterly visits.  With the new regime we are now back into the general system that applies across all member states where each year the Council makes a recommendation.  This comes on foot of a growth survey.  A number of documents have led up to this in terms of assessing the state of the European economy.  This has been followed by country-specific recommendations.  Clearly, these country-specific recommendations are acquiring increasing importance with changes in EU rules in the provisions and the expectations of convergence of countries, particularly within the eurozone.  This is an important process and will continue to be an important part of Ireland's relationship with the European Union.</p><p>  In that context, Ireland welcomes the Commission's package of country-specific recommendations.  As members will note, seven recommendations in total are set out, among which there are no real surprises.  During the past few years we have been involved in this process and we understand the view from Europe of where we need to improve.</p><p>  We have been engaging fully in the Semester process, as it is described, which started with the growth survey and went through examination at European level at a previous Council meeting and now we have the country-specific recommendations.  They took place earlier in the year and the national reform programme under the EU 2020 strategy and the stability programme were published at that stage.  Ireland is involved in that.</p><p>  Following the publication of these country-specific recommendations, various preparatory committees are looking across the range of all member states and the recommendations being made.  These involve the Employment Committee, the Social Protection Committee and the Economic Policy Committee.  That helps to give a broad perspective, not only with regard to a narrow financial money market view of the world but also in respect of a social, economic, employment and social protection view.  It is important to strike that balance.</p><p>  In terms of my responsibility and presenting here to the committee, two of the recommendations are in the sphere of employment.  Recommendations Nos. 3 and 4 fall into the area of employment policy and social policy, and No. 5 deals with the SME sector and access to credit.  There are also two others in which my Department is involved and they deal with banking, access to finance and cost competitiveness.  The recommendations issued to Ireland by the Commission this year are consistent with the policy directions that were firmly established in the past.  They are also consistent with the national approach being adopted in the medium-term economic strategy, the Action Plan for Jobs, the Pathways to Work and SOLAS in terms of the further education and training strategy that is being developed by the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p>  In the course of the coming weeks as we move towards the Council on 19 June, the country-specific recommendations will be finalised and agreed with the various configurations.</p> <p>We will seek to clarify some of the supporting data with the Commission through those committees and also through COREPER, which is the committee of permanent representatives of member states.  This process is ongoing and we do not expect significant adjustments in country specific recommendations Nos. 3, 4 or 5 and expect they will be adopted as they stand on 19 June.  ECOFIN, the European Council of Finance Ministers, will meet on 20 June and it will finalise the country specific recommendations on economic and budgetary issues.  The country specific recommendations will be sent as a package to be endorsed by Heads of State at the European Council on 26 and 27 June.</p><p> Committee members will have seen the country specific recommendations in the packs with which they have been provided.  Recommendation No. 3 calls for improvements in active labour market policies with a particular focus on the long-term unemployed, low skilled workers and young people through the youth guarantee.  It seeks to progress reform in the further education and training sector and ensure the implementation of the apprenticeship report and the provision of workplace training.  It seeks to improve the level and quality of the support service at Intreo offices and the referral process between Intreo offices and the education and training boards.  Essentially, recommendation No. 3 endorses the approach adopted under the Pathways to Work scheme and it encourages improvement in the execution and development of that policy.  The next phase of work, which will take on these recommendations, will be reflected in the forthcoming Pathways to Work scheme that will be published soon.</p><p> On further education, SOLAS was established last October and a significant expansion of the training and work placement programme has taken place.  SOLAS has published a strategy that indicates it seeks to become more relevant to employers and its client base.  It is an ambitious strategy that sets out the various objectives it seeks to pursue and I understand it will be followed by operational programmes that will put flesh on the bones of those objectives.</p><p> These recommendations are aligned with the thrust of existing policy, which has shifted considerably in recent years.  For many years in Ireland the system that prevailed saw payments made to people on condition they were idle.  The system now seeks to support people to become engaged and active and this has been a feature of the active labour market policy that is being pursued by the Minister for Social Protection.  It is evident too in the interlocking changes that are being made by the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p> I will now address the matters of jobless households, child poverty and child care.  This country specific recommendation has two aspects.  It aims to tackle the low work intensity of households and to focus on the important issue of child care in supporting stronger labour market participation by women.  Poverty and social inclusion issues have been highlighted for up to 11 member states.  Up to 19 member states have been given country specific recommendations that focus on different aspects of labour market participation such as young people, women, older workers, migrants and so on.  Low work intensity is the official EU indicator for households with little paid employment and an above average share of the Irish population, 24%, is in such households.  The problem is particularly severe in Ireland in single parent households.  Key policy responses include Intreo, reform of lone parent supports and the development of housing assistance payments.  Social transfers in Ireland are very effective in alleviating poverty in households with low work intensity but increased labour market participation remains the best route out of poverty.  I understand the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is also working in this sphere and will soon publish research in the area that will shape the continuing policy debate.</p><p> It will be difficult to advance significant improvements in child care within the current fiscal constraints.  The supports provided in Ireland include the universal provision of part-time care and education for children in the year before they commence primary school and targeted supports for low income parents through a number of schemes that support them in taking up employment, work experience, education and training opportunities.  All of this combines to see public spending in these areas reach around &euro;260 million.  Responsibility for the implementation of the poverty element of this recommendation falls to the Minister for Social Protection and responsibility in the area of child care falls to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  This country specific recommendation is aligned with the Government's existing strategy and priorities, including early childhood care and education and subsidised after-school child care schemes.  The issue of welfare benefit reform is also very topical as the report of the advisory group on tax and social welfare is anticipated shortly.</p><p> The next recommendation relates to support for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and includes access to finance.  It fully reflects the work on access to finance that is detailed in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, which has been agreed by the Department of Finance and other parties in the State bodies group.  This recommendation has a number of areas.  It relates to the availability of bank and non-bank financing and debt restructuring issues.  It addresses initiatives to improve the access of SMEs to bank credit and non-bank finance, including three SME funds co-funded by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, Microfinance Ireland and the temporary loan guarantee scheme.  The key focus is on supporting SMEs, particularly in accessing finance.  Responsibility for implementing this falls to the Minister for Finance and I as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Restoring normal lending conditions for SMEs is a crucial focus of Government policy and we will continue to work towards the repair of the banking sector.  We seek to develop a range of non-bank sources of finance and this continues to expand with numerous measures under way.  Government oversight of this process is via the SME State bodies group, which is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes senior officials from my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Senior officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are also on the SME funding consultation committee that seeks to strengthen the engagement of stakeholders with the various SME representative bodies.</p><p> On 22 May the establishment of the Strategic Bank Corporation was announced and it will help channel credit into SMEs and it envisages a mix of funding from sources including the European Investment Bank, EIB, KfW and the NPRF.  It is anticipated that it will make &euro;500 million available to SMEs as a first phase.  We are trying to expand options, develop a stronger range of players in the market and develop options for the sector.  At the moment I am finalising proposals to improve the operation of the credit guarantee scheme and the review of micro finance will begin soon.  Net job creation will mostly come from fast-growing young firms and we have reissued support for the seed and venture capital operated by Enterprise Ireland.  This will be pivotal in supporting high-potential start-ups.  There is much happening in this area and we have seen general improvement but there is clearly a long way to go regarding access to finance for small and medium enterprises.  We must continue to be innovative in this area and this has been underlined by the Commission's recommendations.</p><p> The fact that the content of the 2014 recommendations addressed to Ireland is consistent with the thrust of Government programmes reflects the close working relationship that developed during the support programme and was built upon in the three recent bilaterials.  The close fit between the Commission's recommendations and Government policy in terms of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work also reflects the progress made on the reform agenda.  Once adopted, the country specific recommendations will be subject to ongoing multilateral surveillance by member states and the Commission and will involve continual monitoring, mutual learning and peer review.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of motherhood and apple pie about all this.  It is like the end-of-term report that many children will soon receive.  I will focus on certain areas and outline what I would have said had I written the report.  On the third country specific recommendation, can the Minister outline the Government's specific plans to reform our apprenticeship scheme?</p> <p>I know it is not within the Minister's remit but as the Minister with responsibility for employment, I presume he has an input and an interest.  We have fallen out of love with apprenticeships and we need to fall back in love with them for their part in providing labour market opportunities and as part of the preparation for potential labour demand in the market.  I ask the Minister to explain the plan.  In my view, a dog's dinner has been made of writing the report, CSR5, with regard to SME supports and access to finance.</p><p> The Minister is reviewing the credit guarantee scheme and the microfinance scheme which were the central planks of his reform measures.  Will the review of the credit guarantee scheme happen before the end of this session?  At what stage will it make it to the market?  At what stage will it be available to those companies needing credit?  I ask the Minister to provide an update on Microfinance Ireland, how much it has loaned and the Minister's plans.  The LEO network is being launched.  What targets are being assigned to the LEO network to drive microfinance?</p><p> The Minister referred to KfW and the new bank which was launched the day before the elections.  I ask him to outline the legislative framework for that project.  Was it discussed at Cabinet?  I refer to an interesting remark made last night by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, at the Labour Party hustings that she hoped the announcement would mark the beginning of a jobs plan.  I suggest the Minister might brief the Minister for Social Protection on the Action Plan for Jobs.  The Minister wishes to encourage diversity between bank and non-bank financing.  The members of this committee, from all sides, have really driven this issue hard.  We have all raised with the Minister the issue of crowd financing and source financing.  Are there any plans to take action on this issue?  As a country, we are more dependent on the traditional banking structure than any other EU member state - we are dependent on two banks.  It is extraordinary, in light of all the discussion in Europe and in the media about our tax arrangements, that any review of our country's employment and business policies does not reflect that discussion.  Has there been any discussion at any stage during the interaction around these country-specific reviews about our tax policy for multinationals and for business support generally and for employment creation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014061000004#C00200"><p>The Deputy has raised a number of points in his contribution to which I will seek to respond.  The review of the apprenticeship scheme drew together people from all relevant areas.  The apprenticeship scheme collapsed because it was excessively reliant on the construction sector and was no longer fit for purpose.  This is the reason the Minister for Education and Skills decided to undertake a major programme of reform.  The report has been published and the Minister is moving to implement the recommendations of that review.  The approach to apprenticeship will be simplified and includes shortening the necessary duration of apprenticeships and making the scheme more user-friendly for employers.  The range of skill types will be expanded for which apprenticeships could be developed.  The scheme had been too narrow in its focus, and was inflexible.  It will continue to be regulated by statute but the aim is to make it more flexible and useable.  It is complemented by other SOLAS developments which include traineeships.</p><p>  As employers emerge from a pretty difficult environment, the long-term commitment to apprenticeship is the long-term ideal.  In the shorter term, traineeships are a more flexible instrument and these will probably attract more participation.  The Minister for Education and Skills is seeking to put in place a range of measures, not unlike our access to finance challenge, in order to meet different needs of the market place, such as Momentum and Springboard programmes as well as apprenticeships and traineeships.  SOLAS is charged with the implementation of a spectrum of options.</p><p>  I do not accept the Deputy's point that access to finance has not improved dramatically.  It is easy to criticise schemes like microfinance and the loan guarantee for not achieving the desired results.  However, these were under consideration during the Deputy's time in government and they were never implemented.  We have acknowledged that these innovations need to be tested and amended.  We will be bringing the report on the credit review group before the joint committee very shortly and we will bring forward heads of legislation for consultation with the committee.  We have ambitions to expand microfinance.  A total of 240 loans have been approved, totalling &euro;3.8 million, which is a 54% approval rate.  The credit guarantee is currently &euro;11.6 million in 88 facilities.  These schemes have had a very tangible impact on jobs in that they are helping to increase employment by 445 and to maintain employment in the case of 276.  Over 700 jobs are either in place or are protected and these have been saved by the loan guarantee scheme.  We can do better by amending the scheme.  As Deputy Calleary rightly says, this is one of the new instruments at the disposal of the local enterprise offices when dealing with clients.  We are considering amendments to the seed capital scheme, which is a very generous tax break for start-up companies for former PAYE workers who start up companies, but the scheme has not been taken up to a degree.  Crowd financing is also included in the pre-budget assessment to ascertain whether changes may be required to make crowd finance more acceptable.</p><p>  The Commission has an interest in tax policy but it does not arise in the context of the country-specific recommendations.  Member states retain rights as to taxation.  The Department of Finance and ECOFIN would be better sources of information with regard to tax.  Work is ongoing on other issues such as equity finance, retail bonds, working capital for exports and a range of elements to be put in place.  At this stage we are not far off &euro;3 billion in new funding sources which were not in place three years ago.  These range from microfinance, the loan guarantee scheme, the new national NPRF funds, the continuing development of the seed and venture fund and the strategic investment bank.  In consultation with Enterprise Ireland, we are seeking to find out where SMEs are encountering particular difficulties in order to position funds with appropriate partners.  This is a smart way of using our money.  For example, in the seed and venture fund we put up &euro;1 which attracts a further &euro;3 from the private sector, which amounts to a fund of &euro;4 for our &euro;1.  That fund provides finance to businesses and brings domain expertise in the sector in which the businesses operate.  The development capital fund has seen a number of interesting players in that area.  Some very prominent Irish companies are getting behind those development capital funds and bringing their expertise and access to finance to bear and to help the growth of companies.  We are building a range of options.  Not all schemes do as well as they might but that is to be expected with innovation.</p></speech>

It focuses also on child care.  The children's allowance makes it more difficult for a parent to rejoin the workforce.  Another factor to have arisen today is that there has been very little regulation of child care since that "Prime Time" expos&eacute; about a year ago.  That, too, reduces parents' confidence when they want to re-enter the workforce.  </p><p> SME debt is still a critical mess.  The fact that a third of businesses are in debt impairment puts the foot on the neck of possible growth.  Another sector, the hotel sector, is in real trouble with debt.  I know that some of the positive things that the Government has done on job creation have been in the hospitality sector, yet much of that will be either stalled or reversed if there is not a mechanism to reduce the level of toxicity of some of that debt.  We have had many banks and financial institutions before the committee.  Some of them have taken positive steps to separate toxic debt and the functioning element of their business, but others have not.  Others just see functioning businesses as an opportunity fix their own internal financial problems.  I had a meeting earlier today with a number of small traders.  Cash-handling costs are putting small traders out of business.  The way in which the banking industry is focused on deleveraging, on reducing the level of credit in the economy and on making it more difficult for businesses to function is still having an enormous, negative impact on opportunities for job creation.  Will the Minister force the banks to nurture those functioning businesses which have toxic elements to them and to start making it easier for small businesses to function in respect of cash-handling charges etc.?</p><p> Has the issue of our corporation tax raised its head in this regard?  What is the Minister's view on the European Commission's desire to investigate our corporation tax and what does he see as being the outcome of that?  What could be done to increase our competitive advantages elsewhere in the economy so that we are not so reliant on competitive advantage in corporation tax, especially the bargain basement element of it which was highlighted by the Governor of California during the Taoiseach's recent visit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014061000005#D00200"><p>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n makes a general point and says that he does not like EU oversight.  We are interdependent and we have agreed that in certain areas of policy, because of that interdependence, we share information and accept recommendations at a general level and seek to implement them.  This is a process from which we gain as well as it involving our being under scrutiny.  I have no problem with scrutiny either from Oireachtas or from the EU.  The EU adds value.  It is able to look across other countries.  From a micro-examination of what we are doing, it sees trends and patterns, and that is helpful.  Before the Government came into office, and particularly before Joan Burton came to the Department of Social Protection, the OECD had said for many years that we did not have sufficient labour market activation within our welfare system. It said that we had separated labour market activation from the payment system, which was inappropriate, and that other countries which were successful in this area had joined them together.  She has joined them together. It is as a result of international engagement that that has been seen as a correct way to go.  I welcome this process.  As in all these matters, there is some pressure from member states.  That is part of the arrangement that we have signed up to and it is helpful.</p><p>  I accept that problems continue to be faced by SMEs in accessing finance.  Progress is being made in some areas.  The latest Red C survey on access to finance shows that refusal rates for SMEs have come down from 30% to 19%, so there has been a significant improvement in the ability of small and medium enterprises to have applications for finance accepted by the banking system, but, like Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, I would like to see the amount of new lending to SMEs growing.  It is pretty much static at the &euro;2 billion per year.  With a number of sectors now growing, we expect to see more growth in funding to SMEs.  That is certainly a major subject in my engagement with the banks.  We are also putting other, non-bank sources into the marketplace to try to complement that funding.  No matter how effective we are, the long-term business of banks has to be in funding SMEs.  That is their only future in Ireland.  They need to learn those skills and develop the engagement level with their client base to understand their needs.</p><p>  The Central Bank monitors regularly how banks deal with SMEs that are in distress.  It has set targets for the banks, and the banks have engaged in that process.  Considerable progress has been made on distressed SMEs reaching restructuring agreements with the banking system.  I accept that the banks, despite having cut back on their own staff and costs, are seeking to move to break-even and profit positions.  In the long-term, we need a banking system that is able to wash its face.  That has resulted in pressure on costs.  We are clearly in a bind between our ambition to have an efficient banking system that can survive on its own two feet - with the taxpayer, who has put in a lot of money to support it, having the prospect of getting that back - and the fair handling of customers.  We continue to try to get that balance right by having codes of practice in place. </p><p>  To my knowledge, the issue of tax has not come up in this process.  The process has looked at the established areas of engagement between the Troika and us.  As members of the committee know,  those have not involved tax policy.  The engagement is around the areas where we made undertakings in relation to reform agendas.  It is a continuation of that reform agenda.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised the wider issue of how one builds competitive advantage.  I would say from my experience that this is a war for talent; skills is the key.  We achieve competitive advantage through the quality of the skills base that we grow and the appropriateness of those skills.  I have worked with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairi Quinn to double - and we are now stepping up our ambition - the number of ICT graduates.  That is why we have put in place the springboard to develop those skills bases.  It is why we are looking at big data as the next wave where a big skills edge can be gained for countries which are early movers.  It is about looking at clusters and sectors where we can get early-mover advantage.  There is range of things that one needs to develop, but skills are often the top of the agenda - there are others of course.  There are many areas where we can seek to develop our competitive advantage.  The meat and drink of the Action Plan for Jobs is seeking to identify and build out those sectors over time by gradual policy changes and innovations.</p> <p>In this regard research and development, which is the area covered by the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is crucial.  </p><p> In broad terms, while it does not deal with tax, it deals with fiscal consolidation.  One of the recommendations is to support fiscal consolidation.  It states consideration should be given to raising revenues through broadening the tax base but I do not think that is what the Deputy was referring to.  He was referring to corporate tax.</p></speech>

To resolve that, there is a necessity to broaden out the taxation base to ensure there is a better and a fairer tax of business and people.</p></speech>

It dealt with a range of areas, including country-specific recommendations.  To touch on the tax issue, it is almost like having one's maiden aunt visit one's house and criticise the furniture or the family.  It commented on a list of things.  One of them was tax and it referred to the fact VAT is zero rated compared to many other countries.  It referred to our public health expenditure and stated it was among the highest in Europe.  It stated that the cost of pharmaceuticals and child care was very high.  It stated that lending to SMEs was weak and that lawyers' fees were high.  It seemed to go on and on and I felt it was like one's maiden aunt visiting and criticising the house.  However, that does not give us the answers and in this respect the steps the Minister is taking are admirable and the right way to go but the natural reaction is to ask what we can do other than what we are doing already.</p><p>  Yesterday, I attended the launch of Springboard, which the Minister mentioned a couple of times.  It is very impressive.  We met not so much the students as those giving the courses in the colleges and universities.  We heard about some of the success stories they have had over the past couple of years.  Those participating have degrees but in areas in which there are no opportunities for them, in particular construction.  Architects, quantity surveyors and so on are now switching to IT.  Some of the stories were great.  However, the real challenge is how to encourage them to start up a business.  This rests on the Minister's shoulders.  How can we remove the barriers and encourage people to start up companies?  I am not sure we are doing nearly enough.  There must be a system where we could encourage people to set up businesses by removing some of those barriers.  </p><p>  One of the things which was done in Britain was the "one in, one out".  Now it has the "one in, two out".  If a new constraint was introduced and somehow or other it influenced business, a previous one had to be taken out but now if a new piece of red tape is introduced, two pieces of red tape have to be taken out.  That is the sort of thing with which we have to challenge ourselves, although perhaps we are doing something like that already.</p><p>  The Seanad passed the upward-only rent review legislation.  Rents are a huge burden on retail, which is suffering.  Most retailers are having a huge difficulty with this.  I urge the Government to pass that legislation in the D&aacute;il.  It does not have to be enthusiastic about it as the President will not sign it until he gets the Supreme Court to guarantee that it will work and that it is constitutional.  This legislation should be passed and sent to the President, who will not sign it as there is a question over its validity from a constitutional point of view.  However, he could refer it to the Supreme Court which would decide whether it is constitutional.  If the Supreme Court states it is unconstitutional, that is the end of it but if it says it is constitutional, that will also be the end of it but it will remove one of the huge barriers for people who want to set up a businesses and compete, in particular in retail.  Others mentioned hotels and other businesses.  There is an opportunity to do something there.  It is just one of the barriers which could be removed.</p></speech>

Now we are involved in what is a multilateral process.  Every member state is put under scrutiny and faces country-specific recommendations.  There is a meeting of our peers where we can seek to get changes if we do not agree with something.  Those changes can be made.  We work with one another as colleague member states.  There is a large element of peer review and mutual learning in this process.  There is also an element of pressure in the process but there is a considerable amount of give and take and learning in it.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said he did not like the notion but it is a good process and given the problems Europe has had, we need to do this kind of thing.  Not all maiden aunts are unconstructive and unhelpful.</p></speech>

We had the Se&aacute;n O'Sullivan forum, which brought together entrepreneurs, and we are now developing a policy statement on the back of that.  We have done a number of things.  Recently, we announced a competition to find the best young entrepreneur at county and national level in whom we will invest.  That is a very tangible way to encourage young people.  We have put in place Knowledge Transfer Ireland which is essentially a central body that will look at every piece of intellectual property scattered around all of the education institutions to see how it can be sweated to encourage start-up businesses.  We have the local enterprise offices at local level which are a first-stop shop to provide the very best of what the State can give in an accessible way.</p><p>  The changes to company law, which are currently going to the D&aacute;il and the select committee and will shortly go to the Seanad, will prove user-friendly for a new entrepreneur setting up a company in a way that minimises the bureaucracy.  We are aiming to be the Delaware of Europe in the sense of having the best structures for companies.  </p><p>  Ireland and Dublin, in particular, is a start-up hub.  Some of the changes have made it easier for overseas entrepreneurs to come to Ireland.  We have removed some of the obstacles and Enterprise Ireland has a fund of &euro;10 million to help to support overseas entrepreneurs who want to use Ireland as a base for start-ups.  We have a pretty exciting space in many parts of the country.  We can do better in this area and that is one of the reasons the first ever regional enterprise strategies will be developed.  We need to spread that enthusiasm for start-ups throughout the system.</p><p>  In regard to retail, we have sought to simplify the whole retail licensing portal and to have a single portal for retail licensing.  That has gone out to tender and we hope to deliver that later in the year.  We are doing many things we believe will make it easier for people to start a business.</p><p>  I looked at the "one in, one out" concept in the UK but it almost has a whole department devoted to nothing else but that kind of work.  I took a hard look at it but do not believe it could be applied here.  Managing that whole process involves very considerable bureaucracy in the UK.  It is a nice idea but in terms of practicality, it is difficult.</p><p>  I would prefer to ask our Department how it can improve the way it interfaces with business over the next 12 months.  It is doing that already.  It has cut the time in which to get a work permit, it has cut the number of days in which to start up a company and it has cut the waiting times for employers and workers who are in dispute situations.  We are trying to improve every interface we have with business and make it work better.</p> <p>That is probably a more meaningful set of changes for businesses than the one in, one out.  The high level group continues to examine regulation and where to make improvements.  The Minister of State in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, chairs that group.  We are not saying they are mutually exclusive.</p><p> Upward-only rent reviews are a problem.  I am not a lawyer and that issue is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The then Minister, Deputy Shatter, took a hard look at the problem and did his very best to bring forward proposals.  He submitted them for legal scrutiny but they were found not to be robust and the Government could not implement them.  We wanted to do it but the view was that if the proposal went ahead, the State would have to compensate those who had lost if the upward-only rent reviews were no longer available.  We could not ask taxpayers to pick up the bill.  That was the stumbling block for the proposal.</p></speech>

How does the content and tone of our ten country-specific recommendations, CSRs, compare or contrast with those in other countries in Europe, for example, the economically troubled countries in southern Europe, such as Italy, Portugal and Spain, and the more economically stable countries in northern Europe?  Where do we sit in respect of our European neighbours?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014061000007#F00700"><p>I have to confess I have not read all the other country-specific recommendations.  The Commission analyses the data sets in each which tend to follow the same sort of pattern.  In countries where there is high unemployment such as we had, although mercifully that is improving, it focuses on active labour market policies, retraining and displacement.  Countries that have a bigger fiscal problem and are not in a troika process would lay heavier emphasis on broadening the tax base.  To judge by last year's process, those issues came up.  Some consider wage-setting mechanisms, which was controversial and the extent to which indexation is built in and whether that is appropriate when so much change is happening.  It tends to analyse each country and, based on its situation, decides how to respond.</p><p>  The Commission has high level European challenges, which are not surprising: tackling unemployment, reducing debt, shifting to more growth friendly taxation, boosting private investment, making our economies more competitive, youth unemployment and the youth guarantee.  Depending where a country sits on the spectrum of these general issues, it might, for example, say that Austria or Germany has the best example of training and tells Spain to move closer to that model.  It says the same to us.  For example, the interest in the apprenticeship model and the need to modernise it is focused on a traditional weakness of Irish enterprise and the State's provision.  It is a two-way street.</p><p>  I can show the Deputy the issues it highlights in different countries.  It highlights unemployment and contrasts Austria's 4% and Greece&rsquo;s 27% and makes recommendations based on that.</p></speech>

I apologise for having had to step out and hope that nothing I ask has been already covered.</p><p>  The Minister said there are no great surprises and it does not seem to me that the committee or the D&aacute;il would need to deal with the country-specific recommendations.  In the legal context, are they recommendations, directives or directions?  Are there penalties for non-compliance?  Are they legally binding?</p><p>  The Commission published its in-depth review in March, stating "the remaining macroeconomic imbalances require specific monitoring and decisive policy action".  It mentions specifically private and public sector indebtedness.  What concerns does the Minister have about that?</p><p>  A US Senator and governor spoke last week about the status of American companies in Ireland.  Does the Minister think this could have an impact on other multinationals coming into the country, which would affect foreign direct investment?  Is there a mood now in the United States to prohibit this to the extent that some multinationals might no longer regard it as the correct thing to do?</p></speech>

Most are recommendations which are jointly adopted before our peers.  The CSRs for Ireland will be adopted by the entire Union of 28 states.  We are making a political commitment to deliver to one another.  There are enforceable clauses in any recommendations that relate to finance because of the obligations under the various fiscal treaties, such as borrowing levels.  These include the excessive deficit and imbalance procedures.  They could eventually lead to sanctions.  The idea is that we seek as a Union to develop reform agendas that are in our mutual interest.  We commit mutually to try to improve in those areas, which is mostly a political commitment.  There are, however, situations in which there is more power, in the so-called macroeconomic imbalance area.  That is the formal position.</p><p>  Private and public indebtedness issues are not new.  Ireland&rsquo;s public debt peaked last year at 120% of GDP, or whatever the figure was.  That is high.  We have a long-term commitment to get down to 60% over time and there are various expectations in the fiscal treaties of how we should move in the short term.  For example, moving to a 3% borrowing target is the major commitment.  The focus on private indebtedness is on the bank work-out of mortgages and small businesses in distress and looking for a way to deal with those problems.  We have high private indebtedness as well as high public indebtedness.</p> <p>That is one of the challenges of this recession compared with other recessions.  It is not only a cyclical dip, as people have said; it is also a balance sheet recession.  In other words, many households and big companies are impaired with debts.  Therefore, it is not only a cyclical dip from which it is easy to recover.  Clearly, that is a challenge.  The experience not only in Europe but generally is that the quicker one can manage to come to terms with those debt issues, the quicker recovery comes.  That is where the level of European concern in this area comes from.</p><p> The wider issue of tax policy and pressure to change it is at the heart of the so-called BEPS - base erosion and profit shifting - process where the OECD is examining how some companies have been able to play off features of different tax codes and arrive at a situation where they pay negligible levels of tax.  Ireland's position is very clear, that there is nothing wrong with our tax code, but we are fully engaged in a process with the OECD and with other colleagues to come up with what would be multilateral changes to make sure the interaction of these codes does not work in a way that allows companies to avoid paying tax anywhere.  We are fully engaged in that process.  We can gain as much as lose from engaging in that process.  We are not a tax haven.  We have a low certain tax code with very clear statute-based provisions.  The countries that will come under pressure in this are people who have a roll your own type tax code where they give different tax arrangements to different companies that come along.  If we can maintain our straightforward, statute-based, low corporate tax rate, that can be a competitive advantage.  Clearly, we have to work to ensure that but we are very engaged.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Department of Finance were very much at the heart of EU work in this area, even before the BEPS process started at the OECD level.</p></speech>

Considering what those in Europe are doing in examining the CSR, is it possible for us to examine some sort of regional funding in Ireland?  While Dublin is doing very well, some parts of the country are still struggling, in particular rural Ireland, and perhaps in some counties we could consider having a county fund.  I would appreciate an update on the mentoring issue, as it is also a key element of promoting entrepreneurship.</p><p>  We had representatives of the credit unions in last week and they indicated they had &euro;8 billion which they were willing to invest in the SME sector.  Perhaps we could find a way for the State to underwrite that, say over a five year period.  Is that something we could consider?</p></speech>

With regard to entrepreneurial funds, we had the business expansion scheme, BES, or the employment and investment incentive scheme, EIIS, which replaced it, but there was not much take-up of those schemes.  Could it be considered in the upcoming budget with a view to making it more friendly to people and perhaps investments could be made directly by people into a business and tax relief allowed on such investment and the person concerned would pay the capital gains tax on the way out.</p><p>  There does not seem to have been much take-up of the seed capital relief scheme, which has been in place for many years.  Could it be simplified such that the tax a person would get back in terms of the previous five years of tax paid could be invested in the shares as opposed to one having to invest the overall amount?  Currently if one invests &euro;100,000 in a company, one must be a director of the company and one can offset one's tax - up to the previous five years of tax paid - against that &euro;100,000, but perhaps it could be provided that a person could invest &euro;100,000 and claim it back if one had paid that amount over a previous period because currently one has to find &euro;100,000 first which is a struggle.  The amount could be &euro;50,000, I am simply using the figure of &euro;100,000 as an example, but one has to find the money to invest in share capital and then one can get the tax paid on that claimed over the previous five years which, in theory, works very well but, in practice, is very difficult.  That scheme has been in existence since the early 1990s but there has not been much take-up of it.</p></speech>

There are a number of EU sponsored modules, Structural Funds and so on.  If the Deputy is talking about a regional enterprise type fund, I have not seen any measures in that area.  A difficulty in terms of regional policy is that much of what we do in the enterprise area is to respond to enterprise application.  We support viable business plans and that would be the case in most other countries.  They would focus in on how to improve access to finance through COSME, how to improve innovation through Horizon 2020 or how to get a better spread of SME participation.  That is the way in which we seek to strengthen the regions.  Obviously there are other infrastructural issues that have a regional dimension, but they would not be falling into this process - not at the moment in any event as I do not know of any of those - which essentially is examining reform of institutional arrangements.  Much of what is done through the use of Structural Funds and ESF funding has a very definite regional dimension.</p><p>  A  mentoring report is being prepared by Forf&aacute;s and it is in its final stages.  We will probably publish it at the same time as the enterprise strategy which will be in the next number of months or so.</p><p>  On the credit union issue, we are examining whether these funds can be better utilised.  There has undoubtedly been some misgivings about this from the regulator.  I am not fully up on those misgivings but my Department is involved with the State bodies group, which has the finance and regulatory people on board.  That issue is being examined.  The credit unions have potential in this area but there have been some issues with them around business lending.</p><p>  Both the seed capital scheme and the EIIS are being examined and reviewed in the context of next year's budget.  The take-up of them has been disappointing, particularly the seed capital scheme which, as the Deputy said, has been low.  That might be partly due to people not knowing about them but also, as the Deputy rightly said, one has to produce the investment upfront to avail of the tax relief thereafter.  I will pass on the Deputy's suggestion to the Minister, Deputy Noonan's group, which is examining this.  I do not know the workability of it.  It would have to be developed a bit further to determine if it is something that could be considered.  The EIIS does allow the money to go in tax free, and it is much along the lines-----</p></speech>

I compare this analogy to the banking sector, where they are a bit critical of the amount of funding that has been made available to SMEs while there is plenty of funding available to SMEs.</p> <p>I suggest that we should go to the EU which is all talk about putting together another source of funding rather than the banking system.  We are meeting with deputy director Crespo tomorrow who has spoken about this on a number of occasions.  I suggest the Government should be forceful in its manner with the EU and say that they should help us out.</p><p> There is a difficulty in finding the correct conduit to bring the available funding to the SME sector.  AIB is finding it difficult to access the fund and to be the conduit for the funding to SMEs but this does not seem to be a problem for Bank of Ireland.  We need help from the EU to be able to provide some form of conduit for that funding.  The world is awash with money at the moment and there are lots of investors with funds seeking to put their money somewhere.  Bonds are at an all-time low so they are getting no returns from bonds.  It is no use having money in the banks because the overnight rate is negative.  Maybe the Government should ask the EU to help us to put this funding into proper SME use.</p></speech>

Investors need to have an appetite for risk with regard to SMEs.  These funds may sound great in principle but often the level of risk investors are willing to take on is not as great.  There are always issues about how risk is shared and who takes the risk.  Ireland has been reasonably innovative in the way we have used money to leverage private sector money and we have done quite well in this regard.  The European Investment Bank has been involved in some cases but generally speaking our development capital funds and seed and venture funds have had some Exchequer money and considerable private sector money from those who have an appetite for risk.  SME funding requires investors with a risk appetite.  The strategic investment bank is to be regarded as the vehicle for attracting more of that sort of money.  It will also be a case of having the right financial products.  Our banks have not been sufficiently innovative in presenting financial products.  We are looking at options such as export factoring and invoice discounting.  Some of these instruments could be relevant if they could be produced at the right price for business.</p><p>  To be fair to the European Union, it has invested SME funding mechanisms in both COSME and Horizon 2020, the two big programmes which have a bearing on businesses.</p></speech>

It is a case of deciding whether this is a better deal than can be achieved with other financial instruments.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is more informed on this matter than I am.  It has not been as straightforward a source of substantial SME funding as one might think but the strategic investment bank is a major effort to draw down more of that funding.  I refer to funds based in NPRF and Enterprise Ireland which have been formed by the Exchequer in partnership with private investors.  There may be scope in further areas which the Minister for Finance is exploring.  The thinking behind the strategic investment bank is to draw down more of those funds.</p></speech>

He has acknowledged that the Government stands ready to support the workforce and the company in finding a resolution to what is a difficult set of ongoing negotiations.  We all want those negotiations to go well and for the best possible outcome for all 1,100 staff at the plant in Waterford.</p><p>  I have a number of questions for the Minister.  He may be able to outline what practical supports the State can give to support job retention and to deal with the reductions in wages proposed by the company unilaterally two weeks ago.  We have heard from IDA Ireland about the supports it can provide.  Some of the comments from the chief executive officer of IDA Ireland have been very unhelpful to the negotiations.  What tangible, practical supports can the Government put on the table to support and retain jobs in Bausch and Lomb in Waterford?  </p><p>  There seems to be a view that whatever supports the Government will put on the table when the timing is right are separate from the ongoing discussions about the saving of &euro;20 million which is to be achieved with the 200 redundancies and the 20% pay cut for the remaining 900 staff, which everyone regards as unsustainable.  Why is no Government support being considered to minimise the job losses and those pay cuts?  I am sure the Minister will agree that they would be unsustainable for those workers and that the job losses of any degree would be a disaster for Waterford.</p><p>  The Waterford economy has very high levels of unemployment.  The Minister's backbenchers will have informed him of the widespread anger about the high levels of unemployment in Waterford city and the frustration caused by Government promises which have not been delivered upon. I remind the Minister that this committee recently published a report on the south east economic development strategy which put forward practical realistic proposals and a number of high level interventions by the Government to create a level playing field for the region.  Regional aid and a university for the south east were two proposals.  It is a real frustration in Waterford that we do not have an IDA Ireland regional office with an IDA Ireland regional director based in Waterford acting on behalf of the south east and working to an overall regional strategy similar to that published by this committee.  I ask the Minister to outline the tangible actions by the Government and what future actions will be put in place to help create and sustain jobs in Waterford generally because the anger is huge and genuine and understandable given that the levels of unemployment are so high.</p> <p>What people want is action.  They want the Minister with responsibility for jobs and enterprise to act decisively.  What specifically will the Minister and his Department do to support Bausch and Lomb and its workers and, in general, job creation in Waterford city and county, as well as the south east?</p><p> It would be useful if the Minister could come back to the committee to discuss the Forf&aacute;s report and the south east action plan that he published, as well as the committee&rsquo;s SEEDS, the south-east economic development strategy 2013-2023, report.  We spoke earlier about regional development.  There is a significant problem in the south east which can only be addressed with political will and high-level interventions for the region, Waterford city and county.</p></speech>

I am conscious that the negotiations are in a sensitive place, so I will not comment specifically on them.  When they are finalised and, hopefully, a good arrangement is in place, the Minister needs to come back to the committee to outline the sequence of events that have led us to this position.  We wish the negotiations well.  The comments of the outgoing chief executive officer of IDA Ireland were completely inappropriate.  For him to interfere in a specific situation, particularly when he was leaving the organisation, was inappropriate and unfair to everyone involved, particularly the workers for whom much is being asked.  We have a cross-party report on the south east which needs to be revisited.  The Bausch and Lomb episode shows how vulnerable the economy is there.</p><p>  I have been raising with the Minister for some time the fact that this country heavily depends on the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries and it is one of our major employers.  How vulnerable are these jobs to companies such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals which took over Bausch and Lomb?  It is currently involved in an aggressive takeover of Allergan, another Irish-based company.  Has the Minister a strategy in place for dealing with the vulnerability of jobs with takeovers from companies such as Valeant?</p><p>  I wish Martin Shanahan every success as the new chief executive officer of IDA Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014061000010#J00300"><p>Obviously Bausch and Lomb is an IDA Ireland-backed company.  The issue of the IDA and its contingent in Waterford has been spoken about much, particularly regarding its lack of results.  I did a bit of checking recently.  Before 1996, there was a regional IDA manager for the south east, based in Waterford.  That position was moved to Cork then.  At the time, plenty of people, including those in government, sounded a warning that this would have a detrimental and negative effect on Waterford city and county and the south east.  When I did some digging, I found it interesting that when those warnings were sounded the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment who made that decision was in fact the Minister, Deputy Bruton.</p><p>  Since then, those warnings have proved to be absolutely correct.  The decision has led to an imbalance in foreign direct investment with most of it going to three particular locations, Cork, Dublin and Galway.  Neither is there any argument about the deterioration of inward investment in Waterford since that 1996 decision.  In February this year, it was decided to provide funding for 35 new personnel in the IDA.  There needs, however, to be a restructuring in the organisation of senior managers in the south east.  The situation that existed in 1996 when the Minister was in charge needs to be reinstated.  What has occurred with Bausch and Lomb has happened ten times in Waterford over the past ten years.  The Government needs to respond positively to this.  There will be a change soon in personnel in the chief executive officer and chairman in the IDA.  They, along with the Minister, need to take up these points seriously.</p></speech>

This is an exceptionally difficult situation for the workers affected.  This started back in August 2013 when Valeant took over Bausch and Lomb.  It was signalled in the media at the time that Valeant was undertaking a root-and-branch examination of costs and that there would be pressure on different plants to show how they could deliver on costs.  Obviously, threats to employment were implied in that.  That is why we have been actively engaged with this company over a long period.  I know there has been some criticism in this House and elsewhere that this should have been shared with other public figures.  That is not the way one can work in an early-warning situation.  We have worked hard to minimise the impact on Waterford throughout that period.</p><p>  The package the IDA has put forward seeks to minimise the impact of job losses.  The company made a decision that it needed to regain cost competitiveness if it were to retain its operation and re-win its market share.  After acquisitions of this nature, there are always difficulties.  To take up Deputy Calleary&rsquo;s point, we are very alert to mergers and takeovers and their effects.  There is much change in the pharmaceutical sector.  As well as recognising areas of growth as well as of difficulty, we have managed to maintain our employment levels in this sector, a sector in which there has been much downsizing internationally.</p><p>  I do not wish to comment further on this as it is at the Labour Relations Commission.  Both sides are participating in an open and constructive way.  I hope an outcome will allow us save the 900 jobs, invest as we plan and, hopefully, win new opportunities.</p><p>  High unemployment in the south east is a continuing issue, of which I am acutely aware.  The closure of TalkTalk was a particular catalyst for me.  I have put a decisive spotlight on the south east through all our agencies.  I did deliver the regional aid package for the south east which will now put it on a four-square with all other disadvantaged regions in the country, something which had not been the case in the past.  The issue of the technological university does not fall into my bailiwick.</p> <p>I know that the legislative process through which the technological university can be won for the south east is being developed.  I am looking at a regional enterprise strategy and I believe we need to put more thinking into where regions' competitive advantages lie and how we develop them and get greater collaboration to deliver that.  I am devoting further study to this area and the south east will certainly be a major priority for me in that context.  </p><p> The issue of the IDA manager in Waterford is undoubtedly an operational matter for the IDA.  I take the point that there is much criticism.  In terms of where one puts new staff, clearly we are in a very competitive international world and are seeking to build new opportunities in new geographies to win new staff.  All of those 35 people are being put into overseas locations to try to win new investment.  Obviously, the IDA is undergoing reviews of its overall and regional strategies in conjunction with my Department.  We will look at issues raised here in terms of staffing at that level.  I would make the point that the person with designated regional responsibility moved from Waterford in 2011.  I just noticed that if one takes site visits as a measure, in the period before that person moved from Waterford, there were an average of ten site visits per year.  Since that person left, which coincides with my action in putting a spotlight on the south east, the number of site visits has doubled.  I see this as being about delivering to the region and am confident that the IDA, under my direction, is giving this the necessary attention it deserves.  </p><p> I would like to see more wins, but we have had Nypro and Enterprise Ireland had a number of wins, including Eishtec in the south east in Wexford and Waterford.  We continue to put major emphasis on this and it is an area in which we need to work together to deliver a successful strategy.  The site visits are being increased and I believe that, given time, those site visits and that enhanced effort will deliver results.  This year, I again funded through the IDA an advanced facility in Waterford, precisely because I feel that we need something different in the regions to respond to the challenges that IDA has had in getting the necessary regional spread.  I am open to whatever is seen to work and we will be taking a tough look at our regions, how we are doing things and how we can do things better.  That will be part of both the IDA regional strategy and my work with it, which will embrace the wider enterprise family.  I have probably visited the south east more than any other region and have consistently focused on this in all my dealings with the outgoing chief executive, as I will with the incoming chief executive.  It is a high priority for me because it reflects a need that is obvious to me.  </p><p> That document is being reviewed by the south east task force and many of the actions dovetail with ones we are acting upon.  As the Deputy outlined, the regional aid is something that I already acted upon last month.  We will continue to work with the committee in this area.</p></speech>

It is not good enough just to say that the absence of an IDA regional director based in Waterford or a regional office is simply an operational matter for the IDA.  It has been very clear for a long time that this enterprise organisation has not been delivering for Waterford or the south east.  Despite the increase in site visits, we are simply not getting the jobs or the bang for our buck.  The matter is urgent and we cannot afford to wait for any outcome of a regional review in which the Minister might be involved generally.  The south east needs urgent attention and decisive interventions and has needed them for some time.  Many of the high-level interventions in the SEEDS report and the Forf&aacute;s report have not been implemented.  We are still waiting for the university.</p><p>  To go back to the IDA, we need a regional strategy that has a regional office and a regional director.  It is not just about having staff for the sake for it.  It is about having a regional focus and a joined-up approach between all stakeholders so that the IDA is anchored in the region in Waterford city.  That is what we need, and if we do not get it we will have ten more years of job losses and a further decline in manufacturing.  I ask the Minister to accept that there is an urgency about this and to act decisively because, while there is and has been a spotlight, the action has not been as decisive as the Minister would say.</p></speech>

The employment numbers show very clearly that in the past two years, employment in the south east has increased by 14,000.  That is substantial progress and as good a performance as that of any region in the country at the moment.  I accept that unemployment levels are still far too high.  The reason Waterford has been singled out for an advanced facility is precisely because I want to see more delivery there.  As I said to Deputy Deasy, I will be reviewing the appropriate alignment of our resources to the challenges we meet in the context of regional strategy with the IDA.  It is worth pointing out that since I put a spotlight on the area, the site visits have doubled.  The general indicator is that if one can increase site visits and get more companies in to look at the area, one will get the investment in behind.  We need to improve the offering and that is why we are improving it by putting in a facility that will lift the offering that is available.  We are approaching this in a systematic way.  I agree that it is urgent and I will give it urgent attention.  That is all I can assure the Deputy of.</p></speech>

The Minister has spent an awful lot of time on the south east.  I accept that site visits have increased and unemployment figures have gone down significantly.  I was trying to pinpoint one thing, and I think I got the answer I wanted from the Minister.  This occurred back in 1996 when Deputy Bruton was Minister.  Regardless of whether it was a coincidence, in many respects people pinpoint that date as the start of the decline in the city of Waterford, when the transfer of the manager or senior person to Cork took place.  If the Minister is prepared to look at this in the structural review that is ongoing in the IDA, which is being conducted by Frank Ryan, I appreciate that.  It is something that is absolutely necessary.</p></speech>

I will speak briefly on the MRCI, setting up the context for our submission, and I will introduce my colleagues, who will speak on certain points that concern us.<br/>MRCI is a national organisation and we have been in existence for more than 12 years.  We provide a drop-in service to migrant workers and assist them in achieving their rights in the areas of employment, immigration and anti-discrimination.  Our submission is based on the evidence of people with whom we work and research we have conducted over the years.  We have been actively working on the work permit system for several years and we work closely with departmental officials on an ongoing basis to try to make the system better, more efficient and fairer.<br/>We are concerned with the rights of the most vulnerable migrant workers in the State.  We work with undocumented migrants, people who have suffered forced labour, au pairs, carers, restaurant workers and domestic workers, and our comments are confined to those groups.  Nearly 59,000 people are eligible to apply for work permits in the State, a significant number.  Migration plays a very important role in economic development and it will continue to play that role, given the global nature of our economy.  We constantly examine population growth and EU trends, and the current level of immigration in Europe is insufficient to maintain the working age within OECD countries.  We need to look ahead and the Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill provides an opportunity to make our system more fit for purpose.<br/>The Department has always focused on the stated policy commitment of attracting high skills into Ireland.  We also need to consider essential skills and we are keen to work with the Department and SOLAS on that because we see demands in the economy that are not officially recorded.  We have been in touch with a number of the members about the issue of au pairs, who are <i>de facto</i>workers.  The notion of au pairs no longer exists in real terms but provides a loophole for people to employ workers at lower employment standards than we would uphold through our employment legislation.  We also see a growth in the need for care workers across the EU and we must tackle it here.  We will need more workers in the future and we want a system that can accommodate this.<br/>We want the conditions for exploitation in the work permit system wiped out and loopholes closed off.  Our submission speaks to those issues.  My colleague, Mr. Chowdhury, will talk about the right to change employer and the undocumented worker scheme, or what will be known in the Bill as the reactivation scheme.</p></speech>

I came to Ireland in 2002 as a work permit holder.  I have worked as a worker leader with MRCI for many years and have been involved in many campaigns to improve our work permit system and promote decent work conditions.  We welcome the undocumented workers' scheme - the reactivation scheme - in section 6 of the Bill.  This scheme will help people who have lost their permits through no fault of their own due to exploitation, as they can apply for the new permit without the normal conditions.</p><p>  Since 2006 we have been working with the Department to improve the work permit system.  In 2014 we are very pleased that, finally, it will be enacted in law.  There will still be some risks in the work permit system, as workers will be very much tied to their employers.  A worker may work only for the employer named on the work permit and his or her immigration status is fully dependent on his or her staying in the job.  It means the employee seems to be a prisoner for one year.  A worker may change employer when he or she has worked for at least one year with the same employer and has secured a new work permit. If I lose my job as a chef, I also lose my legal status in the country.  That means the employer controls my legal status.  It is very bad for work permit holders.  Their immigration status should be out of the hands of their employers.</p> <p>If I want to get a better paid job and change employer, I can do so if I apply and pay again after one year.  I can get the new work permit but in one year it is hard to save &euro;1,000 for the work permit fee.  To make our system better, we should allow workers to work for different employers within the job sector they have been approved for.  Workers would be obliged to notify the Department of the change in their place of work.  This is a critical issue, which we have consistently raised with the Department and it needs to be addressed in the Bill.  We have proposed some small changes in our submission that would make this happen.</p><p> I thank members for listening and we will take questions.</p></speech>

I came to Ireland in 2003 on a work permit to work as a tandoori chef for Poppadom restaurant.  For the first few years, I was paid 55 cent an hour.  I worked 77 hours a week and got no day off except Christmas Day.  I did not know many people as I stayed with my employer for most of the time.  My employer failed to renew my work permit and I was left undocumented in the country.  I got help from a fellow restaurant worker who brought me to MRCI and the centre brought my case with me to the Labour Court and I won an award of &euro;92,000.  I have never received a penny from this money owed to me for my work.  My employer took the Labour Court to the High Court and said he did not have to pay me because the contract of employment could not be recognised as I was undocumented.  The High Court upheld this but asked the Government to look at the loophole in the law.  I am appealing this decision to the Supreme Court now.<br />I met with Minister Bruton and he promised me that he would address this problem so no other workers would have to suffer like I did.  I thank him for his stated commitment.  I am glad that at least my case exposed this gap and that this Bill will allow some undocumented workers to seek compensation orders for unpaid wages from the court.  My fear is this does not go far enough.  The Bill must ensure that all exploited undocumented workers can access the court.  This is the only way we will make sure no one else is treated like I was.  I urge you to consider strengthening the proposal in the Bill to include all workers subjected to exploitation.  Thank you.</blockquote>I have worked with Mr. Younis as a translator and the MRCI.  I have felt his feeling and the trauma he went through is unexplainable.  There are spaces that can be filled to make our society better because at the end of the day this is my home and my country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014061000013#M00500"><p>In the current format our employment permit system has a list of categories which are not eligible for employment permits.  Many of those categories represent essential skills, particularly around restaurant work, care work, work in private homes, certain positions in the retail and agriculture sectors, etc.  There are generally the sectors in which workers are more vulnerable.  They are not regulated and migrant workers are more concentrated in them.</p><p>  In the current format of the Bill, there is a provision for the job categories to be looked at and reviewed in respect of labour growth outcomes and prospects for the market.  Unfortunately, current projections we have on how the work permit system will recruit foreign workers is solely focused on highly skilled work.  The reality is that there is an increased shortage of labour in essential skills sectors.  The lack of supply of workers for those sectors ends up with systems of exploitation such as the au pair system we described earlier.  We have been researching a little more how the international student system is being used as a source of cheap labour.  Members will be very much aware of the crisis in international language schools.  Essential skills vacancies are being filled by people who do not have legal status as workers, as they are students or come under other immigration categories.  To afford workers the greatest rights, we need to re-examine the ineligible job categories and allow people to come to work in Ireland through a pathway that allows permanency and rights.</p></speech>

MRCI is an excellent organisation, with which we have worked closely in the past.  I particularly welcome Mr. Younis who has given a great deal of hope to many people.  I look forward to working with Ms O'Toole and her team to try to support most of the proposed amendments, in particular those that seeks to prevent exploitation in the workplace.</p></speech>

I commend the MRCI's work and I extend a special welcome to Mr. Younis.  It is shocking to think that the law colludes in the exploitation he detailed and I am sure his case is not the only one.  Many others are experiencing exploitation.  Does the MRCI have an estimate of the level of migrant exploitation in the State?  How many au pairs are being exploited?  I read the centre's proposals regarding au pairs.  A large proportion of that workforce has little or no support, protection or guarantee in employment.  I commend the centre on the work it has done but I would like to get a handle on the size of the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Toole" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014061000013#M00800"><p>I thank Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for his comments and Deputy Calleary for his support as well.  When the Younis case happened and exposed the loophole, we had a number of cases of exploitation.  We are dealing with 30 at the moment where workers cannot go forward to the Labour Court to reclaim their wages but we have been in contact with solicitors around the country and we estimate at least 60 cases are problematic.  With regard to the overall extent of exploitation, we know, for example, that there are difficulties in the au pair sector.  We estimate 25,000 au pairs are placed every year in Ireland.  We looked at this over the past year and analysed it because there is no such thing as an au pair in the way we understood it in the past.  Society has changed and migration is a reality.  Everybody should come under the protection of our employment law and people need to be aware that if they employ someone in their private home, they have to uphold employment rights and standards.  There is no cheap option.  We recognise the situation that has occurred is linked to a lack of affordable child care and pressure on families.</p> <p>We are calling on NERA and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to develop a proactive programme to inform employers and the public that they need to address these issues.  Work also needs to be done with au pairs to inform them of their rights.  We want the National Employment Rights Authority to take a lead on this and to do more.  We would like an explicit statement from the Department to dispel any myths about au pairs being some kind of sub-category of worker.  The reality is that if one has someone employed in one's home they are an employee, and there is no way around that.</p><p> We map the extent of exploitation.  Au pairs are a big issue.  We are taking in cases all the time.  We have a relationship with the National Employment Rights Authority, which takes referrals from us.  We have seen about 20 cases this year, but we know from contact with NERA and the number of inquiries we are getting that the level of exploitation is high.  We also have social media contacts with more than 600 au pairs, who report problems to us.  However, we have very few resources to do this kind of work.  As everyone can appreciate, our resources have been cut to a minimum, so our capacity to outreach is limited.  That is why we hope that NERA and the Department will take up the mantle, inform the public and help au pairs secure their rights.</p><p> As we know, the restaurant work sector is usually problematic.  That is ongoing; we are seeing cases coming through our centre all the time.  There is no evidence yet to suggest that the problems have decreased in any way.  Car washes, too, are becoming problematic in certain areas.  Care is also a big issue because it is growth area.  We anticipate that it will be a problematic area unless we review the categories and look at how people can recruit legally where there is a demand in the economy.  We believe that domestic work will be an ongoing issue because of the unaffordable child care system.  Rather than running away from it and saying that we should make domestic work ineligible because there are areas of exploitation of vulnerable workers, we need to face it, because more people are looking for care in their homes, both older and adult care and child care.  It is a reality that we will have to face in a strategic and planned-out way.</p></speech>

I come across a number of people who are looking for work permits for people in the categories that have been mentioned.  Can the witnesses identify categories for which we might make a case to the Minister to have them included in the legislation?  Rather than speaking generally, can the witnesses identify specific categories?  I know that the linen trade is starting to develop again, and this involves skills that have been lost.  Perhaps people could be used as trainers rather than as specific workers.</p></speech>

There are other areas such as horse riding and agriculture, but if one was to focus on the two main sectors of employment, it would be those two.</p></speech>

Like others, I express support for Mr. Younis's plight.  That sort of discrimination should not happen to anybody; it is disgraceful.

We met the Minister and he gave a commitment to address the case involving Mohammed Younis.  We know that the intention of the Bill is to address such cases, but we would like to see it strengthened to tackle exploitation, which we believe is at the root of the problem.  We have met the Department on a number of occasions and commend the civil servants on using a different approach.  They asked us to make a submission early on, and then we went for meetings with them to discuss it.  They used a problem-solving approach.  We did not achieve a lot of things.  Initially, we would have wanted to uphold the integrity of the Labour Court system so that it could take cases from all workers, but it seemed unable to deal with the contract issue.  That is why they have taken the Younis case outside the Labour Court system and put it into the civil courts.  We welcome that as long as workers can access it.  We do not want a provision whereby people would find it difficult to prove their circumstances.  We want exploitation to be a criterion for accessing one's rights.  The officials were not interested in looking in a more long-term way at the categories that we have discussed - I suppose that their priority was the Bill - but we urged them to look at the ineligible categories in the lead-up to the Bill, given the type of information that we were feeding to them.  We believe that a review should be conducted with the appropriate bodies, allowing us to present our information and statistics and say what we are seeing.</p></speech>

Issues around illegality of contracts arise across Europe.  The proposed legislation has the power to be far-reaching, particularly if an amendment is made to it to include every worker who has been a victim of labour exploitation.</p><p>  On how the work permit system could allow for more flexibility, there are other models inside and outside Europe.  Within Europe, we would generally look at the Swedish work permit system and how it has recently opened up as opposed to closing down.  There are other types of labour migration system, such as that in New Zealand, which is a points-based, and that in Canada, which used to be very good but has slowly been closing down.  It depends on the issue that one wants to address.  In terms of labour exploitation, there is not one particular country that one can look at as a model, but there are lessons to be learnt from other bodies.  When a state does not have a solution, there are international organisations, international trade unions and other community organisations that have proposed models that might not have been implemented but could be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to have an input into the draft Bill of dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA.  While we welcome the opportunity today, this is a sad day for us because we have all served on the council of the DDDA for the past 17 years.  The model we operated through the masterplan was ground-breaking and represented a complete, new, fresh way of achieving regeneration, both social and economic.  The time in question was the first in the history of this State that local community involvement in decision-making affecting local communities was facilitated.  The successes in education, training, investment in community infrastructure, social and affordable housing, and employment were achieved through this model and through co-operation by all stakeholders with the common goal regenerating the docklands.  This brand-new approach set a standard for the future for integration and ownership.</p><p>  In our submission to the committee, I covered the dark times of depopulation, downgrading and neglect of our dockland communities.  The vision to regenerate the docklands gave new life and hope to those living there.  Education for young people and housing to enable them to remain in the communities in which they grew up strengthened our communities and gave people a sense of pride in being docklanders.  Expectations were raised, and staying on in school became the norm.  This acted as a gateway to gaining access to high-end jobs for our young people.  It is important that the successes not be forgotten and that the baby not be thrown out with the bath water.</p><p>  The proposed new entity has to be guided by what worked well over the past 17 years.  If we allow the planning to be developer driven without having regard to the overall docklands area, it will not continue to be a sustainable neighbourhood for everyone living and working there and in terms of the future planning in the area.  It would bring us back to the past when social exclusion was rampant.  The local communities want to see the remaining areas of the docklands built out.  However, we are very proud of what has been achieved over the past 17 years since the inception of the DDDA.  The docklands are too important not to get it right.  We need to work at getting it right through proper consultation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seanie Lambe" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014061000004#E00400"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  We have made a submission in writing.  In the short time available to me, I will address a couple of specific items.  These concern the two trust companies that were set up by the Docklands Development Authority with the local community.  One was the Docklands Housing Trust and the other was the Docklands Community Trust.  Both are charitable trusts and were negotiated with the Revenue Commissioners and the Companies Registration Office.</p><p>  The purpose of the trusts was established through discussions and investigations by the docklands community of other areas.  We negotiated the 20% social housing clause in the docklands master plan, and we were the first in the country to have such a clause.  As the Acting Chairman is probably aware, it became public policy under the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was subsequently amended in 2002.  The reason we did this is that we learned from colleagues in the London Docklands Development Corporation in the East End that one of the major problems they identified was that young people in that area could no longer afford to live where they were born and reared.  What we wanted to do was protect the future of the indigenous local community.  That is why we pursued the 20% social housing idea.  We assumed, perhaps na&iuml;vely, that the units would be put into the control of Dublin City Council.  They were but then the city council handed them over to social housing agencies.  I would like to make it clear that we do not have a problem with social housing agencies, as such, but believe they have policies that differ from those of the council.  Certainly, their vision is different from that of the community representatives in the DDDA.  For instance, some agencies sell the properties to their tenants.  Our review of this was that if the properties were sold to the tenants, within one generation the 20% would be back on the market, resulting in no long-term gain.  To prevent this, we asked that the properties be put into a housing trust.  That was agreed although many of the houses had already been distributed.  It was eventually agreed, in the early part of this century, to set up a trust and put the next set of properties to become available into it.  The trust owns 72 properties.  Our only purpose in owning them is to ensure they remain available to the people on the waiting list of the city council, and that the people who live in them will receive an appropriate service from the managing agent, in this case the housing association.</p><p>  The second trust, the Docklands Community Trust, was an attempt to perpetuate the benefits and gains that had been negotiated throughout the various master plans after the end of the master plan.  The model also came from London, in this case from the Royal Docks Trust.  When the London Docklands Development Corporation came to an end, the remaining money was put into a trust fund for the local community.  We had no guarantee that any such money would be left in our circumstances so we wanted to build up a fund to allow us to continue the work that had been funded previously by the authority.  We had a target of between &euro;5 million and &euro;8 million for the fund but, by the time the economy collapsed and the authority went into serious decline, we had got &euro;1.32 million.</p><p>  Both trusts have a similar design, with three nominees from the DDDA, three from the community sector associated with the authority and one from the city council.  We used the interest on the &euro;1.32 million to support educational initiatives to help young people entering third level courses or post-leaving certificate courses.  We provide the service at no cost because we do so by distributing &euro;20,000 each to the local employment services in Pearse Street and Amiens Street.</p> <p>Therefore, there is no cost involved to the taxpayer in distributing the money.  As regards the model in the memorandum and articles of association, the kind of skills we sought for people on the trust were educational or community experience, finance and investment, accounting, business and management, law, governance, social and economic development, or heritage and culture.  We have been careful about the construction of the boards of trusts.  We are happy with how they are working, notwithstanding the fact that by definition their impact is limited.</p><p> We fear that under the proposed dissolution Bill the handing over of control of those trusts - and the nominating rights of the Docklands Authority on those trusts - to the city council effectively means that the city council will be deciding on four of the seven members of the board.  One may think that will make no difference, but the reality is that if the city council controls the Docklands Housing Trust there will be great pressure on the board to pursue city council policy, which is to sell the units to the people living in them.  That would defeat the purpose of the 20% social housing provision and the initial establishment of the trust. </p><p> Exactly the same arrangement applies on the community trust.  We are faced with that threat.  There are possibilities within the memorandum and articles of both trusts to make different arrangements, but as we see under heading 8 in section 2 of the Bill, all rights and responsibilities would be handed over to the city council.  That is a matter of serious concern for us.  </p><p> We have raised these issues with the existing executive board and we hope to have further discussions with them.  If we are to take what is currently in the Bill heads, however, the situation would then be completely untenable.</p></speech>

Legislation is currently going through the House on the sale of local authority properties and voluntary properties.  Voluntary housing has not, as yet, come on to the market.

To be honest, I am not familiar with what is going through the House.  Obviously we will have to look at it.

There has been quite a lobby for voluntary housing.  Up to now, voluntary housing has not been covered by the sale of city council houses.

The regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area called for an increase in the overall density of development, which will lead to a more compact urban form.  By necessity, this leads to many more people living within the city without the amenity of a private garden or access to any green space of their own.  We can see that happening already, with thousands of people living in apartment blocks.  </p><p>  If we accept that there is a need for a more urbanised lifestyle in the future, then this urban lifestyle has to be more attractive in order for people to buy into it.  We feel that amenities such as community gardens contribute greatly to the urban quality of life within Dublin.</p><p>  There is already a policy within the Dublin city plan, namely GC16, which exists to support the provision of community gardens, allotments, local markets and pocket parks.  These are green spaces for people who live in the city.  As the current Bill calls for the cessation of a master plan from the 1997 Act, we highlight the importance of having an appropriate replacement.  We recommend that Dublin City Council's own city plan be used for guidance for appropriate future developments within the docklands.</p><p>  Urban growing by voluntary groups is expanding within Dublin.  I rewrote this Dublin guide to community gardening in October 2013 and 46 garden projects approached me for a free listing.  This compares to only two community gardens a decade ago.  There are now at least 46.  This is something that is growing in Dublin and it is something the people who live there want.  In essence, we are talking about urban agriculture being used to rethink Dublin's public open spaces and, in doing so, improving Dublin visibly and strengthening its social capital as well.  The silver lining of the recession has been the many community improvement initiatives carried out at grassroots level right across Dublin and not just in the docklands area.  Such initiatives have often been undertaken by people who have been made redundant, but who have skills and time on their hands.  They have used that time, knowledge and skill to improve their own environment.  They have done this without any direct strategic support.  Due to the hard work of many groups and individuals, we have now seen the creation of around 40 community garden projects across Dublin in the last ten years.  These are delivering environmental improvements and biodiversity enhancement within the city for us all.  They support resource-use management and the reduction of resource use, as well as improving and enhancing our communities and developing social capital.  This is a kind of soft infrastructure that is too often missing from planning considerations, probably because it is hard to commoditise community development.  It is hard to put a price on it.  On a modest scale, we are here to represent to the joint committee the intelligent use of two of Dublin's greatest assets: unused land and unused labour.  Future developments within the docklands must allow residents to interact with their environment through horticulture.  This should not be the exclusive preserve of those who are rich enough to own their own private gardens.</p></speech>

I am a member of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority council and, with five others, I represent all the communities in the docklands area.  I was born and reared in the docklands.</p><p>  On behalf of the numerous community organisations, groups, residents' associations and the entire docklands area, which we represent, we wish to make the following statement.  At present, the community liaison committee consists of six community people appointed by the Minister as members of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority council under section 16 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997.</p> <p>Since its establishment in 1997, the DDDA has driven the social regeneration of the docklands community as a key part of its mission.  The representatives of the docklands communities on the council have ensured that the opinions, needs and welfare of the local community were always kept top of the docklands authority's agenda and enshrined in DDDA policy.  The communities are determined to have this agenda maintained in any new entity which will emerge.  The communities are particularly concerned about heads 5 and 6 of the Bill.  Head 5 may not exclude any role of other State agencies, but it excludes full participation by the docklands community by diluting the powers and influence of their representatives.  Head 6 provides for the establishment of a committee which will be known as the docklands consultative forum, the powers of which will be limited to assisting Dublin City Council in discharging its function under head 5.  That is all we know about it at this stage.</p><p> The success of the physical and social regeneration of the docklands thus far has been hailed worldwide as a successful and ingenious regeneration programme by many academic reviews.  The DDDA Act 1997 provided for a general duty for the authority to secure the social and economic regeneration of the Dublin docklands area on a sustainable basis and to promote, particularly as regards persons residing in the area, the provision of education and training opportunities and the development of a wide range of employment.  It required the authority to promote the development of existing and new residential communities in the area, including the development of a mix of housing for people of different social backgrounds.  The above functions and ground-making policies are not provided for in the proposed legislation.  Such policies are not specifically enshrined in the city development plan either.  The draft Bill will not allow for the communities to influence the policies and strategies which contribute to the sustainability of the docklands.</p><p> The direct input of community representatives on the DDDA council over the past 16 years ensured that the community agenda was keep to the fore.  This included the establishment of the social regeneration programme, which embraced the entire community with a customised range of programmes, including community development, social infrastructure, housing, employment and education.  Consideration should be given to allowing a similar system to form part of any new entity.  The proposals in the Bill would lead to marginalised communities in the docklands feeling further disenfranchised.  As a consequence, the docklands may become a less than pleasant place to do business, invest and live.</p><p> Over a year ago, Dublin City Council requested the DDDA council to prepare a report setting out views on the issues that are still relevant from the 2008 DDDA master plan and other issues that are relevant to any other planning framework in the docklands.  The DDDA council's overall recommendations included a standalone planning strategy to be devised and adopted for the entire Dublin docklands area irrespective of the individual planning mechanisms adopted for particular local areas within the overall docklands area; an integrated planning strategy to be employed throughout the area; social and community facilities, particularly education facilities, to be provided in advance of and in tandem with residential development; a formal mechanism to be devised to deliver community gain from private development in the area; a database to be maintained for the docklands area comprising statistical and other data for the area to allow effective monitoring of docklands social and economic indicators; and national funding to support the delivery of infrastructure and facilities, including community facilities, in the area.  The council further recommended that provision for the continuing development and enhancement of existing areas and institutions which have been developed to date in the docklands be included in any future planning strategy.</p><p> A standalone planning strategy for the entire docklands area is considered necessary to ensure the docklands vision is achieved and the docklands legacy is continued.  Such a strategy would provide a framework for other planning mechanisms such as the strategic development zone planning schemes and local area plans.  The content of the planning strategy would reflect the 2008 docklands master plan.  None of the above-mentioned recommendations appear to be transposed to the powers of the new entity.</p><p> Under head 17 of the Bill, the docklands master plan would cease to exist, as would the policies therein.  This is of particular concern to the community representatives.  The master plan encompassed a specific area north and south of the Liffey and its immediate hinterland.  The boundaries were clearly defined and stretched to 520 ha.  It was seen as an innovative space where all aspects of sustainable development were undertaken.  Many pilot programmes were put in place on an experimental basis within the docklands.  As Mr. Seanie Lambe has already pointed out, a requirement for 20% social housing was introduced in 1999, which led to the inclusion of Part V in the Planning and Development Act 2000.  A local labour clause was first introduced in docklands.  While that can be done in other areas, we cannot now have it in a future docklands plan.  Many new community, educational, and training initiatives were undertaken in the area.  The proposed docklands dissolution Bill does not allow for the continuation of any of these programmes.  The existing boundaries of the docklands must be maintained along with the social regeneration policies and the community representatives so that the work undertaken to date can be continued, reviewed and quantified on a continuous basis.</p><p> The regeneration of Dublin's docklands was effective as a result of real participation and co-operation by the community representatives nominated to represent their communities on the council.  Those of us who served on the council feel strongly that continuity will be the key to maintaining the momentum to consolidate the ongoing regeneration of the Dublin docklands neighbourhood.  While it is acknowledged widely that the model of regeneration of the Dublin docklands was ground-breaking and many positive benefits have been achieved, there remain deep-seated structural problems within communities which need to be continually addressed.  The ground-breaking model which framed the social regeneration of the docklands must be continued in any future entity.  The proposed Bill does not allow for this.  We ask the committee to consider this in their recommendations.</p><p> My opening statement has been made on behalf of the members of the DDDA council.</p></speech>

Before I open the meeting to questions from other members, I note that although the things that went wrong within the Dublin Docklands Development Authority are often pointed out, its successes are not mentioned often enough.  Ms Corr and Mr. Lambe covered some of those successes in their submissions.  Certainly, the community came up to the required 20% proportion of social and affordable housing.  While that did not achieve the successes the community wanted, it set out a template that could be followed elsewhere.  That should be recognised.  The local labour clause was also mentioned.</p><p>  The one thing that has always impressed me is the success achieved by local schools in keeping young people until the leaving certificate.  There was a dramatic change in the figures in the schools I know, where fewer than 50% of pupils had previously attended up to leaving certificate level, whereas this year 92% sat the exam.  That is one of the successes of the engagement of the local community and the docklands authority.  We could speak at length of the failures and disappointments, but we forget too often to mention all the successes.  I know many families living in social housing who would not have been living there without the 20% social and affordable clause.  It was a greater success on the south side than on the north side.  That should be acknowledged also.  The template is there to be used again and developed in the current housing crisis.</p></speech>

I agree with the Acting Chairman that we do not often hear about the good things.  The witnesses have brought all good with them.  The bad things that happened were not related to the community.  That should be said.</p><p>  I listened very carefully to all the presentations and note that what is there in terms of community and educational development must continue.  A way must be found to facilitate that.  Integration of community programmes with local authorities is happening all over the country.  When we discuss the Bill, we must ensure representation.  While I do not know how it will work out, it cannot be the case that there is no community representation.  Too much has been invested in it.</p> <p>Community development, as a whole, has to be part of everything.  It cannot be developer-led but has to come from the ground up.  As was said, the county development plan should be used as a blueprint.  I accept land is valuable in the city but every city in Europe has found ways and means of developing community spaces such as gardens and playgrounds that are integrated and overlooked.</p><p> There is no point in throwing the baby out with the bathwater as there is much to be learned with both the good and the bad.  I do not believe anyone wants the docklands development authority structure to continue as it was.  However, we have to take the best from it and ensure that is not lost.  There also needs to be proper integrated consultation in this, which is occurring in every community with every development plan.  It is important a methodology has been laid down in this regard, as it cannot be done on a wing and a prayer.</p></speech>

I do not live in the docklands but I work on the edge of them as I run the Abbey Theatre.</p><p>  Heads 5 and 6 deal with the consultation process and community involvement.  The delegations are concerned that the in-depth and integral community involvement in housing and education might be dissipated when the forum and the housing and community trusts move over to Dublin City Council.  We need to include that in our recommendations to the Minister.</p><p>  If they have a concern that Dublin City Council might have a weighted majority with the nomination of members to the consultative forum and trusts, do the delegations have any suggestions for other nominating bodies to balance that?</p><p>  Can all the groups give a quick snapshot of whether the local community is thriving or not?  Is morale high?  Social regeneration is a term used often and there are success stories in this but also some not so successful cases, particularly on the north side.  What are the key headline anxieties that the local community might have which could inform us in our deliberations of the draft Bill?</p></speech>

We do not want to pre-empt what view might be taken with those suggestions but the proposal in the heads of the Bill is quite disturbing to us.  We would like to see the continuation of the existing boards and that we could change the memorandum and articles of association to allow for them to be self-perpetuating charities with the same limitations, restrictions and oversight as exists now.  The memorandum and articles are robust enough to prevent anyone making money out of the process, as there are no attendance fees or expenses covered.  The only outgoings in the trusts are the administrative costs which are required by law to be audited annually.  Up to now, those costs were paid by the authority.  Over the past 12 months, those from Dublin City Council on the authority have been baulking at those kinds of expenses.  We need to examine other ways of dealing with this.  We are very happy with the way it is run now and view the Bill&rsquo;s proposals for the trusts to be somewhat disastrous.</p><p>  Our communities are mixed.  Everyone is struggling but those lucky enough to be working are doing better than those who are not.  After the substantial educational investment of the authority, we saw a rise not just in leaving certificate completion but in third level attendance from 1% to 10%.  From 1999 to 2006, the rate of young people completing the leaving certificate went up from 10% to 63%, just fractionally under the national average.  These were great achievements.  The last thing in the world we want to do now is lose out on that and reverse those successes.  As these figures are from 2006, we have asked the executive to see if these rates have fallen back over the subsequent years.  We believe we have changed the aspiration in the community.  For the first time in my lifetime, people in disadvantaged areas realise the way out of poverty is through education and it is important to keep young people in school for as long as possible.</p></speech>

That was a tough 40 years.  We say we are an overnight success after 40 years.  We cover all aspects of community needs from the cradle to the grave.  We came from a very dark place.  The organisation was set up to address the demise of industry and jobs in traditional sectors in the area along with low educational attainment.  Those involved in the organisation had a passion to keep the community alive and to keep people ticking over until the inception of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA.</p> <p>It just brought us all to life.  That continues despite cutbacks in funding.  The passion keeps us going.  We will continue to fight whatever comes our way and ensure that the needs of communities are recognised and addressed financially.  The problem with the SDZ is that there is no mention of any funding being available for community needs.  I think Senator Keane said we need to find other ways of funding.  Well, we need to find them, and the availability of funding is one of the things we feel very strongly about, because other than that it is aspirational. </p></speech>

That is a major worry for us because economic growth will happen but we are fearful that the social infrastructure and social needs will be lost.  As Ms Ashe noted with regard to St. Andrew's Resource Centre, we have lost so much in funding over the past couple of years and now we are expected to supply more services because of the downturn.  There is no way we will be funded through anything we have seen in the heads of the Bill.  There is nothing that has jumped out at any of us and told us we will be happy with what is happening there.</p></speech>

As someone who was born and lives in the docklands, I am very aware of relationships there.  It must be acknowledged that there have been very fractious relationships between communities and the DDDA over the years, and these issues have not all been resolved satisfactorily for some of those communities, so there is still a lot of work to be done on that aspect.  The south side learned from the north side, which was the pioneer, had all of the difficulties and did all the learning for the entire docklands area.  The south side benefited from the mistakes and difficulties on the north side.  The community voice, community work and, in particular, the voluntary effort must be acknowledged.</p><p>  When I hear the term "developer-led", the alarm bells go off.  There is no doubt about that.  I was disappointed that we were back to that, from what we are hearing now about the SDZ.  We are not learning the lessons from the past.  These were lessons that were hard won by the communities and we are going back to them.  It will be developer-led and driven, profit margins will be the god and communities will get lost in that.  There is a real fear that this could happen.</p><p>  The main issues are the loss of policies from the master plan and the amount of work that went into the master plan when now it can just be gone almost in a flash.  The legacy issues of community gain, housing and the trusts are still major issues.  I must come to a question or conclusion.  How well were communities listened to in this consultation process, the conferences and the workshops that took place?  Those issues can go forward with a very strong voice from this committee in the D&aacute;il so that the issues that did not get a proper hearing or resolution can be dealt with and we can see a very progressive Bill going through.  I do not think it is that progressive, because of the criticisms the witnesses made today.  It is vital that this committee be a strong voice for those outstanding issues.</p></speech>

We should be part and parcel of decision making, which is reflected in our submission.  The Acting Chairman said that housing was much better on the south side than on the north side.  I am making an argument about why there should be continued community involvement by representatives, particularly at decision-making level.  We have all accepted, by and large, that the good parts of the docklands are excellent, but one has only to look at the dereliction in the North Lotts area, which has never had direct local representation.  As I say to many people, not a child's swing is found in the area and not a brick was laid for the community.  That could continue, and we could be told by Dublin City Council that we will probably meet four times a year and be told what it will do for us.  The North Lotts area is the classic example.  We do not want to go there again.  Areas must have direct involvement and decision making to say what is wrong and what the people want.</p></speech>

The Bill is a standalone piece of legislation.  Its aims are to ensure continued local community and business development in the docklands regeneration through the Docklands Consultative Forum.  Obviously, we cannot lose all of this history and the intelligence created over the years.  It is there and is written down.  I want to put on the record that one of the main aims and objectives of the Bill is to ensure continued local community and business sector involvement in the docklands regeneration because, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, it is sad that it is going to be developer-led.  Every council in Ireland, including Dublin City Council, has changed from the bad old days.  I sat on South Dublin County Council for 20 years.  Development plans are now different.  I can go back as far as 1991 and 1992 when they were developer-led.  This is why I am saying it is important to include the community from the ground up.  That is what this is about, and we are here to ensure it does happen.</p></speech>

We had a set of policies written in the master plan that went back to 1997 and were reviewed every five years.  This was our bible.  We had guidelines.  Under our remit from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, we review the master plan every five years.  We are now back on the docklands for over two years and we have not been given the facilities to review that master plan.  Therefore, we are going into another plan without being able to review the past.  One cannot move forward unless one looks at what has been achieved and decides whether or not one wishes to bring it on or leave it.  We are going to go into what is in the city development plan, whether it is a subsection or not.  The city development plan deals with planning.  It does not deal with community development.  It has community development sections, but what we had was a holistic approach to everything we are doing in the docklands, where we did not have a "them and us" approach.  There are people who can afford to buy in the docklands, such as investors, and those who can afford high rents.  However, there are pockets of the indigenous community who have never had a traditional education beyond the age of 12 or 13.  We are trying to work with these people, because they are our communities, and bring them along.  That will all be gone.  It will be thrown out and we will end up with pockets of deprivation amid wealth.  In order to look at what we have achieved and see where we can bring it forward, we must review the master plan and use that as our base point.</p></speech>

The number of such communities is massive compared to the traditional communities.  We must keep an eye on that so that we can have space for families and the traditional type of housing and it is not all high-rise.</p> <p>The DDDA would love to have 20-storey buildings all over the docklands area.</p></speech>

It gives access to a site for 11 months, after which it must be vacated by all the gardeners for a month.  That hiatus means there is not continuous occupation of the site.  This protects the land owner, usually the local authority, in this case Dublin City Council, from any claims of ownership from a third party who has been making interim use of the site.  From a legal point of view there is a lease framework that can be used, called a conacre agreement.</p><p>  There will always be emotion when a site has been used as a community garden, has been of great value and has provided a community resource for five or ten years when the owner wants to develop it.  That is not an excuse for us to be in a situation in which we are locked out of our own house because we cannot do anything with the vacant sites in Dublin for fear of planning blight, which has been the case for the past ten years.  There are vacant sites, some in NAMA administration and some not, that nobody is allowed to touch for ten or 20 years because there is a wish to develop them further down the line.  It is absurd.  While there will always be arguments for doing nothing, it is not a responsible way forward.</p></speech>

That is the obvious place to put it.  We already have the structure in place.  The trust does not spend its capital.  That was the model we saw in the Royal Docks Trust, London.  We spend only the income from interest.  Because interest rates are so low, we have recently had to invest.  The more capital we have, the more we can earn.  Because we only spend the interest, the capital will never be touched.  While the Docklands Community Trust's brief is very broad, education is the main area.  The memorandum and articles of association are very clear that it is a charity designed for charitable purposes in all sorts of areas, and it is left to the board to decide how to spend the money.</p></speech>

I have lived in the docklands all my life and there has always been an emphasis in the communities, rather than on the part of community representatives, on trying to secure short-term construction jobs, which I always questioned.  We had some successes through the business forum of the DDDA.  Should there be a greater emphasis on the social clause in the new business under the legislation?  This would tie the education and employment clauses to addressing long-term employment.</p></speech>

Having experienced it and studied it over the past few years, the only hope we ever had of getting the 20% local labour was if it was tied to the planning permission.  What we found early in its application is that builders were able to bid more cheaply to developers and go in with lower tenders on the basis that under the Lisbon treaty they could employ people from Lithuania, Turkey and elsewhere and bring them here to work at wage rates that were operative in those countries.  It enabled them to make lower bids and it was difficult for us to negotiate the 20% local labour clause with them.</p><p>  That was only in the building phase.  The jobs at the end of the projects are more important.  Even very few of the jobs that do not require a high level of education such as security, cleaning and so on go to local people these days.  They are not advertised through the local employment service and it is hard to see them, although someone in the paper connected with the American chamber of commerce mentioned that for every ten jobs created in the IT sector, seven subsidiary jobs are created locally.  That might well be true but they are not going to our people and that is very obvious.</p></speech>

We have had a schools placement programme in the docklands, which was a good programme for young people leaving school after their leaving certificate to go into high-tech jobs in financial services.  Most of them stayed in the programme for a year and the majority of them continued onto full-time jobs.  That is one way of getting some of our people into newer companies.  There are many young people in our area who are in financial services due to that programme.  That is an area we should look at.</p></speech>

The Acting Chairman said construction can provide short-term jobs.  If the 20% social clause was tied to planning permission, as Mr. Lambe said, while the jobs might be short-term for the apprenticeship part of their career, at least the young people learn their trade and they are accommodated for the rest of their lives.</p></speech>

One of the things we found when the DDDA fell and everything happened was that firms continued to say that the authority was providing community gain.  The community gain it generally meant was a Christmas party or something like that.  A clear structure is needed for the firms coming in whether they are small local businesses or multinationals.  They need to know what are the policies and expectations when they come into the area.  Internationally, companies are generally handed a handbook welcoming them to the area, for example, the Sydney docklands in Australia, and the levies, plans and what they have to do are outlined.  It is not about providing a Christmas party for the local old people.  This emerged during the planning hearings clearly and it was in the planner's report.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not publish its commentary on each decision but the planner's report clearly said those issues were <i>ultra vires</i>in respect of the planning Acts.  It can only comment on the things written into the Act in the SDZs and there will be multiple SDZs.  Unless there is a clear structure, all the issues we are talking about will fall between stools.</p></speech>

There are a number of legacy issues.  For example, there is a complicated clawback relating to affordable housing involving the DDDA, especially in the later schemes.  Would the community like that to be addressed in the legislation?</p></speech>

Like Mr. Lambe said regarding social housing, we wanted to keep the people buying affordable housing within the docklands area.  We did not want people to make big profits on the housing but, as the downturn arrived, that did not happen.  People have been left in serious situations.  Some families have broken up and they need debt forgiveness.  That is an issue that we need to look at and get closure on as to where we should go.   We need leadership on it because we have been bringing this up time after time.  Every time we have had a council meeting, I have raised it.  No solutions are being given to us.  We are told it is legal and I do not know whether legislation can help us in this regard.  However, we need to address it.</p></speech>

Size and sustainability are issues.  Is the housing trust an adequate size for it to be sustainable if sinking funds, etc., are included in the Bill?  Sometimes a certain number of units is necessary to make a housing trust sustainable.  Is the housing trust large enough to bear the costs?</p></speech>

A management company was initially appointed by DCC with which we were happy to work.  We have a good relationship with its representatives and we are happy with the level of service that they are giving the people.  We are happy, therefore, to leave the situation as is.</p><p>  We do not have any great ambition to be the owners of huge numbers of properties but we want to protect as many of the properties as we can in order that they are accessible through DCC's housing waiting list.  There are other issues about housing management agents, which are problematic.</p> <p>I know that the Acting Chairman is very familiar with the points system of housing allocation used by Dublin City Council.  The housing associations have introduced another element, which is an interview system.  That is a two-sided coin.  Of course, everybody wants to be sure that only people who are going to look after the properties get into them, but if one automatically excludes people with any kind of problem or difficulty, one needs another way of addressing their needs.  In the last docklands masterplan, we introduced the idea, well known and well practised within the city, of supported housing, which has been operated by Focus and other agencies, where people with difficulties can be supported through a process of learning how to budget and to look after children, etc.  It is high-cost, but it is one way in which such needs could be approached.</p><p> On the viability of the trust in having 72 units, we are not looking for profits.</p></speech>

In the voluntary housing sector, one needs momentum and a certain number of units for sustainability.  Some of the smaller voluntary housing agencies, especially in rural Ireland, that set up with 50, 60 or 70 units, ran into serious financial trouble because they needed to spread their costs over a large number of units and structures which, as Mr Lambe will know, involve costs being picked up.  The trust's properties are all apartments, but the obvious issue in the cities is the sinking funds.  Those difficulties may not need to be addressed in this Bill, but there may be a need to enlarge the trust to make sure that it is financially sustainable.</p></speech>

We have ownership of all the sinking funds.  They go directly from the city council to the housing agency.  As the owners of the properties, we have a responsibility to make sure that those are run properly, but we do not have worries about them in the sense that that particular housing agency has a large number of properties and would not be left in that situation.  It has a large number of properties across Docklands and in other parts of the city.</p></speech>

On 4 March the Government approved the general scheme of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill.  I expect drafting of the Bill to get under way shortly.  The Bill is a stand-alone piece of legislation which aims to provide the necessary legal arrangements for all aspects of the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA; to ensure continued local community and business sector involvement in docklands regeneration through the docklands consultative forum; to provide for the transfer of certain responsibilities, rights and liabilities, primarily to Dublin City Council, as a consequence of the dissolution; and to provide certainty regarding the planning and development framework in the docklands area.</p><p>  The Bill is a key component of the overall wind-up process for the DDDA.  This process was commenced in May 2012 when the Government decided the DDDA was to be wound up.  Since then the authority has engaged in an orderly wind-up process, supported by the Department.  As the committee has heard, Dublin City Council is supporting the authority on a practical level during this transitional period.  The committee has heard details of these ongoing arrangements and the future arrangements to be put in place in Dublin City Council.  The Department is supportive of the work being carried out by Dublin City Council in this regard and fully supports its role in leading the future generation of the docklands.</p><p>  The docklands are recognised by all as a very important part of the capital city and a key driver of the local and national economy.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the right environment for this unique area is maintained so it will continue to be a key driver.  The Bill provides the necessary legal certainty for the completion of the DDDA wind-up process and its transition to Dublin City Council.  It is the final part of an orderly sequence of events following the Government's announcement in May 2012.  It puts in place a clear pathway for the continued involvement of the local community and business sector in the future of the docklands project.  It resolves some planning issues which have resulted in unfinished buildings and impacted greatly on the lives of everybody in the docklands, in particular local residents.</p><p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently approved the docklands strategic development zone, SDZ.  The SDZ will put in place an appropriate and sustainable planning framework for the docklands area.  It is important that the provisions in the Bill which deal with the legacy issues surrounding unfinished developments are given legal effect as soon as possible.</p><p>  As detailed drafting of the Bill proceeds I expect the proposals will be refined, including on foot of further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  The Minister will also consider any views of the committee arising out of its consideration of the Bill.  I expect drafting of the text of the Bill by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel will get under way shortly.</p><p>  I am happy to take any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

There is a legacy issue with regard to affordable housing and a complicated clawback.  This clawback is measured as an asset of the DDDA because of complicated structures.  Will the Department consider allowing an out clause for people with this legacy problem so the affordable housing can be dealt with in a similar way to how it is dealt with under legislation for local authority affordable housing?  Has this been examined?</p></speech>

No head in the Bill specifically deals with this matter.  I am aware the Minister of State with responsibility for housing has asked the Housing Agency to conduct a review of the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes and this will be delivered imminently.  With regard to the affordable housing scheme in the DDDA area it is prudent to wait for the outcome of this review.  To some extent the scheme mirrors the affordable housing schemes of local authorities.</p></speech>

It was never expected that property prices would drop.  Will Mr. Dunne give further consideration to tidying up this matter, whereby the affordable housing scheme could mirror those of local authorities?</p></speech>

To give an example, if a unit was valued at &euro;500,000 and sold as part of an affordable housing scheme for &euro;250,000 the asset is the differential of &euro;250,000.  This has reduced over 20 years but is counted as an asset of the authority.  Will Mr. Dunne examine this and see whether a provision can be inserted in the Bill?  I would say 90% of families who purchased under the affordable scheme intend to stay, but a number of family breakdowns have occurred and the families of some people who purchased one-bedroom apartments have increased.  They are caught by the complicated clawback because of the drop in property prices and they cannot afford to move.  Families living in one-bedroom apartments need to move to family-sized units.</p></speech>

It is the view of the majority of committee members that it is incumbent on the Department to go to the Minister and seek the insertion of a provision in the Bill to deal with this issue.  It is not fair or proper to leave it hanging and something should be laid down in the Bill so that this specific issue which must be dealt with in the DDDA area can be viewed differently from how it is viewed in the rest of the country.</p><p>  What procedures are in place for outstanding issues with regard to unfinished estates, outstanding development charges, bonds which have not been adhered to, NAMA and any social benefit there may be to Dublin City Council?

However, head 6 basically proposes a consultative forum without a policy implementation element.  Can the consultative forum be strengthened to allow it to devise development policies that must be adhered to within the docklands area?  I am not necessarily referring to the strategic development zone, SDZ, but to the docklands and their hinterland.  I do not want to use Deputy Cowen's term "watered down version", but this aspect must be strengthened so that the community, local business and Dublin City Council can work together on the development of a coherent policy that allows new developers or companies in the area to be clear on what will be expected of them.  The forum could develop policies instead of just being consultative.</p></speech>

It is meant to provide practical support to the city council, enabling the latter to take in its stride the major challenges and opportunities that emerge in the development of the Dublin docklands area.  The forum could usefully engage in policies on the protection of established businesses, maximising job creation, securing new investment, providing certainty to existing residents associations, community organisations and business units and future development plans.  It could also engage all stakeholders on the area's long-term infrastructural requirements and improve public perception and relationships with stakeholders.  It can have a broad ambit.</p></speech>

The consultative forum will play an important role in supporting the docklands' regeneration.  This is a balanced approach, involving an interaction with Dublin City Council to assist it with developments in the area.</p></speech>

Obviously, Dublin is important to the national recovery, but the docklands area is important to Dublin's regeneration.  The majority of brownfield sites are in that area and it has an indigenous community.  I support the democratic element represented by the councillors as well as the appointment of a consultative forum, which will set out its own terms, but community groups that serve on the forum must have a policy element.  Councillors can have a wider overview, but local communities know the basic needs that need to be met, for example, education, sports, play areas, green areas, etc.  The people best placed to develop such policies, in consultation with the democratic structures, are members of the local communities.  Local councillors will be on the forum, but it needs a more defined policy role.</p><p>  We can all be consulted.  Sometimes, people in the inner city feel consulted up to their eye teeth but receive very few dividends in return.  A master plan containing specific policies is already in place, but if the local community is to be empowered, the forum needs to be strengthened slightly.  When the Department is drafting the legislation, perhaps it should consider this proposal.  The forum does not just comprise members of the local community, but also local businesses.  For such groups to buy into the idea, they must see that their policies and ambitions for the community will be taken on board.  This was obvious when the business and community forums attended our committee.  They want their area to thrive and expand, but they also want a dividend for the local community.  More work is necessary in this regard.</p></speech>

To allow for social regeneration, however, a pot of money must be invested in education, community services or capital programmes.  A fund was available under the DDDA.  Under the Bill, however, no such funding is allowed. Some of the witnesses are involved in the winding up.  In that process, a sum of money for further investment in the local community needs to be identified.</p> <p>There will be an expected surplus in the winding up of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, amounting to several million euro.

The programme is progressing satisfactorily, although it is not possible to say at this stage whether any surplus will be available for community dividend or community gain when all liabilities, including pensions, are taken into account.

There was a change in the structures of the authority and, especially in latter years, the lack of delivery on the social regeneration element meant there is still a need to identify a pot of money to be invested in the local communities both on the north and south sides.  With the strategic development zone, SDZ, the levies are purely for infrastructural purposes, so there is a need to provide social elements for investment.  It would not be right, in framing this Bill, if an effort was not made to identify money that could be spent building social stock in the area, whether it is education, housing, playing fields, community centres, etc., in the docklands.  I use the term "docklands" rather than SDZ, as it is site-specific.</p><p>  If we examine purely the dissolution aspect, we will be left with affluence next door to poverty as there will be no social plan to level the playing field.  There will be high-end apartments costing &euro;500,000 or &euro;750,000 next to local authority housing with very little investment.  The strength of the docklands until now was in the attempts to break down those barriers, increase educational attainment and create an equal playing field for the local and indigenous community to have the opportunity to get the new jobs in the area.  This Bill would be weakened if it did not take on a social regard in that element.  It is very easy to look at this Bill and think we are dissolving the DDDA but if we do not make some sort of allowance for social capital or investment, the process will fail.  That is my policy position as against the purely technical process of dissolving the DDDA, although both of these must be considered at the same time.</p></speech>

The committee intends to develop a report on this issue and perhaps the witnesses will review the evidence given by a number of bodies over the two or three days we have met.  I ask them to remember that there is a thriving community in the docklands area and although we are dissolving the DDDA, we must ensure that the community can be developed and allowed to blossom by getting an opportunity to participate in the economic recovery.  Any Bill must have the critical element of ensuring the indigenous community can share in the economic gains in the docklands area.  There have been some successes but we can go much further.</p></speech>

The Ombudsman for Children cannot be here today and we understand this, but it is important that the committee hears from her.  Perhaps as part of our work programme this can be facilitated prior to the summer recess.  It has been a considerable time since the Ombudsman for Children has come before the committee and under the Act it is important that we have dialogue and communication, which we do, and also to hear from the Ombudsman for Children herself.

However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

I extend an apology from the Ombudsman for Children who is unable to attend as she is out of the country as she has been invited to address an international conference for UNICEF.  I am sure she would be quite happy to take up the invitation by the Chair to try to attend a meeting of the joint committee before the end of this session.</p><p>  As the Chairman will be aware, during the past decade the Ombudsman for Children has used her statutory remit as set out in the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to monitor children's rights and welfare in Ireland, including through our complaints and investigations function.  Some of the issues highlighted by her to date include the situation of children being detained in St. Patrick's Institution, the necessity to set up a committee to review all child deaths, the situation of separated children and how they are cared for and the issue of children and homelessness.</p><p>  The Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, is ten years old this year and in that time it has received more than 10,000 complaints from children and their advocates in respect of a wide variety of issues.  The reason we are attending this meeting and presenting three different reports is to highlight the range and consistency of issues we have addressed with regard to child protection and children in care.</p><p>  The office felt that it was appropriate at the time when the new Child and Family Agency is being established to lay before the Oireachtas these reports in order that it and more especially this committee can be in possession of the most up-to-date data relating to what system issues are arising and how they are adversely affecting children.  It is our firm belief that by setting out the range of issues, the recommendations made and the action accruing from the HSE and-or from the Child and Family Agency as a result that the office can afford this committee the knowledge to scrutinise the relevant Departments and agencies properly about their ongoing progress in this area.</p><p>  Since the office was established in 2004, child protection has consistently been an issue of concern.  The first special report to the Oireachtas in 2006 related to complaints of a child protection nature.  The first own volition investigation was into the State's implementation of its child protection guidelines, Children First, initiated in late 2008 and published in 2010.  Since then we have published numerous individual cases that contain child protection concerns.</p><p>  Today, we welcome the opportunity to discuss a suite of three reports that the Ombudsman for Children believes raise issues that need to be addressed and, equally important, contain detailed findings and recommendations setting out ways in which the delivery of child protection services can be improved.  The office is conscious of its responsibility to make recommendations that promote the best interests of the child.</p><p>  The reports we are discussing today are the recently published Meta-analysis of Repetitive Root Cause Issues regarding the Provision of Services for Children in Care, 2014; An Investigation into the Implementation of Social Work Services in North Lee, published in 2013; and the previously mentioned Investigation into the Implementation of Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, published in 2010.  Each of these reports is based on rigorous and robust investigations, which at all times adhere to our mandate to be neither an advocate for the child nor an adversary to the public body, thereby ensuring fairness has been afforded to all.</p><p>  In chronological order, the first report before members today is the Children First investigation in which the Ombudsman for Children sought to establish the extent of implementation of those guidelines, which had been established in 1999.  The Ombudsman for Children initiated the investigation, of her own volition, because she had seen numerous individual cases where the rigour or application of the Children First national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children was questioned in various areas of the country.  The Ombudsman for Children's investigation found a lack of consistency across many areas of the country in how the reporting of physical, sexual and emotional child abuse and neglect was handled despite the existence of national guidelines for almost ten years at that stage.</p><p>  The findings of this report include poor inter-agency co-operation between the Garda and the HSE; poor record keeping; insufficient efforts made to drive forward the implementation of Children First; evidence of poor quality assurance and a lack of consistent local procedures; and a lack of a 24 hour external access mechanism for people reporting child abuse.  It is important to note that this investigation was initiated prior to the Ryan report being completed.  It was within this report that the Ombudsman for Children was the first to call for the HSE to "consider whether child protection services are best delivered within the context of the HSE".  This was a clear indication that this office was concerned that the whole child protection mechanism was being lost within the mammoth HSE system.</p> <p>Having made such a call, this office welcomes the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency, to be known as Tusla.  We are pleased that it comes under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This ensures the focus is much more clearly on children and their families than heretofore.  I can highlight the importance of having a specialised agency such as Tusla by reporting that in 2013, just over a quarter of all cases dealt with by this office related to issues under the remit of the newly established agency.</p><p> The second report relates to a complaint that was received, which highlighted concerns about the capacity of a local HSE area to cope with the level of child abuse reports being received.  The issues that were highlighted included the screening, assessment and follow-up of referrals in the area.  At the heart of this investigation was a desire to ascertain whether cases where children were reported as being abused had been adequately assessed and followed up in a manner which ensured the child was safe.  This investigation led to seven recommendations, including the requirement for better national oversight of referrals and resource allocation in the area, the need for social work caseloads to be addressed by HSE at national level so that guidance can be given to social work teams on caseload size and weighting and the need for a full HIQA inspection to take place in the area.  We also recommended, not for the first time, that the HSE needed to improve its public accountability by gathering and publishing appropriate and accurate data on its activity in the child protection field.  At that point, the most recent figures available were three years old.  The HSE said the claim that children were unscreened and unassessed and have had no follow up is unfounded and unsubstantiated.  Nevertheless, it went on to implement all of the recommendations.</p><p> The most recent report before the committee is "A Meta-Analysis of Repetitive Root Cause Issues Regarding the Provision of Services for Children in Care".  Approximately 10% of all cases examined by the office each year relate to children in care.  That is a significant body of evidence on which to draw.  The ten cases we have selected within the meta-analysis are representative of the issues and trends that have been identified from that sizeable cohort of cases.  There were approximately 6,400 children in the care system in December 2013.  The majority of them were in foster care.  A small number of children - some 324, or 5% of the total in December 2013 - were living in the residential care system.  With two exceptions, all the cases in the meta-analysis refer to children in residential placements.  The purpose of the meta-analysis is to highlight the significant cross-cutting themes we have identified and ensure they are given attention so that children and families should not need to have recourse to this office on these topics in the future.</p><p> In the meta-analysis report, the office recognised the huge efforts and important contributions made by many staff involved in the care of young people.  Seven main issues that arose needed to be highlighted.  I will go through the recommendations for improvement made by the office in each case.  On the issue of the provision of residential care for children, we recommended that a strategic development plan for residential care of children is required.  On the issue of the protection of children in care, we recommended the introduction of a multi-agency policy, procedure and system which can identify, refer and respond to situations where young people in care place themselves at risk through their own behaviour.  On the issue of assessment and care planning, we recommended that a comprehensive and robust assessment of need to inform care plans and integration between care plans and placement plans, with social workers as key co-ordinators, is required.</p><p> On the issue of social work practice, we recommended the implementation of a revised staff supervision policy, the provision of sufficient training and resources and the introduction of an annual audit.  On the issue of inter-professional and multi-agency collaboration, we identified a requirement for corporate parenting across all Departments, State agencies and relevant service providers and a need for the annual report to report any issues in this regard to ensure they are properly accounted for.  On the issue of record-keeping, we recommended the full implementation of a new policy on records management, the training of social workers in this area and the annual auditing of records to ensure quality.  On the issue of governance, we recommended that robust governance should be in place to avoid a recurrence of these issues in the future.</p><p> At least two of these issues were present in each of the cases within the meta-analysis.  This is an indication of the repetitive nature of many of the system failures.  Members will recall that the issues of record keeping and interagency co-operation were highlighted in the Children First investigation.  This clearly shows the systemic nature of the flaws.  Some of the cases in the meta-analysis highlighted certain problems.  For example, one child moved between 11 placements in four months.  Another child was forced to stay longer than necessary in a justice facility because of delays in completing an assessment and sourcing an onward placement.  In another case, Children First was not implemented in a particular HSE region until late 2012.  Given the own-volition investigation we carried out and the assurances that things would change in 2010, this was a very disappointing discovery.</p><p> Our office engaged with the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, when she was serving as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  We have also engaged with departmental officials and the CEO of the Child and Family Agency around the issues set out in the meta-analysis.  I am pleased to include a response from Tusla in this report.  It is the belief of the Ombudsman for Children that the Oireachtas, particularly the Joint Committee on Health and Children, is well placed to monitor and hold to account the Department and the agency on their progress with these issues.  The Ombudsman for Children does not believe her office should have to investigate these issues over and over again.  Now that the new agency is in place, they should be addressed.  It is her intention that the findings in this report and the recommendations it contains will contribute positively to the ongoing reform of Ireland&rsquo;s child and family support service.  She also intends that the root causes identified will cease to be the subject of examination by this office, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p><p> Children in care may have had difficult childhoods.  Most of them have experienced periods of instability and insecurity.  They may have had their education disrupted and their health needs neglected.  They are entitled to the right to prepare for a successful adult life.  That should not be hampered by the very service set up to aid them.  We hope the committee will find these reports, considered collectively, and the issues we have raised today helpful when it is engaging in its regular reviews of the work of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Child and Family Agency.  The ability to learn from our mistakes is something that makes good systems better and affords hope for the children of the future.  I thank members for their time and attention.</p></speech>

I would like to make a few observations and ask some questions.  Dr. Muldoon said that the Ombudsman for Children's Office "is ten years old this year and... has received more than 10,000 complaints from children" in that time.  Is the level of complaints increasing?  The average annual number of complaints over the last decade is approximately 1,000.  What is the annual figure at present?  Is it closer to 1,500 or 500?  How quickly are these complaints dealt with?  Dr. Muldoon suggested that the Children First report highlighted "poor inter-agency co-operation between the Garda and the HSE".  Was that common right across the board or was it the exception?  How has that improved?  How can we further improve it?  He also said that the HSE "went on to implement all of the recommendations" of the report on social work service provision in North Lee.  How was this achieved?  What impact has this had?  The issues of poor record-keeping and interagency co-operation were highlighted in the meta-analysis.  In one case, a child was moved 11 times to different placements.  In another case, a child was forced to stay longer than necessary in a justice facility.  Can Dr. Muldoon give us the name of the facility in question?  Does this still happen?  What are the effects that this can have on a child?  I note that Children First was not implemented in a particular HSE region until late 2012.  I want to know why this was allowed to happen.  Has this been rectified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-10a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014061000005#E00400"><p>I thank Dr. Muldoon and Ms O'Shea.  They are very welcome here today.  If it is the case that some of my questions would be more appropriately answered by the Ombudsman for Children, I will have no difficulty with being advised to that effect.  I will not ask some other questions today.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan asked about the number of investigations over the last ten years.  I would be very interested to get an understanding of the nature and type of the complaints that are being received by the public.  I know from previous reports that complaints are predominantly received from parents who are advocating on behalf of their children, but I would like to know how this has evolved and changed over the ten-year period in question.  Should we be more worried about certain Departments?  I am sure Departments have learnt lessons as they have dealt with the Ombudsman for Children.  Perhaps some of them would get gold stars while others would not.  It would be interesting to understand what is going on in that area.</p><p>  The second issue I would like to raise is the question of engagement with the Oireachtas under section 19 of the Act.  As a Member of the Oireachtas, I have a difficulty with reports from the Ombudsman for Children being laid before the media before being laid before the Oireachtas.  The Act does not clearly articulate that they should go before us first, but I would have thought, in light of the clear role of the Ombudsman for Children with regard to the Oireachtas, that we should have sight of those reports in advance.  Is there a way that we can look at this?  I have looked at the reports to which Dr. Muldoon has referred.  In the foreword to the meta-analysis, the Ombudsman for Children says that "each of these promised actions [this refers to the recommendations] by the newly formed Child and Family Agency will allow the Oireachtas to measure Tusla's progress and provide a baseline for improvements which we all hope to see for this small but extremely vulnerable cohort of children".</p> <p>How does the Ombudsman for Children see the Oireachtas playing that role?  She has clearly outlined that we have a role although until I read the report in preparation for today's meeting I had not seen that the responsibility was placed on us.  Is the responsibility placed on the Joint Committee on Health and Children or the Oireachtas as a whole?</p><p> The Children First report will go before the Houses.  I remember when the April 2010 report came out, there was a clear reference in chapter 3D to an industrial relations issue that arose in the eastern regional health authority concerning individuals who refused to implement Children First.  Can we be assured with the new Child and Family Agency that there are no industrial relations issues pertaining to Children First or is that something the committee should ask directly of the agencies?</p><p> Following the establishment of the Child and Family Agency and the meta-analysis report published by the Ombudsman for Children in December, what engagements has the office had with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Child and Family Agency on the ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations?  I concur with all of them, but I would like to see progress and to consider how we can best ensure we make such progress for children.</p><p> I wish to ask a question of the Ombudsman for Children but I cannot.  Special powers were delegated to her on the investigation into the Roma children incidents not to the Office of the Ombudsman.  I wish to ask about the findings but I cannot ask the question today.</p></speech>

I never felt the issue was resolved satisfactorily because it was to do with neglect at home.  The child was severely physically disabled and was not able to look after himself in the way a normal 13-year old or 14-year old would.  In a way I regretted ever making the complaint, except that I was obliged to do so because I felt the only result was that the boy got it in the neck from one of his carers.</p><p>  Do the witnesses have a role in protecting children who are in hostels for people awaiting citizenship applications?  I am concerned about children living in such situations for prolonged periods.  Can anything be done to check that children in those situations are being properly looked after and are not subject to abuse of any kind?</p></speech>

In terms of statistics, the annual report for 2013 will be out soon.  We have seen an increase in complaints.  We started in April 2004 and there were 94 complaints in the first year.  Complaints have steadily risen and since 2010 we have seen an increase of approximately 16% up to last year which, shows that complaints have increased in recent years.  The average number of complaints is approximately 1,600 per year.  To June of this year we have seen an increase of 6% on last year.  We are working hard to increase the awareness of the office in various population groups.  We are trying to link in with as many different populations to make them aware of our existence and, accordingly, that has resulted in a considerable increase in reporting to us.</p><p>  The majority of complaints are addressed fairly quickly.  Many of them require signposting only and do not always end up in an investigation.  The majority of cases are dealt with in the first four to six weeks while more complicated preliminary inquiries and investigations can take anywhere from two months to a couple of years.  Cases are wide-ranging but the majority of our work is done very quickly.  More complicated investigations are based on our remit to be neither an advocate for a child or an adversary to a public body that involves a lot of fair play.  We would engage in toing and froing with a public body to ensure we investigate cases in the most appropriate and fair manner.  That takes a bit of time and it is only at the stage when the interaction with the public body is done that we can conclude an investigation.  We are working hard to speed up investigations and to reduce the time taken to approximately 12 months.  We are not quite there yet but we are working on it.  Perhaps Ms O&rsquo;Shea would respond on the questions about Garda and HSE co-operation.</p></speech>

We made recommendations about that to both the HSE and the Garda at the time.  We met with the Garda, although it is not part of our investigative remit, and we had a positive response from it on the recommendations made.</p><p>  One of the issues raised was about the need for the formal liaison structures that were recommended as part of the Children First guidance.  One of our recommendations in the Children First investigation was the need for external inspection to look at how those mechanisms were taking place, in particular aspects such as strategy meetings, liaison management meetings and notifications.  We are pleased that since we have concluded the investigation, HIQA has now commenced inspection of the HSE - now Child and Family Agency - social work services.  I hope that will give some oversight on the level of co-ordination that is occurring with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  The response we got was a commitment to improved communication and a number of mechanisms were put in place.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Child and Family Agency are meeting at a senior level to look at the overall issues because one of the things we found was that it required both senior management to meet to address the issues but also that local liaison should occur on individual case referrals.  We had a positive response to the recommendation.</p><p>  We made seven recommendations following the investigation into the social services in the north Lee area.  The first was about external inspection because while we can look at an individual complaint, our key concern was about the need to inspect the overall service provision that was occurring in the area and that required review of case files which was more appropriate for HIQA to look at.  We also made recommendations about the need to review the north Lee area because of the high referral rate, the difficulty in responding to cases in a timely manner and the level of unallocated cases.  We saw during the course of our investigation that a number of steps were taken to look at additional supports that could be put in place as well as looking at the response to referrals when they first occurred.  The critical issue was about how resources are matched to need and a need for ongoing monitoring in that regard.</p><p>  One of the changes the Child and Family Agency introduced &ndash; it was the HSE at the time &ndash; was a "measuring the pressure" project which allowed monthly reporting through to the national office that gave information about the level of the referral rate and also about the number of unallocated cases.  There were still concerns on these aspects during the course of the investigation but there was better oversight and monitoring by the national office in order to develop strategies for dealing with the issues that arose.</p><p>  We also made a number of other recommendations, a number of which pertained to issues relating to social work caseload management.  Some of the actions are still ongoing because we understand that work is still occurring in that regard but we thought it was important to report to the Oireachtas so that it is aware of the kinds of issues we were highlighting in terms of social work service provision.</p></speech>

There is a need for ongoing monitoring of the capacity of the children and family services to respond to referrals.  The critical issues in north Lee relate to the high referral rate, the level of response times and the difficulty in responding within the timeframes that are required as part of the Children First guidance and the Child Protection Welfare Practice handbook, particularly in terms of carrying out initial assessments.  The difficulty is that if there is a delay in carrying out the initial assessments, that impacts on how quickly concerns can be responded to and establishing the seriousness of those concerns in respect of the children who are being referred to the services.  We saw that the area took a number of steps locally to look at how they might respond to the increasing referral level.  They were holding meetings with local community services to look at how some cases might be intercepted at an earlier stage and directed through to family support and prevention rather than awaiting social work intervention.  Clearly there is a need for ongoing monitoring of the referral rates both in terms of allegations of child abuse as well as child welfare cases.</p></speech>

They were continuing to implement the strategies.  We were of the view that there needs to be continued monitoring of the capacity of the service to be able to respond to the referral rate.  The general referral rate for child protection and welfare services is an issue of concern.  The referral rate level is not specific to north Lee but our investigation was specifically related to north Lee.</p><p>  In terms of the meta-analysis, I was asked about the inter-agency co-operation.  We were particularly concerned about the liaison between social work departments and the child and adolescent mental health services.  We saw the difficulties that children experience in accessing some of the services.  There is a need for improved communication, a proactive response and liaison across the agencies in planning for children in care.  There were situations in which the children in care were placed outside of their local area and there was difficulty in accessing the child and adolescent mental health services in the area in which they were placed.  During the course of our investigations of the ten cases - but it did not occur in all of them, but it was a feature in a number of cases - the issues were resolved but there was a need for improved inter-agency co-operation in working with mental health services.  Another difficulty for children in care is accessing educational services, particularly when they are moving placements, as they can then experience difficulties in accessing education and gaining the support they require in education.</p><p>  The implementation of Children First was an issue in one of our investigations.  During the course of the investigation it was confirmed that Children First was being implemented but that was in late 2012.  We had concerns about the implementation of Children First when we concluded that investigation in 2010.</p></speech>

We would urge that this happen quickly.  This is a key area.  When the bodies were under the same umbrella, it was a very difficult co-operation scenario.  We urge that the memoranda are as clear as possible that the child is at the centre and that they are brought forward as quickly as possible as ways of working and co-operating together.</p></speech>

The types of complaints have been fairly consistent over time.  The majority of complaints we receive come from the area of the Department of Education and Skills, it consistently has been between 40% to 50%.  The most recent figure was about 45%.  The majority of children come under that remit.  As I said in my opening statement 25% of our work relates to the Child and Family Agency.  The fact that there is now an agency with 4,000 staff dealing with cases in that area, as opposed to the HSE with 80,000 staff, will help us enormously.  We have hopes that the new agency will be more agile and more able to cope with the difficulties that we come across and to date our engagement with them has been very constructive.  The HSE has now devolved the Child and Family Agency into a separate body and that is a big learning curve.  The establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is also a significant step forward.  The child is becoming closer and closer to the centre of the work of the public bodies.  That is very encouraging.</p><p>  The role of the Oireachtas in managing the recommendations coming from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is that given the children and family services are evolving into a separate agency, we felt it was time for us to pull all our learning together and put it on record so that in the Oireachtas there is the ability to look back at the work we have done and the recommendations we have made and use that in a constructive manner to challenge the Child and Family Agency to ensure it has a standard against which progress can be measured.  That was our intention when we presented the meta-analysis and these other reports.</p><p>  On the industrial relations at the Child and Family Agency, to the best of my knowledge that has changed.  It is something the committee might need to confirm with the Child and Family Agency but my understanding from the Children First report, which is now four years old, is that the industrial relations issues have been settled, but it would be no harm to check that out when the agency comes before the joint committee.</p><p>  On the question of the engagement of the Ombudsman for Children's Office with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla, as part of the meta-analysis we met with the then Minister and her officials as well as the officials from the Child and Family Agency and that was a very constructive meeting.  We found ourselves in a position in which there are very positive responses to our recommendations.  It has set out clear deadlines and quarterly targets for meeting the recommendations.  We hope this will be overseen by the Oireachtas.  It has been a very positive engagement from our point of view.  We hope this new agency will be a major step forward for the care of the children that we are looking after.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout also inquired about the Roma children.  I cannot comment on that at this stage.</p></speech>

Lack of resources is one part of it, but the system sometimes fails to allow for difficult cases.  The majority of the work is straightforward, but it is a complicated area involving child care and different professionals.  There are gaps between the support mechanisms social care workers may expect.  There are all sorts of areas involved and some people stay within their silos, failing to support in a useful way.  We are continuously and consistently receiving child protection complaints.  That does not seem to be changing and we are not bringing down the numbers.

That was part of the rationale for bringing those forward.  A large number involve complaints regarding children in care and the service provision there.  That is what prompted us to conduct the meta-analysis to look at overarching themes so that it would not be necessary to reinvestigate individual cases and to look at getting the underlying issues addressed in relation to that.</p><p>  In terms of the handling of child protection concerns, we see complaints that relate to the length of time things take, non-responsiveness or difficulty in accessing those investigation or support services.  In some ways, those were the key issues of concern that were raised in the context of the north Lee investigation.  That is also part of the reason we are bringing that here.  We are conscious of the increasing referral levels.  It is about capacity to respond and applying the policy and procedures they have, which was raised through our Children First investigation.</p><p>  We are examining those cases individually.  If there are issues and areas in which we can identify improvements, we make recommendations.  We see once we start to examine those cases that there is an improvement in terms of issues being resolved.  We always take the opportunity to see how things could be improved and addressed better.  It is important that HIQA's role on inspection is commenced.  We are looking at individual cases, but the overall practice and how that is responded to is something in respect of which HIQA has an important role to play.</p></speech>

I have an asylum centre in my constituency and my impression from dealing with some of the asylum seekers is that they are loth to make complaints.  Some of them come from very authoritarian dictatorships and they assume they will not be listened to.  They feel it is very important, given that they are seeking asylum here, that they do not tread on anyone's toes.  They are therefore slow to make complaints about anything.  My impression from conversations with some asylum seekers is that the situation of some children in the centres is very difficult.  They are not appropriate places for children to be for any length of time at all.</p></speech>
