I want to apologise for the delayed start to the meeting.  There was a Vote in the Seanad and we waited for our colleagues from the Seanad to arrive back.  That is the reason we suspended.<br />The purpose of the meeting is to have a discussion with a number of people who made written submissions on the review of the effectiveness of legislation relating to the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On behalf of the committee I am very pleased to welcome Baroness Nuala O'Loan.  She was the first Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, a post she held from 1999 to 2007.  She is very welcome.  I thank her for being here today and giving us her time and expertise.  <br />I welcome<b></b>Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, Acting Garda Commissioner, and her team.  I also welcome Mr. Ronan Brady, lecturer in journalism, Griffith College, Dublin and thank him for being here.  <br />The format of the meeting is that witnesses will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by a question and answer session.  I ask witnesses to keep their opening statements as brief and to the point as possible.  It would be very much appreciated if they could keep them to around five minutes or thereabouts.  <br />I wish to advise all members, witnesses and observers in the Visitors Gallery to please turn off all mobile telephones or switch them to aeroplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device.</p> <p>It is not sufficient to put them on silent mode as this will maintain the level of interference from the committee and impacts negatively on broadcast.  If, in the course of proceedings, there is interference I will ask everybody to switch off their mobile telephones completely or withdraw from the room because it is very annoying for people in television and broadcast to have to endure such interference.</p><p> Before beginning I draw the attention of all witnesses to the position in regard to privilege.  I ask witnesses to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I invite Ms Nuala O'Loan to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800004#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and express my appreciation for the invitation to appear before the committee.</p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has been in existence for some nine years now and has done some very good work.  However, following recent events, there is an opportunity to enhance and refine the law to make it a more effective and more independent organisation.  It is for the Irish State to determine how it legislates for police accountability and my observations, which are the product of my personal experience as Police Ombudsman and my work with policing and police accountability organisations across the world, are offered simply to assist in the reform processes.</p><p>  International experience would suggest that real independence and impartiality are key factors for the success of an independent investigative organisation.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act does not mention either independence or impartiality in the objectives which it sets for GSOC.  It would seem to me that the term "fairness" is a weaker, less specific term.  For example, it would be possible to deliver an equally bad service to everyone.  That would be fair but it would not be acceptable or effective.  I urge the inclusion of a duty on GSOC to act with impartiality and independently.  I also suggest that GSOC should be resourced to investigate every complaint rather than referring matters back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  This is necessary to demonstrate de facto the real independence of GSOC.  It should have the power to investigate policy and practice matters of its own volition.  These are the issues that enabled me as Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland to deliver a service.</p><p>  GSOC cannot currently investigate complaints or allegations against the Commissioner.  The committee has heard evidence of this.  I do not know of any other similar organisation where this is the case and it is not sustainable if GSOC is to be perceived as effective.  There will always be a suspicion that accountability is okay for junior officers but the chief has to be protected.  GSOC needs a complete entitlement to material to be able to do its job.  Currently the Commissioner can withhold material and advise the Minister to withhold material.  That could lead to a perception of cover-up.</p><p>  The appearance of independence is important.  GSOC was required to take as staff former civil servants and its current staff are civil servants - part of the apparatus of the administration of the State.  There has to be a complete separation between GSOC and the State. The current arrangements whereby serving garda&iacute; are based in the GSOC office is not conducive to any perception of independence, and perception is profoundly important.  I cannot conceive of anything which serving garda&iacute; could bring to the office now in terms of explanation of Garda practices which GSOC could not acquire through retired or former garda&iacute;.  GSOC needs an uninterrupted, immediate right of access to search police premises.  I dealt with that issue at some length in my initial submission.  This does not exist and is necessary.  The Garda Commissioner should be under a stated obligation to secure, preserve and provide evidence in every case.</p><p>  Current law enables officers subject to complaint to veto attempts at an informal resolution process.  There is a very low level of informal resolution here.  It is in the interests of everyone that simple, less complex complaints be dealt with more effectively.</p><p>  The provision which causes me considerable concern is the provision which enables prosecution of a person who makes a false or misleading complaint.  I consider that provision to be disproportionate, since it could well deter genuine complainants.  From my experience, it is not easy for most people to make a complaint against the police.  Many states contemplated introducing a provision like this at the request of the police and police representative organisations but decided against it.  Were I making change, I would repeal the section.  Although a person can defend themselves, the mere fact of the possibility of prosecution and the risk of a heavy fine and a prison sentence is a disproportionate disincentive to making a complaint which may be perfectly well justified.</p><p>  The legislation does not provide a right to GSOC to make recommendation for change in policy or practice following a conduct or criminal investigation.  I am aware that some such recommendations are made.   Such a provision would enable a better outcome for the people of Ireland from the investment currently made in police accountability.</p><p>  I would like to say more but think it is better that I give the committee the opportunity to ask me questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800004#D00400"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 with the committee.  I have provided a document outlining our submission on a section by section basis, as requested.  I have also given the committee a printed version of the opening address.  To make the best use of time I propose to touch on a few of the key issues outlined.</p><p>  The revision of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 presents a unique opportunity for us to make sure we have the modern well-governed customer-facing police service we need.  As interim Garda Commissioner I have already launched a substantial reform and renewal programme to make sure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to have the trust, respect and confidence of the diverse communities it serves with pride.  We are at a defining moment in the history of the policing service, a moment at which the principles of accountability, transparency and professionalism must be at the core of a strong, confident and connected policing service and at which such principles must be seen to be at the core of everything we do in order that we are trusted and valued by the public we serve.  The revision of the Act is necessary because in the ten years since it was first drafted, Irish society and public expectations of its police service have changed.  The new Act must reflect this new landscape in which we now operate.  The 2005 Act brought about some very welcome changes but it is time to move forward to a new era of enhanced accountability.</p><p>  At the outset it is important to acknowledge the enormous contribution made on a daily basis by every member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Day in and day out, the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serve this State and our local communities and work to keep them safe and secure.  They interact with families and individuals at some of the most challenging and vulnerable moments that are encountered in life.  Much of this work does not, and often should not, make headlines but it does touch hearts and minds and it does make a difference.</p><p>  Throughout its history An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has met and overcome new challenges, whether they came from the paramilitary threat that hung over this island for decades, from organised criminality or from emerging technologies.  We have done so in a spirit of doing what is right for the community and the country as well as what is in the interests of delivering professional and accountable policing.</p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 was a significant legislative initiative which brought clarity to the management and oversight of policing in this country.  It addressed the changing policing environment and enhanced our ability to meet the emerging challenges of delivering an effective, professional and accountable police service.  Since the publication of the Act, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been and continues to be subject to significant oversight from a range of different institutions: the Oireachtas, including this committee and other Oireachtas committees, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate, and judicial oversight of activities relating to State security.</p><p>  Our relationship with our external oversight authorities must be professional, transparent, open and demonstrate full engagement.  Such oversight is not just welcome but vital in a modern democracy.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recognises that accountability and transparency must be among the fundamental principles upon which we develop our policing service.  That complex task will be greatly helped by an independent policing authority.  This authority, together with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Inspectorate, will enhance public confidence in our policing function and frankly, right now, that reinforcement is necessary.</p><p>  I turn to some specific proposals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which draw both on our professional judgement and expertise and our practical knowledge and experience of providing a community-focused police service.  As I see it they fall into three broad categories: first, accountability and transparency in the delivery of policing; second, investigation of complaints about policing; and third, effective use of resources and ensuring best police practice.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na welcomes the proposed establishment of an independent police authority as a means of enhancing the delivery of a modern dynamic policing service and ensuring it meets the needs and expectations of the community.  We know that there are examples on these islands and further afield of how such authorities can operate.  The structure and make-up of that independent authority is a matter for Government and the Legislature.  The key element for us is to ensure the authority and its members are consistently guided and motivated by what is good for the community and good for policing.</p><p>  Our renewal programme is focused on ensuring we are in a state of readiness to provide the level of governance and accountability to serve the requirements of that authority, when established.  It is vital that we are accountable to national independent bodies.</p> <p>It is equally important that we are accountable to local communities.  The Irish model of policing admired by many police services around the world has been built on listening to, engaging and working in partnership with local communities to identify and solve problems.  To date, the joint policing committees have had a major role to play.  These partnerships between local stakeholders and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have successfully identified solutions for issues that impact on local communities.  These structures should continue to have a meaningful role and to be focused as locally as possible.</p><p> In respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, a strong and fully functioning commission which commands the confidence of the community plays a vital part in maintaining trust in policing.  We are committed to ensuring constructive engagement with GSOC to achieve our mutual objectives.  Our written submission proposes a number of changes to the workings and powers of GSOC.  These key proposals include that garda&iacute; should not investigate garda&iacute;.  As Baroness O'Loan stated, all complaints of a serious nature should be investigated by GSOC personnel, not by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This provides independent objectivity.  We support GSOC's submission that the definition covering what incidents fall into the serious crime category should be extended.  We also support the initiative to allow GSOC to resolve complaints by way of informal resolution with the consent of the complainant and the member complained of.</p><p> In respect of the Garda Inspectorate, since its inception the Garda Inspectorate has produced a number of insightful and valuable reports that have helped improve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, it is worth bearing in mind that some recommendations require resource investments which are difficult in the current climate in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &ndash; like other public bodies - has had to operate.</p><p> I also want to mention something in respect of receiving and responding to feedback.  I have stated from the outset that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be open to internal and external criticism if we are to strengthen and grow.  Dissent is not disloyalty, and different and differing views must be heard and supported as they can help to improve the service we provide.  Sometimes those criticisms may not be fully correct or justified but we need to learn to listen and to understand, and where there are issues that need to be addressed we must take appropriate action immediately.</p><p> In that context, the proposals for internal change include a restructuring of our internal affairs and professional standards department.  This would see the aligning of internal affairs, which directs investigations into allegations of Garda misconduct and examines internal disciplinary matters, and liaises with GSOC, and also the Garda professional standards unit, where standards and procedures can be reviewed so as to highlight areas of strategic concern and proactively address systemic challenges.</p><p> We would also submit that the remit of the internal audit unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be strengthened to enable it to audit and report on strategic, operational, financial and reputational risks to the organisation.  The unit should also be empowered to provide an objective opinion to the chair of the independent audit committee concerning systems, procedures and controls which will then bring the matter to the attention of the Commissioner.  We also submit that there is a need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to conduct public attitude surveys as is already provided for in the Act and we would submit that there should be an alternative public consultation forum that could be held to enhance that process.</p><p> Finally, I recommend that the official title of "An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na" be adopted in the interest of consistency.  In the previous Act it was "The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na", and we believe in the interest of consistency it would be "An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na".</p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its members hold a privileged position in society.  We serve with energy, dedication and pride and must be held accountable, at national and local level.  We are at a point in our history where we can build an organisation so that the Irish police service is a case study in responsive excellence, a leader of national and international best practice, and a constantly evolving force for good in our nation.</p><p> It is my job to get on with reshaping An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that it is worthy of the people it serves and worthy, too, of the great people who work within it.  An independent policing authority that will hold us to account for the delivery of a modern dynamic and human rights based policing service is welcome.  This authority, together with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Inspectorate, will enhance and ensure public confidence in our policing functions.  A revised Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act has a major role to play in helping us reach that goal of being a world-class police service that meets the needs of all communities and citizens for the benefit of the State.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for their time and will answer any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Brady" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800005#E00300"><p>The key points I wish to make are as follows.  The Freedom of Information Acts should be extended to the Garda.  The 1997 Freedom of Information Act was carefully drafted so as to allow this.  Section 23 of the Act already contains the necessary protection for confidential matters in the struggle against crime.  Since 1997, all that has been required for the extension of freedom of information to the Garda has been a decision of the Government.  No further legislation has been required.<br />Ireland is nearly unique, in so far as my studies go, in not extending freedom of information to the Garda.  In other countries, progressive policing organisations and police officers have sought to bring their organisations under a freedom of information regime, arguing that it is vital in maintaining public confidence in the policing service.  In Ireland, however, the authorities have fostered Garda antagonism towards openness, manifested in the legislation preventing proper contact between the media and serving officers.  It would be absurd to claim with certainty that the extension of freedom of information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have prevented the scandals that have recently been unearthed by Garda whistleblowers but it would be equally absurd to deny that a freedom of information regime would have made these scandals less likely.<br />Members of the committee can see my credentials, such as they are.  They are printed for them in the presentation.  I will move on to the key points I want to make.<br />First, the 1997 Act was an enormous step towards openness in a country where bureaucracy and censorship were more normal.  In 2003, there was a kind of bureaucratic coup in the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003 which was intended to reduce the effectivity of the 1997 Act.  Both parties in the current Government have undertaken to reform that.  They are preparing legislation and have already implemented certain aspects of legislation in this regard.  However, one aspect does not require additional legislation, that is, this one.  It is not a radical measure.<br />There is what some journalists have pointed to as &quot;a convenient confusion&quot; that in some way freedom of information would inhibit intelligence gathering or crime investigation.  That is not the case.  The Freedom of Information Act protects the necessary confidentiality of policing work.  The more forward-looking police leaders in our nearest neighbour have been positive about freedom of information legislation.  Sir Hugh Orde, of whom the committee will be aware and who went on to head the Association of Chief Police Officers, ACPO, in the United Kingdom, states that he pushed hard to place that association under the Westminster Freedom of Information Act 2000, and this was accomplished wholly voluntarily in 2011.<br />The ACPO website provides easy access to disclosure logs.  These are the letters that they send out.  They are the documents that they circulate among themselves.  They are redacted - material that could compromise confidentiality is blacked out - but, in the course of my studies, I have read letters to chief police officers from ACPO about intelligence training and other highly sensitive matters.  The redaction means that no terrorist could possibly divine any information that was useful to him or her, but by openly displaying the existence of these letters, ACPO is enabling serious journalists to ask more serious questions.  Of course, ACPO is within its powers to withhold certain information if it is not in the public interest to release it.  The logs contain information on such matters as terrorism and allied matters, criminal justice and performance management.  I have read the Metropolitan Police's disclosure logs as well.  These include, for example, the number of 999 calls which the police have missed.<br />In 2004, assistant chief constable Ian Readhead of the Hampshire police testified before a committee, not unlike this one, in Westminster.  He was asked has freedom of information inhibited police work, and his answer was emphatic.  He stated:<blockquote>No, I do not think so for one moment.  There is a clear balance to be drawn here between the right of the public to know and the right of the Service to sustain public safety in general, and the legislation gives ample opportunity for us to be able to secure information and keep information confidential which would threaten public safety if it were exposed.  I do not think that is the issue at all.</blockquote></p> <p>The assistant chief constable mentioned the culture of the service, whereby there is a tendency towards secrecy, and said he did not think that was sustainable.  He concluded by stating: &quot;There are many things that you could say about the way in which the Special Branch carries out its business which would not prejudice public safety at all.&quot;<br />Members will be aware that I also am a representative of the National Union of Journalists and Irish journalists find little evidence of such views among An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda press office was described by one of my colleagues as a bulwark against openness, which frankly is what most journalists feel about it.  Section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 contains a presumption of criminality against disclosing information to journalists, <i>inter alia</i>, without the approval of senior officers.  This is enormously disproportionate.  The international free speech NGO, Index on Censorship, has stated, quite rightly, that this legislation is &ldquo;not the behaviour of a European democracy&rdquo;.  It is, however, quite consistent with the hugger-mugger attitude concerning the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The absence of outside scrutiny contributes to behaviour such as the refusal to co-operate with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  It also contributes to a commonplace secrecy tactic whereby one defines a hot topic as an operational matter, even when disclosure would in no way inhibit any operation.<br />None of what I have said should be construed as anti-garda.  Speaking personally, I have good reason to thank garda&iacute; for their kindness and their protection on many occasions.  I have also worked with the United Nations internationally and in Asia and Africa I have encountered UN officials who class An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as one of the best police services in the world, based on the work done by garda&iacute; on UN assignments  Regretfully, however, I must agree with my colleague, Ken Foxe, who has stated a genuine argument can be made that had freedom of information, FOI, been in place within the Garda over the past 20 years, it may have made it a more open institution and helped its members to understand that legitimate inquiry is not dangerous.  He went on to state that a more open, more questioning culture across the Garda may have helped to avoid some of the enormous reputational damage it has suffered in recent months.</p></speech>

In the spirit of his contribution, is it okay for the joint committee to publish the opening statements, as our media friends are anxious to see them?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  We will now proceed to questions and I ask my colleagues to be brief, concise and to the point.  The entire point is to elicit information and if people wish to make speeches, they should do so in the Chamber and not here.  I have a list of members who have indicated as they caught my eye and I appeal for focused questions.  I will intervene if someone is rambling away and making a speech.  I am sure members will excuse me for so doing, as it will just be to be helpful.  Deputy Farrell is the first member to have indicated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1014" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800006#F00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance this afternoon.  I only have two or three questions and although I intend to direct them towards an individual, any witness to whom they are not being directed should feel free to weigh in, if he or she has something to say.  I will begin with Baroness O'Loan, who mentioned there should be a provision to allow for GSOC to investigate or have access to a Garda premises.  I will extend that a little by inquiring on her views as to how far that should go.  In the context of GSOC's remit, is one merely talking about Garda stations and Garda headquarters or should other facilities be included?  While I am merely thinking aloud, in the case of an ongoing investigation into issues relating to a particular member of the force, for instance, would this extend - with the assistance of the courts - to looking at the personal premises of a serving member?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800006#F00400"><p>Yes.  On the issue of access to personal premises, that is, to the homes of serving guards, to their cars, caravans or whatever it is, I am not fully experienced in criminal law here but that would be dealt with in the process of criminal investigation and I would expect the normal warrant process to apply to that.  Consequently, that would be possible, were one conducting a criminal investigation.  Very often before that, however, there is a question about whether material may or may not be held in a police station or a Garda station.  My experience has been that very often, there is material that may well be useful to an investigation, which is kept in lockers or desks or even, in the North anyway, in the roof spaces of stations.  The problem as I perceive it at present is that the legislation provides for notice to be given.  In most situations, GSOC would be able to give notice that it wished to come in and look for something or to ask for something but in order to have independence, there must be a right to go and to enter.  We had that right in the North and it was a necessary part of some of our investigations.</p></speech>

While such members are carrying out the course of their duties, they just happen to have it in a personal vehicle that they might be using, for example.  There have been instances mentioned in recent years of serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na using their own vehicles.  I wonder whether the role of GSOC would include that.  While taking on board what Baroness O'Loan said about the criminal investigation, I am just thinking of an investigation being carried out by GSOC and whether, in her view, it would or should extend to that.</p></speech>

If An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not providing the garda&iacute; in question with vehicles that enable them to do their job, then it must be approving the use of their personal vehicles, which must then make it within the territory of GSOC.  While that possibly would require legislation, I think that should be possible because otherwise, one will or may lose the opportunity to retrieve evidence.</p></speech>

As I have heard a great deal of commentary on extending that remit to GSOC, is this an absolute as far as Baroness O'Loan is concerned?</p></speech>

The situation in the North is that the Policing Board is the disciplinary authority for chief officers.  The chief officer is the disciplinary authority for other officers.  Consequently, the Police Ombudsman in the North has full power to investigate allegations against the chief officer.  I have stated publicly that to me, this is something without which I would not be prepared to operate.</p></speech>

In the course of the last public hearing on this issue a couple of weeks ago when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and GSOC were present, a discussion arose on the dual functions they conduct, where there is some crossover and whether the existence of both organisations as separate entities should be continued.  What are Baroness O'Loan's views in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800006#F01000"><p>My experience would suggest to me that they carry out completely different functions.  While I would anticipate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate would have a programme of rolling investigation of current policies, practices, training resources, use of resources and so on and would report on each investigation it does, GSOC has a completely different function, which is to investigate allegations of misconduct.  From allegations of misconduct, there always arise questions on management, training, supervision and that sort of thing.  In the North, we had a power to conduct policy and practice investigations of our own initiative without the consent of the Minister.  We would gather together the information and where we became aware of a trend of problems, perhaps about management, about securing evidence or about dealing with minorities, we would then conduct a policy and practice investigation and publish the results of that investigation on the website.  That is an enormously important contribution to the efficiency of policing.  It derives from the investigation of complaints and for GSOC to then hand that to the inspectorate to conduct these focused investigations would require the inspectorate to go back to the beginning.  That, therefore, would require, if one likes, a duplication of some of the work that already has been done by GSOC.</p> <p>I would retain the current structure of GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.</p></speech>

The only observation I can take from her submission is that the role of investigating misconduct by garda&iacute; should be assigned to GSOC.  I do not think that is a particularly shocking statement given the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  Should a serving member of the Garda be seconded to GSOC or how else might we provide GSOC with the necessary expertise?  Should we provide it with retired members of the Garda or would it be the case that somebody could make a career change, never to return?</p></speech>

In terms of where GSOC may get policing experience or policing knowledge, we would think that for the sake of independence and objectivity, it would be preferable not to have serving members of the Garda seconded to GSOC.  However, it would be open to GSOC to employ members of the Garda or other policing services who may have retired recently and have recent policing experience.  That may be beneficial.</p></speech>

In regard to interpretation of current legislation and new legislation coming through the Houses, what is Ms O'Sullivan's view on members of the force acting up without continuous professional development in the area of interpretation of the law?</p></speech>

One of our imperatives under our transformational programme is to identify the training priorities required for all of our members.  We are focused on getting that up and running quickly, beginning with issues around performance management.  We are introducing a new performance management and accountability framework, and providing training in that regard and in terms of the developmental issues that will arise in that context.  The recent Guerin report made a number of recommendations and an implementation team is considering those broader recommendations and prioritising training requirements, including basic police training such as the taking of statements and keeping up with revised and new legislation.</p></speech>

In my former office, which is now 14 years old, we recruited a number of bright young graduates and sent them on university-based investigative training courses.  They received all of the training that normal detectives would get in forensics and crime scene analysis.  GSOC adapted our training programmes to some degree, as did the Independent Police Commission in London.  There is a body of independent people who can be recruited and, indeed, GSOC has already recruited staff from the Police Ombudsman, which has also recruited back staff who worked for it before subsequently working for GSOC.  I suggest that is a very healthy interchange.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1014" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800007#G00700"><p>It is important that all professionals receive continuous professional development as the core of their ongoing work.  I concur that bringing people in from outside is always a good thing.  Ms O'Sullivan mentioned the internal audit and internal affairs type of structure in the force and spoke about whether that should be moved to GSOC as part of its role.  Perhaps that would not include the auditing element but the investigative element could certainly be considered.  I ask her to outline this in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800007#G00800"><p>In regard to the role of the internal affairs unit, we have a statutory provision for the establishment of a professional standards unit which will carry out thematic audits around policies, practices and procedures.  This is very useful in terms of identifying adherence to policy, practical or procedural issues or any systemic challenges that arise.  The role of the internal affairs section is to pursue any disciplinary issues that may arise in respect of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The disciplinary regulations set out an internal framework whereby members are investigated for disciplinary offences which may not amount to misconduct.  All cases of misconduct are referred to GSOC but the internal framework can deal with disciplinary offences that do not amount to misconduct or malpractice.  We envisage that the role of the professional standards unit in internal affairs would be come more robust to allow us to proactively identify any issues arising and, as happens in other jurisdictions, to allow us an opportunity consider integrity testing among members and identify issues before they become problems.  Where issues arise involving misconduct, malpractice or misbehaviour amounting to potential criminal behaviour, we would refer them to GSOC.</p><p>  I would like to provide more clarity in regard to some of the questions that Deputy Farrell raised earlier.  In regard to the powers of GSOC, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, GSOC enjoys all the privileges and powers of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As Ms O'Loan has noted, the power to search a member's private dwelling or private car is available.  It is important to note there is nothing that is beyond bounds.</p><p>  Before I conclude, I should introduce the team accompanying me.  Assistant Commissioner Donall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in is in charge of the western region.  Assistant Commissioner John Twomey is in charge of the Dublin metropolitan region and traffic.  Both officers have extensive experience in rural and urban policing.  Mr. Cyril Dunne is our chief administrative officer and Mr. Kenneth Ruane is our head of legal affairs.  Together we are leading the transformation programme I mentioned earlier and we can speak further about what we are doing if members so wish.</p></speech>

As I do not have particular knowledge of the area of freedom of information in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I appreciate his enlightening contribution.  Why does he believe a serving member of the force, at any level, should have access to the media?  In a hierarchical structure like the Garda, would it not be more appropriate to go to a senior officer or the press office?  I do not have a particular axe to grind; I am just asking a question.</p></speech>

In the United States it is extremely common and in other parts of northern Europe it is also common, although there are greater restrictions than in the United States.  Section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for a presumption of criminality against any officer who speaks to a journalist.  That is an extremely disproportionate position to take and it threatens the normal interplay between members of the media and garda&iacute;.  The idea that everything has to be referred upstairs is exactly part of the problem that members have been discussing.</p> <p>There needs to be a sense of responsibility on the part of ordinary folk doing a professional job and a recognition that they do so in a public arena.  Section 62 is far too punitive.</p></speech>

It also needs to be managed in a balanced and proportionate way with regard to the rights and privacy of individuals.  This is an important factor that needs to be considered in any amendment to the legislation.</p></speech>

I think of a case, for example, where somebody at an incident scene said that something had happened and described the incident scene in a particular way.  That was reported very widely.  It subsequently transpired that the officer who made that statement had not been fully informed and when all the information became available, there were then suggestions of a cover-up.  I would hesitate to go towards the freedom to speak to the media to the extent that the witness is suggesting.</p></speech>

I note that Ms O'Loan's detailed submission also includes that recommendation.  I am interested to hear the views of Ms O'Loan and of the acting Garda Commissioner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800008#H00500"><p>When I left office, about 11% of our complaints were dealt with by a process of informal resolution.  As it was not mediation, therefore it did not require the consent of the parties.  Officers had to co-operate with the process.  We dealt with rudeness complaints and minor failures of duty, for example, in that way.  Officers were very resistant to it on occasion but the reality was that it was actually a huge learning exercise, like on-the-job training, both for officers and for members of the public.  In the case of members of the public, it was about what they could legitimately expect of policing and for officers it was about the impact on people of the way in which they conducted themselves which may have been off-hand or brusque and which may have resulted from them working a very heavy shift, for example.  Nevertheless, this was interpreted by the member of the public as being rude and not the kind of service to which the public is entitled.  An informal resolution process can actually inform both parties and improve the service delivery by the officer.  Very often, having done this process, the officers in question are quite ready to apologise and very often the member of the public will accept the apology and will say the did not understand it was quite like that.</p><p>  I think it is in the interests of effective resolution of complaints.  The current situation where a garda can refuse to participate and can say he or she is not going to mediate is not helpful to policing here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800008#H00600"><p>The informal resolution process is a very important factor, as Ms O'Loan has said.  The majority of complaints made to GSOC are complaints which we and GSOC would assess as being service level complaints, exactly as Ms O'Loan has described.  They would be behavioural issues as opposed to issues of misconduct or misbehaviour.  There is certainly a lot to be learned from those complaints.  It would be a very positive move if we could come to a form of either agreement or triage.  We have had discussions with GSOC about whether it could triage service level complaints which could be referred back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the consent of the complainant, saying that the complaint would be dealt with.  Line management would deal with the bad behaviours.  Ms O'Loan's point is very important about the learning that emanates from these complaints.</p><p>  I regard the informal resolution process, with consent, as being the next tier.  However, we need to be very careful to achieve balance.  At the last committee meeting there was a suggestion of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vetoing the engagement with the informal resolution process.  We need to find a methodology that allows us to balance the rights of all the individuals, including the complainant and the person against whom the complaint is made, in order to achieve that informal resolution.  In my view, the service level agreement would allow us to have a tiered response to complaints and would make it a much more effective system and free up the resources and the time of the ombudsman commission to deal with the real issues that need to be dealt with such as misconduct, misbehaviour and criminality.</p></speech>

Unlike in the North of Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responsibility for intelligence, security and policing all under the one roof.  The contributors last week made the suggestion that we need more scrutiny similar to international practice.  What are the acting Garda Commissioner's thoughts on the suggestion of this committee having a role in scrutinising the crime and security branch of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces G2, subject to certain restrictions which apply, for example, in Britain or the United States?  There was a consensus that we need to see improved oversight of that area while not interfering in the important work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

The dual mandate for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the security and policing functions is admired by a number of international observers.  It was recently the subject of very positive commentary from a United Nations executive directorate.  It is a very important function which has served the State, the nation and the people very well.  We should remember that at the heart is the safety of communities.  As the Chairman has said, there is a very close correlation between the policing function and the security function, in particular, in the context of local policing on this island and the trust and confidence of the people of the country which has been built up over several years.</p><p>  On the question about oversight of the security side, there is extensive independent judicial oversight which reports directly to the Oireachtas.  It is independent oversight of the range of security activities.  In my view this should remain and it should be strengthened.  I would see it working in the context of the policing authority and then the security function.  I do not see them being incongruent in any way.  They can be complementary and be a support to each other when it comes to accountability, oversight and governance.  The way I envisage it working is that the Garda Commissioner would be accountable to the policing authority in respect of all policing matters and also reporting to the Minister, the Oireachtas and the Government on the security side.  That is the way it works in a number of other jurisdictions, in particular in Scandinavian jurisdictions, and it works particularly well.</p></speech>

The consequence was that under the legislation I had complete power to investigate national security matters.  Because of the interconnect between organised crime and national security, one must think of national security as being more wide than just in terms of anti-terrorist policing.  There can be a big economic threat to national security.  The right for GSOC to look at national security matters, to look at intelligence in particular, which I think seems to be, from the evidence I have read, one of the stumbling points between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is fundamental.</p><p>  When I started as police ombudsman it was anticipated that I would not look at national intelligence matters.  The reality was that it was necessary to do so to do the job.  There is no reason an independent investigative organisation cannot protect national security matters just as well as the police.  The same kind of people do the job and the same kind of vetting levels or protection of information procedures have to be applied.  In particular, GSOC, if it is to do this work, will have to have special intelligence cells, for example.</p> <p>It would be profoundly important - I do not in saying this mean to be in any way disrespectful - that because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can point to national security as a reason for refusing access, this would not viewed by the public as a cover-up.  I believe there is a huge risk of that.  I would commend to the committee, if necessary, an extension of the legislation to make absolutely clear the duty of the Garda Commissioner to provide all material necessary and that the call in terms of whether material is necessary for the investigation be GSOC's.  The responsibility of GSOC then is to prove to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it can protect that information.  This relates back to Mr. Brady's comments about dealing with the press.  It is not possible to do that when dealing with intelligence matters.</p></speech>

There are separate arrangements along the lines I have mentioned in terms of the differentiation between the two functions.  As stated by Baroness O'Loan, where there is a complaint of misconduct, misbehaviour or criminality on behalf of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether or not he or she operates on the security or policing side, it is right and appropriate that GSOC would investigate it.  We may be talking about two different things.  I was speaking about reporting arrangements in terms of the segregation of the policing and security function, which I think is critically important.  Any changes to the Act require careful determination.  In terms of GSOC having primacy in relation to investigations, that applies to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na irrespective of on what side of the organisation they work.</p></speech>

In regard to all of the recent debacles and, in some cases, scandals that have emerged, what are the learning curves for senior management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of dealing with whistleblowers and serious allegations?  I am sure the acting Garda Commissioner has had an opportunity to read the Guerin report, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in relation to the penalty point issues and the scale of maladministration in that regard and the Garda Inspectorate's findings.  What are the lessons for senior management in relation to all of that?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, while these may not always be fully right there will be issues in respect of which we will need to take prompt action.  One of the big learning curves is in terms of the perception of insularity.  We need to engage in much more open collaborative engagement, be willing to discuss matters in a much more open way and demonstrate what we are doing about particular matters.  The team I have brought with me, together with the remainder of the senior management team, are leading the way in transformational change, addressing the issues that have been identified.  One of the big issues is the culture of insularity.  Members will have heard me say before that there must be greater engagement with those who are our critical friends internally and externally.  We must support people in doing that and empower them to come forward and engage with us in a much more open way.  We must ensure we engage, listen, understand and act.  That is key issue for us.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the inspectorate's report.  There are lessons in everything.  What is important for us is that we learn from those lessons and implement the change that is required.  In regard to the Guerin report, we have already started an implementation programme around the broad recommendations in that report.  Deputy Farrell asked earlier about training.  That is one of the issues identified from that report, which we have prioritised.</p><p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we must ensure that we listen, understand and take action as appropriate and that we engage with all of our stakeholders.  We were very fortunate over the past number of years in that we have something which is pretty unique in terms of policing in the context of the strategic human rights advisory committee.  I recently sought to meet with the committee in regard to review of the Ionann report which is now almost ten years old.  It would provide us with a great opportunity to identify what the issues are internally and externally.  Public perception is really important.  We need to restore public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are engaged in doing so in every way we can.</p></speech>

It is reported again today in the media that Sergeant Maurice McCabe is very isolated, unable to attend work and has made repeated complaints about how he is being treated.  I spoke to him today on the basis of the article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I am deeply alarmed by what he told me today in regard to the lack of support from senior Garda management.  Will the acting Garda Commissioner ring him and find out from him what the problem is and deal with the issue?  I ask the her to ensure that matter is resolved today.  In fairness, he has been granted access to the PULSE system, which is welcome.  Sergeant McCabe is at the epicentre of public opinion and represents the change that is necessary.</p></speech>

I am also very conscious of Sergeant McCabe's right to privacy in terms of some of the issues reported and do not intend to breach that here.  What I can say is that senior Garda management are very supportive of Sergeant McCabe and are in contact with him on a daily basis.  On foot of some of the media reporting, I spoke today to the interim confidential recipient, Judge McMahon, and have asked him to facilitate and assist us in making contact with Sergeant McCabe's legal adviser to identify precisely what the issues are that we are speaking about.</p></speech>

Some of the witnesses who appeared before us a couple of weeks queried whether the separation of the confidential recipient and GSOC was a good or bad thing.  Perhaps Baroness O'Loan and the acting Garda Commissioner will comment on whether they believe the confidential recipient should come under the auspices of GSOC or if it should be completely separate.</p></speech>

In that situation, I believe it would be entirely appropriate for GSOC to be the recipient and to have a unit dedicated to such whistleblowing activity.  If this were done, the whistleblower would be assured that the person to whom he or she was reporting was independent.  However, one would have to buttress that by the introduction of a duty on managers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal positively with whistleblowers and make it a disciplinary offence not to positively respond to or manage whistleblowing.  There is an article in the PSNI code of ethics, which is its disciplinary code, which makes it an offence not to do this.  If one does a number of things together then this makes whistleblowing possible.</p> <p>Whistleblowing is about improving policing.  Nobody becomes a police officer to do wrong.  Corruption, carelessness and laziness creep in.  I would place it within GSOC with a statutory power.  I do not believe it would be adequate to have a non-statutory recipient of some type outside that, so I would put it within GSOC and then give it the proper powers and the limited remit.  One would not want them dealing with human resource disputes between members and things like that.</p></speech>

It is equally important to point out that under our disciplinary regulations it is a criminal offence if somebody is being bullied, harassed or victimised in the workplace.  That is an important point.  As I said earlier, our aim is to create a very positive working environment and we will certainly not tolerate bullying, harassment or intimidation of any type of any of our members.  With regard to the issue raised, the Protected Disclosures Bill creates an opportunity for us to identify the best mechanism to deal with it, and that will be very welcome.</p></speech>

If I may, I will return to the Deputy's previous question.  I do not think it is enough to deal with bullying and harassment of whistleblowers.  One must also have a function which deals with turning a blind eye - the blue wall where nothing happens when somebody does something.</p><p>  With regard to oversight, my understanding would be that GSOC is responsible to the courts by way of judicial review.  It must be responsible to the D&aacute;il.  There would be a requirement that one does not second-guess the process of criminal investigation and such matters, but I believe parliamentary accountability is the best process for calling to account an organisation such as GSOC.  At present, as I understand it, GSOC reports to the Minister for Justice and Equality, and that is where the accountability lies.  To my mind that is too close a relationship and there is not sufficient independence for the Minister or for GSOC in that arrangement.  There is also not sufficient power for Parliament.  I suggest that there should be a reporting to this committee, perhaps, or to whatever committee is considered appropriate, as well as the responsibility to the courts and to a freedom of information commissioner.  There will be a raft of other levels of accountability also where GSOC is making decisions that might be challenged through other legal processes.</p></speech>

In the jurisdiction in which I was operating we were subject to freedom of information provisions.  There were special protections for ongoing investigations and the like.  We worked with it and it was challenging and difficult, but it did not compromise investigation.  I think it is a healthy process.</p></speech>

My first question is for the acting Garda Commissioner.  In the first two paragraphs of her written submission she talks about substantial reform, trust, respect, confidence, accountability, transparency and professionalism.  Those are the main points in those paragraphs.  Would she not say that on the ground the opposite has been the case in recent months and that people have lost their confidence and trust in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Many people, both within the Garda and in the wider community, are deeply disturbed about some of the evidence that has come forward from people such as the whistleblowers.</p></speech>

I do not think it is just confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also confidence in the entire administration.  It is very important that we work hard and tirelessly in the context of restoring that public confidence and demonstrating that, as an administration, we are collectively fully committed to addressing these issues and putting them right.  In the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na specifically, we have the programme.  A programme in itself means nothing; the issue is the actions under that programme.  The first thing I did on becoming interim Garda Commissioner was to engage very widely with our internal and external stakeholders.  By that I mean that I met, along with my senior management team, individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in stations.  I considered it very important that in times of turbulence they knew there was strong visible leadership from the top and that the norms, values and standards we expect were being driven from the top.</p><p>  There are almost 16,000 people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including uniformed and sworn members, civilians and the Garda Reserve.  I can give a good example.  Last weekend, at the One Direction concerts which were attended by 250,000 people over three nights, I went to meet and brief our members who were dealing with that.  As I said to them, there are so many things we can do.  People ask me every day if I will go out and refute what is being said.  I do not think it is right to refute what is being said.  The right thing to do is to allow a process to take place where all of the allegations that have been made are fully investigated.  We very much welcome that and will co-operate with the commissions of investigation.  As I told the members both in the rural stations around the country and in Croke Park last week, the public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be restored by them and by the people in our support offices one encounter at a time.  Every time a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages with somebody it is an opportunity to demonstrate the professionalism, dedication, energy and commitment that I spoke about in my opening address.  I firmly believe that is how we will restore public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  From a leadership point of view, it is very important that we provide strong, visible leadership, that we hold people to account and, equally, that we hold ourselves to account for living up to the values and behaviour we expect of our members.  Collectively, we can work together to restore public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The work that is being done in reforming the 2005 Act will help that and support the programme we have already initiated.</p></speech>

Many people have said to me, particularly in recent weeks, that because of all of the shenanigans going on in the justice system between senior garda&iacute;, management and whistleblowers, people have taken their eye off the ball regarding organised crime in this city.  Is that true?  Will there be a big focus on organised crime?</p><p>  The bodies of two people from my constituency were found shot and dumped in a ditch.  There are people who are being intimidated every day by drugs gangs and some of them have said to me that the guards need to focus on these issues.  Can the acting Garda Commissioner give me a commitment today that there is a focus on that type of crime all of the time, regardless of what is going on in here?</p></speech>

The Deputy has agreed to head up some work on this area and we are going to focus on it specifically as a committee.

I know they were from the Deputy's constituency.  I have extended my condolences to those families.  We worked tirelessly to discover and recover the bodies and, unfortunately, bodies were recovered.  Our members worked tirelessly to do that work and it demonstrated our commitment in one sense.</p><p>  The Deputy looked for a commitment.  I am on public record over recent weeks as saying that our determination to tackle drugs, organised crime, terrorism and all their manifestations has not been diminished in any way.  Our members are tirelessly devoted to doing such work.  Since April of this year alone, over the past five weeks, we have seized drugs worth in excess of &euro;29 million, which is evidence of our determination to continue such work.</p></speech>

I will go back to Ms O'Loan.  She stated: "GSOC cannot currently investigate complaints or allegations against the Commissioner."  Is she saying that if it does not happen, the new legislation will be ineffective?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800011#L03600"><p>It is for the D&aacute;il to determine the content of its legislation.  I am saying that I do not think that I would be capable of operating a system in which the Commissioner was not accountable.  I do not quite know how the legislation emerged in the form that it did.  My anticipation would be that it will probably change.</p></speech>

There is a very low level of informal resolution here."  Why is there a low level of complaints?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800011#L03800"><p>My understanding is that the legislation says that the officer must consent to the process and that only 1% of complaints here are dealt with in this form because the majority of officers do not consent.  This is something on which GSOC gave evidence.  When I left my post of Police Ombudsman, we had 11% of complains of that nature being dealt with through informal resolution to the benefit of complainants, officers and the service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800011#L03900"><p>It sounds like low level complaints should be dealt with.  In every other job and position that people work in, 90% of complaints can often be dealt with and buried or got off the pitch, so to speak.  Can Ms O'Loan give examples of places where there is a higher percentage of resolution?  Are there examples of good practice available in terms of how low level complaints are treated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800011#L04000"><p>I was not altogether satisfied with the way in which it was done because we had to allow police inspectors to do the informal resolution.  We were involved but we had to allow the inspectors to do it but I would have preferred to have done it myself.  We then tried to introduce a mediation process, but I left at that stage.</p><p>  Having said all that, it is eminently possible to devise a scheme whereby these complaints are dealt with.  It is important that where a thing can be dealt with by GSOC, it is dealt with by GSOC.  For the Garda to do so almost inevitably costs more because, I guess, a Garda inspector or Garda superintendent will earn more than a GSOC manager who would do this kind of work.  Also, it would be the inspector, sergeant or maybe the superintendent who would have to deal with it depending on the rank of the officer against whom the complaint was made.  Therefore, it would be cheaper.  It also enables somebody who presents with an apparently very simple complaint to gain trust in the complaints organisation - GSOC - and to present with something more serious because they are testing the system and asking themselves whether they dare bring it to the organisation.</p></speech>

That was not what I meant to say.  My objection was to the presumption in favour of criminality on the part of contact between a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a member of the press without the approval of a senior officer.  The presumption of criminality is the problem.  Relationships with the media need to be managed, as the acting Commissioner said subsequently.</p> <p>I recognise that but they need to be managed in the normal way in which they are managed in every other major social organisation and that is through disciplinary controls rather than through the automatic presumption that this is a criminal matter.  What I was trying to say was that was disproportionate.  I hope I have made my point clearly enough.</p></speech>

It is seen universally by colleagues who talk to me as a problem, as a body set up in order to prevent information being distributed.  I have never dealt with it but my students have and they have come back with basically an extremely negative experience.  There should be greater contact between members of the Garda and the media, but not centralised.  It cannot be centralised in the way the Garda press office is.  It does not happen elsewhere, as far as I know.</p></speech>

As previous speakers said, we have had hearings attended by other groups.  I would like to ask the visitors for their views on the thoughts of, and presentations given, by previous groups.</p><p>  I would like to ask Baroness O'Loan a question.  Before GSOC's attendance at this committee, it made a number of public pronouncements in the media and to other committees on high levels and low levels of co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and itself in terms of interaction in investigating complaints by members of the public.   What was her experience in Northern Ireland when her office was established?  Did she experience that and, if so, how did she deal with it?  In fairness to GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that is an issue with which they are both dealing and they are working to try to bring themselves closer together, which is good to hear and is in the public interest.  Did Baroness O'Loan experience that and, if so, how did she deal with it?  What were the results?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.138" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800012#M00600"><p>I have published a number of reports in which I have commented on the level of co-operation I received at different times and in different investigations.  Sometimes it was good and sometimes it was not.  I had something which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission does not have, which is that I had a statutory right to such information as I required.  That was enormously important because when the police said to me, "You cannot have this, it is not relevant and we do not have  it", I always had the right to go back and say, "My test, my choice, my search", and that was profoundly important.</p><p>  The discussion should not be about whether there is an entitlement to look at material which may be relevant to the investigation because the police will not know precisely what one is investigating when one is investigating police officer wrongdoing and, therefore, it cannot judge the relevance of the material.  It can judge the sensitivity of the material but that is a completely separate argument.  </p><p>  I was disappointed to read the recent comments at the previous session at which the Garda ombudsman commissioners gave evidence that there still seemed to be problems in this context.  I would have expected that, nine years on, these matters would largely have been ironed out and that there would have been a process through which information would transmit seamlessly and in a timely fashion.  It is a problem for every independent investigative organisation and it is one which can be, and should be, solved.</p></speech>

In other words, how well resourced was her office in terms of the complement or size of the PSNI as against the resourcing of GSOC and the capacity it has to do its job in the context of the size An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

That required a level of staffing and a level of resourcing which is far greater than that which GSOC has at present.</p><p>  When I started there were 13,000 RUC officers and when I left, there were somewhere in the region of 7,000 to 7,500.  I had somewhere of the order of approximately 150 staff.  If one is to do the job, one must be resourced.  My suspicion is that at the moment, there does not seem to be sufficient resources for GSOC to do the job it is charged with doing.  However, I would have to qualify that by saying, I would have to go away and do a clear analysis before I could make a very much more definitive statement.</p></speech>

I am not asking them for their personal opinions but for their collective view as a management team.  I refer to the establishment of the independent policing authority.  I am asking them about this because we all have an open mind on it, we are on a journey and we are trying to arrive at a consensus on how we set up the nuts and bolts of this new independent organisation.  What is their view on the board of the independent policing authority, on its make-up, its complement and its components, for example, civil society groups, the Oireachtas and local authorities?

We agreed to engage constructively to continue that improvement.  That is important in terms of managing the relationship and to put that on record.</p><p>  In regard to the independent policing authority, as I said in my opening address, it is very welcome and I think it will lend itself to independent objective oversight.  The composition of the committee is a matter for the Legislature.  As the Deputy quite rightly said, we have discussed it as a collective management team because what we are very determined to do is to ensure that our layers of governance and accountability are revised and renewed to provide a level of readiness to service the needs of the new authority.  In terms of its make-up, I think it should be as extensive as possible in terms of representation but again, I know that is a matter under determination by this committee and by others, so I would leave that up to the people determining it.

In terms of what we are doing ourselves, part of the work we have undertaken is to look at the revised governance and accountability, so that will certainly take account of responsibilities and how they should be shared out to provide the level of openness and transparency I just mentioned.

At any time since Ms O'Sullivan has taken up the position of acting Garda Commissioner or in her role in the latter weeks and months of her predecessor, Commissioner Martin Callinan, did any member of the senior management telephone, write to or communicate with Sergeant Maurice McCabe to tell him he is a valuable member of the force, a valuable employee and that the force cared about him?</p></speech>

He has been afforded every support, including that of the welfare services.</p><p>  The Deputy asked me a specific question earlier.  Rather than tell an assistant commissioner not to meet him, I sent an assistant commissioner to meet him and to provide him with some reassurance.

In the context of matters that Mr. Ronan Brady raised, and I know it is not specifically about freedom of information but of serving the public interest, it is the right thing to do.  I know that Mr. Brady referred to centralisation but it is important to say that not only does the Garda have a centralised press office but also local people to deal with local media.  It is a very useful mechanism for connectivity with people.  As part of the renewal programme, we have a pillar around communications and renewed communications and a strategic communications plan. I do not like to speak of communications in those terms but let me explain what it means.  It means reaching out to people through new mechanisms in media, such as social media and new ways of connecting with people.  All of the measures combined contribute to the openness and transparency I spoke about in my opening address.</p></speech>

I was interested in Ms O'Sullivan's remarks and the way she tied them to her comments on local policing committees.  Many recommendations were made for having a broad representation in the context of the independent policing authority and that part of it should be some form of civic oversight.  Whereas the local policing committees appear to be relevant in terms of accountability, as Ms O'Sullivan indicates, that may not mean the same things as oversight.  Would Ms O'Sullivan comment on whether the members of civil society who are part of the local policing committees would be appropriate potential candidates for the independent policing authority?</p></speech>

As I have said, we must be accountable to national bodies but equally it is extremely important that we must be accountable to the communities we serve.  The joint policing committees and the local policing fora have been instrumental all over the country in terms of identifying local issues and using a joint problem-solving approach to actually solve the problems.  That should continue and be strengthened in the new Act.  It is how we provide a responsive policing service to all of our communities.  It is important to have inclusive representation from all aspects of the committees but, as Deputy Collins says, without becoming over wieldy or too large.</p></speech>

Under the Act, GSOC is restricted from expressing an opinion on the merits of Government policy or when a Minister is giving evidence, does she think this should be amended or charged?  This may be relevant to the point made in her presentation about improving policing, as GSOC does not have the right under legislation to make recommendation for change.</p></speech>

It would have to be within the remit.  The reason I asked the Senator to clarify her question was because I was not quite sure what it was.  I think it is profoundly important that GSOC can look at police policy in practice and comment on it.</p><p>  If the Government is deciding to spend X% of its policing and security budget on an aspect of policing, such as renewing all the fleet, is the Senator asking if that is a matter on which GSOC should comment?  I am sorry, I do not think I have clarity on what the Senator meant.</p></speech>

We greatly value the insights we have gained from the witnesses.  I wish to address a question to the acting Garda Commissioner, to Baroness O'Loan and I have a general question.</p><p>  At the last set of hearings I asked about the Garda whistleblowers charter.  Before the departure of Commissioner Callinan, I had written to him requesting a copy.  The AGSI, which was represented at the last hearing had a copy of the charter but it was not sure if it was accessible to the public.  I may have asked the wrong person in the past.  Is the charter publicly accessible?  Should it be publicly accessible?  Should it extend not just to serving garda&iacute; but also, for example, to police doctors or to those who are not serving members of the force but are working in Garda stations, and therefore are privy to internal police practices?</p></speech>

Should we consider having a one-person Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in the context of the overall reform of GSOC?  As the first Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, did Baroness O'Loan find it helpful to be the person in whom the entire identity of the office was located or would a tripartite model be better?  Does Baroness O'Loan have a view on the matter?</p></speech>

I did not find this a disadvantage, however.  On the contrary, it was clearly an advantage to me because one of the problems with people wanting to complain about anything, whether their shampoo or policing service, is that they do not know how to do so or where to go to do so.  That people could identify an individual as the policing ombudsman made for much better accessibility in respect of the office.  From that perspective, the one-person model was beneficial.</p><p>  I also took the decision to be out and about in the community.  I took a policy decision that I would always allow anyone who wanted to come into the office to do so at any time.  If I was free, I would speak to people, although that is difficult when one is trying to run a busy diary.  This was, however, an issue of accessibility.  </p><p>  Different people will make different policy decisions.  The three or five person model has advantages in that the burden is shared and one has a deputy if one falls ill.  These are advantages.  It is a matter for the Legislature to make up its own mind on the issue, as there is not necessarily a right way of approaching it.  The people of Northern Ireland were served well by having one ombudsman.  Further, ombudsmen are usually single individuals rather than commissions.</p></speech>

I note the use of the word "independent" in the title of the new authority.

This committee or another committee of the Oireachtas could appoint a group of people who would independently appoint a policing authority.  In my terms of reference, at least an element of the appointments process should be by open competition.  I envisage the political parties having a vested interest and it may well be that they will legislate for some members of each party to be on the authority.  One must guard against politicising policing.</p></speech>

Is it advisable that it remain as such or should it come within the remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission?  It was clear from the presentation given by GSOC that there is a good relationship between the Garda Inspectorate and GSOC?  Would it be a good idea to bring them together?</p><p>  Ms O'Sullivan suggested that Garda internal affairs and the Garda professional standards unit be aligned.  At what point would a matter that comes to the attention of either of these entities be referred to GSOC?  What mechanism is in place for dealing with such circumstances?</p></speech>

Any issue that would be identified by internal affairs or the professional standards unit that involves misbehaviour, misconduct or malpractice on the part of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be immediately referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  That is how we envisage the process would work.</p><p>  On disciplinary issues, some of the issues identified in the Guerin report, for example, a lack of file management and matters that may not amount to misconduct but include the types of issues identified by Baroness O'Loan, including apathy or laziness, would be dealt with in the internal disciplinary framework.  Appropriate interventions would be taken in terms of training and these would need to be satisfied.  If any indication or insinuation of wrongdoing were identified, it would be immediately transferred or referred to GSOC for investigation.  That is how we envisage that process working.  This approach would allow us to be much more proactive and I envisage that it would work very much with our occupational health department.  This will involve looking for issues that require interventions at an early stage and being able to work on the policy, process and systems side with professional standards, and on the people side with internal affairs.  </p><p>  The Deputy asked about the Garda Inspectorate.  As I noted in my opening statement, the independent policing authority, in conjunction with the Garda Inspectorate and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, provide a type of tripartite oversight, which will, I believe, ensure public confidence and enhanced accountability.  In respect of some of the questions asked, it is equally important, in terms of reinforcing public confidence, that these bodies are also seen to be demonstrably accountable.  </p></speech>

It may also include matters referred to in chapters 1, 20 and 23 of that report.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Purcell and his colleagues.</p><p>  The format of the meeting will see Mr. Purcell invited to make an opening statement, which will be followed by a questions and answers session.  Mr. Purcell has supplied members of the committee with a detailed opening statement, but I understand he intends to read from a shorter version at this point.  We may raise other issues during the course of the meeting.  As we have already had a long session, some two and a half hours, Mr. Purcell will excuse us if we seem a little tired.  It has been a long day so far.</p><p>  Before beginning, I draw the attention of witnesses to the position in regard to privilege.  They should note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should also be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Mr. Purcell to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

My aim is to be as helpful as I can in their deliberations.  If they will permit, I will add a few key points.</p><p>  As the committee is aware, recent events have led to the establishment of the Fennelly commission of investigation, which will have an opportunity to hear from all sides regarding what was an unprecedented, complex and difficult matter.  A further commission is to be established following the publication of the Guerin report.  In addition to these inquiries, the Government has outlined a comprehensive system-wide reform plan that represents a sea change in the way policing will be delivered.  This process is being led by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who has announced a number of measures.</p><p>  Legislation is being prepared to establish an independent Garda authority by the end of this year.  This is a major reform initiative that will transform the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government.  In future, Garda Commissioners will be appointed following an open competition.  This process will be undertaken by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and means that the post of Commissioner will be filled with regard to best recruitment practices.</p><p>  Legislation is being drafted to strengthen the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  As the Minister has stated, the measures in prospect will bring the Garda Commissioner within the scope of the complaints that can be dealt with by GSOC and increase the capacity and remit of GSOC to initiate reviews of Garda practice and procedure without reference to the Minister.</p><p>  The Garda Inspectorate is to carry out a follow-up review of the Guerin report, covering serious crime investigation, management and operational and procedural issues, taking into account the implementation of recommendations already made by the inspectorate in earlier reports and also work currently under way by the inspectorate.</p><p>  Crucially, the Protected Disclosures Bill, as introduced by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will include provisions to enable a Garda whistleblower to report concerns to GSOC for independent investigation.  This will mean that Garda whistleblowers will, from now on, have a strong legal framework within which to report concerns, strong legal protection against penalisation and the opportunity of a fully independent legal examination of their concerns.</p><p>  A review of the performance, management and administration of the Department of Justice of Equality will also be undertaken by independent experts before the summer recess.</p><p>  These measures are designed to transform oversight and accountability and, taken together, will constitute a fundamental change in the way the Garda is managed and relates to the Government and the Department.</p><p>  As I outlined in my statement, the Department has a broad remit.  On the Garda side, the Department's purpose can be said to be one of supporting the Garda on the one hand and seeking to achieve appropriate accountability to the Government on the other.  The context for all of this has evolved over decades when the very existence of the State was under threat.  It is now clear, and the Department recognises fully, that the arrangements for dealing with Garda whistleblowers did not prove fit for purpose.  In so far as that may have involved shortcomings on the part of the Department, I have no hesitation in apologising to all those who have been affected by those shortcomings, including the whistleblowers themselves.</p><p>  In considering the issues before the committee, we need to consider the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which is the framework provided by the Oireachtas within which the Department and Garda operate.  The Act distinguishes between the roles of the Minister and the Commissioner, the Minister being responsible for policy and direction and the Commissioner being responsible for independently running the force.  The framework includes independent oversight by GSOC and independent inspection by the Garda Inspectorate.  It also provides for the role of confidential recipient.</p><p>  The tools in the Act provide for the Commissioner to account to the Government and Minister through the Secretary General.  There is a duty on the Commissioner to keep the Minister and Secretary General fully informed on various important matters and the Minister is in turn accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>I say this not to seek to pass the parcel but rather to point to the complex web that exists to ensure the operational independence of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while at the same time ensuring accountability.  The extent to which this framework has worked or not worked, and why, will no doubt be teased out by the forthcoming commission of inquiry.  In fairness to the staff of the Department, I have to make clear my belief that we were at all times motivated by one thing alone, which was to act in the public interest within the law.  In that context, I believe that we acted in a reasonable manner within the structures in place at the time.  A lot has worked.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had notable success on the crime detection and security fronts.  Some things have not worked and we may have been slower than we might have been in responding to those.</p><p> The truth is that the structures put a lot of reliance on the relationship between the Garda Commissioner and the Minister and Department.  Given the sensitive issues being dealt with, mutual trust and confidence is and has always been crucial in this relationship and this has been built up over a long period of time, not during the term of any single officeholder.  The legislation provides for a duty to account and to provide information supplemented by the independent oversight mechanism of GSOC.  We do not have a separate investigative set-up in the Department.  It is always a challenge in dealing with complex agencies to avoid &ldquo;regulatory capture&rdquo; and this is where lessons can be learnt as we, collectively, consider what enhanced structures and processes should now be put in place. </p><p> This raises the legitimate question of whether over a long period we could have done better in learning lessons and improving Garda accountability.  Yes, we could have done.  I cannot say that we have always, at all times, achieved a perfect balance in managing critical policy and operational issues across the huge range of justice and equality responsibilities.  Most assuredly, I acknowledge that the Guerin report has given rise to a grave situation which I must devote my utmost effort and attention to resolving though specific and targeted changes.</p><p> Some of the relentless criticism of the Department and the excellent people whom I have the privilege to lead as Secretary General is not well founded.  I recognise, however, that confidence in the Department has been damaged and must be quickly restored.  There is in the Department a determination to change what needs to be changed and to turn recent events into an opportunity to learn key lessons and put them into action.</p><p> As Secretary General of the Department, I hope to engage with members of the Committee to explain matters as best I can.  I also look forward to the outcome of the committee&rsquo;s current consultative process in contributing to the ongoing work to identify the best way to address the weaknesses that have been exposed.  Having said that, and as I have explained in my written statement, I hope members will understand that I am somewhat constrained in what I can deal with.</p><p> I fully appreciate these matters are of legitimate interest to committee members.  The difficulty is that, although it would be much easier in many ways to come in here today and fully answer their questions, I must respect the fact that the Fennelly commission has to undertake the work it has been charged with by the Government and these Houses. </p><p> The Government has also decided that a commission of investigation will be established following publication of the Guerin report so some constraint must also be applied to those issues.  The commission in that instance has yet to be established and its terms of reference have not yet been fixed.  I will, therefore, try to assist the committee as best I can on the issues Mr. Guerin raised about the Department but I hope it will understand that it may not be possible as yet to deal in detail with matters which must be left to the commission of investigation.</p><p> The report raises fundamental issues about the statutory framework and various agencies of the justice system, including the Department of Justice and Equality.  Of course, the nature of Mr. Guerin's review meant that he did not find himself in a position to comprehensively address these broader issues.  Presumably because of the timescale involved and because his primary purpose was to consider whether a further inquiry was necessary, at which all parties would have an opportunity to present their cases, he did not seek any views from the Department or the Minister on why it responded as it did to the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe.  Neither, for reasons which he outlined, did Mr Guerin have the benefit of the GSOC perspective on these matters.  Inevitably, this means that the legal analysis contained in the report and the understanding of the policy issues involved are incomplete.  The commission of investigation will provide an opportunity for these to be teased out fully.</p><p> As he emphasises in his report, the purpose of the review was not to make any findings of fact or to determine any disputed question either of fact or law.  Mr. Guerin questions the lack of formal submissions, etc., to the Minister.  In hindsight, the lack of such material which, had it existed might have been of assistance to Mr. Guerin, is regrettable, although this reflects a practice that Ministers might often be briefed orally on particular matters and draft replies prepared in line with that briefing.  It is, however, absolutely the case that the Department and the Minister were aware of the ministerial functions, scope and limitations of the provisions in sections 42 and 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and of the functions and provisions of the confidential recipient regulations.  The Department had a very detailed and nuanced understanding of these legal provisions which I will go through in detail.</p><p> I accept that the record keeping meant that Mr. Guerin does not have the full picture of the thinking in the Department on the action it took and the advice it gave or, indeed, of the then Minister's thinking.  I emphasise that before all of this came to light and as part of a review of risks around communications, information and records, I commissioned an internal project which is well under way to address our record keeping and other related matters. </p><p> It has undoubtedly been the practice of the Department and successive Ministers to place considerable reliance on what they are told by the Garda Commissioner of the day.  There are obvious reasons for this.  The Government appoints a Garda Commissioner because it has confidence in her or him to run the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whose functions include detecting crime, preserving law and order and national security.  If the Department or the Minister were not in a position to place such reliance on what the Garda Commissioner said, this would have the most serious implications.  By law, the Garda Commissioner has the function of directing and controlling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He or she is also responsible for the maintenance of good order and discipline within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> There is a further crucial point which does not appear to be analysed in the report.  The Minister had been advised by the Garda Commissioner in his report that the investigations into Sergeant McCabe&rsquo;s substantive allegations had been based on earlier reports made to the confidential recipient.  The Minister and the Department, naturally, knew of the provision in the confidential recipient regulations providing that all allegations made through the confidential reporting mechanism have to be notified to GSOC, in accordance with arrangements agreed with GSOC, and would have been conscious of the rationale for this, namely, that GSOC would have knowledge of the allegations and the response and could initiate an investigation in the public interest under section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 if it thought it appropriate.  This was, as it was intended to be, a substantial reassurance for the Department and the Minister on the existence of independent oversight in relation to the investigation of the allegations.  This is aside from the fact that the Garda files on these matters were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed no prosecution.</p><p> Neither the Department nor the Minister is an investigatory body or has investigatory powers.  The Minister does have powers under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to require the carrying out of investigations, but it is important to understand the detail of those powers in order to analyse Mr Guerin&rsquo;s key findings in relation to the Minister and the Department and I will be happy to expand on this, in so far as I can, for the committee&rsquo;s information.</p><p> None of what is set out here is intended to minimise the difficulties which have arisen.  We had already recognised that the legal provisions for dealing with whistleblowers were proving inadequate and that there should be a mechanism for complaints to be made directly by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to GSOC.  It is intended simply to set out why the advice which was given and the decisions taken within the Department were considered reasonable given the structures in place at the time.</p><p> As I stated in my letter to the clerk of the committee, I will be happy to return at a future date to discuss these issues in detail with the committee when the various commissions in being and to be established have issued their findings.</p></speech>

Several issues arise from it and from his correspondence with the committee.  As he is aware, the committee wrote to the Government at the time requesting that, among other things, the circumstances leading to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner be referred to the Fennelly commission.  The committee reserved its right to revisit these issues any time.  We recognise that under the terms of reference we cannot follow what is happening in a court or tribunal.</p> <p>However, this is neither a court nor a tribunal but a commission of investigation, which is different.  It is not mentioned in the terms of reference.  Even though there were numerous opportunities to change standing orders over the years, that did not occur.  I maintain that we are perfectly within our remit to raise questions with respect to that issue, even though the commission is inquiring.  The reason we are concerned is that it is a matter which in our view could be cleared up very quickly and easily and which should be.  This is a forum where it could happen and where Mr. Purcell could inform the committee very clearly and in plain English what exactly happened on that night.  I invite him to do so now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.206" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800017#R00200"><p>I have said already that I wanted to make it clear that in my appearance before the committee I am anxious to assist in every way I can with the matters raised in the invitation.  However, as I have indicated, I am precluded from discussing certain matters.  I have said already that I am quite happy, at the appropriate time after the commissions have reported, to discuss it in full with the committee.  I have sent a copy of the letter I received from the Fennelly commission for information.  I drew the attention of the committee to the fact that the commission states it will treat my reply and my statement in confidence, save to the extent that it may be required under the provisions of the Act, particularly section 12, to disclose them or to include them in its reports in accordance with section 32 of the Act.  Further, the commission's letter refers to section 11 of the Act stating that, subject to certain exceptions, it requires the commission to conduct its investigations in private.</p><p>  The committee's letter makes it clear that they intend for me to give my evidence in public.  Accordingly, any inquiry by the committee which impinges on paragraphs N and O of the commission's terms of reference - or, indeed, any of the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission - is highly likely to undermine and prejudice the work of the commission and will run counter to the commission's procedures to conduct its investigation in private.  It would also mean that I would be giving evidence in public and in advance of any other witnesses relevant to the Fennelly commission who would be giving their evidence in private and who would already have heard or read any evidence that I gave in public if I did so.</p><p>  I have already mentioned the Oireachtas standing order to which the committee referred, which states that a matter may not be raised in such a way that it appears to be an attempt to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal.  I acknowledge that although the standing order does not specifically refer to a commission of inquiry, because the standing orders predate the 2004 Act, the intention is clear.  Accordingly, I asked the committee to take this into consideration and to refrain from inquiring on any matters that impinge upon any of the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  Having regard to the above, the committee's own terms of reference cannot be used to undermine or prejudice the specific remit given to Mr. Justice Fennelly by way of resolution passed in the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into matters within its terms of reference.  The terms of reference of the joint committee on justice, with its remit of inquiring into the administration of the Department, cannot be used to undermine or prejudice the Fennelly commission's work, a task given to it by the Oireachtas.</p><p>  Furthermore, on the matter of the Guerin report, the Government has decided and made public its decision to establish a commission of investigation under the Act to investigate the issues identified by Se&aacute;n Guerin in his report as warranting further inquiry.  As the establishment of the commission is imminent, I am deeply concerned that my giving of evidence in public to the committee at this point would in the same way potentially undermine and prejudice the work of the intended commission.</p><p>  I stated in my remarks that I regard the Guerin report and the proposed commission of investigation in a slightly different light, although I remain very concerned about my giving of evidence in public to this committee or, indeed, anywhere else where I might be asked to give it, as it has the potential to prejudice and impinge on that commission of investigation, the establishment of which is imminent.  However, I am prepared to answer questions relating to the Guerin report to the best of my ability, but I ask the Chairman to give me some leeway, in the context of how I may answer the questions about the Guerin report, to take account of the issues I have raised.  My position is clear with regard to any issues that are covered by the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  I have circulated the letter I received from Mr. Justice Fennelly in respect of that matter.  Members of the committee will have had an opportunity to read it and to consider it.  </p><p>  I have never before found myself, and I hope never again to find myself, in a position where in any way I might be seen to be anything other than the absolute maximum of assistance to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but I think this is a rather unusual position to be placed in where a commission of investigation chaired by a Supreme Court judge has been established whose work is already under way.  It seems to me to be a rather unique situation in that what could be seen as a parallel inquiry is proceeding while I am being asked to give evidence relating to matters covered by the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  I am unfortunately in a position where I have to say I simply will not be able to answer questions relating to that matter.  I hope that the committee will understand the difficult situation in which I find myself.  I appreciate the point made by the Chairman and I reiterate my commitment that at such a time as the Fennelly commission completes its deliberations and produces its report - regardless of the outcome of that report and whatever findings it may make - I will be quite happy to come in to this or any other committee to discuss any matters of relevance that the committee seeks to inquire into.</p></speech>

Our advice is that the commission of investigation rules do not preclude the committee from looking at any of these matters, nor do they apply to this committee.  We received this advice today in advance of the meeting.  There are numerous ongoing investigations into the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have seen the retirement of a Garda Commissioner, the resignation of a Minister and a number of other issues which need to be dealt with.  Mr. Purcell will excuse members of the committee and myself for being extremely concerned about what we have seen and what we have heard to date.  That is the reason we were glad to have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Purcell this evening in order to attempt to clear up some of these matters.</p><p>  We are looking for the truth and we are looking for facts - to know what happened on the night that the Garda Commissioner decided to retire and to find out what led up to that decision.  We are advised that this is within the committee's terms of reference and that it concerns the administration of the Department.  I again invite Mr. Purcell to make a statement on that matter and to inform the committee what happened on the night and the sequence of events.  It could be helpful to the tribunal, because the truth cannot change if it is the truth.</p></speech>

In those circumstances, for one person, in this instance me, to be putting into the public domain his account, which others might then have regard to in preparing their statements for the commission, could clearly hamper the approach the commission might take.  It would definitely have the potential to undermine or prejudice the work of the commission.</p></speech>

Section 40 of the Act provides that the role of the Secretary General is to brief the Minister on any matters of accountability relating to the Commissioner's functions.</p></speech>

The normal course of contact outside normal nine to five working hours would be by means of telephone call.  I do not want mislead, in any way, the committee so what I am saying is that most of the meetings I have had with the Garda outside what would be regarded as normal working hours, I would not have considered all that unusual.  That is the just the nature of the work we do and nature of the hours we both sometimes have to work.  Indeed, it is not just ourselves who work them.</p></speech>

I wish to pose questions in respect of a couple of points he made.  During his presentation Mr. Purcell stated, "Neither the Department nor the Minister are investigatory bodies or have investigatory powers."  My question in that regard relates to issues raised in the Guerin report.  Why was an investigation not undertaken by the Department into the allegations put forward by Sergeant McCabe and, in particular, why was such an investigation not conducted in 2012 when the confidential recipient wrote to the Minister regarding allegations made against the Garda Commissioner?  Such an investigation would be required under the terms of the 2007 regulations, section 8 of which states: "On receipt of such a report, the Minister, unless he or she has reason to believe that the allegation contained in it was not made in good faith or is false, frivolous or vexatious, shall cause the allegation to be investigated or take such other action as he or she considers appropriate in the circumstances."</p></speech>

However, I will try to answer any questions.  As a result of the fact that I must be very careful about what I say and, effectively, because this may be something that will impinge on the workings of a commission of inquiry that is going to be established in respect of the Guerin report, I am going to be cautious but I will provide some detail on this.  The committee will have to bear with me in that regard, even if it takes some time to go into the detail.<br />In the report, Mr. Guerin mentions in his analysis that it is apparent that the Minister was invited to exercise two specific functions.  One was to cause an inquiry to be held under section 42 of the 2005 Act and to cause the allegation to be investigated or take such other action as the Minister considered appropriate in the circumstances.  He commented that:<blockquote>What is important about these specific Ministerial functions is that they enable the Minister to ensure that an investigation, in the true sense, independent of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, can be conducted into matters that might be the subject of a complaint made to the Minister.</blockquote></p> <p>He goes on to state: <blockquote><br />From the papers I have seen, I have had difficulty finding material which demonstrated that the Department identified and understood the significant independent statutory role which the Minister had to perform in respect of these matters.  The practice adopted when matters were brought to the Department's attention was invariably to refer the issues that had been raised to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While it would, of course, be entirely reasonable to expect that, where a complaint is made, opportunity will be given to the person the subject of the complaint to respond to it, it is a different matter altogether to be entirely satisfied by that response.</blockquote>In effect, Mr. Guerin summarises the process of determining Sergeant McCabe's complaint went no further than the Minister receiving and acting upon the advice of the person who was the subject of the complaint.  His conclusion was, for whatever reason, that the approach adopted had the result that there was no independent investigation of Sergeant McCabe's complaints and that there is a cause for concern as to the adequacy of the investigation of the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe to the Minister for Justice and Equality, and a sufficient basis for concern as to whether all appropriate steps were taken by the Minister for Justice and Equality to investigate and address the specified complaints.<br />While Mr. Guerin emphasises at the start of his report that he has not made any findings or determinations, clearly these are critical conclusions.  In analysing them it is helpful to recall key facts and legal provisions.  The allegation against the Garda Commissioner centred on the contention that the Garda Commissioner had been guilty of misconduct for listing a superintendent for promotion who in essence had allegedly been in neglect of his duties by permitting seriously inadequate policing practices in his Garda district.  It might be mentioned here for completeness that promotions to the rank of chief superintendent are made by Government on the basis of the outcome of competitive interviews by a board which under the relevant regulations is composed of two independent persons from outside the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one of whom is the chair of the board and a deputy Garda Commissioner.<br />It is important to note that no direct allegations of misconduct were made against the Garda Commissioner.  They were made against the superintendent in question and, to some extent, against other members.  With the greatest respect, it is submitted that in all the circumstances, the characterisation of the action of the Minister and the Department as merely receiving and acting upon the advice of the person who is the subject of the complaint is open to question.<br />The Garda Commissioner is the person who has the statutory function of directing and controlling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of carrying on, managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  More particularly, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for discipline in the force.  While Mr. Guerin's report now raises serious issues about the nature of the Garda Commissioner's response to the Department, it is submitted that the formal written advice and assurances of the Garda Commissioner to the Minister on the adequacy of investigation into Sergeant McCabe's substantive allegations cannot fairly be characterised as merely taking the word of the person against whom allegations have been made.<br />It was also clear from the Garda Commissioner's response that a substantial file had been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who had directed that there be no prosecutions.  While Mr. Guerin mentions this, he did not discuss its significance.  It meant that the Minister could be assured that the investigation files had been examined independently by the Director of Public Prosecutions who had not directed any prosecutions.<br />As I mentioned earlier, there is a further crucial point which Mr. Guerin does not appear to analyse in his findings.  The Minister had been advised by the Garda Commissioner in his report that the investigations into Sergeant McCabe's substantive allegations had been based on earlier reports made to the confidential recipient.  The Minister and the Department naturally knew of the provision in the confidential recipient regulations providing that all allegations through the confidential reporting mechanism have to be forwarded to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, as explained earlier, and would have been conscious of the rationale for this, namely, that GSOC would have sight of the allegations, and the response, and could initiate an investigation in the public interest under section 102 of the 2005 Act if it thought it appropriate.  This was, as it was intended to be, a substantial reassurance for the Department and the Minister on the existence of independent oversight regarding the investigation of the allegations.<br />The Minister was faced with a formal written assurance by the Garda Commissioner of the position regarding the superintendent on which he placed reliance to an extent successive Ministers would be likely to have done, augmented by the fact that the DPP had been involved in the matter and in the context where GSOC had sight of the allegations and outcome, and could have instigated its own independent investigation.<br />With all that has become known since, it might well have been better if a different course of action had been taken but the Department would say that the advice it gave the Minister was reasonable based on what was known at the time and on the statutory provisions in place, which we have since widely acknowledged to be less than satisfactory.  That is one of the reasons the amendments to the Protected Disclosures Bill are being taken and why careful examination of the powers that relate to the remit of GSOC is under way.<br />If the Minister, despite all these factors, had been minded to cause any further investigation of the allegations, the obvious option would have been for him to refer them to GSOC under section 102 of the 2005 Act rather than cause an inquiry under section 42 of that Act.  Mr. Guerin did not consider this point but, in any event, the Minister would have been faced with two issues in that regard.  First, he would have had to satisfy the tests for referral to GSOC under section 102, namely, that it would have had to appear to him to indicate that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence or may have behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.  This would be happening in circumstances where the Garda Commissioner effectively assured him that the opposite was the case.  Second, the Minister would have been aware that GSOC already had sight of the allegations and the outcomes and could have initiated, but chose not to, its own investigation under section 102 on the very grounds that the Minister would have used to refer the allegations to it.<br />As regards the request from Sergeant McCabe's solicitor for an inquiry under section 42 of the 2005 Act, the crucial difficulty that arose in that regard was the fact that consent was not forthcoming despite repeated reminders to Sergeant McCabe's solicitor to transmit the material to the Garda Commissioner.  While Mr. Guerin acknowledges this, no explanation was forthcoming in the report as to why the consent was not forthcoming, other than references to Sergeant McCabe losing all faith in his superior officers.  No decision could properly be made to establish such an inquiry without the complaints being first put to the Commissioner.</p></speech>

We wrote on perhaps five occasions to the solicitor requesting his permission to refer these dossiers to the Garda Commissioner because in order to make an informed choice regarding whether a section 42 or a section 102 inquiry would be taken, the Minister had to have something other than allegations.  This is not in any way a reflection on Sergeant McCabe but when someone makes allegations, allegations are not facts.  Establishing an inquiry either under section 102 or section 42 is a significant step to take so in that context, some response was required and the only person who would have been in a position to provide that response, other than Sergeant McCabe, would have been the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>  While the point was not reached where a decision was to be made on holding an inquiry under section 42, and acknowledging fully the reality that Mr. Guerin did not find any material containing a specific analysis of that, the Department fully appreciated the existence of section 42 as a potential option but understood also the limitations of section 42.  It had already been noted that in an inquiry under section 42, any information, document or thing provided by a person to that inquiry is not admissible in criminal proceedings.  That contrasts sharply with an investigation by GSOC following a referral by the Minister of a matter under section 102 of the Act or in cases where GSOC was determined to carry out such an investigation because that can be a full criminal investigation.</p><p>  There are other aspects of section 42 which, while not discussed in the report by Mr. Guerin, are important in understanding the potential for its use in inquiring into serious allegations of misconduct.  Section 42 enables the Minister, with respect to any matter considered by him or her to be of public concern, to by order appoint a person to inquire into any aspect of the administration, operation, practice or procedure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the conduct of its members and make a report to the Minister.  On the face of it, that is a broad-ranging power.</p> <p>Indeed, section 42 was amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2007 to extend its scope to the conduct of members and to provide for the compellability of witnesses, in that non-compliance by any person with a section 42 inquiry may be brought before the High Court and treated as contempt.  Crucially however, there is no power to administer the oath to any person appearing before a section 42 inquiry, unlike, for example, inquiries under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts or the Commissions of Investigation Act.  This also is in contrast to the statutory predecessor of section 42, which was section 12 of the Dublin Police Act 1924, which was used in the inquiry into the death of Brian Rossiter that reported to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2007.  The 1924 provision provided that evidence-----</p></speech>

Second, am I correct in understanding that part of the Secretary General's answer to my question as to why the Department did not undertake an investigation in terms of an allegation against the Commissioner was that the Department did not undertake an investigation because the only way of finding out the answers here was to go to the Commissioner himself, even though the allegation was against the Commissioner?  In light of the things the Secretary General is saying, my third question is whether he now regrets he did not undertake an investigation.</p></speech>

This is not the normal situation in which I, as Secretary General, would find myself in front of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or any other committee.  This is not a normal situation.  An investigation was carried out when the complaints were made to the confidential recipient.  The Garda Commissioner would have had carried out an investigation into those complaints.  Once that investigation was carried out, under the terms of the same set of regulations - I think it is section 10 - the Commissioner is then obliged to refer the allegations and the outcome to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, for its consideration in accordance with agreements that are in place.  On top of this, in this particular case something in the region of ten volumes of files were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who directed no prosecution in respect of these cases.  I have outlined this and have tried to be careful, not for reasons of running down the clock.</p><p>  The position in respect of the Garda Commissioner is that an investigation is carried out by someone at chief superintendent level.  It then is investigated by an assistant commissioner in the Garda and a further investigation is taken by a deputy commissioner.  These investigations are endorsed by the Commissioner, who sends back a report and, as I said, at the same time it goes to the DPP.  I referred earlier to the third crucial element of this.  While I am not in any way saying that Mr. Guerin did not look at this, I am saying it is not covered, perhaps because for the reasons he outlined clearly in his report he did not have an opportunity to consider the perspective of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  However, GSOC would have had the allegations and would have had the report on what the Commissioner had done in respect of those allegations.</p><p>  As for the Minister, I outlined how the relationships between the Garda Commissioner and the Minister, the Garda Commissioner and the Secretary General of the Department and the Garda Commissioner and the Department are based on trust.  The Commissioner is responsible for the maintenance of order and discipline within the force.  Neither the Department nor the Minister is an investigatory body.  We do not micro-manage the Garda and the Commissioner has responsibility in law for the operation of the Garda.  The Department and the Minister are faced with a situation if we have reports coming back from the Garda Commissioner regarding matters of serious concern such as these, where substantial investigations have been carried out by the Commissioner, where it has gone to the DPP and where we know it also has gone to GSOC.  For the Minister then to make a decision to establish an investigation under section 102, in circumstances in which the Garda Commissioner is stating there is no breach, no criminal offences and no breach of discipline, effectively one would have a situation in which one could loosely say it is not a commission of investigation one needs but a new Commissioner.  I refer to a situation in which one does not accept the bona fides of the Garda Commissioner, who is charged under statute with the management of the force, in circumstances where there have been three elements - I acknowledge I am repeating myself - namely, the Garda investigation, the files going to the DPP and the papers going to GSOC.</p><p>  One should bear in mind that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is the independently appointed statutory body that has the remit of investigating complaints of malpractice in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As it would have had it, the assurance was there that it had seen the same allegations and had received the report from the Garda Commissioner.  Had GSOC considered that something was wrong, it would have been in a position to take action.  Consequently, in such circumstances, the Minister would have to decide he was not going to accept what the Garda Commissioner had told him, he would be ignoring the fact that the DPP had decided there was no criminal prosecution to be brought, and he would be ignoring the fact he was aware of the position in respect of the body charged with the investigation of complaints against members of the Garda, which is GSOC, not the Minister for Justice and Equality, not the Department of Justice and Equality and not the Secretary General of that Department.</p> <p>Knowing that in those three sets of circumstances those matters had been investigated, the Minister then would have had to say that he did not accept what the Commissioner was saying - the Minister might not have to say that he does not accept what the DPP says because that only relates to criminal offences - and that he was ignoring the fact that the body that is statutorily appointed-----</p></speech>

What I am trying to say is, of course, with the benefit of hindsight I might say that, knowing what we know now, and when we have a situation where a commission of investigation is now being set up, maybe we would have looked at it differently.  Every one of us can be wise with the benefit of hindsight.  What I am trying to say, I suppose, is that I am entirely satisfied with the way this was viewed and the analysis that was done, despite the fact that Mr. Guerin SC said there were no findings of fact.  Certainly, anyone reading the report might say he is pointing in a direction that a proper analysis of this was not done.   What I am saying is that a proper analysis of this was done and, in the circumstances and given the limitations of the structures that were in place at the time, it was reasonable.</p></speech>

Later on in 2012, separately to the confidential recipient, three further dossiers of allegations came to the Department.  It was those dossiers that I was referring to when I mentioned that we were aware that Sergeant McCabe had issues with referring these matters to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Indeed, in some ways, and going back to Senator Zappone's question about whether we have regrets now, of course, as we stated, the procedures and structures in place for dealing with Garda whistleblowers were not fit for purpose.  If one looks at it the whole idea of a confidential recipient receiving in confidence reports from a member of the Garda and then the confidential recipient having to refer it to the Garda Commissioner for investigation by other members of the Garda, while not in any way suggesting that they would not carry out a proper investigation, is, I suppose, what goes to the heart of the changes that are being considered and, indeed, that this committee is looking at.  In hindsight, in response to Senator Zappone, none of us would feel that it is appropriate that investigations of complaints against a member of Garda by another member of the Garda can properly be carried out by carried out by the Garda itself.  I think I have answered the question.  Of course, we do have-----</p></speech>

I am sorry, I am not clear on this point.  Mr. Purcell stated that in September 2013 further allegations were made, this time to the Department, that there was an impasse as to what to do with these as to whether or not they could be sent on to the Commissioner, and that such impasse was not resolved until a letter was received from the Attorney General's office in December 2013, which was a full year and a bit away from the time they were received.  That seems like a very long time.</p></speech>

There was correspondence, going from the Department to the solicitor, asking for permission stating that we needed to refer these matters to the Garda Commissioner.  There was also another issue in relation to when they were originally sent in, that they were saying there were records attached to the allegations, and despite what it said, there was nothing attached and we were inquiring about that.  I think Mr. Guerin SC refers to that in his report.</p><p>  Those letters were going to the solicitor seeking the permission.  We felt that this was necessary because we were aware Sergeant McCabe, in other correspondence, had made clear the fact that he did not think it was appropriate.  In fact, if I am correct, Costello &amp;amp; Co. - I cannot remember the individual solicitor's name - had stated in the original letter that came in with these complaints that they did not think it was appropriate that either the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or GSOC would investigate these matters and that is why they were calling for a section 42 investigation.  They thought the matters were so serious that GSOC could not investigate them.  However, the facts of the matter are that GSOC has the power to investigate anything up to and including deaths.  Those are the circumstances.</p></speech>

It is probably important to remember, and I am sure the committee will recall, that while the allegations had been made there was a substantial overlap in terms of time with a significant number of allegations that were made by Sergeant McCabe about the fixed-charge notice processing system, or the penalty points issue, as it is referred to by some commentators.  Occurring in parallel was the penalty points issue, in respect of which complaints were made and referred to the Garda.  An investigation was set up by the Garda Commissioner and led by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney, who in turn produced what has become known as the O'Mahoney report into the penalty point allegations.  In addition, another report was sought.  The Garda Commissioner referred the report to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na professional standards unit to examine it in conjunction with the O'Mahoney report.  It made a number of recommendations.  The Minister, in addition to asking the Garda Commissioner to investigate the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe in order that he could be satisfied further that a proper and full investigation had been carried out, asked him to examine a random 1% of all cancellations.  That was done by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney.  Following on from that, the Minister referred the O'Mahoney report, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na professional standards unit report and all the relevant documentation to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate so it could examine them to determine whether there was a need for further recommendations.  Subsequently, or around the same time, if I am not mistaken, the Minister referred the O'Mahoney report and the professional standards unit's report to this committee, which in turn sent it to the petitions committee, which held various hearings.  These developments were occurring at the same time as the others.  The report from the inspectorate was produced-----</p></speech>

Much of it concerned the penalty points issue but we did have engagement on the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe on the other matters, which we have considered.  Letters were sent from the Minister to the confidential recipient.  That, in effect, shows that there was consultation.</p><p>  I mentioned earlier that the report stated there was no analysis, and that the documentation was sparse.  This was regarded by Mr. Guerin as an issue.  To be honest, it would have been better had we kept minute details on the notes regarding any conversations that took place in that regard, but to say that there was none is not true.  There was engagement, discussion and analysis.  As I stated, I went into detail explaining the analysis of what was happening.  I refer to the three points - the Garda Commissioner, GSOC itself and the Officer of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p>  Let me make one point that may not be strictly related.  There was a lot of commentary that nothing happened with regard to these allegations and the penalty points issue but, as I have indicated, there were a significant number of developments.  In fact, the report that was commissioned by the Minister from the Garda Inspectorate in one way proved just how independent the inspectorate was.  The inspectorate produced a report that was very hard hitting and damning of the way the fixed-charge processing system functioned.</p></speech>

It sounds as if there was a lot of engagement on the investigation of garda&iacute; by garda&iacute;, with the involvement of GSOC, and that this might have been the main type of work and an analysis that was occurring as distinct from the provision of a sufficient amount of advice to the Minister from Mr. Purcell's Department.</p></speech>

The letter effectively confirmed what had been in earlier correspondence.  I revert to the fact that it covered the allegations that had been considered by the Garda Commissioner in the reports mentioned - the DPP - and had gone on to GSOC.</p></speech>

However, the letter covered the various points that had already been made but gave a little more detail.  There were ongoing conversations on the whole issue of allegations made by Sergeant McCabe.  Some concerned penalty points and some concerned other matters.  It might have been the case that the letter itself did not go directly to the Minister.</p></speech>

The Minister for Justice and Equality indicated that she wanted to see reforms in the Department and the Secretary General said he had commissioned an internal report too.  Does he see himself leading those reforms in the Department?</p></speech>

The Government announced far-reaching reforms, the most far-reaching of which is the establishment of the policing authority, which will essentially be a watershed in how policing is delivered in the State.  As I outlined earlier, there is also the open competition for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and the extension of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission&rsquo;s remit to include the Garda Commissioner, as well as the removal of time limitations.  The Protected Disclosures Bill will enable Garda members, whether they are whistleblowers or ordinary members, to make complaints to GSOC.  These are substantial reforms.</p><p>  While the commentary in the Guerin report will be considered in some detail by a commission of investigation, obviously there will be considerable discussion in terms of the witnesses appearing before that commission.  Clearly, the reform programme that will be in place will be a highly challenging one.  There will also be a review of how the Department of Justice and Equality is managed, performs and is administered.  This has come in wake of the Guerin report.  This will be a significantly challenging task.  The Minister, and the Government from the Taoiseach down, have given a clear indication they are committed to what the Minister herself described as a sea change in the way policing is delivered.</p><p>  Yes, I believe I am the right person.  I am capable of dealing with this.  Yes, I am fully committed to it.</p></speech>

Mr. Purcell referred earlier to the fact there are several sections in the Department.  What section was dealing with the information coming in from Sergeant McCabe and his solicitors?  Who is heading up that section?</p></speech>

How is that arrived at?  Is the Secretary General consulted on that?  Is the Minister&rsquo;s private secretary consulted on it?</p></speech>

In some instances, if correspondence is directed directly to the Minister, it would go through the Minister&rsquo;s private office and onto a tracking system.  Other correspondence might be referred directly to whatever division deals with it.  In this instance, it was that particular division.  It would then be dealt with and, in the normal course of events, whatever unfolds, it might or might not go to the Minister, depending on the issues involved.  In some instances there could be oral briefings, or files would be sent up without oral briefings.  It all depends on whatever the particular matter at hand would be.</p></speech>

How is that arrived at and who arrives at that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800023#X00800"><p>The threshold is quite a high one.  It is the section 102 inquiry I referred to earlier.  The threshold is that the Minister must be satisfied that there may have been a criminal offence committed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a breach of discipline.  That threshold is quite high.  The ombudsman commission has exactly the same power to initiate a section 102 investigation.  That is why I was explaining earlier that we were aware it had the documentation regarding the allegations, which gave some assurance that this matter had been considered by the independent body.  The threshold is quite high.  That was what I was referring to when I was responding to the Senator.  For the Minister to take an allegation or allegations and refer it to GSOC for a section 102 investigation in circumstances in which the Garda Commissioner had already said there was nothing wrong and the DPP had said there was no criminal offence - that rules out the criminal offence element from the beginning - then the Minister would want to be absolutely satisfied that a serious offence was committed to discard the advice of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>  The Commissioner is the person in charge of the force and statutorily charged with maintaining its good order and discipline.  One has to place some credence in a report by a Commissioner.  If one does not believe the report the Commissioner gives, effectively one is saying one does not accept his word on it.  There is a trust element there.</p></speech>

The very fact that the Minister sent a letter to the confidential recipient meant he was aware of what was there.  There would have been some discussions at the time.  It is not always the case that a written submission will go up.</p><p>  One of the outcomes of any situation such as this is that anyone, on seeing anything to do with the matter crossing their desk, will say, &ldquo;Look at that.  Would I normally send it up?  Maybe not, but I am not taking any chances in this instance.&rdquo;  This leads to a massive increase in the number of things flying up the line.  That is an understandable reaction to the situation in which we found ourselves of late regarding these matters.</p></speech>

If the letter comes to me for onward transmission to the Minister, the norm would be that if a response is to go out or if a matter is to be examined, it would not generally go to the Minister until someone had dealt with it and prepared whatever the response was going to be.  If there was an issue that needed to be examined before a response could be issued, the norm would be that this would happen before it would go there, because otherwise a situation would inevitably arise where a letter comes in and the first thing is what is the response.

There are many examples in society where organs of the State carry out parallel inquiries.  One could have the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or one could have the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners carrying out parallel inquiries.  The position Mr. Purcell is taking today is not sustainable or credible because we saw in our terms of reference that the issue of the premature retirement and departure of the former Garda Commissioner would be front-loaded in the commission of investigation.  That was not granted.  The Houses of the Oireachtas also voted a budget of &euro;2 million.  Mr. Purcell could clear up all of this but he has taken this position.  There are so many other factors feeding into the position he has taken.  It is really untenable.  Does he appreciate the significance or the gravity of that?  I am not aware of any other Secretary General who has attended a committee and taken a position similar to that of Mr. Purcell.</p></speech>

I spoke to the former Minister about it, and he told me that under no circumstances would he ever have made comments like that.  I said already that, knowing the Minister as I did, there is no way, in my view, that he would have made the comments attributed to him.</p> <p>There was no way the description being put forward in my mind represented anything the Minister might have said.  The only precise thing I can remember from it is one of the quotes,"If he thinks you're doing that, you're finished," or something like it.  There is no way he would have said anything like this and that is what I found very strange about it.  I thought it was very strange; I could not see how that would have been the case.</p></speech>

How can he reconcile this with the Guerin report statement: "The deficiencies identified in the investigations considered in this review, if they were widely replicated, would be a challenge to public confidence in the criminal justice system itself"?  He considers the Department acted reasonably, but he and Mr. Guerin are poles apart.  Is this the Department circling the wagons?  It is adopting a defence of the realm and now contesting the Guerin report.  What Mr. Purcell maintains in his opening statement is at massive variance with the quotation taken from the report.</p></speech>

There is then a situation where it goes to the Director of Public Prosecutions who says no prosecutions are warranted.  One is assured by the knowledge that it also went to GSOC and that it had the opportunity to consider whether it felt further action was warranted in the circumstances.  Bearing in mind what I said about the relationship between the Secretary General and the Commissioner or the Minister and the Commissioner, it is built on a level of trust.  As I said in my opening remarks, it is a trust that has been built up over decades and a relationship that was built during a period when there was a real threat to the security of the State.  There was necessarily a close relationship which, as I said, did not happen during the term of one single officeholder.  That was how it had developed over a long period.  When one has this, what I am saying is that the response was reasonable.  I do not know, with the benefit of hindsight, whether we would do the same thing again.  Again, a lot of boils down to the level of trust.  However, I go back to what I said.  The programme of reform will ensure this will not happen again because if one has a situation where the remit of GSOC is extended to cover complaints made by garda&iacute; - it was only in particular circumstances that it could do so - with the enactment of the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 which will establish GSOC as the authority that will deal with Garda whistleblowers, it will not arise again.  My own belief is that the most far reaching reform that will be introduced in the packages the Minister is driving forward is the establishment of an independent policing authority that will change on a permanent basis the relationship between the Garda Commissioner and garda&iacute; and the Department and-or the Minister.</p></speech>

While I accept that it is not a comfortable position for me to be in, I can understand perfectly why the Minister would take that approach.

That is the point I was trying to make.  People have genuine concerns about letters hanging around offices for two weeks without a Minister receiving them.  How does Mr. Purcell respond to this?</p></speech>

If the roles were reversed, I would be in exactly the same position, but what the Deputy is asking me is different.  He is talking about a particular letter.  I have said that it is covered in the terms of reference and that I am trying my best to be as helpful as I possibly can be in very difficult circumstances - even in a set of circumstances in which there was no commission of investigation.</p> <p>In fact if there was not a commission of investigation, as I said in my opening remarks, it would probably be easier in many ways just to simply answer the questions.  However, it is not that I am answering the questions, or, as the Deputy believes, not answering the questions, because of some desire to obstruct the work of the committee - far from it.  I think I have gone some considerable distance despite the concerns I expressed at the time in relation to the Guerin report.  I have tried to answer the questions as openly and as fully as I possibly can in the circumstances.  However, I have said what I have to say.  I have told the committee my views in relation to matters covered by Mr. Justice Fennelly's commission of investigation and I am not sure what more I can add to that.</p></speech>

I have already outlined in some considerable detail the various things that happened in relation to the whole penalty points issue for want of a better description: the establishment of the investigation by the assistant commissioner; the examination of an additional random 1% over and above the cases that were mentioned in the allegations that were being made; the referral then of the O'Mahoney report to the professional standards unit in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; following on from that the former Minister's referral of the report to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality; the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality then referring it to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions; and the Minister then referring them to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and the extensive and far-reaching report it carried out not only into the particular allegations but into the system itself.  As I said, at one point during a discussion with Garda associations someone said the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate was not independent.  By God, when it produced that report, it certainly showed for all that it was independent.</p><p>  I think that in itself was a very clear indication that the former Minister and everyone else took these allegations very seriously.  Is it fair to say, and perhaps the Deputy will have a view on this, that nobody took those penalty points accusations seriously?  One should just look at what happened with the penalty points and the various stages.</p><p>  One other thing that I forgot to say was that the former Minister then referred them to GSOC and GSOC at the moment is looking at them.  That is a clear indication of the level of seriousness with which the allegations were taken.  To be honest, in my view it was taken very seriously.</p></speech>

That is not to say that there would not be some contact.  If the Deputy is asking me if the Commissioner would ring the Minister and say, "Listen, I've got something very urgent; I'm sending it through to you", that would be quite unusual.  By the way, I have said I cannot comment on what a previous Minister for Justice and Equality would say.

I stated this in the letter I sent to the clerk to the committee, I mentioned it in my opening remarks and I said in turn that I had deep concerns about answering questions on the Guerin report.  My view was that the difference with the Fennelly commission is that the commission itself was established and its terms of reference were set out, the judge is in place and he has commenced his work.  He has written to me and, I believe, to others, so the work of Mr. Justice Fennelly's commission is already under way.  The difference between this and the Guerin commission is that, while I still have concerns that by giving evidence here there is a potential that it in turn may prejudice or undermine the commission, it has not yet been established and its terms of reference have not been set out.  It is a problem, and this is exactly what I meant when I spoke about the difficult position I am in when trying to deal with this.  I have set out why I could not answer questions on Mr. Justice Fennelly's commission or anything relating to the terms of reference, and have tried to adopt as open, honest and frank a manner as I can in trying to facilitate the work of the committee.  I am not sure whether the committee is trying to do this, but I almost get a sense that members are saying that because I answered questions on the Guerin report, I should answer them on the Fennelly commission.  By asking about my approach in dealing with questions - and I do not accept the word "rebuttal", but people have different interpretations - I feel the committee is trying to use the fact that I have been open-----</p></speech>

I do not believe that the Department is not fit for purpose.  We have acknowledged, and I am acknowledging now, that the structures that were in place for dealing with Garda whistleblowers were not fit for purpose.  As part of the reforms that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is introducing, the extension of the remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the Protected Disclosures Bill will address that issue.  I cannot see the logic in having a system in which someone goes to a confidential recipient with a problem, only for the confidential recipient to have to have it investigated.  In other words, garda&iacute; investigating garda&iacute;.  It is far from an ideal situation.  It is not fit for purpose.</p><p>  I do not accept the description, even if it was from the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  I did not hear what he said, but I saw the reports.  I do not accept that the Department of Justice and Equality is not fit for purpose.  I might briefly say why.</p></speech>

What legislative or constitutional prohibition is preventing him from giving us a factual account of what happened and telling the truth?  I am not saying he is not telling the truth, but I have great reservations about his hiding behind or giving precedence to a commission that is not yet established while giving second-class treatment to the committee through our Chairman.</p></speech>

I am expressing my genuine concern that, if I answer questions and give witness in public to issues that are covered by the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission, I will potentially be undermining or prejudicing the work of that commission.  In addition, I would be unfair on myself, in the sense that I am giving evidence in public unlike other witnesses who will appear before that commission.  I will appear before it as well, as the committee has seen from the letter that Mr. Justice Fennelly sent to me.  It is unfair on me, although that is not my primary concern.  Rather, it is the potential to undermine or prejudice the work of the commission.  It is nothing else.  In my discussion with Deputy Mac Lochlainn, while he might not have intended to do so, it sounded like he was saying that, by trying to be helpful on the Guerin report, I was effectively undermining my own position in respect of Fennelly when it was-----</p></speech>

Mr. Purcell mentioned the various avenues of investigation in terms of the whistleblower situation, the O'Mahoney report, which has been discredited, and the files sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  Is it not fair to say that the DPP would only recommend a criminal prosecution where the level of evidence was beyond reasonable doubt?  Surely someone in Mr. Purcell's Department or with the former Minister or former Garda Commissioner should have raised concerns that, leaving aside the question of a criminal prosecution arising from the issues raised by the whistleblowers, there was a significant lack of action on the part of someone in the Department, the former Minister or the former Garda Commissioner.  The DPP would only recommend prosecution where a high bar was met, namely, it could lead to a successful conviction.</p></speech>

I will start by saying that we acted reasonably, given the structures in place at the time.  The structures for dealing with whistleblowers were not adequate.  For this reason, they are being changed as part of the reforms.</p><p>  If one examined any of these cases in isolation, one might view it in the way being described by the Senator, but the matters had been investigated by the Garda and considered by the DPP from the criminal offence perspective.  Crucially, they were sent to GSOC under the terms of the relevant section in the confidential recipient regulations.  When the cases are examined together, the action taken was not unreasonable.  As I made clear, we now know that the structures in place for dealing with Garda whistleblowers were not adequate or fit for purpose.</p><p>  I might make the point that I am only referring to the Garda because that is the matter being discussed, but it is probably fair to say that structures elsewhere for dealing with whistleblowers, be they in the Civil Service, the public sector or the private sector, are not adequate.  This is one of the reasons for the Minister, Deputy Howlin, introducing legislation to deal with the situation.</p></speech>

If it was important enough to have come to my attention and I thought the Minister needed to be made aware of it, I would do it.

This information is listed under the heading, Sergeant McCabe's Solicitor Resumes Direct Contact with the Department.  Obviously, various allegations were made by Sergeant McCabe in that correspondence.  Can Mr. Purcell say why the correspondence was so protracted from September 2012 to My 2013?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.623" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800030#EE02100"><p>I covered this earlier.  The correspondence was protracted because there had been issues with Sergeant McCabe not wanting matters to be brought to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this particular instance, the solicitor acting on behalf of Sergeant McCabe stated specifically in the correspondence that he felt the matter was so important it should not be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  As I pointed out earlier and as the Deputy will be aware that GSOC is the independent statutory body charged with the remit of investigating any elements of wrongdoing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up to and including deaths.  Therefore, it cannot be the case that something is so important that it cannot be investigated by GSOC.  There was a real concern, because of concerns expressed by Sergeant McCabe, that if we were to send the material to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that in itself would become an issue.  It was for that reason that there was protracted correspondence.  Mr. Guerin commented in his report that he did not know why no response was given.  I do not know either why no response was given but no response to the question we asked was given.  While I cannot be exactly certain I think on five occasions we wrote to the solicitor asking for this to happen.</p></speech>

The initial letter contained a reference to some records being attached but there were no records attached.  That was one of the issues queried.  The records which it was stated in the letter were being submitted were never sent in despite requests for them.  I said earlier that there was an overlap between the material submitted at that stage via the solicitor with some of the other allegations and there was also an overlap between the material submitted and material that had been investigated by, I think, the assistant commissioner or, perhaps, deputy commissioner in the context of the internal Garda investigation to which I referred at length when the Deputy was not here.  In that context, all of this was going on during the period concerned.  I also explained earlier that none of this happened in isolation.  At the same time, there was an extensive process in place in regard to what has become known as the penalty points issue, which involved numerous reports and referrals to the Garda professional standard unit, this committee, the petitions committee, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and, ultimately, GSOC.  There was ongoing engagement on that front.</p> <p>The issues relating to Sergeant McCabe all occurred at a parallel time to the issue with the penalty points.  I made that point earlier just to emphasise that it was not the case that nothing was happening with regard to Sergeant McCabe during that period.</p></speech>

Why was that advice obtained?  If Mr. Purcell dealt with that earlier, there is no need to answer but if he has not, I would appreciate an answer.  Second, there is a reference to the advice obtained in paragraph 19.89.  At the same time Mr. Guerin says that he has not seen the advices.  It is a little unusual that he refers to the advices and characterises them without having seen them.  Does he fairly characterise it?  The more important issue is why those advices were sought.</p></speech>

There was a concern that we were not getting anywhere in terms of the engagement with the solicitor for whatever reason.  I do not know the answer to that, but we became concerned about it.  There is a point I made earlier which I will repeat again.  In that particular section of the report relating to the advice, there is a mistake in what Mr. Guerin referred to.  He was referring to the advice being given that the material or the documentation should be sent without further ado, which I think is the phrase used, to the Minister, whereas in fact what was in the advice was that it should be sent to the Garda Commissioner.  I made that point earlier just to clarify things.</p></speech>

As the other committee members will confirm, this has been dealt with extensively.  Despite my concerns about a commission of investigation coming up and the fact that I am here as a witness, I have tried to be as open as possible and tried to be as consistent as possible to the point, as I also said, that I might well be wrong in being as open as I have been with regard to these matters.  I certainly hope it does not come back to haunt me from that perspective.  However, I asked at the beginning to be given some leeway.  I said I would try to answer all of the questions in so far as I can, and I have done that.  I think I have been as open and forthcoming as I can be.</p></speech>

One of the issues in that regard was that we had already had the situation where matters had been investigated by the Garda.  The difficulty and what we had been trying to resolve was the fact that Sergeant McCabe had a problem, and his solicitor had already indicated that he also had a problem, with this going to the Garda, but the advice was to send it to the Garda.  To some extent events overtook what was happening.  The Deputy might recall that the advice was received just before Christmas and from January on we were into the run of appearances by the Garda Commissioner and Sergeant McCabe at the Committee of Public Accounts, then we were almost straight into the allegations of the bugging of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission headquarters and everything that went with that and the establishment of the Cook report.  Then there was the inspectorate report and allegations being made and given to Deputy Martin.  There was all of that.  Essentially, events overtook what was happening.</p><p>  There had been considerable overlap, as I described earlier, but I suppose events overtook it.</p></speech>

The letter that came in on 27 February just gave a bit more detail in regard to the issues that had been investigated by garda&iacute;.  I went into considerable detail explaining how the analysis of the issues was such that we knew the situation had been investigated by garda&iacute; - by a chief superintendent at an early stage, at a later stage by an assistant commissioner and subsequently by a deputy commissioner.  The investigations had been endorsed by the Commissioner who had written to the Minister and in turn, the Minister had written back.  The ten volumes of files were sent to the DPP's office and that office took a decision not to prosecute.  One of the things I mentioned earlier was a crucial point that was not covered in Mr. Guerin's report because, as he outlined in his report, he did not have the GSOC perspective on what happened, namely, that under the confidential recipient regulations of 2007, there is a requirement for any complaints-allegations that are referred by the confidential recipient to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be referred to GSOC, as well as the response to those allegations or complaints.  I use the word "crucial" in this regard because that gave an assurance that not only had it been investigated by garda&iacute; and been sent to the DPP, it had also gone to the one body that has the independent statutory remit for investigating complaints about garda&iacute;.  It was in that context that the whole thing was proceeding.  As I said, that was the reasoning behind this.</p></speech>

There was a lot happening and Mr. Purcell clarified that point earlier.  The issue was not lying idle or being covered up.  I ask Deputy McNamara to conclude as we are running out of time.</p></speech>

Is it normal that such letters would not be furnished to a Minister in the context of the volume of correspondence coming through?  Is it normal that letters from the Attorney General or the Garda Commissioner would not be furnished to the Minister?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.678" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800032#GG00700"><p>There is certainly an issue with the volume of correspondence coming through.  It is the case, as I mentioned earlier, that sometimes briefings are given orally to Ministers about particular matters.  There would not always be a trail although, as I said earlier, one of the side effects or consequences of everything that has happened is that there is and will be a significantly-increased volume of things going to the Minister.  People are asking "should that go up?" and are not taking a chance and sending things up the line.  Some things would go through to the Minister while other things would not.  Sometimes there are oral briefings and other times not.  Occasionally, it must be said, sometimes mistakes are made.  I am not saying that sometimes it does not happen that something should have gone on but did not go.  There can be any number of reasons why something would not go.</p></speech>

Is much of this dealt with by way of oral discussion and briefings rather than extensively written instructions, correspondence and so forth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.680" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800032#GG00900"><p>Sometimes it is.  As I was saying earlier, this ran in parallel with the whole penalty points issue.  That was a very big issue that was going on in parallel to all of this so there would have been discussions internally in regard to what was happening with the various allegations made by Sergeant McCabe.  It was not the case that the particular set of allegations we are now discussing were there, in isolation.  There were other things going on in regard to Sergeant McCabe, particularly the penalty points issue.  Sergeant McCabe and the allegations made by him were very much a live issue.  However, I am not saying that the letter to which the Deputy is referring went to the Minister; I actually do not think it did go.  What I am trying to do here is to set the context and explain that the particular contents of that letter referred back to the investigation that was carried out at an earlier stage which was the subject of correspondence, was examined by the DPP and was sent on to GSOC.  I must make it clear that it was not sent by us to GSOC.  Under a section in the confidential recipient regulations, there was a requirement for the Garda Commissioner to refer the documentation to GSOC.  I am just trying to explain the circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.681" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800032#GG01000"><p>In view of that context and the fact that Mr. Purcell has repeatedly reiterated that the Department and the former Minister were dealing with Sergeant McCabe's allegations at the same time as the fixed charge and penalty points issue, does he think it is accurate to state that the Department or the former Minister did not take seriously Sergeant McCabe's allegations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.682" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800032#GG01100"><p>No, I do not think it is accurate to say that and I said that earlier.  I have outlined the extensive action that was taken by the former Minister in regard to the penalty points, including referral to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the establishment of the investigation that became known as the O'Mahoney investigation.  In addition to the Sergeant McCabe allegations being investigated by the O'Mahoney investigation, the Minister also asked the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate a random 1% of all cancellations, other than the ones that were covered by the allegations and that was done.  The matter was also looked at by the Garda professional standards unit which made recommendations.  The Minister then referred both reports to the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which in turn produced a report which, as I said earlier, nailed once and for all anyone's doubts about whether it was independent.  It produced a very hard-hitting report about the actual operation of the fixed charge notice processing system.  On top of that, the Minister referred the O'Mahoney report and the professional standards unit report to this very committee, as Deputy McNamara knows.</p> <p>In turn - and if I am correct - that was then sent to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.</p><p> On top of all that, the Minister subsequently referred the penalty points allegations and all the other reports to GSOC for examination.  That examination is ongoing.  In the context of any statement to the effect that the allegations being made were not taken seriously, if one looks at the course of action which was taken and which I have described, I do not think anyone could reasonably say that these things were not taken seriously.</p></speech>

The first petition for consideration is P00009/13 from Mr. Hugh Rance, calling for an independent process of appeal in the Department of Education and Skills through which a teacher who is employed by a vocational education committee and has been refused qualified pay and incremental credit, can make an appeal against the decision reached by the VEC.  In particular he feels the regulations on the free movement of workers within the EU are not being enforced by the Department of Education and Skills and as a result, he is being penalised financially and the reduction in salary will also have an impact on his future pension payment.</p><p>  The petitioner forwarded further correspondence to the secretariat on 22 February informing the committee that his situation has been resolved as a result of the appointment of a new chief executive officer to the education and training board.  While he gave no details of the solution reached, he has asked that the committee make appropriate recommendations to the Department of Education and Skills on the circulation of circulars that have an impact on the terms and condition of employment and on pay.</p><p>  We have received further correspondence from the Cork Education and Training Board outlining the ways it is dealing with these matters.  We have agreed to forward to the petitioner a copy of the response from the Cork Education and Training Board and then to close the petition.</p><p>  The second petition for consideration is P00014/13 from Ms Ursula Widmer on the medical criteria for disabled drivers and passengers to be granted a concession under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, SI 353.  </p><p>  Members will see from the criteria that if an individual has the use of one arm, he or she is not entitled to this concession.  However, if an individual has the use of one leg he or she is entitled to the concession.  This seems to be extremely unfair as either would necessitate the use of a modified vehicle.</p><p>  It is proposed the committee will take three steps.  First, we write to the Minister seeking information on the reason that the disablement of the loss of one arm does not satisfy the criteria to qualify under the terms of the scheme; second, that we ask for specific information on the difference in disability, in the context of the scheme, between the loss of one leg as a qualifying criteria whereas the criteria for an upper limb disablement is the loss of both the hand and the arm, given that both disablement necessitates the modification of a car; and, third, we will ask whether he has plans to legislate to balance the disparity in the scheme.  Following the Minister's response, we will deliberate further on the petition.</p><p>  The third petition is P00003/14 from Mr. Christophe Krief concerns a breach of European law on competition, freedom of establishment and free movement of workers.  Mr. Krief states the Building Control Act 2007 is questionable, totally discriminatory and in violation of the fundamental principles of European law and the free movement of workers with the EU Community.  The current verdict of the European Ombudsman is that the Building Control Act 2007 is in breach of European law.</p><p>  We have had correspondence on this issue from a number of bodies.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has recently signed into law the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 which came into force in March 2014.  This new law stipulates that only three groups of professions will be authorised to design and certify compliance with building regulations.  The Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists, CIAT, has been excluded for no reason.  This means that Mr. Krief will not be allowed to continue to work in Ireland.  CIAT has prepared a complaint to send to the European Commission.</p><p>  The committee has deliberated on the correspondence from a number of bodies.  As we think the correspondence clarifies the matter, it is proposed to forward it to the petitioner and the petition be closed. </p></speech>
