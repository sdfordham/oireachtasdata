I invite Mr. McKeon to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014052800003#D00300"><p>I thank the joint committee for inviting us to provide an update on Ireland's youth guarantee programme.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Paul Carroll, principal officer with responsibility for all of the Department's operations in the Dublin north region which includes areas such as Ballymun, Finglas and Coolock.  In that role he has responsibility for the Ballymun pilot youth guarantee scheme.  I am also joined by Mr. Brian McCormick, assistant principal officer and a specialist labour market economist who played a large role in drafting the Irish youth guarantee programme and submitting our proposals to Brussels.</p><p>  I will begin by talking about youth labour market trends.  The Government's primary medium-term strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  Past experience suggests youth unemployment which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during recovery.  There is evidence that this is occurring in Ireland.  The youth unemployment rate fell from 29% at the end of 2011 to 24% at the end of 2013, while the number of young unemployed fell by 19,000 from 68,000 to 49,000 in the same period.</p> <p>It is hoped this improvement in youth unemployment trends will continue.  In this regard it is noteworthy that the reduction in youth unemployment over the past number of months is correlated with a recovery in employment levels among young people.  For example, the proportion of 20 to 24 year olds who are in employment rose from 45.9% at the end of 2012 to 49.3% at the end of 2013, the first such increase in six years.  However it must also be acknowledged that the overall fall in youth unemployment since its peak reflects a number of factors, including an underlying decline in the young adult population and more young people staying on longer in education and emigration.  Accordingly, in addition to promoting medium-term economic recovery to promote jobs growth, the Government recognises the need for measures to support young unemployed people in competing for these job opportunities and to keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. </p><p> Key to this approach will be the implementation of the EU recommendation on a youth guarantee, the objective of which is to ensure that young people receive a quality offer of training, education, work experience or employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case we intend to achieve this objective by enhancing the Intreo engagement with newly unemployed young people, extending the range of interventions available to young people and maintaining and developing the current range of education, training and employment interventions for young people.  If current trends continue, the impact of the new and existing interventions will also be supported by the recovery in the economy and, by extension, employment levels.  In agreeing the recommendation on the youth guarantee, the European Council accepted that the guarantee of an offer of training, education or work experience after a four month period for those aged 18 to 24 years should be implemented on a phased basis in those countries, such as Ireland, which face significant fiscal constraints.  None the less, while financial constraints remain a reality in terms of roll-out, Ireland will be implementing the guarantee from a very advantageous position, as recognised by both the EU and OECD.  Many of the elements that will make up the guarantee at EU level are already in place in Ireland through the Pathways to Work and related strategies.  These include Intreo, the transformative new employment service helping people back to work; JobBridge, the national internship scheme; JobsPlus, the wage subsidy scheme for employers; and work experience options such as T&uacute;s and gateway.</p><p> In implementing the guarantee as set out in the implementation plan published by the Government in January, we will build on these elements and, where conditions require and allow, expand them as necessary.  In this regard we will focus on increasing the impact of these schemes in terms of supporting young unemployed people, with a particular focus in the first instance on young people who are most distant from the labour market, in other words, those who even in the Celtic tiger era would have faced difficulty in accessing the labour market.  Accordingly, the guarantee as approved by the Government and commended by the EU Commission involves the following: modifying the Intreo process to ensure more intensive engagement with young people; increasing the number of places on schemes available to and accessed by young people; earmarking a quota of opportunities on existing schemes for young people, including, in addition to Department of Social Protection schemes, opportunities for accessing entrepreneurship funds via Micro Finance Ireland and training and further education opportunities through the Department of Education and Skills and its agencies; and introducing a developmental internship programme for the most disadvantaged young people between 18 and 25 years of age.  These will be young people who have been identified as having significant barriers to gaining employment.  Under this programme employers will be asked to make work experience places available for young people aged 18 to 25 years with low levels of educational attainment, long periods of unemployment and other social barriers to employment.  It is proposed that at any one time 1,500 young people will participate in this programme and participation will be mandatory for those selected.  We will also improve the JobsPlus subsidy arrangements for employing young people by reducing the qualifying period those aged under 25 years from 12 months to four months in respect of young people who are assessed as having a low to medium probability of leaving the live register.  This is line with recommendations from the OECD.  In line with EU recommendations to improve labour mobility within the EU, we will introduce an international mobility and language skills development programme for young people.</p><p> By the end of 2014 processes and programmes will be rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support, that is, those who are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the public employment services, will receive a youth guarantee offer within four months.  In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s broader focus on tackling long-term unemployment, we will first target interventions at young people most at risk of long-term unemployment.  In this way, we will ensure that our resources are prioritised to help those who are most in need.  In 2012 some 56,000 young people joined the live register as wholly unemployed and some 35,000, or 63%, of these remained unemployed for four months or more.  The target of the guarantee approach will over time be to reduce this level of persistent unemployment among young people.  As part of the implementation of the youth guarantee it is proposed, subject to labour market and economic developments, to review the targeted nature of the youth guarantee offer before the end of 2015.</p><p> As I have already said, the youth guarantee implementation plan was published in January.  It provides over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014, as set out in the table circulated to members.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through post-leaving certificate courses, PLCs, and apprenticeships.  Although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, these PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for young people, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.  In regard to the 28,500 places for unemployed young people, approximately 5,000 of these were taken up in the first four months of 2014.  This is broadly in line with expectations, as the student intake on certain programmes, such as the vocational training opportunity scheme, VTOS, and back to education allowance are concentrated in September and October, in line with the academic calendar.  A new intake of young people to the second iteration of the momentum programme for long-term unemployed jobseekers is also scheduled for later in the year.</p><p> In addition, it is important to note that some of the initiatives planned under the guarantee require primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  We hope this legislation will be enacted as part of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill due to come before the Oireachtas in June.  Two employment schemes in particular, the youth guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people, are dependent on this legislation being passed.  The JobsPlus variant will be available as soon as possible after the relevant legislation has been cleared.  The developmental internship, which will include a pre-internship training period, will be in place no later than the autumn.  Passage of the legislation will also permit the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by Intreo with young unemployed people.</p><p> The cost of implementing the youth guarantee will be met, in the first instance, by the Irish Exchequer.  However, it is expected that a number of these youth programmes will meet European Social Fund, ESF, and youth employment initiative, YEI, eligibility criteria and will be included in the relevant applications for Ireland.  This will permit EU funding to be drawn down in respect of expenditure in 2014 and 2015 to a level that should enable the full YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68.1 million in current prices, with a further similar amount in ESF funding, to be taken up over those two years.  Given the way the funding is structured, in order to recoup these amounts from the EU in due course, it will be necessary that we spend, in the first instance, close to &euro;100 million on relevant programmes each year, or close to &euro;200 million in 2014 and 2015 overall.  It is anticipated that actual expenditure will be significantly in excess of that amount over the period concerned.  Taking existing and planned provision together, the current estimate of programme uptake by young people in 2014 of approximately 28,000 will involve associated programme costs of &euro;336 million.  If all post-leaving certificate course and apprenticeship provisions are included, the total programme uptake of approximately 52,000 has associated programme costs of &euro;528 million. </p><p> Even in advance of the adoption of the national implementation plan, the Department of Social Protection, in conjunction with local groups, had secured EU funding of &euro;250,000 to pilot a youth guarantee scheme in Ballymun.</p> <p>All under 25s on the live register in the Ballymun area are being targeted for inclusion in the pilot scheme.  The Ballymun pilot youth guarantee scheme is developing an activation approach tailored to the needs of young people, guaranteeing access to career guidance-assistance leading to identification of an individual career plan for the young unemployed person concerned, with a follow through to training, education, work experience or full-time employment.  A particular focus of the scheme is to involve and build links with employers in the locality and the immediate hinterland to ensure the guidance and training elements of the scheme are tailored to the needs of the local labour market and to generate work placement-experience opportunities for participants.</p><p> The pilot youth guarantee scheme involves an initial group engagement at the Intreo centre followed by a referral to the Local Employment Service for a one-to-one interview with a LES officer when a detailed progression plan will be prepared.  The result of this plan will be an offer of training, education, work experience or a job within four months.  All persons aged under 25 years on the live register in the Ballymun area are eligible for the pilot scheme.  Feedback from the scheme will be taken into account in the ongoing implementation of the youth guarantee in other areas of the country.</p><p> I hope I have adequately set out the current position on the introduction of the youth guarantee in Ireland and how it will be rolled out across the country in the coming months.  I will be pleased to answer questions.</p></speech>

We have drawn down 40% of it, but we have incurred minimal expense to date because most of the effort is focused on greater utilisation of the resources available rather than having to tap into the funding from the European Union.

I wrote a report on this issue in 2013.  What has happened since?  Will Mr. McKeon outline what is new?  Will he provide statistics for the increases across the schemes, not just Ballymun?  By how much has the take-up for JobBridge, JobsPlus, T&uacute;s, MOMENTUM, Youthreach, Microfinance Ireland, SOLAS, EURAS, Intreo and VTOS and of the back to education allowance, PLC, third level and Springboard places, respectively, increased?</p><p>  I am interested in the arts.

This has a major part to play in terms of the youth guarantee across the board, especially in the context of mainstream education, vocational education and an education for the disabled.  It is an fantastic, enormous document, but there does not seem to be a crossover with the youth guarantee scheme.  Will Mr. McKeon comment on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014052800005#F01300"><p>I thank the officials for attending and their presentation.  The committee has discussed the reduction in the level of youth unemployment which could be due to emigration and young people remaining in education, as well as some going back to work.  How many have returned to work?  We know the percentage reduction, but we would like to know how many are going back to work as opposed to emigrating and so on?</p><p>  On the previous occasion we discussed the JobBridge scheme with the officials we were informed that there was a 60% success rate in people gaining employment following an internship.  Has this percentage increased or decreased?  As I have stated previously, I know of employers who have taken people on under the scheme and who have then reduced the hours of their full-time employees.  The officials are making faces, but this is happening.  I reported this to social welfare officers at the time because the permanent employee had been given reduced hours as a result of the free labour provided through the internship, which is not good enough.  An employer who does this should not be granted another intern.</p><p>  I was contacted by a young man who has returned to education via the Springboard programme.  He is undertaking a culinary arts course in an institute of technology.  He was given a form to apply to take an intensive course next year run by Bord F&aacute;ilte through the institute of technology, which is grand.  His employer told him that he could gain some work experience over the summer while he was waiting to start his next course.  The poor lad is betwixt and between because if he does that work, he will not qualify for the back to education allowance to take the next course.  He will have to refuse work, which is the kernel of the problem.  People will not take up work opportunities because they will lose their benefits.  That should not happen to this young lad.  He should be allowed to take his summer job and return to take his next course in a few months.  He did not even complete the junior certificate programme, but, with the help of his parents, he went back to education and is trying to re-educate himself.  He now finds that the State is working against him by penalising him if he engages in summer employment.  That issue needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Therefore, what is happening to this young man is not supposed to happen.  One is supposed to be able to move freely; one is not supposed to be penalised, depending on which scheme one is moving to and from.</p></speech>

We need this to happen.  Mr. McKeon has outlined dates for the passage of the legislation.  Let us get it through.  What is holding it up?</p> <p>What is holding the legislation up?  Let us get it through.  Why is it being held up so long?  I thought the Minister might be here today so that we could speak about this, but she is not.  We are now halfway through 2014 and another year will be gone before we get it.<br />I have a concern.  Wording is very important and people can cover a lot up with wording.  Mr. McKeon said:<blockquote>The cost of implementing the youth guarantee will be met, in the first instance, by the Irish Exchequer.  However, it is expected that a number of these youth programmes will meet European Social Fund, ESF, and youth employment initiative, YEI, eligibility criteria and will be included in the relevant applications for Ireland.  </blockquote>I do not want to hear that it is expected to meet eligibility criteria; I want to know that it will meet them.  What is the point in saying that we thought it would, if it does not?  We need to know it will meet the eligibility criteria.<br />Mr. McKeon stated that the programme would cost &euro;528 million for 52,000 people.</p></speech>

The table the Department provided seems to indicate that spending on Gateway works out at approximately &euro;5,555 per young person - &euro;2.5 million divided by 450.  However, T&uacute;s works out at &euro;15,900 per person - &euro;15.9 million divided by 1,000.  What is the reason for the difference in the cost?</p><p>  The table also indicates that the 2014 costing per young person on community employment works out at &euro;28,000.  Is that for one year longer?  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh received a reply to a parliamentary question indicating the average cost of a CE place for one year, including income support and all of their costs for items such as training fees and materials, at &euro;13,500.  I seek clarification on the difference.</p><p>  What are included in the costs column on the right hand side of the table?  Does that include everything - income support, training fees, materials and administration?  Does it reflect full-year costs or only what is expected to be spent in 2014?  If so, how would it compare with a full year's costs?</p><p>  I believe there will be a review of the scheme at the end of 2015.  Should a review not be carried out sooner, given that the funding is over 2014 and 2015?  Earlier, Mr. McKeon outlined what the Department would be spending in 2014 and 2015.  Do we not want to ensure, before the money is spent or allocated, that we are doing everything right?  I know Mr. McCormick spoke at the conference in Brussels in April, which I also attended.  He used the car analogy to describe the youth guarantee in Ireland, explaining that we were upgrading existing schemes and might be able to do more down the line; I do not want to get into it.  To expand on the car analogy, it would be akin to having an NCT but having it too late and not being able to establish if the car is up to scratch.</p><p>  I wish to deal with JobBridge for disadvantaged youths.  This issue has been raised by some youth groups I have met.  There is obviously concern about the compulsion involved.  How does the Department ensure the positions are suitable for young people?  I know the plan makes reference to preparation courses prior to commencement.  What will these courses involve?  How do we ensure we have good-quality placements?  What stage have we reached in the design of that?  Mr. McKeon spoke today about mandatory participation.  How will the participants be selected for that?</p><p>  I know the Ballymun pilot is only for people on the live register in that area.  The plan does not indicate how it might be extended to people who are not on the live register and who are not perhaps engaging with the public employment services.  I ask Mr. McKeon to elaborate on that.</p><p>  Mr. McKeon mentioned positive discrimination as if legislation to deal with that would be coming up in June.  He referred to increasing the number of places on schemes available to, and accessed by, young people and earmarking a quota of opportunities on existing schemes for young people.  The Pathways to Work programme states that because young people are getting these places ring-fenced there is a compulsion and they will be penalised if they do not take them up.  Does Mr. McKeon foresee problems because some people are being put at a disadvantage, specifically in the cases of ring-fencing, where there is not additionality but it is just the case that these are the places and we will now have a ring-fence around a certain number of them for young people?</p></speech>

I will not get the calculator out to do the sums, but I promise I will come back to the Senator through the committee secretariat to show her how the figures are worked out.  In short, the cost of provision is a function of the average number, which is a function of the inflow, the outflow, the stock and when things start.  For example, Gateway is only starting, whereas schemes such as community employment and T&uacute;s are already available and we are incurring costs on them.  We already have young people on T&uacute;s and community employment; there are only a few people on Gateway.  So the costs for the year on Gateway will be considerably less in 2014 than the costs for T&uacute;s or CE.  It is a timing issue, but we will get to that.</p><p>  I was asked about the &euro;500 million.  That is the cost, and it works out at roughly &euro;10,000 per person.  A large part of the cost of these schemes is the underlying welfare payment.  Not everybody on these schemes would be in receipt of a welfare payment, but for those in receipt of a welfare payment the welfare payment cost is included, and this comprises a big part of the cost.</p></speech>

The measure of unemployment which is used and which has been used by the European Union and the Department is the ILO, International Labour Organization, measure, which does not include people with disabilities, and that is what we have been particularly asked to deal with.  Everybody has an interest in doing what we can to help not just young people but people generally with disabilities back to work.  We have a number of schemes and services already in place.  Arguably, prior to the introduction of Intreo and things like the youth guarantee, the schemes and services in place for people with disability actually exceeded those in place for people without disabilities.  Not many people know about these, even though we try to promote them.  There are very attractive employment subsidies for employing somebody with a disability - much more attractive than JobsPlus.  There are workplace adaptation grants.  We pay for job coaches to sit beside people and mentor them while they go into work.  We pay for extra supervisors.  All of those schemes are in place.  A big part of the challenge is making them known and promoting them to employers.</p></speech>

A question was raised about positive discrimination and legislation.  We have draft legislation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is intended to include it in the social welfare Bill which will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in June with a target of enactment sometime in July.  Whether it makes it into the first draft of the Bill or comes in as a Committee Stage amendment is a matter for the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel which is finishing the technical drafting of the Bill.  Some technical issues have arisen.  It is certainly our intention to have it in the Bill for consideration by the Oireachtas.  Unfortunately, while the European Union equality directive allows us to discriminate positively in favour of young people our national legislation does not so we must make this change.</p></speech>

We must deal with this.</p><p>  I will speak for a moment on JobBridge for disadvantaged youths and I ask committee members to interrupt me if I do not hit the point of the question.  JobBridge is about breaking the cycle of not being able to get work without experience but not being able to get experience without a job.  Even in the good years some young people would not have had a chance, such as those who may have a record with the probation service or drug addiction problems, or who left school very early.  We are canvassing employers to make 1,500 work experience places available for this cohort of young people.  We will work closely with them in our Intreo centres and prepare them for work.  We will work with the Education and Training Boards on work preparation programmes.  If they are offered a place which we believe is appropriate to them and would give them work experience to enable them to go on another step we will ask them to take up the opportunity.  It will be somewhat different to the current JobBridge programme in that it will involve a four day rather than a five day week.  This extra day can be used for training, job search or other activities.  In the context of the guarantee and the cost it will be mandatory, but it will only be mandatory where one of our case officers determines a person can and will benefit from it.</p><p>  With regard to the review by the end of 2015 the committee should take it as read that we will monitor progress and follow the numbers and trends.  It is difficult to undertake a formal review of the impact of schemes which require 12 months work placement or 12 months on T&uacute;s.  One must let the schemes run their course before a formal review can be done.  We will watch the outcomes and if there are any early warning signs we will tailor what we do to take account of them.</p><p>  Senator Moloney asked about the language and use of the word "expected".  We have deliberately used this language.  We are fully confident they will qualify but we cannot state they will do so because it is in the gift of the European Commission.  This document will go to the Commission so we cannot tell it that it will give us this money, we must tell them we expect it will.  This is where the language comes from.</p><p>  With regard to the issues about full-time employees being displaced by JobBridge all I can say is it is not something we will tolerate if we find out about it.  We have disallowed employers from using JobBridge, not unlike the case mentioned.  If committee members have details they should send them to us and we will investigate them.</p></speech>

We will commission further research this year to evaluate JobBridge.  The internal figures we have examine known progression to employment immediately at the end of JobBridge and this supports the fact it is still above 60%.  We must be conscious of the fact that people who sign off the live register do not have to tell us what they are doing.  We rely on people when they sign off stating they are going into employment.  They can sign off and not tell us.  We do not get responses from approximately 20% to 30% of people.  They just sign off and that is it.  Of those about whom we know we are confident the figure of 60% is maintained.</p></speech>

I would encourage Senator Moloney to have a look at that.</p><p> There has been a significant increase in youth emigration.  We all will be aware of families, for example, friends of my children, who would have emigrated.  It has, certainly, based on the Central Statistics Office numbers, tailored off and decreased somewhat.  The most recent figures are for August 2013.  There has not been an increase in emigration which would explain the reduction in unemployment during that period.  I honestly do not believe that emigration has reduced unemployment.  It certainly helped in stopping it increasing, but in my view the reduction in unemployment is genuinely down to people going back to work.</p></speech>

There are two points I would make about it.  First, there are some recommendations, for example, about youth entrepreneurship.  We have got that covered in our implementation plan.  There is a recommendation about mobility and language development and, as it happens, we have got that in our plan.</p></speech>

There is a significant amount of "cross-fertilisation".  I hate such agricultural words, but there is a significant amount that could be used.  If I hear the word "entrepreneurship" again, I will implode somewhere on a road when people have not the oracy to explain themselves.  There is a considerable amount that could be done there in effective teaching, which the Department was doing within the vocational and others schemes as a given.  There is enormous amount in the arts and in sport that could be part of the youth guarantee.  There should be some kind of that other dreadful clich&eacute;, "synergy", between this and the other.</p></speech>

I will give the sums of money, but I will come to the places as well.  Within the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills, etc., there is approximately &euro;46 million of additional spend this year compared to previous years directly attributable to the youth guarantee on places, etc.  Those places are made up as follows.  There are 1,500 on JobsPlus.  There are approximately 2,000 on the internship programme - although there are 1,500 places at any one point in time, because it is of a six-to-nine month duration, we will get approximately 2,000 through it.  We have an extra 1,000 places for young people on the T&uacute;s scheme.  As places we are talking about for the language and international mobility, we have 250 places this year to see how that goes.  We are talking to our colleagues, in particular, in Germany, about that, and to the education and training board in Dublin about running a language programme to make it happen.  On MOMENTUM, which is in the Department of Education and Skills, there are 2,000.  To use the word Senator O'Donnell mentioned, "entrepreneurship", the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has a microfinance fund.  The Taoiseach launched some information about this recently.  It is planned that approximately 700 young people will qualify for funding.</p></speech>

It is a course in social entrepreneurship that is being provided by the UCD Innovation Academy as part of the Ballymun youth guarantee.  It is a part-time programme over 18 weeks.  It is about creative thinking and positive thinking.  The hope would be that many of the participates there would progress to self-employment or, if not, they are the kinds of person that we want in business who are problem solvers and creative thinkers.  We will be providing support after the event.</p><p>  For those who have a specific idea about what they would like to do in terms of self-employment, we will be supporting them through the funding provided by Microfinance Ireland or the credit union loan guarantee and the soft supports that either the LEO or the partnership would be providing.  There is, in fact, a lot of synergy going on.  There is a lot of creative thinking going on.  We are absolutely committed to trying to harness the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation of those within the committee.  In fact, we will be thinking beyond the mere 18-week course provided by UCD Innovation Academy asking, for example, if there are opportunities in terms of developing innovative CE schemes where the young people in the community can identify gaps in provision within the community and go on themselves to start up companies, either in the public or private sector.  It is an issue of which we are well aware and doing our best to support.</p><p>  There was a question about the pilot Ballymun youth guarantee scheme and why it was confined to the live register.  There is an agreement with the European Union, which is providing the vast bulk of the funding for it.  We have a contract with the Union to deliver and we are not at liberty to broaden the scope of it, although, as my colleague, Mr. McKeon, stated, there are a broad range of other supports available to employers to assist those who have disabilities or who are not fully able to go back to work.</p><p>  In terms of how real it is on the ground, we only became operational in Ballymun at the end of January.  Our commitment to the young people of Ballymun is that we will give each of them who are signing-on on the live register a guarantee - a quality offer of education, training, development, work experience or work, within a period of four months after a one-to-one engagement.</p><p>  So far, the findings are good.  We have seen 360 people so far of which, already, 75% have been given a quality offer.  Some 60% of those are into education and 40% into employment.</p></speech>

It is important to note that this is a particular scheme looking at particular issues involving a partnership of all of the key stakeholders.  I am delighted that the committee had the opportunity to have a chat with Mick Creedon.  He is an enormous asset.  I can say that equally of all of the partners.  We are getting tremendous support from business, from employers and from the education and training board.  It is a wonderful and real and tangible partnership, not only people sat around a table.  We all are totally committed to doing what we can to support those back into employment.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the fact that we are awaiting legislative approval to be able to introduce a broader range of schemes, it is not only that things are happening in Ballymun.  The committee might be aware that in February last we invited all of the young people in Swords to an event in IBAT.  There were 400 young people on the live register in Swords and we provided opportunities with employers.  It was a big event, with all of the employers in the area and with the education and training providers.  It has been hugely successful.  Some 27% of them are now in employment.</p></speech>

I got the figures recently and I will go through them.</p> <p>There were 411 invited, of whom 63 are now in full-time employment, 19 are in casual employment, 15 are involved in internships and two are participating in T&uacute;s.  Therefore, there are now 99 young people in Swords in some form of employment who, before February, were on the live register.  A further 193 are undertaking courses of further education, training or development.  It is not a case of waiting to see what happens in Ballymun; we are learning from the project on an ongoing basis and certainly applying in my division knowledge of what has been learned.  My colleagues' divisional managers are attending a meeting today at which the youth guarantee is very much on the agenda and I have been asked to supply support.  With regard to the approach we are adopting in Swords and potentially the approach we are adopting in Ballymun, the knowledge is being applied on an ongoing basis, notwithstanding the fact that there will not be a formal review of the project until September.  I assure the committee that there are many ongoing developments.</p></speech>

As we know, the trade unions have bought into it and are very supportive of it.  My point concerns both youth and older workers.  In the patch Mr. Carroll and I know well, there is some feedback from the local authority to the effect that some of the individuals who have been selected may be individuals whom the local office wants or has not been able to move on in different ways.  In some cases, they may be unemployable or people who have really struggled to find work, even in the boom.  I understand Gateway does not have a supervisory element to it.  If it is to succeed and people in the category to which I refer are being chosen, we need some funding for supervision.  It is in everybody's interests that the programme succeed.</p></speech>

Community employment must also be considered in this regard.  </p><p>  With regard to the back-to-work enterprise allowance, should we not be aiming to have more young people set up their own companies and businesses?  I have noticed that some people in receipt of the back-to-work enterprise allowance are individuals from an older generation who are returning to self-employment having been on social welfare.  I have no problem with this, but if there were more young people using the allowance, there might be start-up companies, perhaps in the technology sector.  Should we not aim to have more in this category?</p><p>  I participated in a social employment scheme when I was young and found it very beneficial.  With regard to Gateway, particularly because it concerns local authorities, should we not want young people to gain experience in local authorities' planning, arts or heritage departments?

The three must be taken together.  The sums of 700 and 150 represent an additional effort.</p><p>  As Mr. Carroll is much more familiar with Gateway than I am, I will ask him to deal with it.  I am almost certain the programme does have a supervisory element, although I will ask Mr. Carroll to clarify this.  I know that there was some talk to the effect that there was no supervisory element, but there may have been a misunderstanding.  I absolutely agree that the programme could provide a very good pathway to employment.  The objective is to deal with long-term unemployment.  Generally, the proportion who are long-term unemployed is higher among older than younger groups, thus affecting the figures.</p><p>  Sometimes there is talk about people who are unemployable - I say it myself from time to time.  There are some on the live register who will find it very difficult in every circumstance to find a job.  However, even at the height of the Celtic tiger, there were approximately 150,000 people on the live register, of whom approximately 100,000 were short-term unemployed.  There was frictional unemployment.  One is looking at a hard cohort of 50,000.  There are approximately 400,000 on the live register, whcih means that there are more than enough on it who are capable of doing a job.  Most people on it are employable and the vast majority want to work.  It is a question of the Department giving them the right support and direction.  Mr. Carroll will refer to Gateway also.</p><p>  With regard to communication with young people, being in my 50s, I am loath to say we are on point, but we do make an effort.  We use Twitter, Facebook and other social media, including YouTube and such resources.  In my experience, however, the most effective communication mechanism which will not be affected by any development in IT or otherwise is face to face communication.  We invest most of our resources in face to face work using our case officers.  The Intreo approach is about getting to speak to individuals.  Perhaps Mr. Carroll might elaborate on this.</p></speech>

The youth guarantee is very important.  My document of 2013 which nobody read mentioned Ballymun, the youth guarantee and the Gateway project which is exactly what the delegation is talking about.  The Finnish Government launched a road show.  I am not suggesting one use the equivalent of a Fossett's Circus tent, but in a way, there is nothing wrong with this.  Those involved went to the major cities to ascertain, with the various local authorities, what were the major or diverse needs.  I raise the question of communication because it is always one of how one communicates.  Of course, one to one communication is paramount.  The Ballymun initiative is about finding the path with the individual, but it is imperative, for the sake of the energy of the scheme, that communication be good.</p></speech>

We must use multiple channels and interfaces.  I refer not only to communication by the Department but also by the other partners.</p> <p>In Ballymun, we are fortunate in having the Ballymun Regional Youth Resource, BRYR, a youth centre that is engaging with the most marginalised people.<br />We have been examining what we say to people and how we say it.  This is just one of the ways in which we are communicating.  As some of the literature that traditionally issued from the Department might be seen as formal or turgid, this is a way of brightening it up and getting a message across.  We have a youth website, <i>youthguarantee.ie</i>, which we are using to communicate with people.  We had Facebook and Twitter accounts in respect of the youth guarantee, but I was concerned that they had insufficient back-end resourcing.  We should not publish a site unless people are able to respond at the other end.  It is using-----</p></speech>

We held an event the previous month in Finglas and another in Swords the month prior to that.  We are monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis, not waiting for a big bang.  It is a fundamental part of our work.</p><p>  To answer the questions on Gateway, it is of major importance and has a significant contribution to make to the provision of a wealth of real employment opportunities for young people.  We have recently agreed a pilot in Fingal that addresses many of the perceived issues in respect of the people being referred.  Until fairly recently, the requirement was for random selections and the Department did not have a say in who could be sent.  Neither could we send people for whom we felt it would be a great opportunity or just to get them off our books.  It was a simple random selection process.  We will trial a new approach.  Generally, the Department has agreed that, henceforth, 20% of places can be filled by way of self-referral, which is a positive move.  We are determining how to implement this idea logistically.  In Fingal, we will write out and interview people to determine their suitability.  There is a feedback loop.  Where we invite people to attend and find them suitable, the local authority will consider the range of opportunities that might be suitable for those candidates.  If it believes that the person presenting is not job ready, it will feed that information back to us to explain why.  Clearly, we must be able to deal with whatever impeded that person from being able to progress.  The feedback loop is built in.  In terms of the-----</p></speech>

People will be written to and invited to attend.  Fingal County Council will notify us of those who do not avail of the invitation, as they are obviously people with whom we will need to chat.  We are asking people a range of questions.  It is like a mini-curriculum vitae.  On the face of it, Fingal County Council will determine if a person is not suitable for the range of available opportunities and will write to the person to that effect while thanking him or her for expressing an interest.  The other cohort will attend interviews.  Arising from those, people will either be offered opportunities or Fingal County Council will notify the Department of what made them unsuitable.  It is a much more structured approach.  It is not a question of inviting people to interviews when they will clearly not be suitable for jobs, as that can be frustrating and upsetting for them.</p><p>  Recently, we received from Dublin City Council an offer of 50 guaranteed places in respect of the Ballymun youth guarantee.  Those young people will engage in a broad range of activities, for example, maintenance, parks, the arts, the library and community services.  As the Deputy knows, the local authority engages in a broad range of work.  We are trying to be creative with the kinds of opportunity being presented as opposed to what is most people's belief on the matter, namely, putting people to work picking up litter.</p></speech>

It is proposed that Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Taft will each make an opening statement of approximately ten minutes which will be followed by a question and answer session of around 15 minutes per person and then we will have a summary and conclusion.  If the witnesses do not get everything covered in the opening address, I will create space at the end of the meeting for any further additional information they which to feed in.  It is not for committee members to express their own narrative on what is at issue at this time.  That will happen in the report.  The purpose of our proceedings is to draw on the expertise of the witnesses and listen to members' views and explore the issues with them.<br />By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way to make him or her identifiable.<br />I invite Mr. O'Brien to make his opening statement and I will then call on Mr. Taft to follow.</p></speech>

A paper by KPMG completed in February 2014 was circulated and I may refer to the key points in it.  The basis for some of the calculations in that paper is the Revenue Commissioners statistical paper, Corporation Tax Distribution Statistics, and I have copies of it for members.<br />There has been a great deal of discussion about the effective corporation tax rate in Ireland.  The recent papers and articles published on the topic would suggest that there is a 2% effective tax rate in Ireland.  That prompted us in KPMG to write the paper in February 2014.  I will now go through some of its key points.  Before members get into a discussion on what the effective tax rate is, there are a number of key concepts that are important in terms of the territorial scope of taxation.<br />The first question that one must ask is where a company is tax resident.  That is a matter that has been determined in Ireland as a result of case law going back about 150 years.  The leading case was the De Beers case in 1905.  Our paper quotes part of the judgment which states: <blockquote>In applying the conception of residence to a Company, we ought, I think, to proceed as nearly as we can upon the analogy of an individual.  A company cannot eat or sleep, but it can keep house and do business.  We ought, therefore, to see whether (sic) [recte where] it really keeps house and does business.  An individual may be of foreign nationality, and yet reside in the United Kingdom.  So may a Company.  Otherwise, it might have its chief seat of management and its centre of trading in England, under the protection of English law, and yet escape the appropriate taxation by the simple expedient of being registered abroad and distributing its dividends abroad.</blockquote>It then refers to a case some 30 years earlier, which I presume was in 1875, which held that a company resides where its real business is carried on: &quot;Those decisions have been acted upon ever since.  I regard that as the true rule; and the real business is carried on where the central management and control actually abides.&quot; <br />Ireland inherited that rule of residence in 1922 when it became an independent State and inherited the then UK tax system.  That has been a central point of our residence rule ever since.  The principle of what exactly central management of control means has been evolved by the courts in case law over the years.  Irish law follows those cases.  I do not think the Irish rules on that are regarded as unusual.<br />The OECD in its model tax treaties over the years has laid down as the key test for residence of a company the centre of effective management, which is essentially the same test.  We can see that as long ago as 1905, or perhaps 1875, the UK courts rejected the concept of incorporation as being the concept by which one should determine residence of a company and they went instead for the concept of management and control.  One can see in their judgments that the increased possibilities of tax avoidance that would arise if one went with an incorporation test as distinct from a management and control test were one of the reasons that they went with a management and control test.  We have inherited a residence test which is sensible and is based on management and control.  Much of the published articles and papers over the past six or seven months have indicated that Irish companies have an effective rate of corporation tax of 2% by looking at the taxes paid by Irish incorporated companies that are not resident here.  I do not think that makes sense.<br />The territorial scope of Irish corporate taxation, which is common to many countries in the world, is that if a company is resident here it pays tax on its worldwide profits, and if it suffers tax in other countries, it may get a credit for the tax suffered in another country.  If a company is not resident here, and it could be incorporated in Ireland and not resident here, it will still pay tax in Ireland if it has a branch here.  One may come across the phrase &quot;permanent establishment&quot;.  That is the phrase used in the OECD model treaty and it is essentially the same concept as a branch.  Branch is the term used in Irish domestic law, while permanent establishment, or PE, is used in the OECD model tax treaties.  If one has an office, a factory or personnel in Ireland, one will pay tax in Ireland notwithstanding the fact that one is not an Irish resident company.  Equally, non-Irish incorporated companies that are managed and controlled in Ireland would pay full tax here on their worldwide profits.  For example, companies that are incorporated in the Cayman Islands but are managed and controlled in Ireland pay full corporation tax here on their worldwide profits.  An analysis that looks at trying to calculate the amount of tax companies pay based on where they are incorporated is completely flawed, in my view.  It would have as much sense as saying: &quot;How much tax does an Irish citizen living in Dubai pay in Ireland?&quot;  The concept of residence is where a company resides and where it exists.  <br />We could, of course, if we wanted to, do as the United Kingdom did in the late 1980s and amend our rules to provide a dual test.  We could provide that a company is resident in Ireland if it is managed and controlled here or if it is incorporated in Ireland.  We could make that policy choice, but heretofore we have not done that.  That is not a particularly unusual feature of the Irish tax system.<br />One needs data to see what effective taxes are paid.  One needs to know how much tax is paid by Irish resident companies on their worldwide profits - that is both incorporated and non-Irish incorporated companies.  One wants data on the amount of tax paid by non-Irish resident companies that have Irish branches.  The best source is my view is to go to the Revenue Commissioners because it collects the data.  All the companies have to file tax returns.  They file CT1s, corporation tax returns, and that data is aggregated in the Revenue document which I distributed.  If members turn to page 6 of that document, they will see the Revenue Commissioners have aggregated the data and have come up with gross trade profits of &euro;73.8 billion being the gross profits earned by Irish resident companies and Irish branches of foreign companies.</p> <p>They deduct a number of expenses, which are not special tax breaks or reliefs but deductions for genuine business expenses.  The document shows a figure of &euro;8.5 billion for capital allowances.  A capital allowance is essentially a deduction for the depreciation cost of an asset that one buys.  As I note in my paper, the effective tax rate we produced in our calculations is understated.  One of the reasons is that one does not obtain capital allowances on every asset one buys, which means companies buy certain assets for which they do not receive a tax reduction for depreciation. </p><p> Trade losses forward are a normal deductible expense.  A company that makes a loss in one year can carry this forward to be offset against profits for the subsequent year.  This is common practice in virtually every tax system in the world.  </p><p> Current year trading losses occur where one makes a trading loss in one trade and offsets it with a second trade.  This, too, is not an unusual deduction. </p><p> Trade charges refer to royalties, patent payments and so forth, which are deductible in every sensible corporation tax system in the world. </p><p> Group relief is where the tax system recognises where a group has profits in one company and losses in another.  Again, virtually every corporation tax system in the world recognises that this type of relief should be available where one organic economic enterprise is split into different entities.</p><p> These are all normal deductions which reduce the figure for net profits to &euro;38 billion.  Tax should only be levied on net profits after legitimate expenses.  One then has other items of income such as gross rental income and other normal deductions.  The real net profit base in Ireland is &euro;40 billion.  This is the correct denominator in the calculation of an effective tax rate.  </p><p> The figures on page 5 allow us to calculate the correct numerator.  One starts off with a figure of &euro;4.594 billion for the total tax less reliefs plus surcharges.  This figure should then be adjusted for two items only, the first of which is research and development tax credits.  These appear below the line with the &euro;4.594 billion figure and two figures are shown.  The first, &euro;152.3 million, is an amount of research and development tax credits which were set against corporate tax liabilities.  The second figure is a research and development tax credit of &euro;106.2 million, which is the amount of research and development tax credits which are refunded to companies.  This figure refers to research and development costs that are not offset against liabilities but refunded.  These two items reduce the figure of &euro;4.594 billion, whereas the other three items are not, in my view, adjusting items.  I will discuss these relatively minor items in detail if members wish but the Department of Finance calculations treat them as adjusting items.  </p><p> Another number should be added back.  The table shows a figure for double taxation relief of &euro;567.1 million.  One could also do as the Department of Finance has done and produce two figures, one for before double tax relief and one for after double tax relief.  Double tax relief is, however, a normal form of tax relief and should not be deducted.  </p><p> This is how KPMG produced the numerator in our paper.  Using this numerator and denominator, we arrived at an effective tax rate in Ireland of 12.24%.  As I indicated, this is probably understated for a number of reasons.  There are a number of items of genuine business expense for which tax deductions are not available in Ireland, for example, tax depreciation on certain assets and certain entertainment and other expenses.  These figures must be added back.  As the Revenue figures do not show these add-backs, the gross profit figure is somewhat overstated. </p><p> Ireland's loss relief rules are imperfect, which means companies receive loss relief in some but not all cases.  On that basis, one could argue that the Revenue figure for total income is overstated.  For example, the explanatory note accompanying the paper notes that, for example, the total net rental income in the State in the period in question amounted to a loss of &euro;158 million, in other words, losses were made in aggregate as opposed to profits.  Despite this, &euro;520 million was charged in rental profits and, as such, the loss relief was imperfect.  The paper also shows total trading losses forward of &euro;150 million, yet this is not the number that emerges.  Only a small portion of these losses are relievable.  </p><p> The loss relief rules are imperfect and companies do not always receive relief for losses.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Brien" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52014052800004#C00500"><p>These are losses for which a relief has been obtained and which the company has been able to offset against other profits.  One could argue that where a business makes a loss of &euro;1 million in one area and a profit of &euro;1 million elsewhere, the number feeding into the numerator should be zero.  However, the number that feeds in is actually &euro;1 million if relief is not obtained for the loss.</p><p>  We have not adjusted for any of these items in our 12.24% figure for the effective tax rate, which we consider to be a conservative figure.  The effective tax rate is at least 12.24% and any talk of a 2% effective tax rate is completely wrong.  </p><p>  More recently, some of the debate has shifted a little towards stating that while the rate is probably 12%, Ireland allows deductions for payments made to other countries and this reduces the rate.  Deductions which are normal deductions on normal transfer price principles are deductible in every sensible tax system in the world.  This is not an unusual feature of the Irish corporation tax regime.  The United Kingdom has a 20% standard corporation tax rate and applies a 10% rate on some items.  It allows payments for royalties, interest and management fees, irrespective of whether they go to tax havens.  If one were to try to merge or average the tax rate between a tax haven sister company of a UK company and a UK company, one would obtain a rate that is lower than 20%.  Ireland levies a 12.5% tax rate, by and large, on the profits properly attributable to Ireland.  If one wishes to rationalise how one gets in and around 12.2%, one can see from the Revenue paper that approximately &euro;260 million of research and development tax credits were granted in that year, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate.  On the other hand, approximately &euro;2 billion of profits were charged at the higher rate of 25%, which applies to passive income.  This more or less cancelled out the cost of research and development tax credits.  That is rationally how one gets close to the 12.5% figure.  This is not surprising because the only significant tax break other than the 12.5% corporation tax rate is the research and development tax credit.  </p></speech>

Our submission will use the official data collected by national statistical agencies.  We do not intend to directly address the issue of Ireland's role in the global tax avoidance network, which would have a different impact on any estimates from the macroeconomic data.  In providing our estimate of the effective corporation tax, we will also place it in a European and an economic context.</p><p>  There are two principal measurements of profit at a macroeconomic level.  One measures against entrepreneurial income or net operating surplus.  The Central Statistics Office and EUROSTAT regard entrepreneurial income as a more comprehensive measure of corporate profitability.  According to the technical paper, Effective Rates of Corporation Tax in Ireland, produced by the Department of Finance, entrepreneurial income includes collective investment funds, which are not taxed at source.  This becomes a problem for financial companies only as this inclusion makes little difference for non-financial companies.  To arrive at a more robust and realistic rate and make it comparable across the European Union, one uses net operating surplus.  This figure is produced by deducting depreciation charges and net indirect product taxes and subsidies from gross operating surplus.  This is the standard international measurement used by EUROSTAT, the OECD and the United Nations. </p><p>  Our submission shows a table setting out the effective tax rate of countries based on net operating surplus.  This shows that three countries have an effective corporate tax rate of more than 30%.</p> <p>The mean average among other advanced European economies - namely, the 15 EU economies minus the poorer new member states - is 24%.  In Ireland, which lies at the bottom of these, it is 9%.  A useful comparison can be made with small open economies, because such economies have a structure very similar to ours.  These economies have a small domestic market and, like us, are heavily reliant on export earnings.  The IMF has used this benchmark from time to time in papers it published regarding Ireland during its period in the IMF programme.  These small economies include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Sweden.  The effective tax rate of those countries is even higher than ours, at 26%.<br />Ireland's low effective tax rate is a historical phenomenon and not just something that occurred in the past couple of years because of the recession.  The recession will impact sharply on corporate profitability, but over a ten-year period Ireland has consistently been at the bottom of the table of the advanced European economies.<br />Tax rates, whether headline or effective, are a result of policy.  To put them in context, one of the goals of our tax rate policy is to encourage investment.  To test how successful this is in comparison with other countries, it is useful to contrast the amount of corporate investment, of both financial and non-financial companies, as a proportion of their profits in net operating surplus.  The first table on page 3 of my submission demonstrates that it is not unusual for European economies to have corporate investment that is higher than corporate profits.  The average is about 1:1 but, as can be seen, Ireland is once again at the bottom of the table, as corporate investment here is just one-fifth of corporate profitability.  Other measurements can be used.  For instance, as a measure of GDP, one will find that on average over the last decade, corporate investment in the economy is about one third less than the average corporate investment in the EU 28.<br />Another stated policy goal is to use the low corporate tax rate to encourage increased expenditure in the domestic economy.  Forf&aacute;s regularly tracks this in its annual business surveys.  Direct expenditure refers to two items: payroll, which is wages, salaries and social insurance contributions; and purchases from domestic companies, whether for materials or services.  That is the direct expenditure.  Forf&aacute;s estimates that at the beginning of the last decade, over 37% of sales revenue of the current State agencies such as the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in the traded sector was returned to the economy through payroll and domestic purchases.  However, this has fallen over the decade to about one quarter.  Over that period, in real terms - that is, after inflation - direct expenditure by traded companies has fallen by 17%.<br />I would like to point out one further thing to the joint sub-committee.  It would also be a goal of a low effective tax rate to boost the level of employee compensation.  Obviously, if one is encouraging business activity and trying to give it an edge internationally with a corporate tax rate, and also encouraging certain types of high-value-added firm, one would expect that through the trickle-down process, this would impact strongly on employee compensation.  <br />In the graph at the top of page 4, we find that whereas throughout the EU 28 employee compensation makes up nearly three times the level of profits in that operating surplus, in Ireland it is approximately 1:1.  Ireland's relative low-wage standing should not come as a surprise.  My own union, Unite, recently published an analysis based on EUROSTAT data showing that we lag far behind other European averages in terms of employee compensation.  We lag 14% below other advanced European economies.<br />To come back to the question of small open economies with a structure just like our own, our employee compensation levels are 30% below the average of those economies.  There are benefits and costs involved and it is up to the joint sub-committee to tease them out.  One of the costs of a low effective tax rate and the negative differential between that and the tax rate of an average European economy is that it imposes higher costs on households.  It does so either through higher taxation or through reduced expenditure on public services, social protection and investment.<br />We hope the joint sub-committee's exploration of the effective corporate tax rate will be just a first step in a wider analysis of its fiscal and economic impact.  This would allow us to explore a number of other questions.  Is it achieving its stated policy goals, such as encouraging investment, at least in comparison with other European countries?  What would be the impact of an alternative system of corporation tax?  For instance, what would be the impact of a regime with a higher nominal rate but which rewarded capital-intensive and other key value-added sectors for investment, thus hoping to boost corporate investment in the economy while still yielding higher tax revenues?<br />Clearly, when we compare ourselves to our peer group of other small open economies, they have a far higher effective corporate tax rate.  It is nearly three times higher than Ireland's.  At the same time, they have much higher levels of corporate investment and employee compensation.  I would submit that, whatever about the successes or failures of the current system, there are other systems that seem to be working.  It might be beneficial even to explore those systems to see how, with a higher tax rate, one can still generate considerably more investment and employee compensation or wages in the economy.<br />There is no doubt about the positive presence of foreign direct investment in key areas of the economy, including those that are in capital-intensive and globally networked sectors.  The challenge for the joint sub-committee is to explore the deficits and benefits in order to see if some model comes through.  There is a need to study the realistic tax rate in Ireland.  We have just dealt with the macro-economic level; we have not dealt with the issues that Mr. O'Brien mentioned in terms of referencing, for instance, the work of Professor James Stewart.  His work has identified that US multinationals based here have a tax rate of 2%, which is much closer to economies such as Bermuda and the UK's Caribbean islands than it is to Germany and France.  The issue is how to explore that situation to see how we can improve it.<br />There is highly negative international opinion regarding our tax rates, whether it comes from the US Senate, the House of Commons or the EU investigation into our tax rates.  It is also constantly mentioned in articles in prestigious financial newspapers, such as <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>or the <i>Financial Times</i>.  This is causing considerable reputational damage to the Irish economy, to the point of ridicule.  A recent article in <i>Forbes</i>magazine suggested that if they could not call Ireland a tax haven, they should call us a bagel.  I suggest that is the type of publicity we could do without.</p></speech>

Then, everybody sensed that there was a problem with the asset bubble but few were willing to face up to it, never mind address it.  Tax-driven industrial enterprise policy is problematic, especially where that tax structure is concerned.</p> <p>Many international commentaries and international organisations can be undermined by other economies seeking to do the same thing or possibly even better, as can international agencies that are attempting to address the widescale phenomenon of global tax avoidance.  This structure could easily be undone by the proverbial stroke of a legislative pen in some other country.  We must ensure that we are not heading blindly into another crisis because of a refusal to face up to reality or adapt to a changing environment.  I thank the Chairman and the committee.</p></speech>

We will now proceed with the questions.  We will break the questions down into 15 minutes slots.  These committee meetings are broadcast live either on a unified streaming platform, USP, the web and so forth.  For a layperson looking in on this the easiest way to explain the effective tax rate for a PAYE worker is in terms of net take home pay as opposed to gross payment.  We are discussing the net and gross payments of companies.  Will you offer your judgment on it?  When you analyse the effective tax rate paid by companies that are engaged in foreign direct investment here or structured in the country in different ways, does Ireland provide an opportunity for them such that we are a tax haven not by design but by accident?  Perhaps Mr. O' Brien would like to address that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Brien" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52014052800006#E00300"><p>Not in my view, unless one takes the view that an effective tax rate in or around 12.2% or 12.5% constitutes a tax haven.  That, in turn, depends on what one views as the minimum acceptable level of corporation tax.  The 2% rate that has been quoted widely is a bogus rate based on companies that are not tax resident in Ireland.  Such companies are incorporated in Ireland but that is a different concept.  This bogus number has been picked up in the international press and repeated throughout the web and so on and it has been used to beat Ireland.  It is most unfortunate that what I regard as an inaccurate or misleading statistic has been picked up in this way.  I went through the matter in the paper and the Department of Finance paper comes to a similar conclusion.  Mr. Taft's paper comes to a 9% rate, which is not a million miles away.  It is probably too micro to get into the differences between the 9% rate and the 12.2% rate but certainly it is not 2%; that is simply misleading.</p><p>  Under the Irish regime we have set out our stall under a 12.5% rate along with research and development tax credits, which can reduce the rates somewhat.  That is what we offer to the world and we offer it based on profits that are properly allocated to Ireland.  Broadly speaking, that is fine as an offering.  It is similar to the offering of some other similar countries.  For example, countries such as Singapore and Switzerland, which compete with us for foreign direct investment, offer similar regimes.  We are not an outlier in that regard.</p><p>  Across the Border in Northern Ireland, which has not had the benefit of as low a corporation tax rate, they are trying to catch up.  The United Kingdom has introduced a 10% corporation tax rate for what is termed patent box activities.  It has been publicly stated by officials in Northern Ireland that, as a result, projects that were due to come to the South went to Northern Ireland.  Large multinationals in the UK have publicly stated that they have located projects in the UK as a result.  The big four accounting firms in the UK have collectively said that they are now advising hundreds of companies which are considering relocating to the UK as a result of the UK undercutting our offering in many respects.  What we offer is attractive but it is not a tax haven.  Others are trying to do the same.  In fact, others, including our nearest neighbour, are trying to undercut us.</p></speech>

It depends on the definition.  Are we being used as a tax haven?  Are we a conduit tax haven?  Companies set up here are able, as part of the global avoidance network, to shift from one jurisdiction or economy through here to move on to another economy.  We did not particularly address that matter but there are numerous examples.  In fact, legal and accounting firms publish brochures aimed at the markets in continental European countries.  They suggest companies come to Ireland-----</p></speech>

The firms suggest companies come to Ireland and they will show those companies how to pay 2.5% tax.  That may not represent a tax haven as such but it certainly provides a haven from higher taxation if companies are trying to move from a higher tax regime, such as Germany, France or possibly America, to here.</p><p>  I offer one example.  I realise Mr. O'Brien is coming at it from the accountancy and tax-based approach.  I have come at it from the macroeconomic end.  Anyway, the claim is that our corporate tax system is transparent.  However, we cannot undertake key economic measurements because of what Forf&aacute;s has termed multinational accountancy practices.  For example, Forf&aacute;s cannot measure Irish productivity, which is an incredible situation.  As a result of the intervention of multinational accounting practices, which inflate gross value added and gross operating surplus in the multinational-dominated sectors, Forf&aacute;s has to measure the productivity of the labour force in the United States and apply that measurement here.  It is a highly unsatisfactory situation and possibly unique among western industrialised countries.  I do not know of other countries which have to do that.  That is an example of where the multinational accountancy practices actually undermine the basic data.  That is the practice and consequently we cannot compare input and output tables throughout Europe, either through EUROSTAT or Central Statistics Office data.  For similar reasons we cannot compare gross operating surplus or profits per employee in particular sectors because the data are way off the chart.  If that is occurring then of course it is occurring in our tax base.</p></speech>

Let us consider the House of Commons report, the Senate report and so on.  We must take into account the individual national motivation behind reports because we are in a competitive global economy and, therefore, taxation gives a competitive edge while reputational damage gives a competitive advantage to other countries and so forth.  Anyway, with regard to the scrutiny applied to the comparative rate in Ireland and bearing in mind what you have said, Mr. Taft - I will follow on with the views of Mr. O'Brien - how does this measure up with scrutiny undertaken in other jurisdictions?</p></speech>

Is our effective tax rate closer to what its says on the tin by comparison with other countries?</p></speech>

I am referring to the CSO data because EUROSTAT data is collected from there and it is very close to the Revenue Commissioners data as well, as Mr. O'Brien pointed out.  The French effective corporate tax rate is over 30%.</p></speech>

We did not look at the nominal rate in our submission.  You may be referring to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  To be fair to PwC, the firm never portrayed the exercise as an exercise in comparing effective tax rates.  PwC took one company, the now famous pottery company of 50 employees, which was non-trading and which would have been allowed the lower French rate.  The French have two corporate rates, one for smaller businesses.  Ireland used to have such a lower corporate tax rate.  The Chairman asked about scrutiny.  Apparently, there is increasing scrutiny.  The EU Commission has launched an investigation into the tax practices of Luxembourg, Netherlands and Ireland.</p> <p>The Netherlands has gone through a period of scrutinising itself and has started to renegotiate its double taxation treaties with other countries.  The Finance Minister went so far as to apologise for allowing the country to be used as a tax conduit because he was very concerned by the reputational damage to the Netherlands.</p></speech>

It is correct to say, however, as I am sure the officials from the Department of Finance have told the committee, that the Irish system is relatively transparent.  The tax legislation is complicated but it will tell one the tax rates that will apply.  No one will give a company a letter saying the rate is 12.5% but it can have a 3% rate.  That does, in effect, happen in other countries which have special regimes that are quite opaque.  For example, it is very difficult to understand how the tax rate evolves in Singapore but essentially a deal is cut between the taxpayer and the revenue authorities in many cases.  That can also be the case in Switzerland, where there may be a different treatment in each of the 18 cantons.  The rate is a quasi-negotiated rate in many cases.</p></speech>

We can decide whether it should be 99.9% or 1%.  Scrutiny measures that apply across many OECD and European countries focus on the margin between the corporate rate and the effective rate.  How does Ireland perform in that regard?</p></speech>

Some other jurisdictions, which have been less transparent and have a wider gap between their effective rate and their actual rate, have tended to escape scrutiny because the headline rate looks high, but many corporations have paid lower rates.  It is now possible for a company with headquarters in the UK to create a finance company with an effective tax rate of 5%, which is much less than our 12.5%.  That is a deliberate policy decision in the UK.  Its patent box regime is a 10% rate which also undercuts our 12.5% rate.  The EU is now scrutinising the patent box regime.  The UK is defending it but it is not inconceivable that it could be held to be contrary to EU law and it may have to be amended.</p></speech>

Our main project here is to consider the architecture of the application of global taxation, considering what is happening in that arena and Ireland's place and position in that, what we can do, what we can not do, what we can do unilaterally and what we have to do in other contexts.  To use the analogy I used earlier, for companies it is similar to the offside rule in soccer in that there is no point talking to Manchester United or Chelsea.  One has to talk to UEFA and FIFA because they set the rules.  The teams play within the rules and maximise them to their advantage.  Will the announcement by the Minister for Finance in budget 2014 change the effective tax rate in this country or will it be neutral at the end of the year?  I am talking about the residency issue.</p></speech>

It will not have a significant impact on tax revenue or the effective tax rate.  The reason for investigation, analysis or criticism of the Irish corporate tax regime is not the effective tax rate but what is perceived as our role in the global tax avoidance network.  The problem is not the tax rate, it is how we allow companies to use our economy as a transfer conduit.  There is a big debate as to whether we do that in our law or whether it is a function of other countries' laws.  The debate is not about the effective tax rate in that regard, it is whether we are a tax haven conduit.</p></speech>

Is there anything we can do in isolation that adjusts the type of anomalies Mr. Taft has described, or can we do something to our effective tax rate system that makes it stand up better to scrutiny and comparative analysis with other regions?</p></speech>

No one else created it for us.  We started to do this in the 1950s with the first tax reliefs for companies to come in here.  One could say we created it therefore we can "un-create" it.  We cannot, however, "un-create" something on which we based our policy for decades.  In our submission we point out that other countries like our own, those heavily reliant on exports and with small domestic markets, have tax structures that are far different and seem to have a far better economic return.  It is possible for us to get to that point but it is a long-term process, and the first thing one has to do is face up to the reality and not attempt to defend what is becoming increasingly difficult to defend in international circles.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Brien" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52014052800007#F01200"><p>There are a range of policy options.  One possibility is to increase our corporation tax rate.  Mr. Taft mentioned earlier that a low corporation tax rate imposes costs on households because the gap in tax revenue needs to be made up elsewhere.  I would not disagree with that but it assumes that if the corporation tax rate is increased, the total tax yield to the Exchequer will be increased.  That is not necessarily the case.  At the very least that is a debatable proposition.  If we increase our corporation tax rate and, as a consequence, some of the companies based here leave and go elsewhere, to Singapore, Switzerland or the UK, and we lose all that corporation tax revenue, as well as the PAYE and PRSI take on all their employees, the VAT on local spend, plus the increased welfare payments to those unemployed as a result.  We may in fact deprive Irish households of income and increase the burden on them.  There is a point at which one can increase the corporation tax rate - and one can debate what that point is - beyond which the resources available to households will decrease.  That is a key point.  We have increased the corporation tax that we charge on international business.  It used to be 0% until the 1980s, then it was 10%, and now it is 12.5%.  Meanwhile competitors have reduced theirs.</p></speech>

He said it would be open to us to add a second feature to residence - that any company incorporated here would be deemed to be resident here.  What effect would this have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Brien" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52014052800008#G00500"><p>I think the effect would be relatively minor.  The UK took this action in 1988 and the effect in the UK was relatively minor.  The ability to have a company incorporated in Ireland but not resident in Ireland is not a significant feature of global tax planning for multinationals.  I do not think it would have a significantly adverse effect on inward investment.  In terms of that policy choice, one is looking at two factors, one being whether we should take the view that because we have allowed there to be Irish-incorporated but non-resident companies, and this has ended up attracting so much bad publicity - unfair publicity, I would argue, but that is perhaps a matter of opinion - one might decide that it should be changed in order to avoid such publicity in future, and decide to go down the route taken by the UK.  As against that, one might take a view that asks why our tax system should be changed based on unfair criticism, and I think that may be how it will be weighed up.  However, in terms of its effect, there would not be a big flood of extra revenue to the Exchequer because any company affected would simply restructure.  Nor would there be a big outflow of foreign direct investment, because companies could restructure, and therefore I do not think it would be that big a deal for them.</p></speech>

I ask him to give his view as to how that is working and what the country can do to change that domestically.  What role can we play in terms of any unilateral changes in order to have an impact?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Taft" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52014052800008#G00700"><p>Others have made that claim and we have pointed out in our submission that this is an issue.  We just want to deal with the macroeconomic data.  Other people such as Professor James Stewart can address the issue of Ireland being considered a tax haven conduit.  We do not have a particular position on that because, as a union, we have been focused on issues of fiscal and economic impact, not only the corporate tax rate but also other things.  If I may make a point that goes some way towards answering the Deputy's question and following from Mr. O'Brien's points, there could likely be negative consequences if the corporate tax rate were to be unilaterally increased to whatever was decided and if that were the only action taken.  There could be negative consequences if the country were to unilaterally move to break what it has been doing for the past two or three decades and on which it has based its industrial and enterprise policy for that time.  The country has allowed a situation to arise whereby it has a multinational-dominated export sector, a multinational-dominated manufacturing sector that generates pretty much all the exports, a significant portion of the gross value-added products and the sales revenue.  The idea that, using that base, the country can just play with the tax rate or play with the tax relief requires careful thought.  That is the reason my union has said that defining the effective tax rate should be the first step in exploring a whole number of other questions.  There is a need to take care because it is very wide and very deep and it is something we have been doing for a long time.</p></speech>

Our hope in putting forward our submission was to point out a number of things.  If it is the goal of a low-tax structure to generate investment compared to other European economies, we are doing pretty poorly.  If it is the goal of the low-tax regime to generate direct expenditure by companies in the traded sectors - because that is where the tax rate is being directed - we are doing pretty poorly.  If the low tax rate is supposed to bring companies that would generate high levels of employee compensation, we are doing pretty poorly.  Other countries are doing a lot better.  I ask what are they doing better that we are not doing, as they have effective tax rates up to three times ours and they have the same kinds of economic structure relying on exports.  In the first instance, the issue is not the effective tax rate.  In one sense it does not even matter whether it is the 2% rate on the US multinationals; at the end of the day, whether this committee decides it is a rate of 9% or 11% or 12% or 2%, companies are still doing what they do, whether here in Ireland or through Ireland.  Those are the questions the committee needs to consider, but it does need to address the industrial enterprise base of the economy and make sure that is right before looking at issues such as changing tax rates and tax reliefs.</p></speech>

In his view as a practitioner, has the UK become more competitive than Ireland with regard to corporation tax?  Is this beginning to have an impact on investment decisions?</p></speech>

We meet businesses in foreign countries and we try to sell Ireland to them, not simply because we are patriots but because it is in our selfish interest, as they will become our clients when they come to this country.  KPMG Ireland is effectively in competition with other countries and we see the offerings.  Until relatively recently, if I went to a foreign business, many of them would say to me, "I want to go to the UK because it has a bigger labour pool, London is a big financial centre and it is easier to get my employees to go and live in London".  My reply to them is, "That is fine, but you get a better tax answer if you come to Ireland."  That is what gave us a competitive edge.  Ireland is a more peripheral economy than the UK.  However, the UK has all the advantages it has over Ireland and now it also has a 10% patent box tax rate, a 5% rate of tax for finance companies, a 10% rate of capital gains tax for entrepreneurs compared to a rate of 33% in Ireland, lower rates of income tax and all the other advantages.  This has made a huge difference to the UK.  If one searches on Google or reads the newspapers there is much public commentary from businesses that have specifically moved to the UK as a result of the policy.  I am not surprised to see the UK economy starting to do quite well, and in my view this policy has been one of the big factors.

It is important for us to read it.  There has been reputational damage to Ireland as a result of the House of Commons hearings and the US Senate hearings.  Mr. O'Brien is of the view that the commentary has been unfair because it has been based on a false premise and that the 2% effective rate has been put out there.  What can we do, apart from explaining our position to all the stakeholders?  What changes can Ireland make to address some of those concerns?</p></speech>

We could, for example, go down the same route as the United Kingdom in that regard.  If we were to do that, however, we probably would have to allow companies which established themselves on the basis of the rules we have had for the past 150 years time to reorganise.  If somebody did the types of calculation in five years time that were done previously on Irish-incorporated companies, having made all companies Irish resident over a reasonable period of time, the effective tax rate number would pop up as 12.5% or thereabouts instead of 2%.  Doing that might address the adverse publicity we have seen.  The only reason one might decide not to take that course of action would be based on the argument which could be made that it would be a case of allowing our tax system to be founded or designed on the basis of criticism that was unfair or ill-informed.</p></speech>

Some years ago, we introduced OECD best practice transfer pricing rules into our tax system, which are now being applied and audited by Revenue.  Our transfer pricing regime has been tightened up, which is an important aspect of the whole OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, initiative.  Indeed, transfer pricing is a major part of the whole issue of taxation of global multinational entities.</p><p>  There is a great deal of talk about the chain and Ireland being a conduit.  One will find, for instance, that where a great deal of income ends up in the Caribbean, say, that is not the full picture.  Under transfer pricing principles, the conduit will not end there.  In fact, a great deal of that income will then be transfer-priced out by the United States tax authorities into their jurisdiction.  They will say that it is the people in white coats in laboratories in California who are doing the research and will force those Caribbean companies to pay fees to the United States.  One has to take that into account in order to see the complete chain.  Transfer pricing certainly is and will continue to be part of the global response.  The rules here in Ireland have been tightened up in this regard.</p></speech>

However, there is a problem with the way the statistical agencies use the figure for foreign direct investment.  The earnings of foreign companies that are reported in an economy but are not taken out - in other words, where money is coming in but is not taken out - are considered to be reinvested earnings, even though we have no idea how much is actually being reinvested.  That makes up 60% of the FDI flow but, as we know, the bulk of that flow is into financial intermediation.  Foreign direct investment is not investment into fixed assets.</p></speech>

The cost of that is imposed on households through higher labour taxes and indirect taxes or through reduced expenditure on public services and social protection.  The consequence is reduced economic growth.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting we should necessarily follow that country's lead, but there is a principle to be clarified here.  Mr. Taft seems very critical of our having a very low, competitive effective tax rate and he is not willing to accept that raising the rate would be a bad thing.</p></speech>

Our industrial and enterprise policy has been based on low taxes.  If we did not address any other aspect of that policy and simply started playing with tax rates, there probably would be negative consequences because, as I said, our industrial and enterprise policy going back decades has been fuelled by a low tax rate.  It is important to emphasise, however, that companies make the decision to come to Ireland or any other country not just on the basis of effective tax rates.  They also take account of such issues as whether, for instance, we have a first-class telecommunications system.</p></speech>

Other factors are the quality of the workforce, access to markets and so on.  I am not disputing that.<br />The other issue both of the delegates mentioned is the question of reputational damage.  Is Mr. Taft really saying that there are people in other countries who decide not to buy Guinness or other Irish products because of our corporation tax rate?  Does he not accept, on the contrary, that when the message is going around the world that Ireland has a very competitive tax regime, it is a message which indicates to companies that Ireland is a good place in which to invest and employ people?  Mr. Taft referenced several comments about Ireland that have been made in <i>Forbes</i>magazine, but he did not mention the article that described Ireland as the best country in the world in which to set up a business.  The point I am making is that, in reality, no reputational damage is being done to Ireland.</p></speech>

Instead, we should examine our corporate tax rate to see whether it is in line with our stated policy goals of encouraging investment.  The reality is that it is not encouraging investment.  Ireland's rate of corporate investment is one of the lowest in the EU 15 on any metric.  We have to examine whether it is encouraging direct expenditure-----</p></speech>

We can dance around talking about foreign direct investment and whether having the bulk of it going into financial intermeditation is really having a positive impact on the domestic economy.  Let us have that discussion.  I would contend that it is difficult to argue that having retained earnings counted as an investment flow is somehow having a positive impact.  We want companies to come here and invest in greenfield sites, as they did last year to the tune of &euro;4 billion.  That is a very positive thing, involving investment in plant and machinery that will put people back to work.</p> <p>Other countries with small open economies are even more successful in that regard than Ireland, but they have much higher effective corporate tax rates.</p></speech>

In his submission Mr. O'Brien asserts that there are no glaring examples of Ireland being at variance with the global taxation system and no issues in respect of which we could make changes here.  I would have expected that there would be some areas in which we might have been able to act unilaterally.  Has this process not proved that while there has been some criticism from abroad of Ireland's ability to attract foreign direct investment, our tax system is transparent, fair and open and that difficulties of tax avoidance are international in nature and can only be dealt with by means of the BEPS and other OECD systems to which Ireland fully subscribes?</p></speech>

On being open and transparent, I provided an example of multinational accounting practices.  They involve generating tax competitiveness and their impact is such that we cannot even do the basic things other countries can do such as measuring our own productivity, input-output levels, the amount of value added per employee or the gross operating surplus per employee.  We should be careful about using terms such as "transparent" and also about being so defensive.  The first thing to do is engage in an honest examination.</p></speech>

That said, however, the Irish system remains attractive.  A consultation process took place in respect of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, and the foreign earnings deduction, as part of which we submitted a paper.  Essentially, the SARP is the tax system which governs those from abroad who come to work here.  We regard it as uncompetitive and are aware of projects that were lost to Ireland as a result.  In 2006, without consultation, what had previously been an attractive tax regime for foreigners working here - it had been in place since 1922 and was advertised by IDA Ireland and others as part of our offering to international business - was removed at the stroke of a pen.  I will not go into detail, but there were good reasons some reforms were needed at the time.  We do not really provide a competitive offering for foreign workers in coming here, whereas many other countries do.  If I was asked to identify one area in which we could do better, this is the one I would highlight.</p></speech>

They then ask how much their chief executives will be obliged to pay in tax if they relocate here from, for example, Boston.  If the rate is unattractive, it may be difficult to persuade such executives to move.  If it is difficult to persuade a chief executive to move, getting the relevant business to do so may not be possible.  Other countries recognise this and offer tax reliefs to individuals in such circumstances.  Since the removal of the previous regime in 2006, there has not been a major flood of employment.  I do not believe one can see any positive result from what was done.  We are aware of projects which, as a result of that change, failed to come to Ireland and which could have resulted in hundreds of jobs being created.</p></speech>

We shot ourselves in the foot.  A great deal of the international press coverage arose as a result of international news agencies picking up reports or articles published by Irish persons or Irish newspapers.

There is that positive, but the negative is that people wonder if the tax regime in Ireland is sustainable if it is subject to so much criticism.  That is a question which arises.  We inform clients that one of the strengths of the Irish tax regime is that it has been remarkably stable since the 1950s.  I mentioned the attractions of the UK regime and we point out to our clients that these have only been in place for three or four years.  Ireland has had a stable regime since the 1950s and kept the promises it has made to companies which have located their operations here.  When Ireland moved its tax regime, this was the result of pressure from the European Union.  The stability to which I refer is a major positive.</p></speech>

He has shown that those countries with higher effective corporation tax rates are more successful in terms of the amount of money that comes back into their economies in the form of wages, investment and trade.  Does Mr. O'Brien accept the figures put forward by Mr. Taft?  It is not possible to be 100% accurate, particularly as there are numerous ways of computing the figures, but does Mr. O'Brien broadly accept the figures?  If he does, will he explain why what is outlined is the case?  Mr. Taft's evidence appears to go against the laws of capitalism.</p></speech>

However, I am out in the world trying to persuade companies to come to Ireland.  The low corporation tax rate is the most significant weapon in our armoury in trying to do this.  I come up against competitors from countries such as Switzerland and Singapore, both of which have low rates of corporation tax and which are two of the richest countries in the world.  I have not carried out an analysis, but I presume wages, etc., in both jurisdictions are extremely high.  There is one example to which I refer in this regard, namely, Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Northern Ireland, on this island, has had a higher rate of corporation tax.  It has had its political troubles but there has been a ceasefire since 1994.  We have done better than Northern Ireland in terms of attracting investment during the past 20 years and it is seeking to have the same corporation tax rate as we have because it recognises that it is an aid in bringing in business.  If one brings in business and US multinationals and they employ people, take people off the dole and pay them salaries, and income tax is deducted from those salaries and corporation tax is paid over, then it seems that is potentially a win-win situation for Ireland.  I accept that whether 12.5% is the rate that optimises the yield to the Exchequer and the return to the economy - or a rate of 15%, 20%, 30% or 40%, or 6% 7% or 10% - is a matter for debate, but I do not think it is obvious that it is the highest rate that necessarily is the right rate.  From my experience, in trying to get business in here, the rate that we have is a big selling point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52014052800011#K00200"><p>On the 12.5% rate, I support it from the point of view that, on balance, we feel that it may achieve something, although it may not be fair.  Unfortunately, the word "fair" has not been mentioned.  The discussion has been about economics but in dealing with members of the human race the word "fair" needs to be brought into the equation.  It has been missing from the discussion around taxation rates and international capitalism, and that is unfortunate.</p><p>  The second question I wish to ask Mr. O'Brien relates to an issue that has been flagged for years whereby if taxation is increased there may be evidence to show that some workers at the upper end of the scale might emigrate.  With regard to the scenario in which, if the upper rate was increased from 12.5% to 14%, multinationals would flee the country, Mr. Taft has shown grids and graphs in that respect, which Mr. Connor said he accepts.  Where is the evidence to show that?  Are there concrete examples of countries that upped their corporation tax rate, either the effective or the overall rate - obviously companies take note of the effective rate - and in which companies suddenly companies shut down business?  We know that companies relocate because of wage rates.  We have seen how ruthless companies have been when they squeezed the last drop of blood out of workers in this country, and when they can hire workers at a quarter of the wage rate in Asia or some other part of the world, they will move their operations there.  That applies in particular to labour-intensive industries.  Are there clear examples in which a government has said it wants a better effective rate or it wants to increase the overall rate and close off the loopholes?</p></speech>

I presume we would probably all accept that if we had, say, a 110% corporation tax rate, probably no company - certainly no foreign company - would set up here, but, equally, we would probably all accept that 0% is not the proper rate either.  The rate that probably would encourage the maximum amount of investment in Ireland is somewhere between 0% and 100%, and we can have a big debate as to what that rate is.  I would point out that our rate was 0% from the 1950s until the EU forced us to increase our rate from 0% in the 1980s; our rate increased to 10% and then it increased to 12.5%.  An insight I can bring to the committee, which perhaps only people in our profession could bring, is that we talk to companies all of the time.  We go to meeting rooms where there are people representing companies that intend to set up new operations and they have flipcharts showing the advantages of setting up in various countries.  I will be there from Ireland along with a guy from my firm in France, Germany, Switzerland or wherever, and they will line up the pros and cons of where to set up their new venture.  I can certainly say that corporation tax rate is a factor; it is not the only factor, but it is a factor in their decision making.  If the 12.5% rate was increased to 12.51% I do not believe that would make any difference, but at some point increasing the rate would make a difference and it is very hard to get that precisely right.  I am certainly aware of projects in recent years - as I said, some of this can be found publicly on the web - that have gone to the UK that might have gone to Ireland because of the fact that our rate is now 12.5% while in the UK one can <i>de facto</i>get a 10% rate.   Even with our rate being 12.5%, we are losing out on getting some projects.  I do not know what is the optimal rate - that is a matter for debate - but certainly a lower rate gives us a better chance of attracting projects.  That is common sense.</p></speech>

The Deputy will not be able to find any examples of countries that increased their tax rates only to experience a loss of business.  In other words, would companies move their operations if we increased our corporate tax rate from 12.5% to 15%?  That is something one cannot test until one does it.  The nominal tax rate for most multinationals prior to the merging of the two rates - we used to have the 40% rate and a 10% rate for manufacturing tax relief - was 10%, and that increased to 12.5%, but the increase did not have any negative impact.  An alternative system -  this is something to be examined and from which we should not shy away - could be to increase the nominal rate and through a series of reliefs, allowances and rewards for investments to target those sectors that our indigenous sector would find difficult to generate - capital-intensive sectors such as the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors or other key global network sectors.  That would be possible.  In other words, there are more ways to use the tax system rather than just through the rate.  We have a whole array of instruments at our disposal.  We could increase the nominal tax rate and still have particular reliefs.  If we look back on the beginnings of the Celtic tiger boom in the 1990s - what is always considered the good phase - one will see that we used to have two rates, a 40% tax rate, essentially for domestic companies, and a 10% rate, or in some cases a 0% rate, for multinationals.  It did not stop new start-up companies in the domestic sector from generating business - those at the 40% tax rate - or from increasing economic activity during that period.  They were then brought together because there was an EU requirement for us to have one single rate.  In one sense, by using a nominal rate with an array of very targeted instruments in the key sectors, we could maintain and possibly even boost investment where we wanted to while still yielding higher tax revenues without any loss.</p></speech>

It is because those grants are net figures?  That is assuming they are not using instruments such as the ones he mentioned in his reply to my previous question.  In other words, the grants he has set out are based on net figures.   Why is that the case?</p></speech>

This has to do with the extent to which we have privileged the multinational sector, because we need everything possible to bring in companies that are going to invest.  I do not refer to foreign direct investment but investment on the ground that will create jobs and economic activity.  We have neglected the indigenous sector.  If one takes into account the proportions of the economies, we would have to increase employment in our indigenous manufacturing sector by 100,000 people just to reach the average of the indigenous manufacturing sector in small local economies.</p><p> As to why we have not done that, one should not forget that for a decade prior to the crash we were too busy providing reliefs for a different kind of investment, which was not nearly as productive.  I suggest that if we had 100,000 more people in indigenous manufacturing employment one would have a sizeable increase in investment and direct expenditure because indigenous firms, according to Forf&aacute;s, are much more likely to source domestically so one would have that impact.  Those domestic firms that are being sourced will then in turn because of the economic activity, generate their own investment to increase capacity and then one has an upwards spiral.  I suggest that it begins with the need to build a strong indigenous enterprise.  That goes back to the Telesis report in the 1980s which everyone ran away from.  If we were to do that we could link that with a strong multinational sector but one coming in to engage in productive investment.  That is a win-win.</p></speech>

That is the case with a lot of private domestic companies and foreign branches of multinational sectors.  That would be very helpful because classic economics, as much as we might criticise it, has one key point that is applicable to all economic theory, namely, that one needs to have symmetry of information.  If companies are able to withhold information it puts the Government at a disadvantage.  It also puts the workforce at a disadvantage when it comes to wage contract bargaining.  Further, it puts society at a disadvantage.  The more openness and transparency we can have the better policy decisions we will get.</p></speech>

A multiplicity of factors are involved; there is the impact on the FDI currently resident in Ireland and also in terms of the situation for Mr. O&rsquo;Brien with regard to future FDI.  Is there a possibility of damage if one starts to move the figure around?  What are the implications if we make the change, whether we go up or down, on future FDI?  Existing companies might be compliant and happy to pay it but does it create a situation where the market perception is that one even if the change is only 1% or 2% it could change again and gives rise to uncertainty for long term planning?</p></speech>

That is the last piece of the puzzle.

The fact that the regime has been so stable for so long and that we can point to the fact that the low rate of corporation tax is supported by all the main parties in the D&aacute;il and that it survived so many changes of Government over so many decades, can be pointed to and contrasted with other countries.  I am aware, for example, of proposed changes in rules in other jurisdictions and of companies moving businesses because of a proposal which might not have happened, but the companies decide to move anyway because of the uncertainty about the country on the basis that the regime cannot be trusted.  If a company is investing hundreds of millions of euro, in many cases it is for the long term, in factories and plants.  That means that if one changes the regime, for example, by increasing the corporate tax rate, the effect on operations which are already here would be less because if one has built one&rsquo;s factory and employed people it will not be as easy to leave.  One has made a massive investment and it will take a lot to cause one to move that.</p><p>  When one talks to subsidiaries of multinationals in Ireland they say, for example, that the changes in the UK will not affect existing operations but it means new projects will not go there.  The most immediate impact would be on new projects that might have come that otherwise do not come.  People closing down and moving out is a more radical decision.</p></speech>

Something to bear in mind is that a corporation does not actually exist.  Under corporate law 101, a corporation is a legal fiction.  When the Deputy says the corporation is paying a 12.5% rate of tax, it is not as if there is a corporation in an armchair in a mansion on top of a hill rubbing its hands with glee because it has a low tax rate.  Corporations do not exist.  They are a vehicle for collective investment and pooling of funds by shareholders.  All taxes are ultimately borne by individuals.  Corporation tax is a double tax on investors in shares.  For example, if somebody has a pension fund and that pension fund invests in, say, a United States multinational company, that US multinational invests in Ireland and pays 12.5% tax in Ireland.  When those profits are repatriated to the US, a further 22.5% of tax will be paid.  Meanwhile, the pension fund is paying in Ireland 0.75% of the capital value of the fund under the pension levy.  That is on the capital, not on the income.  In some years there might be no income because the company might make losses.  Risk-free returns are 2% or 3%, which are the current interest rates, and 0.75% is perhaps 20% or 25% of the risk-free return, the risk-adjusted return.</p></speech>

Can I finish?  The pension levy is a double tax.  When the pension fund then distributes the income to the pension holder, if they are paying the top rate of tax in Ireland they are paying a further 55%.  The Deputy should bear in mind that corporations do not exist.  It is a double tax on the profits of investors and by the time one works one's way through the chain and the money comes back in the hands of the investor, they could be up at an 80% tax rate.</p></speech>

We can see some of the figures, and they were alluded to by Mr. O'Brien in his introduction.  I got this table about a year and a half ago and tried to draw some points out of it publicly because I was quite shocked by what I consider to be the effective rate, which is the amount of tax paid by companies, particularly the very profitable multinational companies.  As the figures are broken down by the degree of profitability and size of those companies, we see that of the &euro;73 billion in total profits, &euro;52 billion of those profits are made by 480 companies that earn profits in excess of &euro;10 million a year but only pay &euro;3.3 billion in tax, which is probably about 7%.  In terms of the EUROSTAT figures, which I have also alluded to in terms of effective rates, and I got this information from the Oireachtas library and research service, it states that the effective rate in Ireland is 6.8%, 18.9% for Denmark, 18% for Finland, 23.6% for Norway and 27.2% for Sweden, for example.  What I do not understand is if the way we get from &euro;70 billion to &euro;4 billion is normal accountancy practice, why is our implicit rate so much lower than all of those other countries which presumably use the same accountancy practices as we do here?</p></speech>

It points out that because we have a large fund management industry in Ireland, there is &euro;1 trillion in investment funds based in Ireland.  Those funds pay no tax.  That is what is dragging down the average in the EUROSTAT figures, and that is explained in the Department of Finance figures.  If someone goes into the AIB investment fund, the fund itself pays no tax.  On distribution to the unit holder, a tax is paid by the unit holder, in effect.  That is the Department of Finance's explanation for the difference, and that makes sense to me.  That rationalises-----</p></speech>

Just &euro;14 billion of the &euro;73 billion pre-tax profits are royalty payments paid by a multinational to the exact same multinational.  That multinational decides how much it will charge itself for the right to use patents and intellectual property rights because that is such a huge proportion of the element of gross profits that is written down to the point where it pays tax on far less.

I mentioned earlier that corporation tax can only be charged on the net profit arising to a company.  It is well known that the classic kind of case we are talking about is a US multinational that places intellectual property, say, a brand or technology, into a tax haven - we will say Bermuda for the sake of argument.  It then creates a factory in Ireland.  The factory in Ireland does not own the intellectual property.  It manufactures goods and sells them.  Revenue from the sale of goods comes into Ireland and Ireland pays - I think this is what the Deputy is alluding to with the trade charges - royalties for the use of that intellectual property.</p></speech>

In a situation where the intellectual arm of the company is taking intellectual copyright money and another arm of the company funds the development of the construction of that factory in Ireland and puts a base interest rate on the repayment of that loan, which would be well above what would be bought in the market, that comes into the equation.

We have a substantial team of transfer pricing experts in our office, as do many of the companies and the revenue authorities all over the world.  The Deputy is right that in this case, one is selling to oneself and consequently, the question is how do we know if the price is at arm's length.  What they do is to find comparable situations, insofar as they can, where a third party is involved.  For example, many sophisticated manufacturing companies and many sophisticated brands get their manufacturing done by third parties, that is, by contract manufacturers as they call them.  Transfer pricing experts try to ascertain what profit margin is retained by a contract manufacturer and what profit accrues to the brand owner.  Thereafter, one has a debate with the tax authorities as to what is the appropriate pricing.  That is an entire industry.</p></speech>

It strikes me that this is one of the key mechanisms that allows such companies to write down their taxable profits and that this area must be examined a hell of a lot more.  I have absolutely no doubt but that this explains why, according to European comparisons, Ireland's implicit rate is so much lower than everywhere else, because a lot of the companies engaged in this particular practice are based here.</p></speech>

I think that tax authorities are awake to it and police it and it is getting increasing focus.  Part of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project is to examine the entire area of transfer pricing.  As for the difference between the EUROSTAT effective tax rate, I think the funds issue explains it and that Ireland's effective tax rate is in or around the 12% rate I mentioned earlier.  Ireland is not unusual in allowing deduction for these types of payments.  Every sensible tax system in the world allows for deduction for such payments.  There is of course a further piece of the jigsaw, which is that the United States has decided under its tax rules that it will allow such payments to go from countries like Ireland, the United Kingdom and Germany to the Caribbean and when they arrive in the Caribbean, they are not taxed.  This is allowed in the US tax system and that is a tax policy choice by the United States.</p></speech>

Are the management and control criteria for tax residency completely archaic and out of date in the modern globalised economy?  Where does one define this in a multinational company that has branches and subsidiaries all over the place and has a whole series of different hubs of management, control, added value and so on?  How can one possibly state it is all managed in the United States, even though it has sizeable investments, operations and so on in Ireland and elsewhere that it somehow can evade?  I put this question to both witnesses.</p></speech>

This is because no matter where a company is resident, its pays tax wherever it has a taxable presence, that is, a permanent establishment or a branch and I note the threshold for having a branch is very low.  Consequently, even if a company is not resident in Ireland, it pays tax here if it has an office or staff here and so on.  It pays tax here and has a taxable presence here.  The companies that have attracted attention are companies that are Irish-incorporated but which have no presence here whatsoever.  Consequently, wherever they should pay tax, it certainly should not be in Ireland.  For me personally, the residence issue is a little bit of a red herring because of what happens if one has a taxable presence - a branch - here in Ireland.  The Deputy mentioned a multinational company that might have hubs and offices all over the world but if it has, it will pay tax and have taxable presences in each of those countries.</p></speech>

How does he tally that with his other argument, which is that as a result of Ireland's low tax rate, we have a low level of corporate investment when compared with our European neighbours?  I do not quite discern how these two things square.  If our tax is not a major contributor, when compared with our European neighbours, to significant levels of corporate investment, why would increasing the effective rate or the nominal rate by some degree have any particular effect on the levels of corporate investment?</p></speech>

It may well reduce the number of companies who wish to come here because a number may believe we are on a slippery slope whereby the rate increased to 15% but that might increase to 18% next year and to 20% after that.  However, we do not know.  I made the point that back in the 1990s, when the headline tax rate of 10% was increased to 12.5%, there was no appreciable damage.  It is possible to argue the toss and there are all sorts of arguments but one will not be able to come to any certainty until one actually does it.</p></speech>

The idea that increasing taxes on such firms or indeed increasing the social wage - which is employers' social contribution and which, together with the corporate tax rate, also is one of the lowest in advanced European economies - would disadvantage firms is incorrect.  This is because the whole idea of increasing tax revenue and increasing the social wage is that there is more investment into public services, which generates its own economic activity and its own domestic demand.

Some companies may not have those kinds of expenses and the impact might be minimal.  However, assume a company that has &euro;1 million of gross income and is paying &euro;800,000 in royalty payments which are legitimate genuine expenses of its business and other trade charges - there are other items below that line - so that its income is &euro;200,000, and now one has levied a charge of 12.5% on that &euro;1 million.  Some &euro;125,000, as a percentage of its &euro;200,000, is a tax rate of 60% plus, which would be completely uncompetitive.

Already, I am aware of projects that we have lost because the 12.5% is being undercut by some countries and, at 15%, I am sure we would lose more projects.  As I stated, the optimal rate that maximises the benefit to the economy is a matter for debate and I could not scientifically prove it to Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>

Such allowances would form part of any progressive corporate tax strategy because we want to encourage that type of investment in the economy.  We would have to be careful of a minimum effective tax because, as Mr. O'Brien stated, company A is not like company B or company C, as they work in different sectors.  As always, no matter how we refigure, rethink or play out scenarios, the key is whether this tax rate will generate revenue for the State, whether it will promote investment and whether it will help boast employee compensation.  A tax rate cannot do all of those things.  It has to be integrated into broader policy.  However, that is the key.  Other countries seem to have found the key or at least a room that gets them into the big room.  We are still outside in the hallway.</p></speech>

The reason I would suggest not is because were we to do so, a substantial number of companies that rely on the ability to pay royalties to such countries would potentially decamp from the country and we would lose the corporation tax revenues, the PAYE revenues and other revenues associated with those companies and it would render us uncompetitive with other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

He has been with us for a number of years and has been a very good ambassador.  He has obviously built strong relations between Nigeria and Ireland during his term of office here.  Unfortunately, like all ambassadors, his term of office is up shortly and he will be leaving us in the near future.  This is an ideal opportunity for us to have the ambassador here today to talk about a number of issues, including his time here.  <br />He is accompanied by his Minister, Mr. Jidda, head of chancery at the Nigerian Embassy.  <br />Before we hear from Ambassador Pwol, I wish to remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such as way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, whenever possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br />I also wish to welcome members of the diplomatic corps and representatives of St. Michael's School in Finglas, who have taken a great interest in the subject matter which we are about to discuss.  We all know about the recent events in Nigeria and are all aware of the various atrocities that have been committed.  Most noticeably, a few weeks ago, we received news of the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls from the northern town of Chibok.  This particular incident has gained a lot of media attention worldwide, including here in Ireland.  It has been the subject of correspondence, including a petition received by the joint committee.  The issue has also been the subject matter of many parliamentary questions recently.<br />At the moment, our thoughts are with the girls and their families.  We hope they will be released unharmed and we continue to monitor the situation.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, has taken a particular interest in this matter.  In addition, the ambassador has been monitoring the situation for the Government.<br />I now call on Ambassador Pwol to make his presentation to the joint committee.  He is very welcome.  We are delighted to have him and his counsellor present to update us on the current political situation, particularly the incidence of kidnapping which has had worldwide attention.  Hopefully, there can be a peaceful solution so that those girls can return to their families.  One can just imagine the uproar and consternation if it happened here in Ireland and all those students in St. Michael's College were kidnapped.  One can imagine the ordeal and hurt their families would have to endure.  We hope there will be a successful, peaceful conclusion to this issue.  Perhaps the ambassador can also say a few words about Irish-Nigerian relations.</p></speech>

Mr. Felix Yusufu Pwol" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014052800003#B00300"><p>Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Let me at the outset express my profound appreciation to the Chair and other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade for the invitation extended to me to brief this august body on recent developments regarding the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria.<br />This briefing session organised by the committee is a clear indication of the concern and empathy the Government and people of Ireland have towards the Government and people of Nigeria over the security challenges affecting the country in recent years, especially as they concern the incessant unleashing of terror by the Boko Haram insurgency group.<br />On behalf of the Government and people of Nigeria, may I also express my deepest thanks to many individuals, associations and schoolchildren in Ireland who have in strong terms condemned the abduction of the over 270 schoolchildren in Chibok, Borno state?  The embassy has received numerous letters from Irish citizens expressing grave concern over the fate of the abducted schoolgirls.  We certainly appreciate this gesture.<br />I will now explain the background for the distinguished parliamentarians here.  The emergence of the Boko Haram sect in Nigeria is a fairly recent development dating back to the year 2009.  Since then, it has metamorphosed into a local insurgency.  The sect was officially known as Jamaa'tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'wati Wai Jihad, which in English means &quot;people<b></b>committed to<b></b>the propagation of the Prophet's teachings and jihad&quot;<b>. </b><br />The words Boko Haram literally mean western or non-Islamic education is prohibited.  The group is strongly opposed to all democratic institutions and principles.  The insurgency is a declaration of war on the Government and people of Nigeria.  It is understood that the group's ultimate objective is to create an Islamic state in Nigeria.<br />In carrying out its destructive acts, the group has, since 2009, unleashed mayhem by launching a vicious guerrilla-style campaign against defenceless people, government infrastructure and installations, places of worship, schools, villages and communities.<br />The Boko Haram insurgency has so far claimed over 12,000 lives with more than 8,000 persons injured or maimed.  The insurgency has also displaced thousands of innocent Nigerians, especially in the border communities, and has destroyed properties worth billions of naira.<br />As members of the joint committee are aware, on 14 April 2014, the Boko Haram insurgents abducted over 200 schoolgirls from Chibok secondary school in Borno state.  This followed the slaughter of some 40 schoolchildren in the Government secondary school Banu, in Yobe state.  These two incidents, including the Nyanya, Abuja bombings in April and May 2014, represent the most vicious and callous attack of terror and violence by Boko Haram bandits in recent times.  It is therefore obvious that this terror group has destroyed social life in the north-eastern part of Nigeria and has crippled economic activities in the area.<br />Let me make it categorically clear that the insurgency is certainly not a religious war, as both Christians and Muslims have been killed and have had their places of worship destroyed.  It has also emerged that the group has links with other terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and al-Shabab.  The group has hideouts and camps in neighbouring countries, namely, Chad, Cameroon and the Niger Republic.  Boko Haram's war is not only against the Nigerian Government and people but constitutes a threat to regional peace and security.<br />I will now outline the Government efforts involved.  In its efforts to stem the situation, the Government declared a state of emergency on 15 May 2013 in three north-eastern states, namely, Adamawa, Borno and Yobe.  The state of emergency has been renewed twice since then and there are plans to extend it further until the situation improves in these states.  The matter is currently before our Parliament, the National Assembly.  The President has sent a fresh request for renewal of the mandate.<br />Members of the joint committee may also be aware that a new division of the Nigerian army, the 7th mechanised division, has been established in Maiduguri, Borno state. </p> <p>The Government has adopted a multi-track strategy to contain the insurgency which includes dialogue, engagement, empowerment, education and re-orientation.  It will be recalled that the presidential committee on dialogue and peaceful resolution of security challenges in the north, headed by Mr. Kabiru T. Turaki, the Minister for Special Duties, has submitted its report which is currently being considered for implementation.  The acceptance of the request for assistance from the USA, France, Britain, Israel, China and Spain is evidence of the Government's resolve to secure the release of the abducted children and to also see that the perpetrators of these dastardly acts are brought to justice.  The recent classification of Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organisation by the United Nations Security Council is a welcome development.  With this classification, Boko Haram will become liable to the imposition of sanctions with global application.  It will also be recalled that the United States of America, Canada and Australia have accorded Boko Haram the same classification.</p><p> In the aftermath of the abduction of the girls in Chibok, information management and reporting has been a source of concern to the Government.  In this regard, the Government has adopted measures to streamline information management and co-ordination to forestall the misrepresentation of facts to the general public and our international partners.  The recently concluded special summit of security on Nigeria hosted by the President of France, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, was attended by the Presidents of Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger as well as representatives of the UK, USA and EU.  The outcome of the conference has further renewed the commitment of all stakeholders to this crisis.  The major highlights of the decisions at the conference include: information sharing among countries in the region; co-ordinated action for the urgent rescue of the abducted girls with the active support and co-operation of all the countries participating in the summit; regional co-operation and the establishment of joint border patrols with the four neighbouring states; the establishment of mechanisms for information exchange on trafficking of weapons; bolstering of measures to secure weapons stockpiles; and the implementation of co-ordinated patrols with the aim of combatting Boko Haram and locating the missing schoolgirls.</p><p> As I conclude my brief statement, I express again my thanks for the support and solidarity Nigeria continues to enjoy from the Government and people of Ireland.  I underscore the fact that my Government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the current insurgency is brought to an end in the not-too-distant future.  I thank the distinguished parliamentarians for their kind attention.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste on behalf of the Government and the Irish people condemned in the strongest possible terms the frequency and spread of terrorist attacks and violent activities.  Naturally, the authorities must take all steps to protect their citizens and maintain law and order.</p><p>  The ambassador mentioned that 12,000 lives had been lost in the insurgency.  I presume that is in the period 2009 to 2014.  If that is correct, it brings me on to a report from Amnesty International which estimated that 1,500 people were killed in northern Nigeria between January and March of this year.  If those figures are correct, they demonstrate a very significant intensification of murder and loss of life which must be the source of serious concern.</p><p>  The Chairman referred quite rightly to the abduction of more than 270 schoolchildren.  That abduction of innocent young people strikes a chord with all who believe in civilisation and basic human rights.  With regard to the special summit on security that was hosted by the President of France on 17 May 2014 and the decisions and recommendations reached, does the ambassador consider that the necessary actions which have been agreed will be implemented with the urgency required?  We are dealing with a very difficult situation.</p><p>  Can the ambassador let us know with what other international terrorist organisations Boko Haram has an association?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.408" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E.

By way of background, it has become clear that Boko Haram has been operating not only from Nigerian territory but from neighbouring countries.  In the last few months, there has been greater co-ordination of action principally with Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon.  Unfortunately, I do not have map with me, but if members know the geography of Nigeria, the states involved border it to the north, principally Chad and Cameroon.  It has been established that following its attacks, Boko Haram seeks safe hideouts in Cameroon.  That is why Cameroon was brought on board.  Small arms have also been a major part of this problems.  Nigeria is a leading member of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, and we are trying to enforce the ECOWAS convention on small arms signed in 2006.</p><p>  Regarding Boko Haram's links to other organisations, I honestly do not know.  I must say that this is a new phenomenon in west Africa, as we have seen.  It is only as this crisis has evolved that we have been able to establish these links.  If one looks at west Africa from Mali and moves eastwards, there is a clear link.  The arms that came from Libya after the collapse of the Gadaffi regime have also been established as a factor as one moves eastwards through Chad, central Africa and up to Somalia.  It is important to recognise that we are dealing with an evolving situation and I do not know whether anybody can authoritatively say "This is why it is".  We are trying to follow and monitor what is happening as things evolve.  It is a very fluid situation but I can tell the committee that with the meeting in France and international support from our immediate neighbours, ECOWAS, the African Union and the UN, we are very optimistic that we will make major headway in the next few months.  I do not know if I missed anything.</p></speech>

The facts that I gave the committee were established by the Government of Nigeria.  I do not want to comment on what Amnesty International has said.</p> <p>Information management in this matter involves a delicate balance in a democratic situation.  While we appreciate the need for the public to know, we should also be mindful of how these figures are arrived at.  Many organisations have come out with such figures which we have found are not correct.  The established figure for the Abuja bus station bomb blast was 75 killed, but some organisations claimed that the death toll was between 100 and 175.</p></speech>

The Nigerian Government has had a very difficult situation to deal with.  As a democratic government, the initial response was to seek to engage in dialogue.  However, the group refused to talk and continued to kill innocent people.  Even to declare a state of emergency was a very difficult decision.  There was a meeting of major stakeholders, the state governments, community leaders and legislators, at which all factors were considered.  These measures were taken in line with the Nigerian constitution because the Nigerian Government felt it could not stand by in the name of democracy and human rights when innocent people were being killed.  The offer of dialogue is still being ignored.  One must, therefore, understand the background to some of these issues.</p><p>  The Nigerian Government has a committee in place that is willing at any time to discuss any issue the group wants to discuss.  There are so many channels for it to air its grievances.  The press is one of the freest in Africa and the world.  Nigeria comprises 36 states, with 36 individual legislative arms.  We have a Senate with 109 Members and a House of Representatives with 360 Members.  There is a human rights commission, as well as a public complaints commission.  If people cannot utilise all of these channels and prefer to use violence, one can understand the dilemma.  Is one going to leave innocent people to be attacked, killed or maimed?  These are some of the challenges we want people to see and actually appreciate the magnitude of what we are going through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014052800005#D00600"><p>I welcome the ambassador.  My first experience of people from Nigeria was when, as a child, two young children from Biafra arrived at our school, refugees from the conflict.  As kids, it was probably the first time we had actually met anyone fleeing from a war-torn region and it was unusual that it was two African children at our school.  There are 40,000 Nigerians living in Ireland today.  A few years later a conflict had broken out in a part of this country and we met more people fleeing from that conflict.</p><p>  The ambassador has explained the meaning of &ldquo;Boko Haram&rdquo;, namely, forbidding western education.  I do not know much about the Koran, but I always understood Mohammad had spoken about the importance of education.  He even said, &ldquo;Go in quest of knowledge even unto China.&rdquo;  I cannot understand from where Boko Haram is coming, but I presume it is anti-western sentiment.  We have similar conflicts across the world, with young girls in Afghanistan being targeted because they are learning to read and write.</p><p>  Nigeria is now Africa&rsquo;s largest economy and has the continent&rsquo;s largest oil reserves.  It has a child population of 10.5 million, but only 4% of girls in northern Nigeria complete secondary school.  Is the emergence of Boko Haram a symptom of the tensions within Nigerian society?  While the situation in Biafra has settled down, there are many tensions within the country, many of which are down to inequalities.  I have spoken to people who have travelled there who have told me that there is a lot of wealth but large extremes in poverty.  What is the Nigerian Government doing to tackle societal inequalities?  What is happening to the oil revenues?  We condemn what happened to the schoolgirls and selling them as slaves for $10.  There is no humanity in Boko Haram and no sympathy around this table for what it is doing.  If there is anything we can do, we will do it, as this needs to stop.  However, there are problems within Nigeria and I would like to get my head around some of the difficulties.  Is Boko Haram a symptom of something that is wrong in Nigeria that needs to be fixed?  I would like to hear about the peace talks, but if the ambassador cannot refer to them, I will understand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014052800005#D00700"><p>I welcome the ambassador.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the work of the outgoing Irish ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Paddy Fay, and wish his successor, Mr. Sean Hoy, every success, as well as a productive and positive time in Nigeria and other west African countries.</p><p>  When we listened to what had happened to the schoolgirls, I cannot help but recall the Dublin second level schoolgirls I saw earlier in the Visitors Gallery in the D&aacute;il and their safe access to primary and second level education, as well as the opportunity to attend third level, if that is their choice.  I know the Cuban ambassador is present at the meeting.  I am aware of the amazing work that has been done in Cuba since the revolution to ensure everyone in that country is educated.  The whole thrust of Boko Haram is to deprive girls of an education and bring them back to the status of slaves in feudal times.  If we deprive girls of an education, we are also depriving the education system of female teachers whom we all acknowledge are excellent role models in so many countries.</p><p>  Several years ago, when Madeleine McCann went missing in Portugal, there was a massive outcry and massice media attention for that one girl.  While I accept the efforts to ensure the safe return of the 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria that the ambassador outlined, there was an obvious lack of urgency at the beginning on the part of the Nigerian Government to deal with the abduction.  There was a lacklustre response and I do not accept that it had happened in a remote area.  There could have been of a more focus on the event when it happened.  Would it have been left as a sideline issue, were it not for international pressure and attention?  </p><p>  Do we have all of the names of the girls abducted?</p> <p>Do we know who their families are in the event that some of them are trafficked out of Africa so that other countries can watch out for them and know who they are?  There were reports that defence forces in the area knew that something was coming and did not have the necessary troops to repel this incursion by Boko Haram.  Are Nigerian troops infiltrated by Boko Haram?  Given that Nigeria has so many resources and such a vast population, why are more resources not going to the defence authorities to ensure people are safe?  What has declaring a state of emergency actually achieved?  Does the ambassador know who is arming Boko Haram?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H. E. Mr. Felix Yusufu Pwol" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014052800006#E00300"><p>My first answer is in response to Deputy Crowe.  He talked about structural problems.  Perhaps I should provide brief background information about Nigeria.  Nigeria celebrated its centenary anniversary in January marking 100 years of amalgamation.  Nigeria has a population of between 160 and 170 million and contains more than 250 ethnic groups.  What form of government would have been most suitable?  The committee may be aware that the 1954 constitution made Nigeria a federal structure to address some of these concerns.  There were three regions in 1954 and we now have 36 states.  It aims to address some of the issues about which Deputy Crowe spoke such as marginalisation and deprivation.  Our constitution contains a federal character commission.  It is designed to see that positions are rationalised in terms of personnel in various statutory bodies.  It also relates to the distribution of socioeconomic resources such as roads, schools, hospitals and so on.  We had challenges with Biafra but I do not know of any country in Africa that went through a three year civil year that has had the kind of reconciliation we have had in Nigeria given the complexity I have just explained.  We have more than 250 ethnic groups.  No doubt there are challenges, but we are trying to address them through measures such as the federal structure.</p><p>  There are a number of cultural factors relating to girls' education.  Initially, Islamic education was emphasised but my colleague here is a Muslim and he will tell the committee that after Islamic education, many of the girls about whom we are talking embrace Western education.  It is a deliberate government policy.  There were no ladies in very senior appointments 30 or 40 years ago.  Today, the chief justice of Nigeria is a lady and a lady has just been appointed to the court of appeal.  For the first time in the history of Nigeria, there are about 11 female ministers and 18 secretaries general.  We are aiming to get the number to 20 out of 42, which is a major step.  I am not saying we have reached it but I want the committee to appreciate where we are coming from.  It is important.  I should also underscore that in the 54 years of independence from 1960, only 25 governments have been civilian.  A total of 29 governments have been under military control.  The committee knows what military rule is.  It involves suspending a constitution.  I know what many people said in 2003 when we had the first transition from one civilian government to another.  People thought that hell would be let loose, but this did not happen.  I agree that we have had challenges but we are trying our best to manage them.</p><p>  In terms of the poverty that was alluded to, the current government has introduced a number of programmes.  There is a programme called SURE-P, which stands for Subsidy, Re-investment &amp;amp; Empowerment.  What does it mean?  It means that if, after the budget, we have resources that are above what was budgeted for, that extra amount is put into programmes like start-up programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly for young college graduates and even for village women who want to start up small businesses.  This programme is in its third year and has been a very big success.  There is a programme called Youth Enterprise with Innovation in Nigeria, YouWiN, which identifies promising young entrepreneurs and their businesses.  They are selected and linked up with a bank called the Bank of Industry to help them access credit to improve their businesses.</p><p>  The war on terror does not merely involve the military-criminal aspect, on which I dwelt.  The government has many programmes.  Within the past year, we saw the national agricultural plan, the national industrial plan, the national health summit, the national sports summit and the national water summit.  These have never been held in the history of the country.  These are major five year programmes that are designed to address some of the challenges we face in the area of infrastructure.  One was also held on education.  The committee will be interested to note that every year we have about one million qualified students for third level education.  Unfortunately, only half - between 400,000 and 500,000 - get that.  It is because of this that in the past two years the current government has set up seven new universities to address this.  Many of the programmes I mentioned are in partnership with the private sector to see how we can create jobs.  In 2013, 1.1 million jobs were created in Nigeria.  It is a still a long way off but we are trying our best.</p><p>  In looking at these matters, it is important to see where we are coming from.  I hope I have addressed most of the issues that have been raised.  There is no doubt that poverty exists but poverty is not a licence to kill innocent people.  We appreciate and acknowledge that there are challenges but that does not mean that one takes the lives of innocent people.  If we start behaving like that, we will slide into anarchy.</p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the issue of girls' education.  I want to state that there are special programmes designed to encourage girls' education in Nigeria, particularly in northern Nigeria.  We must admit that there have been cultural challenges but many of these communities are now realising that they need to educate their girls.  This has been achieved through an aggressive campaign by the government, meetings, training programmes and showcasing those who have gone to school.  As I mentioned, the current chief justice of Nigeria is a lady.  For the first time, a two star general in the navy is a lady.  These things were unheard of.  It is a challenge in the police force but I can assure the committee it is being aggressively addressed.</p><p>  I tend to disagree with Deputy O'Sullivan regarding a lack of urgency in seeing to the rescue of these girls.  As I mentioned earlier, there are issues that it is not appropriate for us to discuss in a public hearing, which is why I do not want to go into details.  It is the same thing regarding the question of whether troops were infiltrated.  I do not wish to comment on it in this kind of setting.  In a normal situation, one must follow certain procedures to pass laws, particularly those relating to the security of lives and property.  The state of emergency means that one may waive some of these procedures that are required by the parliament to enable the government to take certain actions, for example, in the area of movement and communication.  If necessary, one can suspend communication by mobile phones and so on.  That is what it means.  This measure was taken in full consultation.  The security officials and members of the armed forces were invited to a meeting by both Houses of Parliament - the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p> <p>Extensive discussions were held on whether it was necessary to continue with the state of emergency and they agreed to it.  It was not the case that the President had decided to impose a state of emergency.  Elders from the three states have met the President on several occasions and, as one would expect in a democracy, many people argued against the need to declare a state of emergency.  The question that arose for them what to suggest as an alternative, but they could not produce a credible alternative.  In a democracy, when one wants to substitute one option for another, one should be able to show the viability of the options proposed.  It became very clear that, while people may have disagreed with the imposition of the state of emergency, in the scenario it seemed to be the better option.</p><p> The question on Boko Haram is interesting.  I do not think the issues are confined to Nigeria.  Most countries, both in the sub-region and on the African continent, now acknowledge that it must be part of the worldwide illegal network for the trafficking of arms.  This is becoming obvious.  What does this portend for the world?  There is a need for increased co-operation and vigilance.  In Nigeria we started a national identity card project several years ago.  After many years of delay, it was launched last year, with the inclusion of a system for biometric identification.  This forms part of our long-term goals.  Similarly for the banking system, we know how financial institutions can contribute to money laundering and trafficking.  This is how groups get the money for arms.  A number of steps have been taken in this regard.  We are introducing biometric identification for bank accounts in order that when somebody withdraws a certain amount of money, his or her identity can be known.  These are examples of the long-term measures we are implementing to address the issues involved.  They will not be easy to address, but I assure the committee that the government is not resting.  </p><p> I hope I have thrown light on members' questions.</p></speech>

We have all expressed our support, in various ways, for the efforts to find the abducted girls and return them to their families.  It was an act of aggression and oppression by a group which believed in its own superiority.  The fact is that 50% of the population, that is, women, were not regarded as being entitled to freedom of access to education.  We should compliment the girls from Finglas who identified with the abducted girls and wrote to Chairman to express their concern.  They did something that was within their ambit.  Perhaps people throughout the globe might have done a little bit more or acted a little quicker, whether in Nigeria or elsewhere.  It may well be a difficult and sensitive issue and I hope the negotiations are successful, but the degree to which this behaviour is accepted in a modern society in any part of the globe is frightening.  A couple of years ago an attempt was made on the life of a young girl in Pakistan because of her opposition to the ongoing campaign to prevent girls from getting an education.  That attempt failed, but there is continuing aggression against and suppression of women and girls.  This behaviour is unacceptable in any society, regardless of its origins.</p><p>  I ask the extent to which the international community has come on board to offer assistance.  In a case of this nature, there should be no circumstances in which offers of help are refused.  It is essential that every possible avenue be explored to ensure the perpetrators of this deed are given a clear indication there is no safe place for them and that there is no way they can win.  Deprivation of education is deprivation of freedom and human rights.  In regard to human rights, it is sad that might seeks to overcome right, even at this time.  The most worrying factor is that the victims were vulnerable and that their rights were overcome and set aside by those who see themselves as occupying a superior position.  It must be extraordinarily scary for young women and girls in Nigeria and other countries beset by similar activities.</p><p>  I acknowledge that individual members of the committee have previously raised this issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The European Union is also acting on it.  The United Nations should also take action and I hope it is making a serious effort to impress on those involved that this action is unacceptable.  Everything that can be done should be done to highlight the issue.  We should all express the hope that the girls who are the victims in this case will be returned home safe and sound.</p></speech>

I understand 100 or more are still in captivity.</p><p>  I do not want to fight with the ambassador, but I fundamentally disagree with his statement that the insurgency is not a religious war as both Christians and Muslims have been killed.  It is most definitely a religious war.  The fact that Muslims are being killed means that they are being killed by more extreme Muslims.  The fact that the mosques of these Muslims are being burned by Boko Haram clearly indicates that the group wants to create an Islamist state in Nigeria.  The group consists of religiously motivated sectarian thugs and gangsters who represent the Islamists of the world.  As the ambassador pointed out, Islamists - Al Shabab - murdered the daughter of the Kenyan ambassador in Nairobi.  There is a horrible Christian-Muslim conflict in the Central African Republic and we are trying to stabilise the conflict in Somalia.  In Sudan there is a similar conflict and we have seen what has happened in Niger recently.</p> <p>Had France not intervened, Mali would have been completely overrun.  It goes as far as Mauritania and the ambassador mentioned the porous border between Cameroon and Nigeria.  Across Africa a war is being fought by primitive Islamists who do not represent mainstream Islam and are an affront to mainstream Muslims, hence the violence they inflict on them.  It is a tragedy that we are dealing with this issue because we would love to be able to say Nigeria was a model country.  It has a growth rate of 6.6%.  We keep talking about the African countries that are doing so well economically and changing the face of Africa, yet we are plunged into barbarity by these Islamist terrorists linked with al-Qaeda.</p><p> I know the area very well and have used the porous border illegally, having travelled from Niger into Nigeria and across to Cameroon via Maiduguri.  I have very fond memories of Maiduguri and Kano.  A very strong argument has been made that Nigeria is a very wealthy country, having produced approximately &euro;80 billion worth of oil, and that it is reaping the consequences of the neglect of the poorer north on security grounds, among other reasons.  Is the northern region economically depressed, hence the ability of Boko Haram to recruit those who feel disenfranchised from the Muslim community?  Will the ambassador explain to us who, as westerners, have not fully come to terms with the concept of Muslim Islamists how the central government of Nigeria relates to the 12 northern states of Nigeria which apply Sharia law?  We can clearly see that Boko Haram is unsatisfied with the extent to which Sharia law is applied there and wants, as we can see from its behaviour with the young girls in question, a different type of law.  How do the political structures of Nigeria operate when there is the application of such laws in the north?</p><p> People have been locked into state schools and burned to death.  The schools from which the girls were kidnapped were state-funded.  These groups are attacking the state education system.  I congratulate the Nigerian Government on trying to provide a state educational infrastructure.  Does the ambassador agree that the northern sector has been neglected economically and is, therefore, ripe ground for groups such as Boko Haram to recruit from the Muslim community and pursue an Islamist war of attrition against Nigeria?</p></speech>

One can only imagine the awful situation experienced by the parents and siblings of the young girls who are missing and the urgent need to address the problem.  Other speakers have referred to the fact that in the early stages it appeared that the government was slow to react to the abduction of these children.  How significant is the publicity and media attention in Nigeria given to the fact that so many school children are missing?</p><p>  I appreciate that the ambassador cannot comment much on operational matters and what is being done within Nigeria regarding negotiations and discussions.  Is consideration being given to taking up the offers of assistance by the many countries which want to help Nigeria to address this issue?  I am very encouraged by some of the statistics the ambassador has given for the growth of universities and the numbers of women pursuing third level education.  Is there a link between this issue and Nigeria's human rights record which is not particularly wonderful?  I am thinking of legislation that has been passed on same sex marriage and civil unions and the treatment of members of the gay community.  Are there underlying issues, as well as an attempt to prevent the education of women in Nigeria?</p><p>  What would the ambassador like this committee and the Irish Government to do to assist Nigeria in bringing about a resolution of this issue and helping to have the girls returned to their families as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.426" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Felix Yusufu Pwol" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014052800008#G00300"><p>I share most of the sentiments exprssed in Deputy Bernard J. Durkan's commentary.  We should uphold the education of girls, which is part of the challenge we face.  It is a very abnormal, awkward situation.  We thought we were moving in the right direction before this unfortunate destruction.  As I mentioned, while we may have had some cultural issues, we had moved much further.  The constitution and education Acts encourage the education of girls.  I hope members will visit Nigeria one of these days to see and understand what I am saying.  I agree with most of the statements made - it is a violation of human rights.  Nigeria is a member of the Human Rights Council.  As a nation, we came from military rule but have made tremendous progress.</p><p>  I disagree with Deputy Eric Byrne.  We must be very clear.  The fact that a group wants to create an Islamic state does not make the current insurgency a religious war.  They are two different things.  People could use religion for political purposes, but that does not mean a country is experiencing a religious war.  We are nowhere near what Lebanon experienced in the past.  This issue is very clear.  The constitution makes it clear that Nigeria is a secular state.  When an insurgent group states it wants to create an Islamic state and has been wreaking havoc, we should be very cautious in trying to understand the facts.  As far as I know, BBC journalists have been to Chibok.  I have mentioned that the press in Nigeria is one of the freest.  People have been there and seen.  I am not aware of any religious war in Nigeria.  Which country does not have religious skirmishes from time to time?  Does this degenerate to calling it a religious war?</p> <p>These are some of the things I want the committee to have.  I mentioned information management.  In this kind of a delicate situation that we are in, it is important.  Some of our journalists do not seem to understand the complexity of the issues and the challenges.  It is not just making news but trying to get the correct news for people to understand the issues.  That is equally important.  We have a freedom of information Act but its use must be weighted.  It is just like the talk about human rights.  If it violates somebody else's rights, what rights are we talking about then?  We should try to distinguish clearly this question of religious war or religious commissions and so on before we get into very dicey situations.</p><p> Reference was made to the relationship with the federal Government.  We have a constitution that recognises three types of government: federal, 36 states at the intermediate level and 774 local government areas similar to counties in Ireland.  The jurisdiction of the courts is clear.  Even where there are Sharia courts, they are predominantly Islamic states.  One also has to look at the issues brought before those courts.  Apart from Islamic courts, we have customary area courts.  They would not have the traditional high courts or magistrates courts that are familiar to most people in the western world so it is important to understand these distinctions.  If there is Sharia law in, say, Kebbi state, first, one has to be a Muslim to be subjected to that kind of law, second, there is a customary area court if one is not a Muslim and then we have the magistrate courts and as one climbs the ladder, one goes to the state high court, then to the federal high court and to the court of appeal and the supreme court.  It is important for people to understand this distinction and not assume that when Sharia law is mentioned, it is just applied.  The limitation of powers is not as neat as we think it is and sometimes one has to go to court to clarify some of the issues.</p><p> Reference was then made to economic deprivation in the north.  It could be a factor and I do not rule it out.  It is easier to recruit somebody who is hungry and unemployed than somebody who is well fed and has a job but that cannot also be a licence to foment problems.  Does it mean if we are past our problems, it now gives us a right to attack certain people when we have clear laws that guide these things?  I have mentioned so many avenues for people to seek redress from the Public Complaints Commission to even the Federal Character Commission.  If a particular state or part of Nigeria feels it is being marginalised, it has every right to raise it after the courts.  That organisation will be asked to bring documents.  There is the press like I mentioned.  We have parliamentary committees at the state and federal level where people can seek redress.</p><p> With regard to the economic depression the member mentioned, people have brought issues such as why a project was not sited in a location or why routes or schools were not constructed.  These are taken into consideration at budgetary sessions.  Even in the north east, there will be spatial provision to address many of the issues and challenges that were mentioned from security of schools to economic infrastructure that has been destroyed.  For example, electricity lines, mobile telephone towers and so on have been vandalised.  It is a comprehensive programme and it is complex.  It has to be divided into short term, medium term and long term.  The Government was not enthusiastic in replying with force to force but was left with little or no option.</p><p> I agree that economic deprivation could be a factor but I do not know whether I have the time to go into this because I do not want to get into the blame game of how these things evolved.  The important thing is if there are economic challenges, I believe the way forward is what should be done to address them.  This is what the Government has been trying to do, even though we have a federal structure with a National Economic Council where the federal and state governments meet regularly to address many of these issues.  In a federal structure, some states are far richer than others and, therefore, one must find a way and see how one brings up those that less fortunate in terms of resources - human, natural and so on.</p><p> In response to Senator Mullins, media attention was quite high.  We have more than 100 newspapers, more than 100 radio stations and approximately 200 television stations.  No issue has generated more coverage apart from soccer.  To emphasise the seriousness of this matter, this is a fairly new phenomenon and I believe it has brought greater awareness of our security that we used to take for granted.  Community policy is what the federal Government has been working hard on to see if we learn the principles of such policing from other societies where the police will collaborate with the village, districts and communities and exchange views on how many of these problems can be addressed. </p><p> On human rights, Nigeria passed a law on same-sex marriage.  That is just one aspect.  We need to understand this thing from a proper cultural perspective.  The analogy I used when I am asked about this by people is the way many western people react when they hear about polygamy in Africa.  People find it strange here.  Likewise when one mentions same-sex marriage, people begin to wonder probably because it is not the practice.  I believe many of us know it is not because something is wrong but simply because one is not used to it, one tends to think it is wrong probably by one's own assessment.  I do not know whether there is any empirical validation of some of the cultural beliefs we hold today.</p><p> We have come a long way on human rights.  Over the past ten or 15 years and particularly over the past three years, one can see the commendable achievements of our law enforcement agencies.  We have tried to learn from best practice in peackeeping operations, on which we have worked closely with Ireland.  I believe every country still has challenges but it is also important to see the progress that has been made and to see how we can make better progress.</p><p> The committee can help us to throw light on some of these issues that people understand.  A few year ago, many countries thought they could take on the security challenges alone but, day by day, we are seeing that it is becoming more intractable and complex and even in some countries it would appear there is a safe haven for some of these elements.</p> <p>I believe the meeting in France, the UN Security Council resolution and the action taken by the African Union and ECOWAS are a clear indiction that we are moving in the right direction.  We in Nigeria are very optimistic that, given the support we are getting from very many friendly countries, we shall make headway.  All of us are concerned and are praying that the girls will be brought to safety.  That is the fundamental issue that concerns the Government as we speak.</p><p> If there is any issue I did not address, the members might let me know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014052800010#J00200"><p>I thank the ambassador for coming to share his insights with us on this matter.  Obviously, all of our minds have been concentrated on the abduction of those unfortunate girls and, of course, we would wish that everything possible be done in order to get their safe release.  It is something of a reflection on the UN and the Western media that the huge focus has only now arisen on this issue because, going back over a number of years, there have been many atrocities.  Last year, for example, 29 students were burned alive at a school in northern Nigeria, which probably got one article and that was then the end of it for some of our newspapers.  A couple of months later, 40 more students were killed and, in February of this year, 59 boys attending a boarding school were shot dead.  These atrocities have been ongoing.</p><p>  The ambassador mentioned that this has been an issue since 2009.  My understanding is that the group which is now called Boko Haram emerged following the 9/11 atrocities in the US, and that Mohammed Yusuf, the young man who established this group, went on to embrace a Taliban-inspired model of education in order to move away from Western education and towards the Koranic sciences.  He was apparently arrested in 2009 and died in custody while he was handcuffed.  Has that not led to a very significant increase in the radicalisation of that group and in the atrocities it has committed?  I do not know that anybody has been brought to justice for that murder.  As we know in this country, when British authorities got involved in murdering our citizens, it fed into the campaign, which continued because of the sympathy this generated.  What is being done to bring those perpetrators to justice?  That is my first question.</p><p>  Second, the ambassador said it was categorically clear that the insurgency is not a religious war, as both Christians and Muslims have been killed and had their places of worship destroyed.  As I said earlier, this issue has not been particularly well publicised in this country and the same is probably the case elsewhere in the Western world.  My understanding is that many of these atrocities have concentrated on the Christian community and that various murders have taken place in churches around the main Christian holidays of Christmas and Easter.  Indeed, it is significant that in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, 70 people were killed at Easter.  I feel there is a sectarian element to this which probably reflects what is happening in many locations where there is conflict and where Islamic extremists are involved in those conflicts.</p><p>  I understand there are 17,000 refugees in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.  The Jubilee Campaign, which is an aid group that has been functioning in Nigeria, has urged the Nigerian Government to bring those refugees back to Nigeria.  It has also been campaigning for the UN and Western Governments to set up a victim relief fund in Nigeria.  What assistance is the Nigerian Government getting on that front from the UN and Western countries?</p><p>  I welcome some of the conference's recommendations, particularly those urging greater cohesion between the neighbouring countries.  Is it not the case that Nigeria itself will need more external assistance from an intelligence and perhaps a military point of view in order to bring this conflict to an end?  The conflict has been increasing over recent years.  It is probably a reflection on the bodies charged with dealing with this, and on ourselves to an extent, as politicians in the Western world, that we have only come very belatedly to focus on it.  I hope these girls will be released, but I would hate to think that afterwards the focus would move elsewhere rather than remaining on bringing this conflict to a conclusion.  What does the ambassador believe Ireland and the European Union can do to assist that effort?</p></speech>

With regard to the prosecution of the perpetrators, some of the demands they have been sending through social media and other methods have called for the release of some of their comrades.  It is true there are many, including women, who have been arrested and detained.  While the prosecution is taking a long time, the Attorney General some weeks ago mentioned the steps that have been taken to prosecute them in court.  Part of the reason for the delay is that the normal judicial process takes longer due to the need for evidence and other issues, but there is an attempt to address the issues so they can be brought to justice.  There is no doubt some of these people have been arrested and are in detention, even in Abuja.</p><p>  To come back to the religious issue-----</p></speech>

I know there was an internal inquiry but, so long as that is not made public, I cannot comment on what actually happened.  From media reports, I know there was an investigation into the circumstances in which he died.</p><p>  The Senator's question has brought another dimension to the religious issue concerning these radical groups.  We have to be careful in that some of these groups give the impression they are working for a particular religion.  Initially, as the Senator said, they were attacking churches, but it was not much longer before they started attacking mosques.  Sometimes they do these things to confuse people.  Even mainstream religious people do not understand what is happening.  The challenge for the international community is to try to understand this issue properly.  My own personal view, from studying the issue, is that I do not believe we will learn clearly where this came from and where it is going to.  The complication has been the link to al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab.  The average person in Nigeria does not see a link, but it is becoming clear that this is a very sophisticated group.  This is a new phenomenon in Nigeria, where we have never seen any group of this type.</p> <p>They have machine guns and vehicles.  Many of them are well trained.  There was a briefing by defence headquarters last year.  Another important question is where are they getting all of their support, and it would be good to establish this.  It is becoming increasingly clear that it is international.  Wherever it comes from, we can see from the consequences on the ground that it is not just a ragtag bunch perpetrating all of this.</p><p> I do not know whether the 10 million Nigerians can be considered refugees.  Yes, they were internally displaced, and this has happened in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the eastern part of Nigeria.  No doubt they had no choice but to move, because these people are simply callous and do not spare women, children or the elderly.  The Nigerian national emergency agency is examining it.  A team from the United States came to assist with logistics and the national emergency agency is working hard to address this question.  When they visited they assured us they were looking into the matter of displaced people across the borders with Niger, Cameroon and Chad.</p><p> With regard to support from the UN and Western countries, if people are not aware of a danger they can fall into a trap.  An important step this committee and other European parliamentarians can take is to help the public understand the seriousness of the matter.  It is important that people are aware.  When people are aware they will understand the serious danger we are in.  As I have mentioned several times, it is not a battle for one or several countries; it should be worldwide, because it is sophisticated and involves money-laundering, drug trafficking, trafficking small arms and human trafficking.  Nigeria has established a body to address the matter of human trafficking.</p><p> A major challenge in Nigeria is that we need logistical assistance such as intelligence support.  Approximately 20,000 troops are involved in the operation in three states.  A new division was created.  Previously we had four divisions but a special division was created to address the problem in the three states I mentioned.  We are looking to countries with better experience than us, particularly with regard to intelligence.</p><p> Something introduced in the west African subdivision which might be helpful is the early warning system.  We discovered that part of the problem which led to political conflicts was a slow response.  Issues started with disputes over electoral votes and other such mundane things but before one knew it, it had escalated into very serious violence.  It is important to examine certain indicators which tend to show this is what is likely to happen.  We must also work hard to see what mechanisms to put in place to address this matter.  The strategy must change to meet the challenges of the times in which we live now.</p></speech>

The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Joe Costello, has been to Nigeria twice.  Last year he went with a trade delegation comprising 17 companies.  We also see increasing co-operation in the memorandum of understanding signed with University College Cork.  I was able to organise a visit to Nigeria where those who travelled met the presidents of approximately ten universities to discuss collaboration in teaching, research and student exchange programmes.  I also initiated a similar programme in Waterford Institute of Technology, and people from there also went to Nigeria and met the presidents of approximately 12 polytechnics.  As a result of this visit, two memorandums of understanding have been signed, with Federal Polytechnic Oko and Yaba College of Technology, which is our oldest college of technology.</p><p>  Irish companies such as Diageo, and previously Guinness, have traditionally been in Nigeria, and the construction company PW has been there for almost 40 years.  Other construction companies such as McNamara Construction are moving into Nigeria.  Glanbia and PZ Cussons are working together in Nigeria on dairy production.  We are examining the area of agriculture, particularly fisheries.  I was in Donegal five weeks ago and Premier Fish has been investing much in Nigeria.  This is an area we want to examine.</p><p>  I forgot to mention education and e-learning.  We are trying to implement best practice in education.  I mentioned the challenge we have in third level education, and we believe that if we put in place a mechanism for e-learning it would help a great deal.</p><p>  We have challenges in other areas such as infrastructure, including boat transportation, and aviation, particularly leasing aircraft.  At present we are modernising 22 airports and we believe the Irish will help us.  We also face a big challenge with energy.  Last year a delegation came and had very good discussions and site visits.  I cannot remember which body was involved.</p><p>  Relations are moving in the right direction.  I could not quite achieve an exchange of visits between the two Parliaments, which I think we need to work on, and I hope my successor will take it up.  The lower chamber of the Nigerian Parliament has 360 members and there are 109 senators in the other chamber.  The only presidential visit between the two countries was in June 2002.  I had hoped the foreign minister would go but I could not find a suitable time; Ireland chaired the OSCE in 2012 and during the first half of last year it held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU, which made it difficult.  We hope, towards the end of the year or early in the new year, to have an official ministerial summit-level visit.  It is interesting that we are seeing increased interest in trade from both Ireland and Nigeria.</p></speech>

I thank him for his services in this country.  He worked very closely with the Irish ambassador, Mr. Fay, in Abuja.  We are delighted that another expert in Nigeria, Sean Hoy, has been appointed ambassador and we know he will work with Mr. Pwol's successor.</p> <p>I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Umar Ahmed Abba, whom I know will continue to bat for his country with Ireland in the coming years.  I thank both delegates for attending today's meeting and for answering the questions so frankly.  As they will have noted, the members are very interested in what is happening in Nigeria.  This is a good sign of the relations that exist between the two Parliaments.  We had a most interesting and wide-ranging discussion.  I hope the ambassador has had a very fruitful and enjoyable experience in Ireland.  We wish him luck in his new post.</p></speech>

I want to apologise for the delayed start to the meeting.  There was a Vote in the Seanad and we waited for our colleagues from the Seanad to arrive back.  That is the reason we suspended.<br />The purpose of the meeting is to have a discussion with a number of people who made written submissions on the review of the effectiveness of legislation relating to the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On behalf of the committee I am very pleased to welcome Baroness Nuala O'Loan.  She was the first Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, a post she held from 1999 to 2007.  She is very welcome.  I thank her for being here today and giving us her time and expertise.  <br />I welcome<b></b>Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, Acting Garda Commissioner, and her team.  I also welcome Mr. Ronan Brady, lecturer in journalism, Griffith College, Dublin and thank him for being here.  <br />The format of the meeting is that witnesses will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by a question and answer session.  I ask witnesses to keep their opening statements as brief and to the point as possible.  It would be very much appreciated if they could keep them to around five minutes or thereabouts.  <br />I wish to advise all members, witnesses and observers in the Visitors Gallery to please turn off all mobile telephones or switch them to aeroplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device.</p> <p>It is not sufficient to put them on silent mode as this will maintain the level of interference from the committee and impacts negatively on broadcast.  If, in the course of proceedings, there is interference I will ask everybody to switch off their mobile telephones completely or withdraw from the room because it is very annoying for people in television and broadcast to have to endure such interference.</p><p> Before beginning I draw the attention of all witnesses to the position in regard to privilege.  I ask witnesses to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I invite Ms Nuala O'Loan to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

However, following recent events, there is an opportunity to enhance and refine the law to make it a more effective and more independent organisation.  It is for the Irish State to determine how it legislates for police accountability and my observations, which are the product of my personal experience as Police Ombudsman and my work with policing and police accountability organisations across the world, are offered simply to assist in the reform processes.</p><p>  International experience would suggest that real independence and impartiality are key factors for the success of an independent investigative organisation.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act does not mention either independence or impartiality in the objectives which it sets for GSOC.  It would seem to me that the term "fairness" is a weaker, less specific term.  For example, it would be possible to deliver an equally bad service to everyone.  That would be fair but it would not be acceptable or effective.  I urge the inclusion of a duty on GSOC to act with impartiality and independently.  I also suggest that GSOC should be resourced to investigate every complaint rather than referring matters back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  This is necessary to demonstrate de facto the real independence of GSOC.  It should have the power to investigate policy and practice matters of its own volition.  These are the issues that enabled me as Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland to deliver a service.</p><p>  GSOC cannot currently investigate complaints or allegations against the Commissioner.  The committee has heard evidence of this.  I do not know of any other similar organisation where this is the case and it is not sustainable if GSOC is to be perceived as effective.  There will always be a suspicion that accountability is okay for junior officers but the chief has to be protected.  GSOC needs a complete entitlement to material to be able to do its job.  Currently the Commissioner can withhold material and advise the Minister to withhold material.  That could lead to a perception of cover-up.</p><p>  The appearance of independence is important.  GSOC was required to take as staff former civil servants and its current staff are civil servants - part of the apparatus of the administration of the State.  There has to be a complete separation between GSOC and the State. The current arrangements whereby serving garda&iacute; are based in the GSOC office is not conducive to any perception of independence, and perception is profoundly important.  I cannot conceive of anything which serving garda&iacute; could bring to the office now in terms of explanation of Garda practices which GSOC could not acquire through retired or former garda&iacute;.  GSOC needs an uninterrupted, immediate right of access to search police premises.  I dealt with that issue at some length in my initial submission.  This does not exist and is necessary.  The Garda Commissioner should be under a stated obligation to secure, preserve and provide evidence in every case.</p><p>  Current law enables officers subject to complaint to veto attempts at an informal resolution process.  There is a very low level of informal resolution here.  It is in the interests of everyone that simple, less complex complaints be dealt with more effectively.</p><p>  The provision which causes me considerable concern is the provision which enables prosecution of a person who makes a false or misleading complaint.  I consider that provision to be disproportionate, since it could well deter genuine complainants.  From my experience, it is not easy for most people to make a complaint against the police.  Many states contemplated introducing a provision like this at the request of the police and police representative organisations but decided against it.  Were I making change, I would repeal the section.  Although a person can defend themselves, the mere fact of the possibility of prosecution and the risk of a heavy fine and a prison sentence is a disproportionate disincentive to making a complaint which may be perfectly well justified.</p><p>  The legislation does not provide a right to GSOC to make recommendation for change in policy or practice following a conduct or criminal investigation.  I am aware that some such recommendations are made.   Such a provision would enable a better outcome for the people of Ireland from the investment currently made in police accountability.</p><p>  I would like to say more but think it is better that I give the committee the opportunity to ask me questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800004#D00400"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 with the committee.  I have provided a document outlining our submission on a section by section basis, as requested.  I have also given the committee a printed version of the opening address.  To make the best use of time I propose to touch on a few of the key issues outlined.</p><p>  The revision of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 presents a unique opportunity for us to make sure we have the modern well-governed customer-facing police service we need.  As interim Garda Commissioner I have already launched a substantial reform and renewal programme to make sure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to have the trust, respect and confidence of the diverse communities it serves with pride.  We are at a defining moment in the history of the policing service, a moment at which the principles of accountability, transparency and professionalism must be at the core of a strong, confident and connected policing service and at which such principles must be seen to be at the core of everything we do in order that we are trusted and valued by the public we serve.  The revision of the Act is necessary because in the ten years since it was first drafted, Irish society and public expectations of its police service have changed.  The new Act must reflect this new landscape in which we now operate.  The 2005 Act brought about some very welcome changes but it is time to move forward to a new era of enhanced accountability.</p><p>  At the outset it is important to acknowledge the enormous contribution made on a daily basis by every member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Day in and day out, the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serve this State and our local communities and work to keep them safe and secure.  They interact with families and individuals at some of the most challenging and vulnerable moments that are encountered in life.  Much of this work does not, and often should not, make headlines but it does touch hearts and minds and it does make a difference.</p><p>  Throughout its history An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has met and overcome new challenges, whether they came from the paramilitary threat that hung over this island for decades, from organised criminality or from emerging technologies.  We have done so in a spirit of doing what is right for the community and the country as well as what is in the interests of delivering professional and accountable policing.</p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 was a significant legislative initiative which brought clarity to the management and oversight of policing in this country.  It addressed the changing policing environment and enhanced our ability to meet the emerging challenges of delivering an effective, professional and accountable police service.  Since the publication of the Act, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been and continues to be subject to significant oversight from a range of different institutions: the Oireachtas, including this committee and other Oireachtas committees, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate, and judicial oversight of activities relating to State security.</p><p>  Our relationship with our external oversight authorities must be professional, transparent, open and demonstrate full engagement.  Such oversight is not just welcome but vital in a modern democracy.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recognises that accountability and transparency must be among the fundamental principles upon which we develop our policing service.  That complex task will be greatly helped by an independent policing authority.  This authority, together with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Inspectorate, will enhance public confidence in our policing function and frankly, right now, that reinforcement is necessary.</p><p>  I turn to some specific proposals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which draw both on our professional judgement and expertise and our practical knowledge and experience of providing a community-focused police service.  As I see it they fall into three broad categories: first, accountability and transparency in the delivery of policing; second, investigation of complaints about policing; and third, effective use of resources and ensuring best police practice.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na welcomes the proposed establishment of an independent police authority as a means of enhancing the delivery of a modern dynamic policing service and ensuring it meets the needs and expectations of the community.  We know that there are examples on these islands and further afield of how such authorities can operate.  The structure and make-up of that independent authority is a matter for Government and the Legislature.  The key element for us is to ensure the authority and its members are consistently guided and motivated by what is good for the community and good for policing.</p><p>  Our renewal programme is focused on ensuring we are in a state of readiness to provide the level of governance and accountability to serve the requirements of that authority, when established.  It is vital that we are accountable to national independent bodies.</p> <p>It is equally important that we are accountable to local communities.  The Irish model of policing admired by many police services around the world has been built on listening to, engaging and working in partnership with local communities to identify and solve problems.  To date, the joint policing committees have had a major role to play.  These partnerships between local stakeholders and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have successfully identified solutions for issues that impact on local communities.  These structures should continue to have a meaningful role and to be focused as locally as possible.</p><p> In respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, a strong and fully functioning commission which commands the confidence of the community plays a vital part in maintaining trust in policing.  We are committed to ensuring constructive engagement with GSOC to achieve our mutual objectives.  Our written submission proposes a number of changes to the workings and powers of GSOC.  These key proposals include that garda&iacute; should not investigate garda&iacute;.  As Baroness O'Loan stated, all complaints of a serious nature should be investigated by GSOC personnel, not by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This provides independent objectivity.  We support GSOC's submission that the definition covering what incidents fall into the serious crime category should be extended.  We also support the initiative to allow GSOC to resolve complaints by way of informal resolution with the consent of the complainant and the member complained of.</p><p> In respect of the Garda Inspectorate, since its inception the Garda Inspectorate has produced a number of insightful and valuable reports that have helped improve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, it is worth bearing in mind that some recommendations require resource investments which are difficult in the current climate in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &ndash; like other public bodies - has had to operate.</p><p> I also want to mention something in respect of receiving and responding to feedback.  I have stated from the outset that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be open to internal and external criticism if we are to strengthen and grow.  Dissent is not disloyalty, and different and differing views must be heard and supported as they can help to improve the service we provide.  Sometimes those criticisms may not be fully correct or justified but we need to learn to listen and to understand, and where there are issues that need to be addressed we must take appropriate action immediately.</p><p> In that context, the proposals for internal change include a restructuring of our internal affairs and professional standards department.  This would see the aligning of internal affairs, which directs investigations into allegations of Garda misconduct and examines internal disciplinary matters, and liaises with GSOC, and also the Garda professional standards unit, where standards and procedures can be reviewed so as to highlight areas of strategic concern and proactively address systemic challenges.</p><p> We would also submit that the remit of the internal audit unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be strengthened to enable it to audit and report on strategic, operational, financial and reputational risks to the organisation.  The unit should also be empowered to provide an objective opinion to the chair of the independent audit committee concerning systems, procedures and controls which will then bring the matter to the attention of the Commissioner.  We also submit that there is a need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to conduct public attitude surveys as is already provided for in the Act and we would submit that there should be an alternative public consultation forum that could be held to enhance that process.</p><p> Finally, I recommend that the official title of "An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na" be adopted in the interest of consistency.  In the previous Act it was "The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na", and we believe in the interest of consistency it would be "An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na".</p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its members hold a privileged position in society.  We serve with energy, dedication and pride and must be held accountable, at national and local level.  We are at a point in our history where we can build an organisation so that the Irish police service is a case study in responsive excellence, a leader of national and international best practice, and a constantly evolving force for good in our nation.</p><p> It is my job to get on with reshaping An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that it is worthy of the people it serves and worthy, too, of the great people who work within it.  An independent policing authority that will hold us to account for the delivery of a modern dynamic and human rights based policing service is welcome.  This authority, together with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Inspectorate, will enhance and ensure public confidence in our policing functions.  A revised Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act has a major role to play in helping us reach that goal of being a world-class police service that meets the needs of all communities and citizens for the benefit of the State.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for their time and will answer any questions.</p></speech>

The Freedom of Information Acts should be extended to the Garda.  The 1997 Freedom of Information Act was carefully drafted so as to allow this.  Section 23 of the Act already contains the necessary protection for confidential matters in the struggle against crime.  Since 1997, all that has been required for the extension of freedom of information to the Garda has been a decision of the Government.  No further legislation has been required.<br />Ireland is nearly unique, in so far as my studies go, in not extending freedom of information to the Garda.  In other countries, progressive policing organisations and police officers have sought to bring their organisations under a freedom of information regime, arguing that it is vital in maintaining public confidence in the policing service.  In Ireland, however, the authorities have fostered Garda antagonism towards openness, manifested in the legislation preventing proper contact between the media and serving officers.  It would be absurd to claim with certainty that the extension of freedom of information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have prevented the scandals that have recently been unearthed by Garda whistleblowers but it would be equally absurd to deny that a freedom of information regime would have made these scandals less likely.<br />Members of the committee can see my credentials, such as they are.  They are printed for them in the presentation.  I will move on to the key points I want to make.<br />First, the 1997 Act was an enormous step towards openness in a country where bureaucracy and censorship were more normal.  In 2003, there was a kind of bureaucratic coup in the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003 which was intended to reduce the effectivity of the 1997 Act.  Both parties in the current Government have undertaken to reform that.  They are preparing legislation and have already implemented certain aspects of legislation in this regard.  However, one aspect does not require additional legislation, that is, this one.  It is not a radical measure.<br />There is what some journalists have pointed to as &quot;a convenient confusion&quot; that in some way freedom of information would inhibit intelligence gathering or crime investigation.  That is not the case.  The Freedom of Information Act protects the necessary confidentiality of policing work.  The more forward-looking police leaders in our nearest neighbour have been positive about freedom of information legislation.  Sir Hugh Orde, of whom the committee will be aware and who went on to head the Association of Chief Police Officers, ACPO, in the United Kingdom, states that he pushed hard to place that association under the Westminster Freedom of Information Act 2000, and this was accomplished wholly voluntarily in 2011.<br />The ACPO website provides easy access to disclosure logs.  These are the letters that they send out.  They are the documents that they circulate among themselves.  They are redacted - material that could compromise confidentiality is blacked out - but, in the course of my studies, I have read letters to chief police officers from ACPO about intelligence training and other highly sensitive matters.  The redaction means that no terrorist could possibly divine any information that was useful to him or her, but by openly displaying the existence of these letters, ACPO is enabling serious journalists to ask more serious questions.  Of course, ACPO is within its powers to withhold certain information if it is not in the public interest to release it.  The logs contain information on such matters as terrorism and allied matters, criminal justice and performance management.  I have read the Metropolitan Police's disclosure logs as well.  These include, for example, the number of 999 calls which the police have missed.<br />In 2004, assistant chief constable Ian Readhead of the Hampshire police testified before a committee, not unlike this one, in Westminster.  He was asked has freedom of information inhibited police work, and his answer was emphatic.  He stated:<blockquote>No, I do not think so for one moment.  There is a clear balance to be drawn here between the right of the public to know and the right of the Service to sustain public safety in general, and the legislation gives ample opportunity for us to be able to secure information and keep information confidential which would threaten public safety if it were exposed.  I do not think that is the issue at all.</blockquote></p> <p>The assistant chief constable mentioned the culture of the service, whereby there is a tendency towards secrecy, and said he did not think that was sustainable.  He concluded by stating: &quot;There are many things that you could say about the way in which the Special Branch carries out its business which would not prejudice public safety at all.&quot;<br />Members will be aware that I also am a representative of the National Union of Journalists and Irish journalists find little evidence of such views among An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda press office was described by one of my colleagues as a bulwark against openness, which frankly is what most journalists feel about it.  Section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 contains a presumption of criminality against disclosing information to journalists, <i>inter alia</i>, without the approval of senior officers.  This is enormously disproportionate.  The international free speech NGO, Index on Censorship, has stated, quite rightly, that this legislation is &ldquo;not the behaviour of a European democracy&rdquo;.  It is, however, quite consistent with the hugger-mugger attitude concerning the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The absence of outside scrutiny contributes to behaviour such as the refusal to co-operate with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  It also contributes to a commonplace secrecy tactic whereby one defines a hot topic as an operational matter, even when disclosure would in no way inhibit any operation.<br />None of what I have said should be construed as anti-garda.  Speaking personally, I have good reason to thank garda&iacute; for their kindness and their protection on many occasions.  I have also worked with the United Nations internationally and in Asia and Africa I have encountered UN officials who class An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as one of the best police services in the world, based on the work done by garda&iacute; on UN assignments  Regretfully, however, I must agree with my colleague, Ken Foxe, who has stated a genuine argument can be made that had freedom of information, FOI, been in place within the Garda over the past 20 years, it may have made it a more open institution and helped its members to understand that legitimate inquiry is not dangerous.  He went on to state that a more open, more questioning culture across the Garda may have helped to avoid some of the enormous reputational damage it has suffered in recent months.</p></speech>

I only have two or three questions and although I intend to direct them towards an individual, any witness to whom they are not being directed should feel free to weigh in, if he or she has something to say.  I will begin with Baroness O'Loan, who mentioned there should be a provision to allow for GSOC to investigate or have access to a Garda premises.  I will extend that a little by inquiring on her views as to how far that should go.  In the context of GSOC's remit, is one merely talking about Garda stations and Garda headquarters or should other facilities be included?  While I am merely thinking aloud, in the case of an ongoing investigation into issues relating to a particular member of the force, for instance, would this extend - with the assistance of the courts - to looking at the personal premises of a serving member?</p></speech>

On the issue of access to personal premises, that is, to the homes of serving guards, to their cars, caravans or whatever it is, I am not fully experienced in criminal law here but that would be dealt with in the process of criminal investigation and I would expect the normal warrant process to apply to that.  Consequently, that would be possible, were one conducting a criminal investigation.  Very often before that, however, there is a question about whether material may or may not be held in a police station or a Garda station.  My experience has been that very often, there is material that may well be useful to an investigation, which is kept in lockers or desks or even, in the North anyway, in the roof spaces of stations.  The problem as I perceive it at present is that the legislation provides for notice to be given.  In most situations, GSOC would be able to give notice that it wished to come in and look for something or to ask for something but in order to have independence, there must be a right to go and to enter.  We had that right in the North and it was a necessary part of some of our investigations.</p></speech>

While such members are carrying out the course of their duties, they just happen to have it in a personal vehicle that they might be using, for example.  There have been instances mentioned in recent years of serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na using their own vehicles.  I wonder whether the role of GSOC would include that.  While taking on board what Baroness O'Loan said about the criminal investigation, I am just thinking of an investigation being carried out by GSOC and whether, in her view, it would or should extend to that.</p></speech>

If An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not providing the garda&iacute; in question with vehicles that enable them to do their job, then it must be approving the use of their personal vehicles, which must then make it within the territory of GSOC.  While that possibly would require legislation, I think that should be possible because otherwise, one will or may lose the opportunity to retrieve evidence.</p></speech>

As I have heard a great deal of commentary on extending that remit to GSOC, is this an absolute as far as Baroness O'Loan is concerned?</p></speech>

The situation in the North is that the Policing Board is the disciplinary authority for chief officers.  The chief officer is the disciplinary authority for other officers.  Consequently, the Police Ombudsman in the North has full power to investigate allegations against the chief officer.  I have stated publicly that to me, this is something without which I would not be prepared to operate.</p></speech>

In the course of the last public hearing on this issue a couple of weeks ago when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and GSOC were present, a discussion arose on the dual functions they conduct, where there is some crossover and whether the existence of both organisations as separate entities should be continued.  What are Baroness O'Loan's views in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.466" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800006#F01000"><p>My experience would suggest to me that they carry out completely different functions.  While I would anticipate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate would have a programme of rolling investigation of current policies, practices, training resources, use of resources and so on and would report on each investigation it does, GSOC has a completely different function, which is to investigate allegations of misconduct.  From allegations of misconduct, there always arise questions on management, training, supervision and that sort of thing.  In the North, we had a power to conduct policy and practice investigations of our own initiative without the consent of the Minister.  We would gather together the information and where we became aware of a trend of problems, perhaps about management, about securing evidence or about dealing with minorities, we would then conduct a policy and practice investigation and publish the results of that investigation on the website.  That is an enormously important contribution to the efficiency of policing.  It derives from the investigation of complaints and for GSOC to then hand that to the inspectorate to conduct these focused investigations would require the inspectorate to go back to the beginning.  That, therefore, would require, if one likes, a duplication of some of the work that already has been done by GSOC.</p> <p>I would retain the current structure of GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.</p></speech>

The only observation I can take from her submission is that the role of investigating misconduct by garda&iacute; should be assigned to GSOC.  I do not think that is a particularly shocking statement given the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  Should a serving member of the Garda be seconded to GSOC or how else might we provide GSOC with the necessary expertise?  Should we provide it with retired members of the Garda or would it be the case that somebody could make a career change, never to return?</p></speech>

In terms of where GSOC may get policing experience or policing knowledge, we would think that for the sake of independence and objectivity, it would be preferable not to have serving members of the Garda seconded to GSOC.  However, it would be open to GSOC to employ members of the Garda or other policing services who may have retired recently and have recent policing experience.  That may be beneficial.</p></speech>

One of our imperatives under our transformational programme is to identify the training priorities required for all of our members.  We are focused on getting that up and running quickly, beginning with issues around performance management.  We are introducing a new performance management and accountability framework, and providing training in that regard and in terms of the developmental issues that will arise in that context.  The recent Guerin report made a number of recommendations and an implementation team is considering those broader recommendations and prioritising training requirements, including basic police training such as the taking of statements and keeping up with revised and new legislation.</p></speech>

In my former office, which is now 14 years old, we recruited a number of bright young graduates and sent them on university-based investigative training courses.  They received all of the training that normal detectives would get in forensics and crime scene analysis.  GSOC adapted our training programmes to some degree, as did the Independent Police Commission in London.  There is a body of independent people who can be recruited and, indeed, GSOC has already recruited staff from the Police Ombudsman, which has also recruited back staff who worked for it before subsequently working for GSOC.  I suggest that is a very healthy interchange.</p></speech>

I concur that bringing people in from outside is always a good thing.  Ms O'Sullivan mentioned the internal audit and internal affairs type of structure in the force and spoke about whether that should be moved to GSOC as part of its role.  Perhaps that would not include the auditing element but the investigative element could certainly be considered.  I ask her to outline this in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800007#G00800"><p>In regard to the role of the internal affairs unit, we have a statutory provision for the establishment of a professional standards unit which will carry out thematic audits around policies, practices and procedures.  This is very useful in terms of identifying adherence to policy, practical or procedural issues or any systemic challenges that arise.  The role of the internal affairs section is to pursue any disciplinary issues that may arise in respect of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The disciplinary regulations set out an internal framework whereby members are investigated for disciplinary offences which may not amount to misconduct.  All cases of misconduct are referred to GSOC but the internal framework can deal with disciplinary offences that do not amount to misconduct or malpractice.  We envisage that the role of the professional standards unit in internal affairs would be come more robust to allow us to proactively identify any issues arising and, as happens in other jurisdictions, to allow us an opportunity consider integrity testing among members and identify issues before they become problems.  Where issues arise involving misconduct, malpractice or misbehaviour amounting to potential criminal behaviour, we would refer them to GSOC.</p><p>  I would like to provide more clarity in regard to some of the questions that Deputy Farrell raised earlier.  In regard to the powers of GSOC, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, GSOC enjoys all the privileges and powers of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As Ms O'Loan has noted, the power to search a member's private dwelling or private car is available.  It is important to note there is nothing that is beyond bounds.</p><p>  Before I conclude, I should introduce the team accompanying me.  Assistant Commissioner Donall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in is in charge of the western region.  Assistant Commissioner John Twomey is in charge of the Dublin metropolitan region and traffic.  Both officers have extensive experience in rural and urban policing.  Mr. Cyril Dunne is our chief administrative officer and Mr. Kenneth Ruane is our head of legal affairs.  Together we are leading the transformation programme I mentioned earlier and we can speak further about what we are doing if members so wish.</p></speech>

As I do not have particular knowledge of the area of freedom of information in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I appreciate his enlightening contribution.  Why does he believe a serving member of the force, at any level, should have access to the media?  In a hierarchical structure like the Garda, would it not be more appropriate to go to a senior officer or the press office?  I do not have a particular axe to grind; I am just asking a question.</p></speech>

In the United States it is extremely common and in other parts of northern Europe it is also common, although there are greater restrictions than in the United States.  Section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for a presumption of criminality against any officer who speaks to a journalist.  That is an extremely disproportionate position to take and it threatens the normal interplay between members of the media and garda&iacute;.  The idea that everything has to be referred upstairs is exactly part of the problem that members have been discussing.</p> <p>There needs to be a sense of responsibility on the part of ordinary folk doing a professional job and a recognition that they do so in a public arena.  Section 62 is far too punitive.</p></speech>

It also needs to be managed in a balanced and proportionate way with regard to the rights and privacy of individuals.  This is an important factor that needs to be considered in any amendment to the legislation.</p></speech>

I think of a case, for example, where somebody at an incident scene said that something had happened and described the incident scene in a particular way.  That was reported very widely.  It subsequently transpired that the officer who made that statement had not been fully informed and when all the information became available, there were then suggestions of a cover-up.  I would hesitate to go towards the freedom to speak to the media to the extent that the witness is suggesting.</p></speech>

I note that Ms O'Loan's detailed submission also includes that recommendation.  I am interested to hear the views of Ms O'Loan and of the acting Garda Commissioner.</p></speech>

As it was not mediation, therefore it did not require the consent of the parties.  Officers had to co-operate with the process.  We dealt with rudeness complaints and minor failures of duty, for example, in that way.  Officers were very resistant to it on occasion but the reality was that it was actually a huge learning exercise, like on-the-job training, both for officers and for members of the public.  In the case of members of the public, it was about what they could legitimately expect of policing and for officers it was about the impact on people of the way in which they conducted themselves which may have been off-hand or brusque and which may have resulted from them working a very heavy shift, for example.  Nevertheless, this was interpreted by the member of the public as being rude and not the kind of service to which the public is entitled.  An informal resolution process can actually inform both parties and improve the service delivery by the officer.  Very often, having done this process, the officers in question are quite ready to apologise and very often the member of the public will accept the apology and will say the did not understand it was quite like that.</p><p>  I think it is in the interests of effective resolution of complaints.  The current situation where a garda can refuse to participate and can say he or she is not going to mediate is not helpful to policing here.</p></speech>

The majority of complaints made to GSOC are complaints which we and GSOC would assess as being service level complaints, exactly as Ms O'Loan has described.  They would be behavioural issues as opposed to issues of misconduct or misbehaviour.  There is certainly a lot to be learned from those complaints.  It would be a very positive move if we could come to a form of either agreement or triage.  We have had discussions with GSOC about whether it could triage service level complaints which could be referred back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the consent of the complainant, saying that the complaint would be dealt with.  Line management would deal with the bad behaviours.  Ms O'Loan's point is very important about the learning that emanates from these complaints.</p><p>  I regard the informal resolution process, with consent, as being the next tier.  However, we need to be very careful to achieve balance.  At the last committee meeting there was a suggestion of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vetoing the engagement with the informal resolution process.  We need to find a methodology that allows us to balance the rights of all the individuals, including the complainant and the person against whom the complaint is made, in order to achieve that informal resolution.  In my view, the service level agreement would allow us to have a tiered response to complaints and would make it a much more effective system and free up the resources and the time of the ombudsman commission to deal with the real issues that need to be dealt with such as misconduct, misbehaviour and criminality.</p></speech>

Unlike in the North of Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responsibility for intelligence, security and policing all under the one roof.  The contributors last week made the suggestion that we need more scrutiny similar to international practice.  What are the acting Garda Commissioner's thoughts on the suggestion of this committee having a role in scrutinising the crime and security branch of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces G2, subject to certain restrictions which apply, for example, in Britain or the United States?  There was a consensus that we need to see improved oversight of that area while not interfering in the important work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

The dual mandate for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the security and policing functions is admired by a number of international observers.  It was recently the subject of very positive commentary from a United Nations executive directorate.  It is a very important function which has served the State, the nation and the people very well.  We should remember that at the heart is the safety of communities.  As the Chairman has said, there is a very close correlation between the policing function and the security function, in particular, in the context of local policing on this island and the trust and confidence of the people of the country which has been built up over several years.</p><p>  On the question about oversight of the security side, there is extensive independent judicial oversight which reports directly to the Oireachtas.  It is independent oversight of the range of security activities.  In my view this should remain and it should be strengthened.  I would see it working in the context of the policing authority and then the security function.  I do not see them being incongruent in any way.  They can be complementary and be a support to each other when it comes to accountability, oversight and governance.  The way I envisage it working is that the Garda Commissioner would be accountable to the policing authority in respect of all policing matters and also reporting to the Minister, the Oireachtas and the Government on the security side.  That is the way it works in a number of other jurisdictions, in particular in Scandinavian jurisdictions, and it works particularly well.</p></speech>

The consequence was that under the legislation I had complete power to investigate national security matters.  Because of the interconnect between organised crime and national security, one must think of national security as being more wide than just in terms of anti-terrorist policing.  There can be a big economic threat to national security.  The right for GSOC to look at national security matters, to look at intelligence in particular, which I think seems to be, from the evidence I have read, one of the stumbling points between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is fundamental.</p><p>  When I started as police ombudsman it was anticipated that I would not look at national intelligence matters.  The reality was that it was necessary to do so to do the job.  There is no reason an independent investigative organisation cannot protect national security matters just as well as the police.  The same kind of people do the job and the same kind of vetting levels or protection of information procedures have to be applied.  In particular, GSOC, if it is to do this work, will have to have special intelligence cells, for example.</p> <p>It would be profoundly important - I do not in saying this mean to be in any way disrespectful - that because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can point to national security as a reason for refusing access, this would not viewed by the public as a cover-up.  I believe there is a huge risk of that.  I would commend to the committee, if necessary, an extension of the legislation to make absolutely clear the duty of the Garda Commissioner to provide all material necessary and that the call in terms of whether material is necessary for the investigation be GSOC's.  The responsibility of GSOC then is to prove to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it can protect that information.  This relates back to Mr. Brady's comments about dealing with the press.  It is not possible to do that when dealing with intelligence matters.</p></speech>

There are separate arrangements along the lines I have mentioned in terms of the differentiation between the two functions.  As stated by Baroness O'Loan, where there is a complaint of misconduct, misbehaviour or criminality on behalf of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether or not he or she operates on the security or policing side, it is right and appropriate that GSOC would investigate it.  We may be talking about two different things.  I was speaking about reporting arrangements in terms of the segregation of the policing and security function, which I think is critically important.  Any changes to the Act require careful determination.  In terms of GSOC having primacy in relation to investigations, that applies to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na irrespective of on what side of the organisation they work.</p></speech>

In regard to all of the recent debacles and, in some cases, scandals that have emerged, what are the learning curves for senior management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of dealing with whistleblowers and serious allegations?  I am sure the acting Garda Commissioner has had an opportunity to read the Guerin report, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in relation to the penalty point issues and the scale of maladministration in that regard and the Garda Inspectorate's findings.  What are the lessons for senior management in relation to all of that?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, while these may not always be fully right there will be issues in respect of which we will need to take prompt action.  One of the big learning curves is in terms of the perception of insularity.  We need to engage in much more open collaborative engagement, be willing to discuss matters in a much more open way and demonstrate what we are doing about particular matters.  The team I have brought with me, together with the remainder of the senior management team, are leading the way in transformational change, addressing the issues that have been identified.  One of the big issues is the culture of insularity.  Members will have heard me say before that there must be greater engagement with those who are our critical friends internally and externally.  We must support people in doing that and empower them to come forward and engage with us in a much more open way.  We must ensure we engage, listen, understand and act.  That is key issue for us.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the inspectorate's report.  There are lessons in everything.  What is important for us is that we learn from those lessons and implement the change that is required.  In regard to the Guerin report, we have already started an implementation programme around the broad recommendations in that report.  Deputy Farrell asked earlier about training.  That is one of the issues identified from that report, which we have prioritised.</p><p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we must ensure that we listen, understand and take action as appropriate and that we engage with all of our stakeholders.  We were very fortunate over the past number of years in that we have something which is pretty unique in terms of policing in the context of the strategic human rights advisory committee.  I recently sought to meet with the committee in regard to review of the Ionann report which is now almost ten years old.  It would provide us with a great opportunity to identify what the issues are internally and externally.  Public perception is really important.  We need to restore public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are engaged in doing so in every way we can.</p></speech>

It is reported again today in the media that Sergeant Maurice McCabe is very isolated, unable to attend work and has made repeated complaints about how he is being treated.  I spoke to him today on the basis of the article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I am deeply alarmed by what he told me today in regard to the lack of support from senior Garda management.  Will the acting Garda Commissioner ring him and find out from him what the problem is and deal with the issue?  I ask the her to ensure that matter is resolved today.  In fairness, he has been granted access to the PULSE system, which is welcome.  Sergeant McCabe is at the epicentre of public opinion and represents the change that is necessary.</p></speech>

As I have already said, the main objective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to provide a positive working environment for everybody and to support everybody in going about their job.  That includes all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including members who want to and have brought matters to our attention.  I am aware of the media reporting.  I am also very conscious of Sergeant McCabe's right to privacy in terms of some of the issues reported and do not intend to breach that here.  What I can say is that senior Garda management are very supportive of Sergeant McCabe and are in contact with him on a daily basis.  On foot of some of the media reporting, I spoke today to the interim confidential recipient, Judge McMahon, and have asked him to facilitate and assist us in making contact with Sergeant McCabe's legal adviser to identify precisely what the issues are that we are speaking about.</p></speech>

Some of the witnesses who appeared before us a couple of weeks queried whether the separation of the confidential recipient and GSOC was a good or bad thing.  Perhaps Baroness O'Loan and the acting Garda Commissioner will comment on whether they believe the confidential recipient should come under the auspices of GSOC or if it should be completely separate.</p></speech>

In that situation, I believe it would be entirely appropriate for GSOC to be the recipient and to have a unit dedicated to such whistleblowing activity.  If this were done, the whistleblower would be assured that the person to whom he or she was reporting was independent.  However, one would have to buttress that by the introduction of a duty on managers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal positively with whistleblowers and make it a disciplinary offence not to positively respond to or manage whistleblowing.  There is an article in the PSNI code of ethics, which is its disciplinary code, which makes it an offence not to do this.  If one does a number of things together then this makes whistleblowing possible.</p> <p>Whistleblowing is about improving policing.  Nobody becomes a police officer to do wrong.  Corruption, carelessness and laziness creep in.  I would place it within GSOC with a statutory power.  I do not believe it would be adequate to have a non-statutory recipient of some type outside that, so I would put it within GSOC and then give it the proper powers and the limited remit.  One would not want them dealing with human resource disputes between members and things like that.</p></speech>

It is equally important to point out that under our disciplinary regulations it is a criminal offence if somebody is being bullied, harassed or victimised in the workplace.  That is an important point.  As I said earlier, our aim is to create a very positive working environment and we will certainly not tolerate bullying, harassment or intimidation of any type of any of our members.  With regard to the issue raised, the Protected Disclosures Bill creates an opportunity for us to identify the best mechanism to deal with it, and that will be very welcome.</p></speech>

If I may, I will return to the Deputy's previous question.  I do not think it is enough to deal with bullying and harassment of whistleblowers.  One must also have a function which deals with turning a blind eye - the blue wall where nothing happens when somebody does something.</p><p>  With regard to oversight, my understanding would be that GSOC is responsible to the courts by way of judicial review.  It must be responsible to the D&aacute;il.  There would be a requirement that one does not second-guess the process of criminal investigation and such matters, but I believe parliamentary accountability is the best process for calling to account an organisation such as GSOC.  At present, as I understand it, GSOC reports to the Minister for Justice and Equality, and that is where the accountability lies.  To my mind that is too close a relationship and there is not sufficient independence for the Minister or for GSOC in that arrangement.  There is also not sufficient power for Parliament.  I suggest that there should be a reporting to this committee, perhaps, or to whatever committee is considered appropriate, as well as the responsibility to the courts and to a freedom of information commissioner.  There will be a raft of other levels of accountability also where GSOC is making decisions that might be challenged through other legal processes.</p></speech>

What are Baroness O'Loan's thoughts on that?  Is it something she would agree with in its entirety or something she would consider on a conditional basis?</p></speech>

In the jurisdiction in which I was operating we were subject to freedom of information provisions.  There were special protections for ongoing investigations and the like.  We worked with it and it was challenging and difficult, but it did not compromise investigation.  I think it is a healthy process.</p></speech>

My first question is for the acting Garda Commissioner.  In the first two paragraphs of her written submission she talks about substantial reform, trust, respect, confidence, accountability, transparency and professionalism.  Those are the main points in those paragraphs.  Would she not say that on the ground the opposite has been the case in recent months and that people have lost their confidence and trust in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Many people, both within the Garda and in the wider community, are deeply disturbed about some of the evidence that has come forward from people such as the whistleblowers.</p></speech>

I do not think it is just confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also confidence in the entire administration.  It is very important that we work hard and tirelessly in the context of restoring that public confidence and demonstrating that, as an administration, we are collectively fully committed to addressing these issues and putting them right.  In the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na specifically, we have the programme.  A programme in itself means nothing; the issue is the actions under that programme.  The first thing I did on becoming interim Garda Commissioner was to engage very widely with our internal and external stakeholders.  By that I mean that I met, along with my senior management team, individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in stations.  I considered it very important that in times of turbulence they knew there was strong visible leadership from the top and that the norms, values and standards we expect were being driven from the top.</p><p>  There are almost 16,000 people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including uniformed and sworn members, civilians and the Garda Reserve.  I can give a good example.  Last weekend, at the One Direction concerts which were attended by 250,000 people over three nights, I went to meet and brief our members who were dealing with that.  As I said to them, there are so many things we can do.  People ask me every day if I will go out and refute what is being said.  I do not think it is right to refute what is being said.  The right thing to do is to allow a process to take place where all of the allegations that have been made are fully investigated.  We very much welcome that and will co-operate with the commissions of investigation.  As I told the members both in the rural stations around the country and in Croke Park last week, the public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be restored by them and by the people in our support offices one encounter at a time.  Every time a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages with somebody it is an opportunity to demonstrate the professionalism, dedication, energy and commitment that I spoke about in my opening address.  I firmly believe that is how we will restore public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  From a leadership point of view, it is very important that we provide strong, visible leadership, that we hold people to account and, equally, that we hold ourselves to account for living up to the values and behaviour we expect of our members.  Collectively, we can work together to restore public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The work that is being done in reforming the 2005 Act will help that and support the programme we have already initiated.</p></speech>

Many people have said to me, particularly in recent weeks, that because of all of the shenanigans going on in the justice system between senior garda&iacute;, management and whistleblowers, people have taken their eye off the ball regarding organised crime in this city.  Is that true?  Will there be a big focus on organised crime?</p><p>  The bodies of two people from my constituency were found shot and dumped in a ditch.  There are people who are being intimidated every day by drugs gangs and some of them have said to me that the guards need to focus on these issues.  Can the acting Garda Commissioner give me a commitment today that there is a focus on that type of crime all of the time, regardless of what is going on in here?</p></speech>

The Deputy has agreed to head up some work on this area and we are going to focus on it specifically as a committee.

I know they were from the Deputy's constituency.  I have extended my condolences to those families.  We worked tirelessly to discover and recover the bodies and, unfortunately, bodies were recovered.  Our members worked tirelessly to do that work and it demonstrated our commitment in one sense.</p><p>  The Deputy looked for a commitment.  I am on public record over recent weeks as saying that our determination to tackle drugs, organised crime, terrorism and all their manifestations has not been diminished in any way.  Our members are tirelessly devoted to doing such work.  Since April of this year alone, over the past five weeks, we have seized drugs worth in excess of &euro;29 million, which is evidence of our determination to continue such work.</p></speech>

I will go back to Ms O'Loan.  She stated: "GSOC cannot currently investigate complaints or allegations against the Commissioner."

I am saying that I do not think that I would be capable of operating a system in which the Commissioner was not accountable.  I do not quite know how the legislation emerged in the form that it did.  My anticipation would be that it will probably change.</p></speech>

There is a very low level of informal resolution here."  Why is there a low level of complaints?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.564" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800011#L03800"><p>My understanding is that the legislation says that the officer must consent to the process and that only 1% of complaints here are dealt with in this form because the majority of officers do not consent.  This is something on which GSOC gave evidence.  When I left my post of Police Ombudsman, we had 11% of complains of that nature being dealt with through informal resolution to the benefit of complainants, officers and the service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.565" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800011#L03900"><p>It sounds like low level complaints should be dealt with.  In every other job and position that people work in, 90% of complaints can often be dealt with and buried or got off the pitch, so to speak.  Can Ms O'Loan give examples of places where there is a higher percentage of resolution?  Are there examples of good practice available in terms of how low level complaints are treated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.566" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800011#L04000"><p>I was not altogether satisfied with the way in which it was done because we had to allow police inspectors to do the informal resolution.  We were involved but we had to allow the inspectors to do it but I would have preferred to have done it myself.  We then tried to introduce a mediation process, but I left at that stage.</p><p>  Having said all that, it is eminently possible to devise a scheme whereby these complaints are dealt with.  It is important that where a thing can be dealt with by GSOC, it is dealt with by GSOC.  For the Garda to do so almost inevitably costs more because, I guess, a Garda inspector or Garda superintendent will earn more than a GSOC manager who would do this kind of work.  Also, it would be the inspector, sergeant or maybe the superintendent who would have to deal with it depending on the rank of the officer against whom the complaint was made.  Therefore, it would be cheaper.  It also enables somebody who presents with an apparently very simple complaint to gain trust in the complaints organisation - GSOC - and to present with something more serious because they are testing the system and asking themselves whether they dare bring it to the organisation.</p></speech>

That was not what I meant to say.  My objection was to the presumption in favour of criminality on the part of contact between a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a member of the press without the approval of a senior officer.  The presumption of criminality is the problem.  Relationships with the media need to be managed, as the acting Commissioner said subsequently.</p> <p>I recognise that but they need to be managed in the normal way in which they are managed in every other major social organisation and that is through disciplinary controls rather than through the automatic presumption that this is a criminal matter.  What I was trying to say was that was disproportionate.  I hope I have made my point clearly enough.</p></speech>

It is seen universally by colleagues who talk to me as a problem, as a body set up in order to prevent information being distributed.  I have never dealt with it but my students have and they have come back with basically an extremely negative experience.  There should be greater contact between members of the Garda and the media, but not centralised.  It cannot be centralised in the way the Garda press office is.  It does not happen elsewhere, as far as I know.</p></speech>

As previous speakers said, we have had hearings attended by other groups.  I would like to ask the visitors for their views on the thoughts of, and presentations given, by previous groups.</p><p>  I would like to ask Baroness O'Loan a question.  Before GSOC's attendance at this committee, it made a number of public pronouncements in the media and to other committees on high levels and low levels of co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and itself in terms of interaction in investigating complaints by members of the public.   What was her experience in Northern Ireland when her office was established?  Did she experience that and, if so, how did she deal with it?  In fairness to GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that is an issue with which they are both dealing and they are working to try to bring themselves closer together, which is good to hear and is in the public interest.  Did Baroness O'Loan experience that and, if so, how did she deal with it?  What were the results?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.578" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Nuala O'Loan" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800012#M00600"><p>I have published a number of reports in which I have commented on the level of co-operation I received at different times and in different investigations.  Sometimes it was good and sometimes it was not.  I had something which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission does not have, which is that I had a statutory right to such information as I required.  That was enormously important because when the police said to me, "You cannot have this, it is not relevant and we do not have  it", I always had the right to go back and say, "My test, my choice, my search", and that was profoundly important.</p><p>  The discussion should not be about whether there is an entitlement to look at material which may be relevant to the investigation because the police will not know precisely what one is investigating when one is investigating police officer wrongdoing and, therefore, it cannot judge the relevance of the material.  It can judge the sensitivity of the material but that is a completely separate argument.  </p><p>  I was disappointed to read the recent comments at the previous session at which the Garda ombudsman commissioners gave evidence that there still seemed to be problems in this context.  I would have expected that, nine years on, these matters would largely have been ironed out and that there would have been a process through which information would transmit seamlessly and in a timely fashion.  It is a problem for every independent investigative organisation and it is one which can be, and should be, solved.</p></speech>

In other words, how well resourced was her office in terms of the complement or size of the PSNI as against the resourcing of GSOC and the capacity it has to do its job in the context of the size An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

That required a level of staffing and a level of resourcing which is far greater than that which GSOC has at present.</p><p>  When I started there were 13,000 RUC officers and when I left, there were somewhere in the region of 7,000 to 7,500.  I had somewhere of the order of approximately 150 staff.  If one is to do the job, one must be resourced.  My suspicion is that at the moment, there does not seem to be sufficient resources for GSOC to do the job it is charged with doing.  However, I would have to qualify that by saying, I would have to go away and do a clear analysis before I could make a very much more definitive statement.</p></speech>

I am not asking them for their personal opinions but for their collective view as a management team.  I refer to the establishment of the independent policing authority.  I am asking them about this because we all have an open mind on it, we are on a journey and we are trying to arrive at a consensus on how we set up the nuts and bolts of this new independent organisation.  What is their view on the board of the independent policing authority, on its make-up, its complement and its components, for example, civil society groups, the Oireachtas and local authorities?  Have they any views on the membership of it?</p></speech>

We agreed to engage constructively to continue that improvement.  That is important in terms of managing the relationship and to put that on record.</p><p>  In regard to the independent policing authority, as I said in my opening address, it is very welcome and I think it will lend itself to independent objective oversight.  The composition of the committee is a matter for the Legislature.  As the Deputy quite rightly said, we have discussed it as a collective management team because what we are very determined to do is to ensure that our layers of governance and accountability are revised and renewed to provide a level of readiness to service the needs of the new authority.  In terms of its make-up, I think it should be as extensive as possible in terms of representation but again, I know that is a matter under determination by this committee and by others, so I would leave that up to the people determining it.  However, we will certainly very much welcome it.</p></speech>

We are very engaged with the inspectorate in terms of doing that.  That is a very welcome review which is looking at the structures, the systems and the processes and it will go down all the way to numbers.  In terms of what we are doing ourselves, part of the work we have undertaken is to look at the revised governance and accountability, so that will certainly take account of responsibilities and how they should be shared out to provide the level of openness and transparency I just mentioned.  We are very engaged with the inspectorate in helping it to conduct its review, as are all of the staff associations.</p> <p>We look forward to that and we think it is quite timely.</p></speech>

At any time since Ms O'Sullivan has taken up the position of acting Garda Commissioner or in her role in the latter weeks and months of her predecessor, Commissioner Martin Callinan, did any member of the senior management telephone, write to or communicate with Sergeant Maurice McCabe to tell him he is a valuable member of the force, a valuable employee and that the force cared about him?</p></speech>

He has been afforded every support, including that of the welfare services.</p><p>  The Deputy asked me a specific question earlier.  Rather than tell an assistant commissioner not to meet him, I sent an assistant commissioner to meet him and to provide him with some reassurance.  That is my understanding of what has been done.</p></speech>

In the context of matters that Mr. Ronan Brady raised, and I know it is not specifically about freedom of information but of serving the public interest, it is the right thing to do.  I know that Mr. Brady referred to centralisation but it is important to say that not only does the Garda have a centralised press office but also local people to deal with local media.  It is a very useful mechanism for connectivity with people.  As part of the renewal programme, we have a pillar around communications and renewed communications and a strategic communications plan. I do not like to speak of communications in those terms but let me explain what it means.  It means reaching out to people through new mechanisms in media, such as social media and new ways of connecting with people.  All of the measures combined contribute to the openness and transparency I spoke about in my opening address.</p></speech>

It is very welcome.  I am sure as head of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Ms O'Sullivan was embarrassed to read the story in the <i>Irish Independent</i>and in the media in general.

I was interested in Ms O'Sullivan's remarks and the way she tied them to her comments on local policing committees.  Many recommendations were made for having a broad representation in the context of the independent policing authority and that part of it should be some form of civic oversight.  Whereas the local policing committees appear to be relevant in terms of accountability, as Ms O'Sullivan indicates, that may not mean the same things as oversight.  Would Ms O'Sullivan comment on whether the members of civil society who are part of the local policing committees would be appropriate potential candidates for the independent policing authority?</p></speech>

As I have said, we must be accountable to national bodies but equally it is extremely important that we must be accountable to the communities we serve.  The joint policing committees and the local policing fora have been instrumental all over the country in terms of identifying local issues and using a joint problem-solving approach to actually solve the problems.  That should continue and be strengthened in the new Act.  It is how we provide a responsive policing service to all of our communities.  It is important to have inclusive representation from all aspects of the committees but, as Deputy Collins says, without becoming over wieldy or too large.</p></speech>

Under the Act, GSOC is restricted from expressing an opinion on the merits of Government policy or when a Minister is giving evidence, does she think this should be amended or charged?  This may be relevant to the point made in her presentation about improving policing, as GSOC does not have the right under legislation to make recommendation for change.</p></speech>

It would have to be within the remit.  The reason I asked the Senator to clarify her question was because I was not quite sure what it was.  I think it is profoundly important that GSOC can look at police policy in practice and comment on it.</p><p>  If the Government is deciding to spend X% of its policing and security budget on an aspect of policing, such as renewing all the fleet, is the Senator asking if that is a matter on which GSOC should comment?  I am sorry, I do not think I have clarity on what the Senator meant.</p></speech>

We greatly value the insights we have gained from the witnesses.  I wish to address a question to the acting Garda Commissioner, to Baroness O'Loan and I have a general question.</p><p>  At the last set of hearings I asked about the Garda whistleblowers charter.  Before the departure of Commissioner Callinan, I had written to him requesting a copy.  The AGSI, which was represented at the last hearing had a copy of the charter but it was not sure if it was accessible to the public.  I may have asked the wrong person in the past.  Is the charter publicly accessible?  Should it be publicly accessible?  Should it extend not just to serving garda&iacute; but also, for example, to police doctors or to those who are not serving members of the force but are working in Garda stations, and therefore are privy to internal police practices?</p></speech>

Should we consider having a one-person Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in the context of the overall reform of GSOC?  As the first Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, did Baroness O'Loan find it helpful to be the person in whom the entire identity of the office was located or would a tripartite model be better?  Does Baroness O'Loan have a view on the matter?</p></speech>

I did not find this a disadvantage, however.  On the contrary, it was clearly an advantage to me because one of the problems with people wanting to complain about anything, whether their shampoo or policing service, is that they do not know how to do so or where to go to do so.  That people could identify an individual as the policing ombudsman made for much better accessibility in respect of the office.  From that perspective, the one-person model was beneficial.</p><p>  I also took the decision to be out and about in the community.  I took a policy decision that I would always allow anyone who wanted to come into the office to do so at any time.  If I was free, I would speak to people, although that is difficult when one is trying to run a busy diary.  This was, however, an issue of accessibility.  </p><p>  Different people will make different policy decisions.  The three or five person model has advantages in that the burden is shared and one has a deputy if one falls ill.  These are advantages.  It is a matter for the Legislature to make up its own mind on the issue, as there is not necessarily a right way of approaching it.  The people of Northern Ireland were served well by having one ombudsman.  Further, ombudsmen are usually single individuals rather than commissions.</p></speech>

In my terms of reference, at least an element of the appointments process should be by open competition.  I envisage the political parties having a vested interest and it may well be that they will legislate for some members of each party to be on the authority.  One must guard against politicising policing.</p></speech>

Would it be a good idea to bring them together?</p><p>  Ms O'Sullivan suggested that Garda internal affairs and the Garda professional standards unit be aligned.

Any issue that would be identified by internal affairs or the professional standards unit that involves misbehaviour, misconduct or malpractice on the part of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be immediately referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  That is how we envisage the process would work.</p><p>  On disciplinary issues, some of the issues identified in the Guerin report, for example, a lack of file management and matters that may not amount to misconduct but include the types of issues identified by Baroness O'Loan, including apathy or laziness, would be dealt with in the internal disciplinary framework.  Appropriate interventions would be taken in terms of training and these would need to be satisfied.  If any indication or insinuation of wrongdoing were identified, it would be immediately transferred or referred to GSOC for investigation.  That is how we envisage that process working.  This approach would allow us to be much more proactive and I envisage that it would work very much with our occupational health department.  This will involve looking for issues that require interventions at an early stage and being able to work on the policy, process and systems side with professional standards, and on the people side with internal affairs.  </p><p>  The Deputy asked about the Garda Inspectorate.  As I noted in my opening statement, the independent policing authority, in conjunction with the Garda Inspectorate and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, provide a type of tripartite oversight, which will, I believe, ensure public confidence and enhanced accountability.  In respect of some of the questions asked, it is equally important, in terms of reinforcing public confidence, that these bodies are also seen to be demonstrably accountable.  </p></speech>

It may also include matters referred to in chapters 1, 20 and 23 of that report.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Purcell and his colleagues.</p><p>  The format of the meeting will see Mr. Purcell invited to make an opening statement, which will be followed by a questions and answers session.  Mr. Purcell has supplied members of the committee with a detailed opening statement, but I understand he intends to read from a shorter version at this point.  We may raise other issues during the course of the meeting.  As we have already had a long session, some two and a half hours, Mr. Purcell will excuse us if we seem a little tired.  It has been a long day so far.</p><p>  Before beginning, I draw the attention of witnesses to the position in regard to privilege.  They should note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should also be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Mr. Purcell to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

My aim is to be as helpful as I can in their deliberations.  If they will permit, I will add a few key points.</p><p>  As the committee is aware, recent events have led to the establishment of the Fennelly commission of investigation, which will have an opportunity to hear from all sides regarding what was an unprecedented, complex and difficult matter.  A further commission is to be established following the publication of the Guerin report.  In addition to these inquiries, the Government has outlined a comprehensive system-wide reform plan that represents a sea change in the way policing will be delivered.  This process is being led by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who has announced a number of measures.</p><p>  Legislation is being prepared to establish an independent Garda authority by the end of this year.  This is a major reform initiative that will transform the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government.  In future, Garda Commissioners will be appointed following an open competition.  This process will be undertaken by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and means that the post of Commissioner will be filled with regard to best recruitment practices.</p><p>  Legislation is being drafted to strengthen the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  As the Minister has stated, the measures in prospect will bring the Garda Commissioner within the scope of the complaints that can be dealt with by GSOC and increase the capacity and remit of GSOC to initiate reviews of Garda practice and procedure without reference to the Minister.</p><p>  The Garda Inspectorate is to carry out a follow-up review of the Guerin report, covering serious crime investigation, management and operational and procedural issues, taking into account the implementation of recommendations already made by the inspectorate in earlier reports and also work currently under way by the inspectorate.</p><p>  Crucially, the Protected Disclosures Bill, as introduced by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will include provisions to enable a Garda whistleblower to report concerns to GSOC for independent investigation.  This will mean that Garda whistleblowers will, from now on, have a strong legal framework within which to report concerns, strong legal protection against penalisation and the opportunity of a fully independent legal examination of their concerns.</p><p>  A review of the performance, management and administration of the Department of Justice of Equality will also be undertaken by independent experts before the summer recess.</p><p>  These measures are designed to transform oversight and accountability and, taken together, will constitute a fundamental change in the way the Garda is managed and relates to the Government and the Department.</p><p>  As I outlined in my statement, the Department has a broad remit.  On the Garda side, the Department's purpose can be said to be one of supporting the Garda on the one hand and seeking to achieve appropriate accountability to the Government on the other.  The context for all of this has evolved over decades when the very existence of the State was under threat.  It is now clear, and the Department recognises fully, that the arrangements for dealing with Garda whistleblowers did not prove fit for purpose.  In so far as that may have involved shortcomings on the part of the Department, I have no hesitation in apologising to all those who have been affected by those shortcomings, including the whistleblowers themselves.</p><p>  In considering the issues before the committee, we need to consider the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which is the framework provided by the Oireachtas within which the Department and Garda operate.  The Act distinguishes between the roles of the Minister and the Commissioner, the Minister being responsible for policy and direction and the Commissioner being responsible for independently running the force.  The framework includes independent oversight by GSOC and independent inspection by the Garda Inspectorate.  It also provides for the role of confidential recipient.</p><p>  The tools in the Act provide for the Commissioner to account to the Government and Minister through the Secretary General.  There is a duty on the Commissioner to keep the Minister and Secretary General fully informed on various important matters and the Minister is in turn accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>I say this not to seek to pass the parcel but rather to point to the complex web that exists to ensure the operational independence of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while at the same time ensuring accountability.  The extent to which this framework has worked or not worked, and why, will no doubt be teased out by the forthcoming commission of inquiry.  In fairness to the staff of the Department, I have to make clear my belief that we were at all times motivated by one thing alone, which was to act in the public interest within the law.  In that context, I believe that we acted in a reasonable manner within the structures in place at the time.  A lot has worked.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had notable success on the crime detection and security fronts.  Some things have not worked and we may have been slower than we might have been in responding to those.</p><p> The truth is that the structures put a lot of reliance on the relationship between the Garda Commissioner and the Minister and Department.  Given the sensitive issues being dealt with, mutual trust and confidence is and has always been crucial in this relationship and this has been built up over a long period of time, not during the term of any single officeholder.  The legislation provides for a duty to account and to provide information supplemented by the independent oversight mechanism of GSOC.  We do not have a separate investigative set-up in the Department.  It is always a challenge in dealing with complex agencies to avoid &ldquo;regulatory capture&rdquo; and this is where lessons can be learnt as we, collectively, consider what enhanced structures and processes should now be put in place. </p><p> This raises the legitimate question of whether over a long period we could have done better in learning lessons and improving Garda accountability.  Yes, we could have done.  I cannot say that we have always, at all times, achieved a perfect balance in managing critical policy and operational issues across the huge range of justice and equality responsibilities.  Most assuredly, I acknowledge that the Guerin report has given rise to a grave situation which I must devote my utmost effort and attention to resolving though specific and targeted changes.</p><p> Some of the relentless criticism of the Department and the excellent people whom I have the privilege to lead as Secretary General is not well founded.  I recognise, however, that confidence in the Department has been damaged and must be quickly restored.  There is in the Department a determination to change what needs to be changed and to turn recent events into an opportunity to learn key lessons and put them into action.</p><p> As Secretary General of the Department, I hope to engage with members of the Committee to explain matters as best I can.  I also look forward to the outcome of the committee&rsquo;s current consultative process in contributing to the ongoing work to identify the best way to address the weaknesses that have been exposed.  Having said that, and as I have explained in my written statement, I hope members will understand that I am somewhat constrained in what I can deal with.</p><p> I fully appreciate these matters are of legitimate interest to committee members.  The difficulty is that, although it would be much easier in many ways to come in here today and fully answer their questions, I must respect the fact that the Fennelly commission has to undertake the work it has been charged with by the Government and these Houses. </p><p> The Government has also decided that a commission of investigation will be established following publication of the Guerin report so some constraint must also be applied to those issues.  The commission in that instance has yet to be established and its terms of reference have not yet been fixed.  I will, therefore, try to assist the committee as best I can on the issues Mr. Guerin raised about the Department but I hope it will understand that it may not be possible as yet to deal in detail with matters which must be left to the commission of investigation.</p><p> The report raises fundamental issues about the statutory framework and various agencies of the justice system, including the Department of Justice and Equality.  Of course, the nature of Mr. Guerin's review meant that he did not find himself in a position to comprehensively address these broader issues.  Presumably because of the timescale involved and because his primary purpose was to consider whether a further inquiry was necessary, at which all parties would have an opportunity to present their cases, he did not seek any views from the Department or the Minister on why it responded as it did to the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe.  Neither, for reasons which he outlined, did Mr Guerin have the benefit of the GSOC perspective on these matters.  Inevitably, this means that the legal analysis contained in the report and the understanding of the policy issues involved are incomplete.  The commission of investigation will provide an opportunity for these to be teased out fully.</p><p> As he emphasises in his report, the purpose of the review was not to make any findings of fact or to determine any disputed question either of fact or law.  Mr. Guerin questions the lack of formal submissions, etc., to the Minister.  In hindsight, the lack of such material which, had it existed might have been of assistance to Mr. Guerin, is regrettable, although this reflects a practice that Ministers might often be briefed orally on particular matters and draft replies prepared in line with that briefing.  It is, however, absolutely the case that the Department and the Minister were aware of the ministerial functions, scope and limitations of the provisions in sections 42 and 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and of the functions and provisions of the confidential recipient regulations.  The Department had a very detailed and nuanced understanding of these legal provisions which I will go through in detail.</p><p> I accept that the record keeping meant that Mr. Guerin does not have the full picture of the thinking in the Department on the action it took and the advice it gave or, indeed, of the then Minister's thinking.  I emphasise that before all of this came to light and as part of a review of risks around communications, information and records, I commissioned an internal project which is well under way to address our record keeping and other related matters. </p><p> It has undoubtedly been the practice of the Department and successive Ministers to place considerable reliance on what they are told by the Garda Commissioner of the day.  There are obvious reasons for this.  The Government appoints a Garda Commissioner because it has confidence in her or him to run the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whose functions include detecting crime, preserving law and order and national security.  If the Department or the Minister were not in a position to place such reliance on what the Garda Commissioner said, this would have the most serious implications.  By law, the Garda Commissioner has the function of directing and controlling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He or she is also responsible for the maintenance of good order and discipline within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> There is a further crucial point which does not appear to be analysed in the report.  The Minister had been advised by the Garda Commissioner in his report that the investigations into Sergeant McCabe&rsquo;s substantive allegations had been based on earlier reports made to the confidential recipient.  The Minister and the Department, naturally, knew of the provision in the confidential recipient regulations providing that all allegations made through the confidential reporting mechanism have to be notified to GSOC, in accordance with arrangements agreed with GSOC, and would have been conscious of the rationale for this, namely, that GSOC would have knowledge of the allegations and the response and could initiate an investigation in the public interest under section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 if it thought it appropriate.  This was, as it was intended to be, a substantial reassurance for the Department and the Minister on the existence of independent oversight in relation to the investigation of the allegations.  This is aside from the fact that the Garda files on these matters were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed no prosecution.</p><p> Neither the Department nor the Minister is an investigatory body or has investigatory powers.  The Minister does have powers under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to require the carrying out of investigations, but it is important to understand the detail of those powers in order to analyse Mr Guerin&rsquo;s key findings in relation to the Minister and the Department and I will be happy to expand on this, in so far as I can, for the committee&rsquo;s information.</p><p> None of what is set out here is intended to minimise the difficulties which have arisen.  We had already recognised that the legal provisions for dealing with whistleblowers were proving inadequate and that there should be a mechanism for complaints to be made directly by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to GSOC.  It is intended simply to set out why the advice which was given and the decisions taken within the Department were considered reasonable given the structures in place at the time.</p><p> As I stated in my letter to the clerk of the committee, I will be happy to return at a future date to discuss these issues in detail with the committee when the various commissions in being and to be established have issued their findings.</p></speech>

Several issues arise from it and from his correspondence with the committee.  As he is aware, the committee wrote to the Government at the time requesting that, among other things, the circumstances leading to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner be referred to the Fennelly commission.  The committee reserved its right to revisit these issues any time.  We recognise that under the terms of reference we cannot follow what is happening in a court or tribunal.</p> <p>However, this is neither a court nor a tribunal but a commission of investigation, which is different.  It is not mentioned in the terms of reference.  Even though there were numerous opportunities to change standing orders over the years, that did not occur.  I maintain that we are perfectly within our remit to raise questions with respect to that issue, even though the commission is inquiring.  The reason we are concerned is that it is a matter which in our view could be cleared up very quickly and easily and which should be.  This is a forum where it could happen and where Mr. Purcell could inform the committee very clearly and in plain English what exactly happened on that night.  I invite him to do so now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.646" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800017#R00200"><p>I have said already that I wanted to make it clear that in my appearance before the committee I am anxious to assist in every way I can with the matters raised in the invitation.  However, as I have indicated, I am precluded from discussing certain matters.  I have said already that I am quite happy, at the appropriate time after the commissions have reported, to discuss it in full with the committee.  I have sent a copy of the letter I received from the Fennelly commission for information.  I drew the attention of the committee to the fact that the commission states it will treat my reply and my statement in confidence, save to the extent that it may be required under the provisions of the Act, particularly section 12, to disclose them or to include them in its reports in accordance with section 32 of the Act.  Further, the commission's letter refers to section 11 of the Act stating that, subject to certain exceptions, it requires the commission to conduct its investigations in private.</p><p>  The committee's letter makes it clear that they intend for me to give my evidence in public.  Accordingly, any inquiry by the committee which impinges on paragraphs N and O of the commission's terms of reference - or, indeed, any of the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission - is highly likely to undermine and prejudice the work of the commission and will run counter to the commission's procedures to conduct its investigation in private.  It would also mean that I would be giving evidence in public and in advance of any other witnesses relevant to the Fennelly commission who would be giving their evidence in private and who would already have heard or read any evidence that I gave in public if I did so.</p><p>  I have already mentioned the Oireachtas standing order to which the committee referred, which states that a matter may not be raised in such a way that it appears to be an attempt to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal.  I acknowledge that although the standing order does not specifically refer to a commission of inquiry, because the standing orders predate the 2004 Act, the intention is clear.  Accordingly, I asked the committee to take this into consideration and to refrain from inquiring on any matters that impinge upon any of the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  Having regard to the above, the committee's own terms of reference cannot be used to undermine or prejudice the specific remit given to Mr. Justice Fennelly by way of resolution passed in the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into matters within its terms of reference.  The terms of reference of the joint committee on justice, with its remit of inquiring into the administration of the Department, cannot be used to undermine or prejudice the Fennelly commission's work, a task given to it by the Oireachtas.</p><p>  Furthermore, on the matter of the Guerin report, the Government has decided and made public its decision to establish a commission of investigation under the Act to investigate the issues identified by Se&aacute;n Guerin in his report as warranting further inquiry.  As the establishment of the commission is imminent, I am deeply concerned that my giving of evidence in public to the committee at this point would in the same way potentially undermine and prejudice the work of the intended commission.</p><p>  I stated in my remarks that I regard the Guerin report and the proposed commission of investigation in a slightly different light, although I remain very concerned about my giving of evidence in public to this committee or, indeed, anywhere else where I might be asked to give it, as it has the potential to prejudice and impinge on that commission of investigation, the establishment of which is imminent.  However, I am prepared to answer questions relating to the Guerin report to the best of my ability, but I ask the Chairman to give me some leeway, in the context of how I may answer the questions about the Guerin report, to take account of the issues I have raised.  My position is clear with regard to any issues that are covered by the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  I have circulated the letter I received from Mr. Justice Fennelly in respect of that matter.  Members of the committee will have had an opportunity to read it and to consider it.  </p><p>  I have never before found myself, and I hope never again to find myself, in a position where in any way I might be seen to be anything other than the absolute maximum of assistance to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but I think this is a rather unusual position to be placed in where a commission of investigation chaired by a Supreme Court judge has been established whose work is already under way.  It seems to me to be a rather unique situation in that what could be seen as a parallel inquiry is proceeding while I am being asked to give evidence relating to matters covered by the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  I am unfortunately in a position where I have to say I simply will not be able to answer questions relating to that matter.  I hope that the committee will understand the difficult situation in which I find myself.  I appreciate the point made by the Chairman and I reiterate my commitment that at such a time as the Fennelly commission completes its deliberations and produces its report - regardless of the outcome of that report and whatever findings it may make - I will be quite happy to come in to this or any other committee to discuss any matters of relevance that the committee seeks to inquire into.</p></speech>

Our advice is that the commission of investigation rules do not preclude the committee from looking at any of these matters, nor do they apply to this committee.  We received this advice today in advance of the meeting.  There are numerous ongoing investigations into the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have seen the retirement of a Garda Commissioner, the resignation of a Minister and a number of other issues which need to be dealt with.  Mr. Purcell will excuse members of the committee and myself for being extremely concerned about what we have seen and what we have heard to date.  That is the reason we were glad to have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Purcell this evening in order to attempt to clear up some of these matters.</p><p>  We are looking for the truth and we are looking for facts - to know what happened on the night that the Garda Commissioner decided to retire and to find out what led up to that decision.  We are advised that this is within the committee's terms of reference and that it concerns the administration of the Department.  I again invite Mr. Purcell to make a statement on that matter and to inform the committee what happened on the night and the sequence of events.  It could be helpful to the tribunal, because the truth cannot change if it is the truth.</p></speech>

In those circumstances, for one person, in this instance me, to be putting into the public domain his account, which others might then have regard to in preparing their statements for the commission, could clearly hamper the approach the commission might take.  It would definitely have the potential to undermine or prejudice the work of the commission.</p></speech>

Section 40 of the Act provides that the role of the Secretary General is to brief the Minister on any matters of accountability relating to the Commissioner's functions.</p></speech>

The answer is yes, I would have met the Commissioner outside normal nine to five working hours .  That, in itself, would not be all that unusual.  The normal course of contact outside normal nine to five working hours would be by means of telephone call.  I do not want mislead, in any way, the committee so what I am saying is that most of the meetings I have had with the Garda outside what would be regarded as normal working hours, I would not have considered all that unusual.  That is the just the nature of the work we do and nature of the hours we both sometimes have to work.  Indeed, it is not just ourselves who work them.</p></speech>

I wish to pose questions in respect of a couple of points he made.  During his presentation Mr. Purcell stated, "Neither the Department nor the Minister are investigatory bodies or have investigatory powers."  My question in that regard relates to issues raised in the Guerin report.  Why was an investigation not undertaken by the Department into the allegations put forward by Sergeant McCabe and, in particular, why was such an investigation not conducted in 2012 when the confidential recipient wrote to the Minister regarding allegations made against the Garda Commissioner?  Such an investigation would be required under the terms of the 2007 regulations, section 8 of which states: "On receipt of such a report, the Minister, unless he or she has reason to believe that the allegation contained in it was not made in good faith or is false, frivolous or vexatious, shall cause the allegation to be investigated or take such other action as he or she considers appropriate in the circumstances."</p></speech>

However, I will try to answer any questions.  As a result of the fact that I must be very careful about what I say and, effectively, because this may be something that will impinge on the workings of a commission of inquiry that is going to be established in respect of the Guerin report, I am going to be cautious but I will provide some detail on this.  The committee will have to bear with me in that regard, even if it takes some time to go into the detail.<br />In the report, Mr. Guerin mentions in his analysis that it is apparent that the Minister was invited to exercise two specific functions.  One was to cause an inquiry to be held under section 42 of the 2005 Act and to cause the allegation to be investigated or take such other action as the Minister considered appropriate in the circumstances.  He commented that:<blockquote>What is important about these specific Ministerial functions is that they enable the Minister to ensure that an investigation, in the true sense, independent of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, can be conducted into matters that might be the subject of a complaint made to the Minister.</blockquote></p> <p>He goes on to state: <blockquote><br />From the papers I have seen, I have had difficulty finding material which demonstrated that the Department identified and understood the significant independent statutory role which the Minister had to perform in respect of these matters.  The practice adopted when matters were brought to the Department's attention was invariably to refer the issues that had been raised to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While it would, of course, be entirely reasonable to expect that, where a complaint is made, opportunity will be given to the person the subject of the complaint to respond to it, it is a different matter altogether to be entirely satisfied by that response.</blockquote>In effect, Mr. Guerin summarises the process of determining Sergeant McCabe's complaint went no further than the Minister receiving and acting upon the advice of the person who was the subject of the complaint.  His conclusion was, for whatever reason, that the approach adopted had the result that there was no independent investigation of Sergeant McCabe's complaints and that there is a cause for concern as to the adequacy of the investigation of the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe to the Minister for Justice and Equality, and a sufficient basis for concern as to whether all appropriate steps were taken by the Minister for Justice and Equality to investigate and address the specified complaints.<br />While Mr. Guerin emphasises at the start of his report that he has not made any findings or determinations, clearly these are critical conclusions.  In analysing them it is helpful to recall key facts and legal provisions.  The allegation against the Garda Commissioner centred on the contention that the Garda Commissioner had been guilty of misconduct for listing a superintendent for promotion who in essence had allegedly been in neglect of his duties by permitting seriously inadequate policing practices in his Garda district.  It might be mentioned here for completeness that promotions to the rank of chief superintendent are made by Government on the basis of the outcome of competitive interviews by a board which under the relevant regulations is composed of two independent persons from outside the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one of whom is the chair of the board and a deputy Garda Commissioner.<br />It is important to note that no direct allegations of misconduct were made against the Garda Commissioner.  They were made against the superintendent in question and, to some extent, against other members.  With the greatest respect, it is submitted that in all the circumstances, the characterisation of the action of the Minister and the Department as merely receiving and acting upon the advice of the person who is the subject of the complaint is open to question.<br />The Garda Commissioner is the person who has the statutory function of directing and controlling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of carrying on, managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  More particularly, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for discipline in the force.  While Mr. Guerin's report now raises serious issues about the nature of the Garda Commissioner's response to the Department, it is submitted that the formal written advice and assurances of the Garda Commissioner to the Minister on the adequacy of investigation into Sergeant McCabe's substantive allegations cannot fairly be characterised as merely taking the word of the person against whom allegations have been made.<br />It was also clear from the Garda Commissioner's response that a substantial file had been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who had directed that there be no prosecutions.  While Mr. Guerin mentions this, he did not discuss its significance.  It meant that the Minister could be assured that the investigation files had been examined independently by the Director of Public Prosecutions who had not directed any prosecutions.<br />As I mentioned earlier, there is a further crucial point which Mr. Guerin does not appear to analyse in his findings.  The Minister had been advised by the Garda Commissioner in his report that the investigations into Sergeant McCabe's substantive allegations had been based on earlier reports made to the confidential recipient.  The Minister and the Department naturally knew of the provision in the confidential recipient regulations providing that all allegations through the confidential reporting mechanism have to be forwarded to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, as explained earlier, and would have been conscious of the rationale for this, namely, that GSOC would have sight of the allegations, and the response, and could initiate an investigation in the public interest under section 102 of the 2005 Act if it thought it appropriate.  This was, as it was intended to be, a substantial reassurance for the Department and the Minister on the existence of independent oversight regarding the investigation of the allegations.<br />The Minister was faced with a formal written assurance by the Garda Commissioner of the position regarding the superintendent on which he placed reliance to an extent successive Ministers would be likely to have done, augmented by the fact that the DPP had been involved in the matter and in the context where GSOC had sight of the allegations and outcome, and could have instigated its own independent investigation.<br />With all that has become known since, it might well have been better if a different course of action had been taken but the Department would say that the advice it gave the Minister was reasonable based on what was known at the time and on the statutory provisions in place, which we have since widely acknowledged to be less than satisfactory.  That is one of the reasons the amendments to the Protected Disclosures Bill are being taken and why careful examination of the powers that relate to the remit of GSOC is under way.<br />If the Minister, despite all these factors, had been minded to cause any further investigation of the allegations, the obvious option would have been for him to refer them to GSOC under section 102 of the 2005 Act rather than cause an inquiry under section 42 of that Act.  Mr. Guerin did not consider this point but, in any event, the Minister would have been faced with two issues in that regard.  First, he would have had to satisfy the tests for referral to GSOC under section 102, namely, that it would have had to appear to him to indicate that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence or may have behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.  This would be happening in circumstances where the Garda Commissioner effectively assured him that the opposite was the case.  Second, the Minister would have been aware that GSOC already had sight of the allegations and the outcomes and could have initiated, but chose not to, its own investigation under section 102 on the very grounds that the Minister would have used to refer the allegations to it.<br />As regards the request from Sergeant McCabe's solicitor for an inquiry under section 42 of the 2005 Act, the crucial difficulty that arose in that regard was the fact that consent was not forthcoming despite repeated reminders to Sergeant McCabe's solicitor to transmit the material to the Garda Commissioner.  While Mr. Guerin acknowledges this, no explanation was forthcoming in the report as to why the consent was not forthcoming, other than references to Sergeant McCabe losing all faith in his superior officers.  No decision could properly be made to establish such an inquiry without the complaints being first put to the Commissioner.</p></speech>

We wrote on perhaps five occasions to the solicitor requesting his permission to refer these dossiers to the Garda Commissioner because in order to make an informed choice regarding whether a section 42 or a section 102 inquiry would be taken, the Minister had to have something other than allegations.  This is not in any way a reflection on Sergeant McCabe but when someone makes allegations, allegations are not facts.  Establishing an inquiry either under section 102 or section 42 is a significant step to take so in that context, some response was required and the only person who would have been in a position to provide that response, other than Sergeant McCabe, would have been the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>  While the point was not reached where a decision was to be made on holding an inquiry under section 42, and acknowledging fully the reality that Mr. Guerin did not find any material containing a specific analysis of that, the Department fully appreciated the existence of section 42 as a potential option but understood also the limitations of section 42.  It had already been noted that in an inquiry under section 42, any information, document or thing provided by a person to that inquiry is not admissible in criminal proceedings.  That contrasts sharply with an investigation by GSOC following a referral by the Minister of a matter under section 102 of the Act or in cases where GSOC was determined to carry out such an investigation because that can be a full criminal investigation.</p><p>  There are other aspects of section 42 which, while not discussed in the report by Mr. Guerin, are important in understanding the potential for its use in inquiring into serious allegations of misconduct.  Section 42 enables the Minister, with respect to any matter considered by him or her to be of public concern, to by order appoint a person to inquire into any aspect of the administration, operation, practice or procedure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the conduct of its members and make a report to the Minister.  On the face of it, that is a broad-ranging power.</p> <p>Indeed, section 42 was amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2007 to extend its scope to the conduct of members and to provide for the compellability of witnesses, in that non-compliance by any person with a section 42 inquiry may be brought before the High Court and treated as contempt.  Crucially however, there is no power to administer the oath to any person appearing before a section 42 inquiry, unlike, for example, inquiries under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts or the Commissions of Investigation Act.  This also is in contrast to the statutory predecessor of section 42, which was section 12 of the Dublin Police Act 1924, which was used in the inquiry into the death of Brian Rossiter that reported to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2007.  The 1924 provision provided that evidence-----</p></speech>

Second, am I correct in understanding that part of the Secretary General's answer to my question as to why the Department did not undertake an investigation in terms of an allegation against the Commissioner was that the Department did not undertake an investigation because the only way of finding out the answers here was to go to the Commissioner himself, even though the allegation was against the Commissioner?  In light of the things the Secretary General is saying, my third question is whether he now regrets he did not undertake an investigation.</p></speech>

This is not the normal situation in which I, as Secretary General, would find myself in front of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or any other committee.  This is not a normal situation.  An investigation was carried out when the complaints were made to the confidential recipient.  The Garda Commissioner would have had carried out an investigation into those complaints.  Once that investigation was carried out, under the terms of the same set of regulations - I think it is section 10 - the Commissioner is then obliged to refer the allegations and the outcome to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, for its consideration in accordance with agreements that are in place.  On top of this, in this particular case something in the region of ten volumes of files were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who directed no prosecution in respect of these cases.  I have outlined this and have tried to be careful, not for reasons of running down the clock.</p><p>  The position in respect of the Garda Commissioner is that an investigation is carried out by someone at chief superintendent level.  It then is investigated by an assistant commissioner in the Garda and a further investigation is taken by a deputy commissioner.  These investigations are endorsed by the Commissioner, who sends back a report and, as I said, at the same time it goes to the DPP.  I referred earlier to the third crucial element of this.  While I am not in any way saying that Mr. Guerin did not look at this, I am saying it is not covered, perhaps because for the reasons he outlined clearly in his report he did not have an opportunity to consider the perspective of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  However, GSOC would have had the allegations and would have had the report on what the Commissioner had done in respect of those allegations.</p><p>  As for the Minister, I outlined how the relationships between the Garda Commissioner and the Minister, the Garda Commissioner and the Secretary General of the Department and the Garda Commissioner and the Department are based on trust.  The Commissioner is responsible for the maintenance of order and discipline within the force.  Neither the Department nor the Minister is an investigatory body.  We do not micro-manage the Garda and the Commissioner has responsibility in law for the operation of the Garda.  The Department and the Minister are faced with a situation if we have reports coming back from the Garda Commissioner regarding matters of serious concern such as these, where substantial investigations have been carried out by the Commissioner, where it has gone to the DPP and where we know it also has gone to GSOC.  For the Minister then to make a decision to establish an investigation under section 102, in circumstances in which the Garda Commissioner is stating there is no breach, no criminal offences and no breach of discipline, effectively one would have a situation in which one could loosely say it is not a commission of investigation one needs but a new Commissioner.  I refer to a situation in which one does not accept the bona fides of the Garda Commissioner, who is charged under statute with the management of the force, in circumstances where there have been three elements - I acknowledge I am repeating myself - namely, the Garda investigation, the files going to the DPP and the papers going to GSOC.</p><p>  One should bear in mind that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is the independently appointed statutory body that has the remit of investigating complaints of malpractice in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As it would have had it, the assurance was there that it had seen the same allegations and had received the report from the Garda Commissioner.  Had GSOC considered that something was wrong, it would have been in a position to take action.  Consequently, in such circumstances, the Minister would have to decide he was not going to accept what the Garda Commissioner had told him, he would be ignoring the fact that the DPP had decided there was no criminal prosecution to be brought, and he would be ignoring the fact he was aware of the position in respect of the body charged with the investigation of complaints against members of the Garda, which is GSOC, not the Minister for Justice and Equality, not the Department of Justice and Equality and not the Secretary General of that Department.</p> <p>Knowing that in those three sets of circumstances those matters had been investigated, the Minister then would have had to say that he did not accept what the Commissioner was saying - the Minister might not have to say that he does not accept what the DPP says because that only relates to criminal offences - and that he was ignoring the fact that the body that is statutorily appointed-----</p></speech>

What I am trying to say is, of course, with the benefit of hindsight I might say that, knowing what we know now, and when we have a situation where a commission of investigation is now being set up, maybe we would have looked at it differently.  Every one of us can be wise with the benefit of hindsight.  What I am trying to say, I suppose, is that I am entirely satisfied with the way this was viewed and the analysis that was done, despite the fact that Mr. Guerin SC said there were no findings of fact.  Certainly, anyone reading the report might say he is pointing in a direction that a proper analysis of this was not done.   What I am saying is that a proper analysis of this was done and, in the circumstances and given the limitations of the structures that were in place at the time, it was reasonable.</p></speech>

Later on in 2012, separately to the confidential recipient, three further dossiers of allegations came to the Department.  It was those dossiers that I was referring to when I mentioned that we were aware that Sergeant McCabe had issues with referring these matters to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Indeed, in some ways, and going back to Senator Zappone's question about whether we have regrets now, of course, as we stated, the procedures and structures in place for dealing with Garda whistleblowers were not fit for purpose.  If one looks at it the whole idea of a confidential recipient receiving in confidence reports from a member of the Garda and then the confidential recipient having to refer it to the Garda Commissioner for investigation by other members of the Garda, while not in any way suggesting that they would not carry out a proper investigation, is, I suppose, what goes to the heart of the changes that are being considered and, indeed, that this committee is looking at.  In hindsight, in response to Senator Zappone, none of us would feel that it is appropriate that investigations of complaints against a member of Garda by another member of the Garda can properly be carried out by carried out by the Garda itself.  I think I have answered the question.  Of course, we do have-----</p></speech>

I am sorry, I am not clear on this point.  Mr. Purcell stated that in September 2013 further allegations were made, this time to the Department, that there was an impasse as to what to do with these as to whether or not they could be sent on to the Commissioner, and that such impasse was not resolved until a letter was received from the Attorney General's office in December 2013, which was a full year and a bit away from the time they were received.  That seems like a very long time.</p></speech>

There was correspondence, going from the Department to the solicitor, asking for permission stating that we needed to refer these matters to the Garda Commissioner.  There was also another issue in relation to when they were originally sent in, that they were saying there were records attached to the allegations, and despite what it said, there was nothing attached and we were inquiring about that.  I think Mr. Guerin SC refers to that in his report.</p><p>  Those letters were going to the solicitor seeking the permission.  We felt that this was necessary because we were aware Sergeant McCabe, in other correspondence, had made clear the fact that he did not think it was appropriate.  In fact, if I am correct, Costello &amp;amp; Co. - I cannot remember the individual solicitor's name - had stated in the original letter that came in with these complaints that they did not think it was appropriate that either the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or GSOC would investigate these matters and that is why they were calling for a section 42 investigation.  They thought the matters were so serious that GSOC could not investigate them.  However, the facts of the matter are that GSOC has the power to investigate anything up to and including deaths.  Those are the circumstances.</p></speech>

It is probably important to remember, and I am sure the committee will recall, that while the allegations had been made there was a substantial overlap in terms of time with a significant number of allegations that were made by Sergeant McCabe about the fixed-charge notice processing system, or the penalty points issue, as it is referred to by some commentators.  Occurring in parallel was the penalty points issue, in respect of which complaints were made and referred to the Garda.  An investigation was set up by the Garda Commissioner and led by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney, who in turn produced what has become known as the O'Mahoney report into the penalty point allegations.  In addition, another report was sought.  The Garda Commissioner referred the report to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na professional standards unit to examine it in conjunction with the O'Mahoney report.  It made a number of recommendations.  The Minister, in addition to asking the Garda Commissioner to investigate the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe in order that he could be satisfied further that a proper and full investigation had been carried out, asked him to examine a random 1% of all cancellations.  That was done by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney.  Following on from that, the Minister referred the O'Mahoney report, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na professional standards unit report and all the relevant documentation to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate so it could examine them to determine whether there was a need for further recommendations.  Subsequently, or around the same time, if I am not mistaken, the Minister referred the O'Mahoney report and the professional standards unit's report to this committee, which in turn sent it to the petitions committee, which held various hearings.  These developments were occurring at the same time as the others.  The report from the inspectorate was produced-----</p></speech>

Much of it concerned the penalty points issue but we did have engagement on the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe on the other matters, which we have considered.  Letters were sent from the Minister to the confidential recipient.  That, in effect, shows that there was consultation.</p><p>  I mentioned earlier that the report stated there was no analysis, and that the documentation was sparse.  This was regarded by Mr. Guerin as an issue.  To be honest, it would have been better had we kept minute details on the notes regarding any conversations that took place in that regard, but to say that there was none is not true.  There was engagement, discussion and analysis.  As I stated, I went into detail explaining the analysis of what was happening.  I refer to the three points - the Garda Commissioner, GSOC itself and the Officer of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p>  Let me make one point that may not be strictly related.  There was a lot of commentary that nothing happened with regard to these allegations and the penalty points issue but, as I have indicated, there were a significant number of developments.  In fact, the report that was commissioned by the Minister from the Garda Inspectorate in one way proved just how independent the inspectorate was.  The inspectorate produced a report that was very hard hitting and damning of the way the fixed-charge processing system functioned.</p></speech>

It sounds as if there was a lot of engagement on the investigation of garda&iacute; by garda&iacute;, with the involvement of GSOC, and that this might have been the main type of work and an analysis that was occurring as distinct from the provision of a sufficient amount of advice to the Minister from Mr. Purcell's Department.</p></speech>

The letter effectively confirmed what had been in earlier correspondence.  I revert to the fact that it covered the allegations that had been considered by the Garda Commissioner in the reports mentioned - the DPP - and had gone on to GSOC.</p></speech>

However, the letter covered the various points that had already been made but gave a little more detail.  There were ongoing conversations on the whole issue of allegations made by Sergeant McCabe.  Some concerned penalty points and some concerned other matters.  It might have been the case that the letter itself did not go directly to the Minister.</p></speech>

The Government announced far-reaching reforms, the most far-reaching of which is the establishment of the policing authority, which will essentially be a watershed in how policing is delivered in the State.  As I outlined earlier, there is also the open competition for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and the extension of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission&rsquo;s remit to include the Garda Commissioner, as well as the removal of time limitations.  The Protected Disclosures Bill will enable Garda members, whether they are whistleblowers or ordinary members, to make complaints to GSOC.  These are substantial reforms.</p><p>  While the commentary in the Guerin report will be considered in some detail by a commission of investigation, obviously there will be considerable discussion in terms of the witnesses appearing before that commission.  Clearly, the reform programme that will be in place will be a highly challenging one.  There will also be a review of how the Department of Justice and Equality is managed, performs and is administered.  This has come in wake of the Guerin report.  This will be a significantly challenging task.  The Minister, and the Government from the Taoiseach down, have given a clear indication they are committed to what the Minister herself described as a sea change in the way policing is delivered.</p><p>  Yes, I believe I am the right person.  I am capable of dealing with this.  Yes, I am fully committed to it.</p></speech>

Mr. Purcell referred earlier to the fact there are several sections in the Department.  What section was dealing with the information coming in from Sergeant McCabe and his solicitors?  Who is heading up that section?</p></speech>

How is that arrived at?  Is the Secretary General consulted on that?  Is the Minister&rsquo;s private secretary consulted on it?</p></speech>

In some instances, if correspondence is directed directly to the Minister, it would go through the Minister&rsquo;s private office and onto a tracking system.  Other correspondence might be referred directly to whatever division deals with it.  In this instance, it was that particular division.  It would then be dealt with and, in the normal course of events, whatever unfolds, it might or might not go to the Minister, depending on the issues involved.  In some instances there could be oral briefings, or files would be sent up without oral briefings.  It all depends on whatever the particular matter at hand would be.</p></speech>

It is the section 102 inquiry I referred to earlier.  The threshold is that the Minister must be satisfied that there may have been a criminal offence committed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a breach of discipline.  That threshold is quite high.  The ombudsman commission has exactly the same power to initiate a section 102 investigation.  That is why I was explaining earlier that we were aware it had the documentation regarding the allegations, which gave some assurance that this matter had been considered by the independent body.  The threshold is quite high.  That was what I was referring to when I was responding to the Senator.  For the Minister to take an allegation or allegations and refer it to GSOC for a section 102 investigation in circumstances in which the Garda Commissioner had already said there was nothing wrong and the DPP had said there was no criminal offence - that rules out the criminal offence element from the beginning - then the Minister would want to be absolutely satisfied that a serious offence was committed to discard the advice of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>  The Commissioner is the person in charge of the force and statutorily charged with maintaining its good order and discipline.  One has to place some credence in a report by a Commissioner.  If one does not believe the report the Commissioner gives, effectively one is saying one does not accept his word on it.  There is a trust element there.</p></speech>

The very fact that the Minister sent a letter to the confidential recipient meant he was aware of what was there.  There would have been some discussions at the time.  It is not always the case that a written submission will go up.</p><p>  One of the outcomes of any situation such as this is that anyone, on seeing anything to do with the matter crossing their desk, will say, &ldquo;Look at that.  Would I normally send it up?  Maybe not, but I am not taking any chances in this instance.&rdquo;  This leads to a massive increase in the number of things flying up the line.  That is an understandable reaction to the situation in which we found ourselves of late regarding these matters.</p></speech>

If the letter comes to me for onward transmission to the Minister, the norm would be that if a response is to go out or if a matter is to be examined, it would not generally go to the Minister until someone had dealt with it and prepared whatever the response was going to be.  If there was an issue that needed to be examined before a response could be issued, the norm would be that this would happen before it would go there, because otherwise a situation would inevitably arise where a letter comes in and the first thing is what is the response.

There are many examples in society where organs of the State carry out parallel inquiries.  One could have the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or one could have the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners carrying out parallel inquiries.  The position Mr. Purcell is taking today is not sustainable or credible because we saw in our terms of reference that the issue of the premature retirement and departure of the former Garda Commissioner would be front-loaded in the commission of investigation.  That was not granted.  The Houses of the Oireachtas also voted a budget of &euro;2 million.  Mr. Purcell could clear up all of this but he has taken this position.  There are so many other factors feeding into the position he has taken.  It is really untenable.  Does he appreciate the significance or the gravity of that?  I am not aware of any other Secretary General who has attended a committee and taken a position similar to that of Mr. Purcell.</p></speech>

I spoke to the former Minister about it, and he told me that under no circumstances would he ever have made comments like that.  I said already that, knowing the Minister as I did, there is no way, in my view, that he would have made the comments attributed to him.</p> <p>There was no way the description being put forward in my mind represented anything the Minister might have said.  The only precise thing I can remember from it is one of the quotes,"If he thinks you're doing that, you're finished," or something like it.  There is no way he would have said anything like this and that is what I found very strange about it.  I thought it was very strange; I could not see how that would have been the case.</p></speech>

How can he reconcile this with the Guerin report statement: "The deficiencies identified in the investigations considered in this review, if they were widely replicated, would be a challenge to public confidence in the criminal justice system itself"?  He considers the Department acted reasonably, but he and Mr. Guerin are poles apart.  Is this the Department circling the wagons?  It is adopting a defence of the realm and now contesting the Guerin report.  What Mr. Purcell maintains in his opening statement is at massive variance with the quotation taken from the report.</p></speech>

There is then a situation where it goes to the Director of Public Prosecutions who says no prosecutions are warranted.  One is assured by the knowledge that it also went to GSOC and that it had the opportunity to consider whether it felt further action was warranted in the circumstances.  Bearing in mind what I said about the relationship between the Secretary General and the Commissioner or the Minister and the Commissioner, it is built on a level of trust.  As I said in my opening remarks, it is a trust that has been built up over decades and a relationship that was built during a period when there was a real threat to the security of the State.  There was necessarily a close relationship which, as I said, did not happen during the term of one single officeholder.  That was how it had developed over a long period.  When one has this, what I am saying is that the response was reasonable.  I do not know, with the benefit of hindsight, whether we would do the same thing again.  Again, a lot of boils down to the level of trust.  However, I go back to what I said.  The programme of reform will ensure this will not happen again because if one has a situation where the remit of GSOC is extended to cover complaints made by garda&iacute; - it was only in particular circumstances that it could do so - with the enactment of the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 which will establish GSOC as the authority that will deal with Garda whistleblowers, it will not arise again.  My own belief is that the most far reaching reform that will be introduced in the packages the Minister is driving forward is the establishment of an independent policing authority that will change on a permanent basis the relationship between the Garda Commissioner and garda&iacute; and the Department and-or the Minister.</p></speech>

While I accept that it is not a comfortable position for me to be in, I can understand perfectly why the Minister would take that approach.

That is the point I was trying to make.  People have genuine concerns about letters hanging around offices for two weeks without a Minister receiving them.  How does Mr. Purcell respond to this?</p></speech>

If the roles were reversed, I would be in exactly the same position, but what the Deputy is asking me is different.  He is talking about a particular letter.  I have said that it is covered in the terms of reference and that I am trying my best to be as helpful as I possibly can be in very difficult circumstances - even in a set of circumstances in which there was no commission of investigation.</p> <p>In fact if there was not a commission of investigation, as I said in my opening remarks, it would probably be easier in many ways just to simply answer the questions.  However, it is not that I am answering the questions, or, as the Deputy believes, not answering the questions, because of some desire to obstruct the work of the committee - far from it.  I think I have gone some considerable distance despite the concerns I expressed at the time in relation to the Guerin report.  I have tried to answer the questions as openly and as fully as I possibly can in the circumstances.  However, I have said what I have to say.  I have told the committee my views in relation to matters covered by Mr. Justice Fennelly's commission of investigation and I am not sure what more I can add to that.</p></speech>

I have already outlined in some considerable detail the various things that happened in relation to the whole penalty points issue for want of a better description: the establishment of the investigation by the assistant commissioner; the examination of an additional random 1% over and above the cases that were mentioned in the allegations that were being made; the referral then of the O'Mahoney report to the professional standards unit in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; following on from that the former Minister's referral of the report to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality; the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality then referring it to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions; and the Minister then referring them to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and the extensive and far-reaching report it carried out not only into the particular allegations but into the system itself.  As I said, at one point during a discussion with Garda associations someone said the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate was not independent.  By God, when it produced that report, it certainly showed for all that it was independent.</p><p>  I think that in itself was a very clear indication that the former Minister and everyone else took these allegations very seriously.  Is it fair to say, and perhaps the Deputy will have a view on this, that nobody took those penalty points accusations seriously?  One should just look at what happened with the penalty points and the various stages.</p><p>  One other thing that I forgot to say was that the former Minister then referred them to GSOC and GSOC at the moment is looking at them.  That is a clear indication of the level of seriousness with which the allegations were taken.  To be honest, in my view it was taken very seriously.</p></speech>

That is not to say that there would not be some contact.  If the Deputy is asking me if the Commissioner would ring the Minister and say, "Listen, I've got something very urgent; I'm sending it through to you", that would be quite unusual.  By the way, I have said I cannot comment on what a previous Minister for Justice and Equality would say.

Does Mr. Purcell believe the detailed written statement which he prepared for today - his detailed rebuttal of the findings of the Guerin report which led to the resignation of a Minister for Justice and Equality - in defence of the Department's role in advance of a commission of investigation is consistent with his other arguments that he cannot comment on the matters to do with the resignation or retirement of the Garda Commissioner, or the correspondence issues he will not deal with, because he does not want to prejudice the Fennelly commission?

I stated this in the letter I sent to the clerk to the committee, I mentioned it in my opening remarks and I said in turn that I had deep concerns about answering questions on the Guerin report.  My view was that the difference with the Fennelly commission is that the commission itself was established and its terms of reference were set out, the judge is in place and he has commenced his work.  He has written to me and, I believe, to others, so the work of Mr. Justice Fennelly's commission is already under way.  The difference between this and the Guerin commission is that, while I still have concerns that by giving evidence here there is a potential that it in turn may prejudice or undermine the commission, it has not yet been established and its terms of reference have not been set out.  It is a problem, and this is exactly what I meant when I spoke about the difficult position I am in when trying to deal with this.  I have set out why I could not answer questions on Mr. Justice Fennelly's commission or anything relating to the terms of reference, and have tried to adopt as open, honest and frank a manner as I can in trying to facilitate the work of the committee.  I am not sure whether the committee is trying to do this, but I almost get a sense that members are saying that because I answered questions on the Guerin report, I should answer them on the Fennelly commission.  By asking about my approach in dealing with questions - and I do not accept the word "rebuttal", but people have different interpretations - I feel the committee is trying to use the fact that I have been open-----</p></speech>

I do not believe that the Department is not fit for purpose.  We have acknowledged, and I am acknowledging now, that the structures that were in place for dealing with Garda whistleblowers were not fit for purpose.  As part of the reforms that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is introducing, the extension of the remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the Protected Disclosures Bill will address that issue.  I cannot see the logic in having a system in which someone goes to a confidential recipient with a problem, only for the confidential recipient to have to have it investigated.  In other words, garda&iacute; investigating garda&iacute;.  It is far from an ideal situation.  It is not fit for purpose.</p><p>  I do not accept the description, even if it was from the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  I did not hear what he said, but I saw the reports.  I do not accept that the Department of Justice and Equality is not fit for purpose.  I might briefly say why.</p></speech>

What legislative or constitutional prohibition is preventing him from giving us a factual account of what happened and telling the truth?  I am not saying he is not telling the truth, but I have great reservations about his hiding behind or giving precedence to a commission that is not yet established while giving second-class treatment to the committee through our Chairman.</p></speech>

I am expressing my genuine concern that, if I answer questions and give witness in public to issues that are covered by the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission, I will potentially be undermining or prejudicing the work of that commission.  In addition, I would be unfair on myself, in the sense that I am giving evidence in public unlike other witnesses who will appear before that commission.  I will appear before it as well, as the committee has seen from the letter that Mr. Justice Fennelly sent to me.  It is unfair on me, although that is not my primary concern.  Rather, it is the potential to undermine or prejudice the work of the commission.  It is nothing else.  In my discussion with Deputy Mac Lochlainn, while he might not have intended to do so, it sounded like he was saying that, by trying to be helpful on the Guerin report, I was effectively undermining my own position in respect of Fennelly when it was-----</p></speech>

Mr. Purcell mentioned the various avenues of investigation in terms of the whistleblower situation, the O'Mahoney report, which has been discredited, and the files sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  Is it not fair to say that the DPP would only recommend a criminal prosecution where the level of evidence was beyond reasonable doubt?  Surely someone in Mr. Purcell's Department or with the former Minister or former Garda Commissioner should have raised concerns that, leaving aside the question of a criminal prosecution arising from the issues raised by the whistleblowers, there was a significant lack of action on the part of someone in the Department, the former Minister or the former Garda Commissioner.  The DPP would only recommend prosecution where a high bar was met, namely, it could lead to a successful conviction.</p></speech>

I will start by saying that we acted reasonably, given the structures in place at the time.  The structures for dealing with whistleblowers were not adequate.  For this reason, they are being changed as part of the reforms.</p><p>  If one examined any of these cases in isolation, one might view it in the way being described by the Senator, but the matters had been investigated by the Garda and considered by the DPP from the criminal offence perspective.  Crucially, they were sent to GSOC under the terms of the relevant section in the confidential recipient regulations.  When the cases are examined together, the action taken was not unreasonable.  As I made clear, we now know that the structures in place for dealing with Garda whistleblowers were not adequate or fit for purpose.</p><p>  I might make the point that I am only referring to the Garda because that is the matter being discussed, but it is probably fair to say that structures elsewhere for dealing with whistleblowers, be they in the Civil Service, the public sector or the private sector, are not adequate.  This is one of the reasons for the Minister, Deputy Howlin, introducing legislation to deal with the situation.</p></speech>

If it was important enough to have come to my attention and I thought the Minister needed to be made aware of it, I would do it.

This information is listed under the heading, Sergeant McCabe's Solicitor Resumes Direct Contact with the Department.  Obviously, various allegations were made by Sergeant McCabe in that correspondence.  Can Mr. Purcell say why the correspondence was so protracted from September 2012 to My 2013?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.1063" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800030#EE02100"><p>I covered this earlier.  The correspondence was protracted because there had been issues with Sergeant McCabe not wanting matters to be brought to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this particular instance, the solicitor acting on behalf of Sergeant McCabe stated specifically in the correspondence that he felt the matter was so important it should not be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  As I pointed out earlier and as the Deputy will be aware that GSOC is the independent statutory body charged with the remit of investigating any elements of wrongdoing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up to and including deaths.  Therefore, it cannot be the case that something is so important that it cannot be investigated by GSOC.  There was a real concern, because of concerns expressed by Sergeant McCabe, that if we were to send the material to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that in itself would become an issue.  It was for that reason that there was protracted correspondence.  Mr. Guerin commented in his report that he did not know why no response was given.  I do not know either why no response was given but no response to the question we asked was given.  While I cannot be exactly certain I think on five occasions we wrote to the solicitor asking for this to happen.</p></speech>

The initial letter contained a reference to some records being attached but there were no records attached.  That was one of the issues queried.  The records which it was stated in the letter were being submitted were never sent in despite requests for them.  I said earlier that there was an overlap between the material submitted at that stage via the solicitor with some of the other allegations and there was also an overlap between the material submitted and material that had been investigated by, I think, the assistant commissioner or, perhaps, deputy commissioner in the context of the internal Garda investigation to which I referred at length when the Deputy was not here.  In that context, all of this was going on during the period concerned.  I also explained earlier that none of this happened in isolation.  At the same time, there was an extensive process in place in regard to what has become known as the penalty points issue, which involved numerous reports and referrals to the Garda professional standard unit, this committee, the petitions committee, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and, ultimately, GSOC.  There was ongoing engagement on that front.</p> <p>The issues relating to Sergeant McCabe all occurred at a parallel time to the issue with the penalty points.  I made that point earlier just to emphasise that it was not the case that nothing was happening with regard to Sergeant McCabe during that period.</p></speech>

Why was that advice obtained?  If Mr. Purcell dealt with that earlier, there is no need to answer but if he has not, I would appreciate an answer.  Second, there is a reference to the advice obtained in paragraph 19.89.  At the same time Mr. Guerin says that he has not seen the advices.  It is a little unusual that he refers to the advices and characterises them without having seen them.  Does he fairly characterise it?  The more important issue is why those advices were sought.</p></speech>

There was a concern that we were not getting anywhere in terms of the engagement with the solicitor for whatever reason.  I do not know the answer to that, but we became concerned about it.  There is a point I made earlier which I will repeat again.  In that particular section of the report relating to the advice, there is a mistake in what Mr. Guerin referred to.  He was referring to the advice being given that the material or the documentation should be sent without further ado, which I think is the phrase used, to the Minister, whereas in fact what was in the advice was that it should be sent to the Garda Commissioner.  I made that point earlier just to clarify things.</p></speech>

As the other committee members will confirm, this has been dealt with extensively.  Despite my concerns about a commission of investigation coming up and the fact that I am here as a witness, I have tried to be as open as possible and tried to be as consistent as possible to the point, as I also said, that I might well be wrong in being as open as I have been with regard to these matters.  I certainly hope it does not come back to haunt me from that perspective.  However, I asked at the beginning to be given some leeway.  I said I would try to answer all of the questions in so far as I can, and I have done that.  I think I have been as open and forthcoming as I can be.</p></speech>

One of the issues in that regard was that we had already had the situation where matters had been investigated by the Garda.  The difficulty and what we had been trying to resolve was the fact that Sergeant McCabe had a problem, and his solicitor had already indicated that he also had a problem, with this going to the Garda, but the advice was to send it to the Garda.  To some extent events overtook what was happening.  The Deputy might recall that the advice was received just before Christmas and from January on we were into the run of appearances by the Garda Commissioner and Sergeant McCabe at the Committee of Public Accounts, then we were almost straight into the allegations of the bugging of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission headquarters and everything that went with that and the establishment of the Cook report.  Then there was the inspectorate report and allegations being made and given to Deputy Martin.  There was all of that.  Essentially, events overtook what was happening.</p><p>  There had been considerable overlap, as I described earlier, but I suppose events overtook it.</p></speech>

The letter that came in on 27 February just gave a bit more detail in regard to the issues that had been investigated by garda&iacute;.  I went into considerable detail explaining how the analysis of the issues was such that we knew the situation had been investigated by garda&iacute; - by a chief superintendent at an early stage, at a later stage by an assistant commissioner and subsequently by a deputy commissioner.  The investigations had been endorsed by the Commissioner who had written to the Minister and in turn, the Minister had written back.  The ten volumes of files were sent to the DPP's office and that office took a decision not to prosecute.  One of the things I mentioned earlier was a crucial point that was not covered in Mr. Guerin's report because, as he outlined in his report, he did not have the GSOC perspective on what happened, namely, that under the confidential recipient regulations of 2007, there is a requirement for any complaints-allegations that are referred by the confidential recipient to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be referred to GSOC, as well as the response to those allegations or complaints.  I use the word "crucial" in this regard because that gave an assurance that not only had it been investigated by garda&iacute; and been sent to the DPP, it had also gone to the one body that has the independent statutory remit for investigating complaints about garda&iacute;.  It was in that context that the whole thing was proceeding.  As I said, that was the reasoning behind this.</p></speech>

There was a lot happening and Mr. Purcell clarified that point earlier.  The issue was not lying idle or being covered up.  I ask Deputy McNamara to conclude as we are running out of time.</p></speech>

Is it normal that such letters would not be furnished to a Minister in the context of the volume of correspondence coming through?  Is it normal that letters from the Attorney General or the Garda Commissioner would not be furnished to the Minister?</p></speech>

It is the case, as I mentioned earlier, that sometimes briefings are given orally to Ministers about particular matters.  There would not always be a trail although, as I said earlier, one of the side effects or consequences of everything that has happened is that there is and will be a significantly-increased volume of things going to the Minister.  People are asking "should that go up?" and are not taking a chance and sending things up the line.  Some things would go through to the Minister while other things would not.  Sometimes there are oral briefings and other times not.  Occasionally, it must be said, sometimes mistakes are made.  I am not saying that sometimes it does not happen that something should have gone on but did not go.  There can be any number of reasons why something would not go.</p></speech>

Is much of this dealt with by way of oral discussion and briefings rather than extensively written instructions, correspondence and so forth?</p></speech>

As I was saying earlier, this ran in parallel with the whole penalty points issue.  That was a very big issue that was going on in parallel to all of this so there would have been discussions internally in regard to what was happening with the various allegations made by Sergeant McCabe.  It was not the case that the particular set of allegations we are now discussing were there, in isolation.  There were other things going on in regard to Sergeant McCabe, particularly the penalty points issue.  Sergeant McCabe and the allegations made by him were very much a live issue.  However, I am not saying that the letter to which the Deputy is referring went to the Minister; I actually do not think it did go.  What I am trying to do here is to set the context and explain that the particular contents of that letter referred back to the investigation that was carried out at an earlier stage which was the subject of correspondence, was examined by the DPP and was sent on to GSOC.  I must make it clear that it was not sent by us to GSOC.  Under a section in the confidential recipient regulations, there was a requirement for the Garda Commissioner to refer the documentation to GSOC.  I am just trying to explain the circumstances.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.1122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014052800032#GG01100"><p>No, I do not think it is accurate to say that and I said that earlier.  I have outlined the extensive action that was taken by the former Minister in regard to the penalty points, including referral to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the establishment of the investigation that became known as the O'Mahoney investigation.  In addition to the Sergeant McCabe allegations being investigated by the O'Mahoney investigation, the Minister also asked the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate a random 1% of all cancellations, other than the ones that were covered by the allegations and that was done.  The matter was also looked at by the Garda professional standards unit which made recommendations.  The Minister then referred both reports to the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which in turn produced a report which, as I said earlier, nailed once and for all anyone's doubts about whether it was independent.  It produced a very hard-hitting report about the actual operation of the fixed charge notice processing system.  On top of that, the Minister referred the O'Mahoney report and the professional standards unit report to this very committee, as Deputy McNamara knows.</p> <p>In turn - and if I am correct - that was then sent to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.</p><p> On top of all that, the Minister subsequently referred the penalty points allegations and all the other reports to GSOC for examination.  That examination is ongoing.  In the context of any statement to the effect that the allegations being made were not taken seriously, if one looks at the course of action which was taken and which I have described, I do not think anyone could reasonably say that these things were not taken seriously.</p></speech>

The first petition for consideration is P00009/13 from Mr. Hugh Rance, calling for an independent process of appeal in the Department of Education and Skills through which a teacher who is employed by a vocational education committee and has been refused qualified pay and incremental credit, can make an appeal against the decision reached by the VEC.  In particular he feels the regulations on the free movement of workers within the EU are not being enforced by the Department of Education and Skills and as a result, he is being penalised financially and the reduction in salary will also have an impact on his future pension payment.</p><p>  The petitioner forwarded further correspondence to the secretariat on 22 February informing the committee that his situation has been resolved as a result of the appointment of a new chief executive officer to the education and training board.  While he gave no details of the solution reached, he has asked that the committee make appropriate recommendations to the Department of Education and Skills on the circulation of circulars that have an impact on the terms and condition of employment and on pay.</p><p>  We have received further correspondence from the Cork Education and Training Board outlining the ways it is dealing with these matters.  We have agreed to forward to the petitioner a copy of the response from the Cork Education and Training Board and then to close the petition.</p><p>  The second petition for consideration is P00014/13 from Ms Ursula Widmer on the medical criteria for disabled drivers and passengers to be granted a concession under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, SI 353.  </p><p>  Members will see from the criteria that if an individual has the use of one arm, he or she is not entitled to this concession.  However, if an individual has the use of one leg he or she is entitled to the concession.  This seems to be extremely unfair as either would necessitate the use of a modified vehicle.</p><p>  It is proposed the committee will take three steps.  First, we write to the Minister seeking information on the reason that the disablement of the loss of one arm does not satisfy the criteria to qualify under the terms of the scheme; second, that we ask for specific information on the difference in disability, in the context of the scheme, between the loss of one leg as a qualifying criteria whereas the criteria for an upper limb disablement is the loss of both the hand and the arm, given that both disablement necessitates the modification of a car; and, third, we will ask whether he has plans to legislate to balance the disparity in the scheme.  Following the Minister's response, we will deliberate further on the petition.</p><p>  The third petition is P00003/14 from Mr. Christophe Krief concerns a breach of European law on competition, freedom of establishment and free movement of workers.  Mr. Krief states the Building Control Act 2007 is questionable, totally discriminatory and in violation of the fundamental principles of European law and the free movement of workers with the EU Community.  The current verdict of the European Ombudsman is that the Building Control Act 2007 is in breach of European law.</p><p>  We have had correspondence on this issue from a number of bodies.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has recently signed into law the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 which came into force in March 2014.  This new law stipulates that only three groups of professions will be authorised to design and certify compliance with building regulations.  The Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists, CIAT, has been excluded for no reason.  This means that Mr. Krief will not be allowed to continue to work in Ireland.  CIAT has prepared a complaint to send to the European Commission.</p><p>  The committee has deliberated on the correspondence from a number of bodies.  As we think the correspondence clarifies the matter, it is proposed to forward it to the petitioner and the petition be closed. </p></speech>

I will briefly outline the outcome of the last Transport Council on 14 March in Luxemburg.  I will then focus on the agenda for the Transport Council on 5 June and run through the main agenda items and some of the important any other business, AOB, items.  I will welcome questions from members.</p><p>  The first Transport Council under the Greek Presidency was chaired by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Networks, Mr. Michalis Chrisochoidis.  Ireland was represented by the deputy permanent representative, Mr. Tom Hanney, and the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Mahony.  The half-day Council reflected the relatively light agenda and was attended by fewer than half of member state Ministers.</p><p>  Among the &ldquo;A&rdquo; items adopted was a decision confirming the position taken at COREPER not to adopt a Council decision or to proceed with further deliberations on a co-ordinated EU position to be taken at the International Maritime Organization, IMO, in relation to implementation of nitrogen oxide, NOx, maritime emission standards.  This amounts to a decision not to exercise shared EU competence in this matter, thereby obviating further proposals by the Commission in the near future.</p><p>  A general approach was agreed unanimously by member states on the European Railway Agency, ERA, regulation and delegations lifted the remaining reservations.  The Commission retained reservations on the final agreement on Articles 21, 22 and 29 regarding the powers of the Commission to act on national rules and findings of national safety authority audits carried out by the ERA; the reduction in the number of Commission representatives on the ERA management board; the procedure for appointment and dismissal of the executive director; and implementing, rather than delegated, powers regarding fees and charges.  The Commission declared its intention to manage these reservations during the debate with the European Parliament.  An almost full table round of interventions focused mainly on preferred next steps on the fourth railway package.  The Presidency&rsquo;s conclusion was not very clear or emphatic about the next steps.  Mr. Chrisochoidis merely noted a &ldquo;constructive approach towards making progress for future negotiations&rdquo; and emphasised the general importance to European competitiveness of reducing costs and improving the quality of railway services.</p><p>  The political position was agreed to on the draft Shift2Rail regulation establishing the joint undertaking for the railway innovation programme under Horizon 2020, without amendments to the final compromise text proposed by the Presidency.  Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and France took the floor to express their general enthusiasm for the measure and indicate final approval for the text regarding the criteria for membership of the joint undertakings.  They emphasised that this allowed for the &ldquo;balanced involvement&rdquo; of all public and private actors.  On the other hand, Austria, Croatia, Slovenia and Ireland did not agree that the participation rules were balanced and, while accepting the final compromise, expressed regret that SMEs, in particular, did not enjoy the same opportunities as others for associate membership.  It remains for the European Parliament to adopt a positive opinion on the text of the compromise before it is adopted.</p><p>  There was a policy debate on the issue of urban mobility which focused on three questions prepared by the Presidency on the basis of a Commission communication on sustainable urban mobility, published in December 2013.  In its introduction the Commission stressed the importance of making urban mobility more sustainable in the interests of improving air quality, reducing the numbers of road deaths and injuries and reducing congestion and its attendant costs.  A decentralised but co-ordinated and non-prescriptive approach was being advocated which respected subsidiarity and supported local authorities, the exchange of best practice and reinforced EU effort where there was EU added value.  An expert group is to be established later this year and the Commission hoped all member states would participate.  All of the member states which spoke welcomed the initiative and spoke positively about its non-prescriptive approach.  The Commission concluded that the focus for work on urban mobility should be on the exchange of best practice among member states and the soon to be established expert group would have a key role to play in this regard.</p><p>  Under the heading of AOB, the main items related to the airports package, clean power and the outcome of the EU-ASEAN aviation summit.  On the airports package, the Presidency reported on the agreement reached with the European Parliament on the noise regulation aspect of the package.  Regarding clean power, the Presidency reported on the ongoing negotiations on the directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure.  The Commission welcomed progress in the negotiations but regretted the Council&rsquo;s lack of ambition regarding the deadline for liquefied natural gas, LNG, infrastructure for ports.  Italy, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Spain, Belgium and Ireland all intervened to emphasise the importance of reaching agreement on the file as soon as possible, encouraging all actors to assume their responsibilities.</p><p>  The Commission reported on the EU-ASEAN aviation summit which took place in Singapore on 11 and 12 February, with participation from ten South-East Asian states.  The Commission stated the region was a key market with half of the aviation traffic growth in the next decade expected to take place to, from and within the Asia-Pacific region.  The summit created good momentum toward a tailored approach to EU-ASEAN relations.  The Commission reported that the preparation of a comprehensive air service agreement would commence shortly.</p><p>  On the Transport Council agenda for 5 June, No. 4 relates to the fourth rail package, an ambitious suite of six EU legislative proposals involving further opening of domestic railway markets to competition, mandatory tendering of public service contracts and updating and streamlining of processes and systems for railway safety and interoperability.  The Council is being asked to reach political agreement on three of the proposals contained in the package, namely, the proposals for directives on the interoperability of the European railway system, safety on the Community&rsquo;s railways and a proposal for a regulation on the ERA.  Concerns that Ireland had about the text of the original proposals have been addressed by amendments agreed to at previous Councils.  Ireland welcomes the measures contained in the proposals submitted to the Council and can support them.</p><p>  No. 5 on the Council agenda deals with the proposal to amend Directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying down the maximum authorised weights and dimensions in national and international traffic for heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, circulating within the European Union.  Ireland fully supports the proposed amendments to allow manufacturers to develop more aerodynamic, fuel-efficient and safer vehicles, which will enhance road safety.  The proposals will give drivers a better field of vision, which has the potential to reduce the numbers of collisions involving vulnerable road users.</p> <p>On this note, Ireland has always stressed the road safety benefits of the proposed revisions to the directive, particularly to Article 9, the profile of HGV cabs, and has consistently argued for a short lead-in period, of the order of five years, on the grounds of road safety.  Ireland is also supportive of the proposed increase in weight of one tonne for alternatively fuelled HGVs, to take account of the heavier Euro 6 engines and battery components and an increase of 1.5 tonnes for all buses and coaches to accommodate the increased average weight of passengers and their luggage. </p><p> Our concern is the Commission&rsquo;s proposals amending Article 4, which are less than clear.  There are differing interpretations of the impact of the proposals on the article and we will reserve our position until it is clarified, particularly the potential impact on bilateral arrangements we have with the UK.</p><p> Agenda item 6 proposes a regulation to open up access to the provision of certain services in ports, such as bunkering, dredging, mooring, port reception facilities, pilotage and towing.  The Irish commercial ports sector largely fulfils the spirit of the proposed regulation and Ireland welcomes its objectives.</p><p> Agenda item 7 deals with common rules on compensation and assistance for airline passengers.  While we are broadly supportive, we have concerns about a particular aspect of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, which is that of compensation in the case of missed connections.  Under the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, the first feeder airline will be liable for the full amount of compensation where a connection is missed.  This has potential to have serious implications for carriers such as Aer Lingus which feed traffic into many of the European hubs for onward long-haul connections.  The industry contends that this has the potential to seriously undermine interlining arrangements among carriers and discourage such arrangements, which, perversely, could be to the detriment of consumers, as it could reduce choice and convenience and likely result in higher costs.   Ireland&rsquo;s views are shared by many other member states in this regard.</p><p> Agenda item 8 proposes the adoption of draft Council conclusions on the mid-term review of the EU&rsquo;s maritime transport policy until 2018 and outlook to 2020.  A draft declaration on this was adopted at an informal maritime meeting in Athens on 7 May and Ireland welcomes and supports the Council conclusions.  Shipping and the movement of goods by sea is vitally important to the economy, and our continued support for the implementation of EU policy to develop and promote a safe, secure and clean shipping environment is assured.</p><p> On AOB item 9(a), the French have concerns about Regulation (EC) No.1071/2009, which establishes common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator.  The purpose of the regulation is to achieve greater harmonisation of standards among member states, particularly as regards levels of financial standing required and the standard of professional competence expected; to facilitate the right of establishment in other member states and the mutual recognition of professional status; to improve the overall professional standing and quality of road transport; and to prevent unscrupulous firms from seeking to gain market share by skimping on safety and working conditions.  France is concerned that there are many problems within the present framework that result in unfair competition in national markets.  The main issues of concern to France are cabotage and "letter box" companies.</p><p> Cabotage remains a contentious issue, although the amount of cabotage remains small in the context of the overall EU transport market.  Some member states view the further liberalisation of cabotage as unacceptable due to the disparity in labour costs across the EU.  They fear that this would result in a race to the bottom in labour standards, which would have a negative impact on society.  Ireland recognises the overall benefit of a liberalised market that is equitable and supports any steps taken that will assist with a smooth transition to this.</p><p> On AOB item 9(b), Ireland supports the establishment of the joint venture and believes that the output of the shift to rail joint undertaking will have positive benefits for the rail market.  The main outputs envisaged from the programme will be a 50% reduction in life cycle costs for the railway transport system; a 100% increase in capacity; a 50% increase in reliability and punctuality of rail services; the removal of technical obstacles to the interoperability of the rail system; and a reduction in noise, emissions and other environmental impacts arising from rail transport.</p><p> To date, one Irish company, as part of a larger consortium, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the joint undertaking.  It is also understood that a consortium consisting of UCD and Trinity College Dublin is in negotiation on the development of a memorandum of understanding with the joint undertaking.  It is also understood that the Rail Procurement Agency and Irish Rail have been exploring possibilities under the initiative.</p><p> On AOB item 9(c), I look forward to receiving information from the Commission on tracking of aeroplanes, which is an important safety issue, following on from the Malaysian Airlines incident.  I am happy to take questions from members on the agenda.</p></speech>

With regard to the fourth railway package, there are issues with regard to the awarding of the PSO contracts, and a court case is outstanding in this regard.  I am a little worried that PSO cutbacks and allowing other operators to take on PSO contracts will lead to further privatisation.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p><p>  There will be a division between the management of the rail infrastructure and the operation of the rail services.  Will he explain how that will work?  Will Irish Rail operate a different setup to manage that?  Will this be more beneficial in the context of increased co-operation between rail operators North and South?</p><p>  I refer to the proposal to amend Directive 96/53/EC, which relates to the height, length, weight and so on of HGVs.  The standard height in Europe is 4 m.  Will this have repercussions for Irish hauliers?  There are cabotage issues throughout Europe.</p><p>  The Minister referred as he closed his contribution to the tracking of aeroplanes following the recent tragic accident.  What is the Council considering?  This is a significant issue.  What happened to the Malaysian Airlines flight - an aeroplane disappearing off the face of the earth - cannot be allowed to happen again.  Will this be a major issue during the discussions?</p></speech>

Next week's Council meeting will deal with the technical aspects of the fourth railway package, such as safety, interoperability and the European Railway Agency.  We will not discuss the opening of the railway market but it will be discussed at a later stage.  International traffic is liberalised.  For example, the Belfast-Dublin route could be operated by anyone.  The Commission is proposing to open up domestic markets - that is, journeys within a country - to competition and tendering.  We support that in principle across the Union where it makes sense but, as far as Ireland is concerned, we intend to seek a derogation from it.  The domestic rail market in Ireland is too small for different companies to compete to run services.  There would be a significant cost to tendering for PSO routes and we might find that the only operator that tenders for them is Irish Rail.  There would be a great deal of money in it for lawyers, consultants and others but there would be no outcome to it.  Irish Rail could tender services if it wanted to but we will not seek a legal obligation on us to do so under European law and, therefore, we will seek a derogation on that.</p><p>  The restructuring of Irish Rail is under way.  That relates to an existing directive.  It will involve a separation within the company to give an infrastructure management company and a railway undertaking.  We had a derogation under the directive but we did not seek to have it renewed.</p><p>   The standard HGV height in continental Europe is 4 m because there are many low railway bridges.</p> <p>This is an area of concern for us because we want to maintain the 4.6 m height for Britain and Ireland, and we want to make sure nothing in European law creates a problem for us.  However, there is no proposal to change the heights across the EU at present.</p><p> On the tracking of aircraft, the Commission will just look at the safety standards but the longer-term solution to this issue is the satellite tracking of aircraft.  At the moment, this is done by radar, which stops approximately 200 km off the coast.  Essentially, once an aircraft is that far off the coast, it flies on a dedicated path and if it disappears along that path, one does not necessarily know where it has disappeared, and if the pilot diverts from that path, one does not necessarily know where the aircraft has gone.  We are leaders on this issue.  The Irish Aviation Authority is part of a consortium, involving Canada and some other countries, that will move towards satellite tracking of aircraft rather than radar tracking, although that will take a while to happen.</p></speech>

He mentioned the importance of the ports policy, specifically the importance of shipping to an island economy.  This committee recently discussed the Government's ports policy in regard to the division of ports by tier according to their national, regional or local importance.  I am sure the Minister is aware that on the west coast there is only one port of tier 1 importance, namely, Shannon-Foynes Port.  In the recent past, there has been an announcement by the Galway Port Company which aspires to make a significant capital investment at its port with a view to going into almost direct competition with Shannon-Foynes, although this is probably at odds with what has been laid out in the Government's ports policy document.  Is it the Department's intention to continue to support the Government's ports policy in terms of the State's investment in ports and any investment that might come down the line?  Is it also its intention to continue Government policy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Galway Port, which I understand has been categorised at a lower level than Shannon-Foynes?<br />I ask this because I believe what ports require at the moment is a degree of certainty.  Given the significant infrastructural investment that is taking place at Foynes at present, I do not think it helpful to have a situation where there is uncertainty in regard to whether there will be one or more ports of strategic national importance on the west coast.  If clarification can be given today in regard to the Minister's position and the Department's position, namely, that investment in tier 1 ports will be identified and will continue as laid down in the ports policy document that was published, that would be very helpful.</p></speech>

The tiering of ports largely follows the TEN-T guidelines as to what is a core port and what is not, and what is on TEN-T and what is not.  Some take the view that governments can just put anything they want on the trans-European networks, but they cannot.  There are certain criteria, and the ports that meet those criteria are Dublin, Cork, Shannon-Foynes, Rosslare and Waterford.  We have classified Dublin, Cork and Shannon-Foynes as the tier 1 ports because of the level of trade they carry.  In particular, Shannon-Foynes is a huge bulk port.  I understand Galway accounts for less than 2%, perhaps less than 1%, of all trade by sea, so it is considered a regional port.  Whatever happens, there is no State investment at all in the commercial ports and there are no Exchequer grants for the commercial ports, which operate entirely on a commercial basis in the same way that the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is or any of those semi-States operate.  There could be a State investment through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, but that would have to be on a commercial basis and they would have to be sure they would get all their money back, plus a return.</p><p>  We allow the ports to operate on a commercial basis and to put in their own planning applications.  For example, Dublin has its plans for Alexandra Quay, Cork has its plans for Ringaskiddy and Galway has its plans for its new ports.  The Department neither gives approval nor vetoes such planning applications but what is expected is that An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in making its decision, and it is the body that will make the decision, will have regard to everything it has to have regard to, which includes the ports policy, environmental issues and pretty much anything else.</p></speech>

On one of the issues discussed, the policy debate on urban mobility, the Minister's presentation refers to this being a rather repetitive debate.  It seems to me that thinking has not emerged too much in this regard.  I am taken to some extent by the press coverage today of Google's plans to introduce a vehicle that does not have any controls other than those that will be guided by systems, which it is in the process of developing and receiving patents for.  In the Minister's opinion, will the Commission or any of the member states have direct contact with, or are any of them in discussions with, the industry regarding the whole area of urban mobility?  Given Google seems to be moving ahead, it would be important for the Minister to get into conversation with it, considering it has such a presence here.  The difficulty is that the industry is often well ahead of where politics and policy is, and this is an example of that.  Perhaps this is something on which the Minister could take a lead.  I believe he would have the wherewithal to get his head around what Google is at here, so it is something he might comment on.</p><p>  Another issue which is perhaps not part of policy, to quote Deputy O'Donovan, relates to the industrial relations issues taking place within Irish Rail and more particularly within Aer Lingus, where a strike is looming at the weekend.  While I do not want to get into the issues around the strike, does the Minister believe the industrial relations mechanism that exists at present, as deployed by the unions and Aer Lingus, is fit for purpose?  This continuous toing and froing between the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court and the continuous balloting for strike action would seem to identify a broader problem within that company between management and unions.  Does the Minister believe it is possible to create some other forum or try to facilitate, through some other mechanism, a more comprehensive and long-term solution so we do not have this continuous threat of strike, then moving to a one day or two day strike and so on?  This is causing a great deal of uncertainty in the minds not just of the travelling public and business but also tour operators and people who are looking at Ireland as a destination for their summer vacation.  The Minister might comment on both issues.</p></speech>

The Deputy makes a very good point on technology.  It is absolutely the case that technology is ahead of legislation, but it is very hard to write legislation in anticipation of technologies that might or might not develop.  I do not know much about the new driverless car, so I might take the Deputy's advice and contact Google as to whether I can take a look at it.  As I said, we would have to provide for it in legislation, but as I have not seen it, I am not sure how.  It would definitely be a challenge.</p><p>  On Aer Lingus, we have had three strike threats in the past six months alone.</p> <p>Even though the strikes may not happen, the inconvenience for passengers and potential travellers damages the company's reputation.  Anything that damages the reputation of the company means that fewer people will book with Aer Lingus which means that it will make less in profit which means that there will be less money for staff.  It seems to be a self-defeating strategy.  It is hard for me to comment on whether there should be a new mechanism for solving disputes.  From the point of view of the Government, the Labour Relations Commission is available to be used any time people wish, but they must want to do it.  It is welcome that the company has invited the union to talks and that it has accepted the invitation.  I hope they will be able to resolve the matter.  In my contacts with both sides they accept that they need a better way to solve their problems, but they have not yet agreed yet what that better way is.</p></speech>

We certainly agree on the damage the uncertainty causes, not only for the business travelling community but also in terms of the negative impact is has on the tourism sector.  I have spoken to people involved in the industry who see potential cancellations as industry representatives outside Ireland are stating to hoteliers they will not take the risk of holding a conference here.  This is damaging and the Government needs to move to a sectoral approach to industrial relations, rather than using the generic model which worked in the past.  It is probably more relevant now in the absence of a partnership arrangement that a forum be established without delay.  I look forward to the Minister giving consideration to this in bringing forward proposals.</p></speech>

He also stated there was no proposal, but there is a Commission proposal.  Am I reading something different into it?  It states that if the Commission's proposal to amend Article 4 is accepted, it is likely that it would prohibit the cross-border operations of vehicles exceeding 4 m in height.</p></speech>

The EU standard is 4 m height; therefore, there is no proposal to change heights or weights throughout EU member states.  Individual states have the right to apply different weights and heights in their own jurisdiction and it is up to member states to agree to it on a bilateral basis.  We want to ensure nothing undermines this position.  To clarify, there is no proposal to change the heights or weights.</p></speech>

We have discussed the issue of road safety and I raised in the D&aacute;il with the Minister the need for a philosophical and attitudinal change to what we find acceptable with regard to road death figures.  I used the 1970s as an example when more than 600 people died on the roads every year in Ireland.  In the late 1990s the figure was more than 400.  In time to come I hope we will look back and state that in the early part of the 21st century the figures were also shockingly high.  To this end, what further measures does the Minister envisages being initiated in Europe in the implementation of modern technology to help stem number of road deaths?  Does he envisage speed restrictions for large vehicles which were applied here in the mid-2000s being applied across the board?  Does he see alcolocks being applied across the board?  How far off is this?  Is it something on which Ireland could lead the way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.1159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014052800006#H00600"><p>What we plan to do in the coming years on road safety is outlined in the strategy which contains approximately 140 actions.  They all relate to education, engineering and enforcement.  Road safety is largely a domestic competence and I would prefer not to see the European Union getting too involved in domestic road traffic legislation as it affects speed limits.  It is up to every country to do this for itself.  The European Union is very involved in setting vehicle standards and licensing.  We are generally supportive of anything which raises vehicle standards to make vehicles safer.  We do not like to impose too many standards which are specific to Ireland because it creates many distortions such as in the second-hand car trade.  What is being introduced at EU level is eCall, a system being introduced in new cars.  It will mean that if a car crashes, it can call the emergency services.  Such measures are discussed a great deal at EU level.  Introducing alcolocks or interlocks in all vehicles might be a step too far at this stage, but in the road safety strategy we are considering the courts imposing them.  If somebody has penalty points or a conviction for drink-driving, use of an alcolock could be imposed.  It might also makes sense in the case of commercial vehicles such as buses and trucks.  By and large, I would prefer to see such measures decided at national level.</p></speech>

The outlook we need to take is zero tolerance to road deaths and injuries because one death is one too many.  We should try to embrace technology more and see it as a way of self-policing road traffic management and as a means of punishing and regulating those who have stepped outside the mark.  It might be more effective than some of the measures in place.  I encourage the Minister to explore as many measures as possible.</p></speech>

There is mutual recognition of disqualification from driving.  Standardising the penalty points system throughout the European Union would be extremely complicated because what is an offence in some countries is not in others.  Some countries have many penalty point offences, while others do not.  It is a difficult issue.  Under agenda item 9(c), there will be an information point from the Commission on cross-border traffic offences and the key issue is the exchange of information and enforcement.  We are very interested in being able to do this.  There are many difficulties in making these issues a reality.  We will wait to see what the Commission's proposals are and consider them.</p></speech>

They have exempted a small number of roads that straddle the Border but are still refusing to exempt the A5, which we want exempted.  We have been considering, as a potential alternative solution, joining the UK system, introducing the same system in the Republic and reducing the road tax for heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, to compensate them.  However, this needs to be worked out between my Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Revenue and a few other people.  An interdepartmental committee is working on it.</p></speech>

Most people registered in the UK pay road tax as well as a standard charge, which allows them to use the roads freely.  The only people who pay the &pound;10 are those who are not road taxed in the UK.  If we joined the UK system, anyone road taxed in the Republic would be able to use the roads in the North and Britain without having to pay the &pound;10, but anyone visiting Ireland from another EU country would have to pay it.  However, there are many different options and we have not settled on one.  There is a committee set up between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which controls road tax, Revenue and a few others.  We hope to have a set of proposals before the recess.</p></speech>

There is an inconsistency in traffic route lighting and some motorways are overlit.  The lighting approaching, at and exiting junctions on the M1 from Dublin to the Border and beyond is far in excess of what is required.  I have quantified this by considering the M7 and M8, which have similar exits and entrances.  When one leaves a junction, there are 25 high-powered traffic route lights on both sides of the road, covering a quarter of a mile.  I have also considered the situation in America.  There are more traffic route lights on the M1 than there are on any interstate highway in the US.  Maybe this is the requisite standard, but there is an inconsistency on the M7 and M8 in terms of the lighting at junctions.  Is there a standard and is it based on a European or British standard?</p><p>  There are in excess of 500 high-powered traffic route lights.  This level is not necessary.  There are CO2 emissions because more electricity is needed.  I travel the motorways often.  Many of the lights in question do not light for a considerable period.  This is something we should consider in the interests of saving money.  Anyone using the junctions at night has his or her lights on anyway.  We could do without 75% of the road lights for one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening, for example, from 4.30 a.m. or 5 a.m. to 6 a.m.  This would mean reviewing the contacts or time switches, but a significant saving could be made in terms of electricity.  I do not know whether the Department or the Minister shares my opinion, but there is an inconsistency.  I can say this without fear of contradiction.  One need only consider how the junctions on the M8, M7 and M1 are not lit the same way.  Some access junctions have 40 high-powered lights.  I contend that they are not required.  Perhaps we should consider engaging in an exercise on this matter, although maybe I should not have raised it today.</p></speech>

There is technology that allows the lights to know when a car is approaching and they can turn on when there is traffic and off when there is none.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister and his officials.

We can leave the defamation to the weekend.  I do not think we need to go over that here.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the forthcoming Telecommunications and Energy Councils on 6 and 9 June, respectively.</p><p>  I will begin by dealing with the Telecommunications Council.  I understand the committee already has a copy of the draft agenda and I understand COREPER is expected to finalise an agreed agenda later today.  The Hellenic Presidency will provide the Council with a progress report on the proposal on a single telecoms market, also known as the connected continent package.  There will also be a progress report and orientation debate on the Commission proposal on the network and information security directive, which deals with the very topical and important issue of cyber security.  Under the any other business part of the agenda, the Presidency will provide the Council with information on the files relating to the digital agenda scoreboard, electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, measures to reduce the costs of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks and accessibility to public sector bodies&rsquo; websites.  Since the last Telecommunications Council in December, the Hellenic Presidency has overseen agreement being reached on both the regulation on electronic identification and trust services and the directive relating to broadband cost reduction.  Both of these legislative proposals have also been signed off by Parliament.</p><p>  The directive on accessibility to public sector bodies&rsquo; websites has not been discussed in any detail since the Irish Presidency and it is expected that the incoming Italian Presidency will begin a re-examination of this proposal. </p> <p>No discussion or debate is anticipated on these issues.  There will be a lunchtime discussion devoted to the issue of Internet governance.  </p><p> The Commission&rsquo;s connected continent package was proposed in September 2013 as a further measure to achieve a move towards a single market for electronic communications.  It has provoked a widespread and strong reaction across the full range of players in the EU telecommunications market.  This was the subject of a political debate at last December&rsquo;s Ministerial Council meeting where the vast majority of member states raised concerns regarding various aspects of the proposals, including the lack of consultation by the Commission prior to drafting.</p><p> The Greek Presidency initiated an indepth examination of the proposals in March last at Council working group level.   The working group is still only involved in a first reading of the full text and progress to date has been laborious.  A number of key concerns have emerged, many of which mirror concerns outlined by my officials when they briefed this committee on the proposal in October last year.  In its contribution to date on the Council working group discussions, Ireland has highlighted its concerns regarding the overall thrust of the package and focussed in particular on the need to safeguard national competence in critical policy areas such as spectrum, which, as we have previously outlined to the committee, we see as a valuable and strategically vital piece of national infrastructure.  As of now, the Presidency does not intend to have a debate on this measure at Council.</p><p> The network and information security directive relates to cyber security and proposes that member states be required to adopt national network information security strategies, designate national competent authorities and establish computer emergency response teams, CERTs.  It sets out standardised procedures for dealing with the increasingly sensitive area of cyber security and proposes an enabling power for the Commission to specify mandatory reporting obligations in relation to security breaches on public administrations and on critical infrastructure operators.  While the Hellenic Presidency has proposed a debate on this proposal at Council, it has not as yet indicated the orientation of the debate and has not framed any specific questions to help guide the discussion.  It is likely that the debate will focus on outstanding areas of concern in order to allow the incoming Italian Presidency accelerate the examination of this proposal.</p><p> In principle, this proposal is to be welcomed from an Irish perspective.  We are seeking clarifications on the precise scope of the directive and we want to ensure that all relevant market participants are included within the scope of this directive, including those in the public sector.  One concern we share with a number of other like-minded member states is that the operational co-operation through the proposed co-operation mechanism is too ambitious given the different levels of capability that exist in individual member states.  Operational co-operation, involving the provision and sharing of sensitive operational information between member states is best facilitated through trust and confidence building measures.</p><p> At Council, I will reiterate that Ireland would favour a regime of voluntary reporting of cyber incidents as opposed to the mandatory reporting envisaged in the proposal.  There is concern that a mandatory approach could amount to a compliance oriented approach by industry with a focus to merely report what is legally necessary with adverse implications for existing voluntary arrangements.  It could also result in a regulatory burden with implications for the competitiveness of European industry.  Improving member states&rsquo; capacity to effectively deal with network security is essential for a secure digital single market and we will continue to contribute to the discussions on this directive at the Council working group to ensure the final directive is best suited to achieve this objective.</p><p> The Presidency proposes to hold a lunchtime debate on Internet governance.  Internet governance has long been taken to mean the setting of rules and principles that govern the operation of the Internet.  In recent years, the debate has become more politicised and contested, due mainly to the growing centrality of the Internet in the daily economic, cultural and political lives of citizens.  Earlier this year, the European Commission published a communication on Internet policy principles, which reflects the Commission&rsquo;s growing interest in this area and its belief that an EU position is required.  Considerable work has already been done in this area by bodies such as the OECD, the Council of Europe and the EU, and much can be learned from what already exists and has been agreed by member states.  Ireland has and will continue to maintain a strong line on the pressing need to preserve a free and open Internet.  As Internet governance encompasses a wide range of subjects, including content, data protection, intellectual property law and network security, it is important that all relevant stakeholders are brought on board at a national and EU level. </p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for the Minister in relation to Internet safety.  The Minister will be aware of the committee's report in this area.  One of the issues flagged during our discussions on this issue was that of international law in this area.  Perhaps the Minister will say if issues such as cyber bullying and so on are on the table for discussion by the Council.  </p><p>  The Minister referred to the directive in relation to broadband, which is a major issue for parts of Ireland.  Perhaps he would elaborate further on what is contained in that directive and on progress in relation to Internet governance.  The committee when drawing up its report identified a gap in this area in the context of Irish law versus international law.  Are there proposals at EU level to address this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-28a.1182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014052800009#L00200"><p>The discussion to which Deputy Moynihan refers will be a lunchtime discussion of the type which almost always occurs following a Council of Ministers meeting and focuses on a particular subject.  In this particular instance, the subject is that of Internet governance.  In my view, we are a long way from being able to define trans-European law on the issue of Internet governance.  We have an Internet content governance advisory council chaired by Dr. Brian O'Neill of the Dublin Institute of Technology, the report of which is due to be submitted this month.  That report will be published.  Up to now, it has been the disposition of Europe to leave this to domestic sovereign law.  However, as the Deputy said there are issues that arise that are common to pretty much every country in the world.  The advisory group, which comprises a number of specialists under the chairmanship of Dr. Brian O'Neill, is the first place to which I would look for new guidance on this issue.  It has the repository of knowledge and experience required and understands the international literature and European experience.</p> <p>I will publish the report.  I do not have the freedom to say that he and the group may be willing to present to this committee but I suspect because the man has been so generous with his time and in doing this job <i>pro bono</i>- it is his field - he may be willing to do so.  That might be helpful after the committee gets a chance to read his report.  As Deputy Moynihan has stated, apart from the issues of concern to the European Union, there are more local and domestic matters related to the question, which concerns parents, teachers and others.</p></speech>

Are the laws introduced to the Statute Book for the State good enough for this Internet area?  Should there be something at international level?</p></speech>

I am a bit sceptical about our ability to give expression in law to measures in this area and it would have to be very carefully evaluated.  If there were simple answers to this, other countries would have produced them by now.  There are no simple answers and sometimes very simplistic answers are put forward, including by some of our own profession, sparking dramatic headlines and all the rest.  Implementing these processes is much more challenging in the world of the Internet today.</p></speech>

One element discussed is the reduction of cost in deploying high-speed electronic communications networks.  In light of the announcement made recently regarding bringing fibre to communities throughout the country, will there be implications arising from what we are discussing today; could it help the initiative or is there the possibility that it will delay us because we must agree this before we decide to achieve what we want in rolling out fibre to different communities throughout the country?</p><p>  Will the Minister flesh out the voluntary versus mandatory position on the reporting of cyber incidents?  I do not know if it is related but we heard last week about the global eBay issue and surely there should be some reporting of minor incidents that always seem to occur.  Will the Minister outline why he is taking the voluntary course of action rather than a mandatory approach?  There are to be computer emergency response teams, like cyber SWAT teams, to deal with some of these issues.  It is the right concept if we can get our heads around it.  The matter of trust in networks is a big issue so why are we adopting a voluntary approach?</p></speech>

We would like to think that many of the measures we highlighted in the broadband task force presaged much of the debate happening now in Europe.  We brought together the main players in the industry with Department officials, chaired by me, with the regulator and representatives of Forf&aacute;s also present.  We highlighted a number of measures and it was the first time the industry chief stated that we had this kind of sustained engagement about Ireland's needs regarding quality connectivity.  A number of the issues highlighted, such as the better leveraging of State assets to facilitate the roll-out of broadband, constitute exactly the kind of approach being used in this debate in Europe.</p><p>  The Deputy is right in his second question as we must comply with state aid rules.  The broadband plan acknowledges that the commercial sector is not going to be able to provide the kind of quality connectivity that rural Ireland is entitled to and the State must intervene but that can only happen once it complies with state aid and competition rules, etc.  As I told the committee before, that involves a very detailed and painstaking mapping exercise now well under way for presentation to Europe.  We have had an enthusiastic response because of a decision to roll out fibre, notwithstanding the additional investment that will inevitably be involved.  European Commission people see that as a solution that is future-proofed, and solutions we thought of before pale in comparison.  We have no way around this and we must go through the state aids process, etc.  We are well on the way in preparing for that.</p><p>  The issues are remarkably similar, especially for countries where large geographic tracts of the country have low density population.  It is all right if a person operates in an entirely urban society but where there is low-density population throughout large tracts of a country like Ireland, others encounter the same problems as us.</p></speech>

Progress to date has been laborious, and that is probably an understatement.  It is difficult to see how anything has happened and whose interests are being protected in this approach.  Is it the interests of companies or people who use telecoms?  Has any initiative been taken to get companies talking to each other, as that will ultimately be required?  It would be frustrating to attend a meeting with effectively no agenda, no identified issues and where questions will not be addressed and no discussion, effectively, will be had.  I call into question the purpose of the meeting.  What can the Minister do to ensure more progress in the area?</p><p>  Is it in order to refer to the Minister's letter to the committee from 19 March regarding the Energy Council meeting in Brussels on 4 March 2014?</p></speech>

It is phenomenally complex, very comprehensive and, from the point of view of the Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, deserves urgent attention.  It is not fair to say there is not an agenda.  There is very much an agenda and a focus, but the issues thrown up are of great complexity, given the variations in different member states and the different considerations that we would have ourselves.  Indeed, I believe the committee received a presentation on this from my officials shortly after the publication of the report and the committee members noted an opinion after that in which they expressed reservations.</p><p>  Without committing myself to it in full, they are reservations that we would broadly agree with.  For example, as I said in my introductory remarks, we regard the issue of spectrum as a public good and a national resource.  We regard spectrum as strategically vital and that we ought to maintain as much sovereign direction over it as we can.  The last tranche of spectrum auctioned a little over a year ago resulted in a very healthy interest by the big players in the market and an investment of some &euro;855 million, which I take to be a vote of confidence in the economy for the future.  It was very significant.  I am all in favour of co-ordination and so forth of spectrum policy as well as every other policy within a Single Market and a Union, but I believe we should make haste slowly and protect our national interests to ensure that they are not eroded in any way.</p><p>  Apart from that, the reason for the laborious progress is that the working group must tease through a measure such as this in line-by-line detail.  Given the divergences within the Union at present, the different perspectives and the view of the sector itself, it is inevitable that progress would be slow.  We are all in favour of some aspects of it.  For example, Germany and the United Kingdom have latterly suggested that we might consider abstracting out some of the elements, but the attitude of the Commissioner to date is that it is a package, as she sees it, and we must consider it in its totality.  There are welcome aspects.  The committee would welcome the changes that are imminent in roaming charges from 1 July, for example.  They are quite significant in terms of the decreases for consumers and so forth.</p></speech>

There is a working group of people who have expertise in the area.  As Deputy Moynihan said earlier, we cannot all have masters degrees in the high tech aspect of some of these decisions and so forth.  That is the reason we retain experts to guide us.  The heavy lifting will be done by the working group, but there will be a progress report by the Presidency.  I have not seen that progress report yet, but there will be one and we will discuss it.  There are some good things in this package that I would like to see progressed, but there are some matters in it that raise quite profound and fundamental questions.  They are questions on which we would have to make haste slowly, and I will say that.</p></speech>

We have made the agenda available to the committee.  It includes completion of the Internal Market in energy, international energy relations and, in particular, the value of multilateral frameworks to promote climate and energy policy goals.  To outline the context, the recent informal meeting of energy Ministers which I attended in Athens on 15 and 16 May provided an opportunity for Ministers to discuss the following: energy security; fuel import dependency; completion of the internal energy market; the southern gas corridor; construction of the necessary infrastructure and interconnections, including projects of common interest; development of indigenous resources, including renewables and energy efficiency; a level playing field with regard to third countries; a strong external dimension with member states speaking with one voice; diversification of routes and sources for gas; continued efforts towards decarbonisation, that is, the 2050 roadmap and 2030 framework; and consistency between energy security and the 2030 framework policies that are mutually reinforcing.  A good deal of this has been prompted by the Ukraine crisis and the implications of that for energy security.  Ministers also considered the issue of financing energy efficiency, financing projects of common interest, PCIs, and governance under the climate and energy 2030 framework.</p><p>  As I mentioned earlier the Energy Council will be held on 13 June.  Ministers will consider a report on the completion of the internal energy market by 2014 and discuss the value of multilateral frameworks to promote climate and energy policy.</p> <p> With regard to the European Council meeting on 26 and 27 June, the focus of discussion is expected to be on energy and security, and the Commission's expected European energy security strategy.  A comprehensive plan for reducing energy dependency is a key issue which has arisen because of the situation in Ukraine.  I understand that this strategy is due to be adopted today.  In this regard, discussion will also focus on new routes, including potential new discoveries in the eastern Mediterranean.  In addition, there will be discussion on Poland's proposal for an energy union which stresses the importance of investment in energy connectors.  The Council will take stock of progress made on 2030 framework for climate and energy with a view to adopting a final decision at the October European Council.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to explain what is proposed and has been spoken about in terms of projects of common interest.</p><p>  The issue of energy security has also been brought into focus.  Perhaps I misunderstood, but there was some indication, to me, that there might be a discussion at one of these meetings regarding hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.  I am not sure whether that is the case, but if it is, then I ask the Minister to outline what has been said across Europe on the matter.  In certain parts of the country the issue is very important.  Deputy Colreavy will be more familiar with it, but there is great concern about fracking in Clare and Leitrim.</p></speech>

In terms of the policy objective of realising the completion of the internal energy market, a great deal of it has to do with network codes and such issues, but obviously the physical infrastructure is important.  If all of the legal regulatory and other work can be done in respect of concluding the objective of an internal energy market, we then have to get on with the business of how to connect the continent and the member states in terms of physical infrastructure.  There is an amount of finance available under the recent budgetary conclusions for the financing of, or financial assistance with, projects of common interest between member states and so on.</p><p>  The North-South interconnector between Meath and Tyrone has been designated a project of common interest.  That is an example of what I am talking about.  Whether it will qualify for funding is a separate issue, but it is a project of common interest.  Let me give another example.  If we were building the interconnector again between Wales and north Dublin, that would be the kind of thing that is envisaged in terms of the Deputy's question on what are the projects of common interest.  There are much larger physical interconnector projects in other countries and between member states.  In terms of the domestic scene, I have given the best example that I can give to the Deputy.</p><p>  When we held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, at our informal energy Council in Dublin, we put on the agenda the issue of unconventional gas and oil and other technologies.  Since then, there has been a debate going on in the European Union about the issue.  The Commission has issues and some thoughts on it, mainly from the point of view of the competitiveness implications of what has happened in the United States.  The price of gas in the United States has dropped dramatically, and obviously that has implications for European industry and competitiveness.  There is no prescription being handed down.  A number of member states are doing what we are doing here, as the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, will tell the committee, in terms of asking our Environmental Protection Agency to carry out a thorough examination of the technology and its safety and assess whether there are environmental risks and all of that kind of thing.  We have managed to put together and provide a great deal of money to carry out the study, which is under way.  I am sure the Minister of State will answer any particular questions that Members may have.</p></speech>

Sometimes it seems to me that the focus is not on the consumers - the people who use the energy.  It seems to me to be more about support for companies than protecting the right to an affordable supply for customers.  Does the Minister think the debate needs to be adjusted?  Is there any mechanism for member states to work with the EU in getting supports to develop the potential for energy independence?</p><p>  I will focus again on costs from the consumers' perspective.  Is there enough debate on such costs at Commission level?  Is there more we could and should be doing about the matter?</p><p>  Finally, I will comment on fracking.  The perceived wisdom is that because there is fracking in the United States, the price of gas has fallen.  However, that was largely accidental.  What operates in the States is, I am afraid, a large Ponzi scheme.  They have to drill more wells in order to recover the initial investment made.</p><p>  A letter dated 19 March and signed by the Minister was included in the minutes of the meeting.  Having read it, I am concerned that hydraulic fracturing was addressed as a normal option.  Where I come from, fracking is not normal.  He said that the State had invested a good bit of money in the EPA and was carrying out a study on the environmental and unquantified or other impacts of hydraulic fracturing.  To my mind, that study should not be going on.  It is a self-evident truth that the landscape in Fermanagh, Leitrim, Clare, Sligo and Donegal will be an industrial wasteland if we allow fracking to go ahead.  We should be exploring every option other than hydraulic fracturing.  Frankly, it is an outrageous abuse of taxpayers' money that we are getting the EPA to carry out the study.</p> <p>It is the same as the Government considering whether the maternity services should be consultant-led in Sligo regional hospital.  It is a question that should not be considered.</p></speech>

There is a reasonable balance.  It is important that small and large energy users have access to energy as competitively priced as they can source because they give employment.  Wearing their other hats, consumers are workers in these companies and it would be damaging to employment if there was not emphasis on competitively priced energy for industry and for companies.  I agree with Deputy Michael Colreavy that we must bring available instruments to bear to ensure energy is as competitively priced for consumers as can be.  That is more difficult in a country that imports 96% of its gas and 100% of its oil.  There is so much we can do and are doing.  This morning, I opened an Engineers Ireland seminar and workshop on performance contracting.  The impetus we have given to developing a new retrofit industry, stemming from the new efficiency fund where up to &euro;70 million is available for exemplar projects with the engineers of Ireland meeting today to discuss the implementation of it, means there can be considerable savings in energy costs as a result.  It is a question of balance.  Consumers' consumption is determined by their income and employment and if they do not have jobs in companies they will not be able to consume a great deal.  There must be a balance.  The thrust of policy is towards the completion of the internal market and it is a two-way street.  Where there is interconnectivity and quality infrastructure, there is better security of supply and there is also an impact on prices.  It is a two-way street.  We have seen this in respect of the interconnector's first year operating between Britain and Ireland.  It may not be an ongoing situation but where we import energy, it brings downwards pressure on prices in the domestic market and that is a good thing.</p><p>  I cannot agree with Deputy Colreavy with regard to wasting taxpayers' money because the EPA is doing a definitive study on hydraulic fracturing.  The EPA is acknowledged to be an independent expert professional agency whose integrity is not questioned and it is imperative we get the best advice available.  At different stages of history, new technologies have emerged that initially frightened people or in respect of which people had concerns.  In the case of hydraulic fracturing, as articulated by Deputy Michael Colreavy, citizens have concerns about environmental implications and it is absolutely the duty of Government to ensure the concerns of people are examined by the best professional advice we have available.  I do not know what will be in the report of the EPA but I am sure it will stand up to scrutiny when it emerges.  In the interim, there is no fracking going on in this country.  It is bad enough listening to complaints about things that are going on in the country and I do not think we should be imagining complaints.  No fracking is going on and we will have a definitive scientific study.  When available, it will be published and I am sure the committee will go into it in detail.</p></speech>

Where I come from, fracking is not normal and will never be regarded as normal.  Will the EPA report measure the level of public resistance, should there be any attempt to introduce fracking in the north west?  Does the Minister know the area?  Has he seen it?  Can he envisage the area, even if there is no threat to health, with 100 lorries transporting water to fracking sites up and down the narrow roads of beautiful north Leitrim?</p></speech>

The Minister has touched on projects of common interest, PCIs, and funding.  Who decides on that and what are the criteria?  Costs have been major factor in respect of the EirGrid North-South interconnector.  They are trying to do it as cheaply as possible so that it does not appear on people's energy bills.  Will the fact that the project has not gone ahead, and is costing money every year, help us in that respect?  What are the criteria and who decides on it?</p></speech>

I have described the projects of common interest in the lingo of the Union.  Each member state puts forward what it thinks are projects that qualify as projects of common interest.  Then, the battle takes place to access funding.  Even when it is designated a project of common interest, it does not automatically follow that every member state gets funding for every project.  That would very soon exhaust the resources available.  A committee meets in Brussels and we have national representative on it.  It goes through the projects and the process, with the committee going through the criteria that ought to apply.  We do not yet know what will come out of it in the end but work is under way.  A person from my Department is on the committee.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy Colreavy's question, there is not a week of the year that we or the sector are not engaged in the evolution of new technology and new innovation in terms of the energy landscape.</p> <p>We are heading down the road towards smart metering, for example.  New innovations in terms of energy efficiency and storage are being worked on.  Technology is developing all the time.  </p><p> I do not think one could say from the discussion at European level on hydraulic fracturing so far that it is regarded as normal.  Member states come to it with totally different perspectives.  Several member states, like ourselves, are engaged in detailed studies of the issue.  It is an area in which one needs to know the science as well.</p><p> Defoliation in a scenic area like that from which the Deputy comes is an entirely different matter but I repeat there is no fracking going on in this country currently.  All we are doing is using the expertise available to the State to give us best advice on what is the position.  I would have to disagree with the Deputy on his description of what is going on in the United States inasmuch as I am not challenging whether there is discomfiture among some communities about hydraulic fracturing but I am talking about its economic impact in the United States.  If Commissioner Oettinger was here rather than me, he would say that as European Union Commissioner for Energy, this has competitiveness implications for Europe and that he cannot avoid it.</p><p> In regard to what we are doing, I will read the following to the Deputy.  Such an assessment would entail consideration of the potential impacts of the project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the interrelationship between the above factors.  I think the Deputy will agree that is a pretty succinct but none the less comprehensive review.</p><p> On the Deputy's question about whether I can tell what size the protests will be, I cannot do that but the Deputy can see from the-----</p></speech>

I said the EPA study will not incorporate the level of resistance there will be at local level to these proposals.   I live there, my family lives there and I hope my children and grandchildren will live there.  The EPA study will not take into account the impact on the daily lives of people who live in and love that region.   That is the point I was making and not the volume of resistance or the number of people on the picket line.  People live in and love that area.</p><p>  As soon as the EPA report comes out, I will propose a special meeting of the committee in a conference room in Manorhamilton so that members will be able to see for themselves the area about which we are talking and in which we are going to cut open the earth.</p></speech>

The Deputy is dismissing the planning process.  Suppose we had the EPA study and it said the technology is perfectly safe, a developer came along and there was a project.  It would have to go through the whole environmental impact assessment, including the impact on human life and the human impact.  The hoops that have to be jumped through are extremely rigorous and demanding.  I have no wish to do anything other than preserve the natural beauty of the area in which the Deputy is fortunate to live, and he knows that.  All I am saying to him is that it is my duty to take the expert advice available to me in preparation for European Council meetings where issues come up on the agenda and where we need to put an Irish perspective.  I have explained in Europe that we are not engaged in any hydraulic fracturing and that we are doing a professional scientific study on the safety of the technology and its environmental impacts and so on.  That is all I am saying.</p></speech>

The Government which proceeded this one approved some very basic desk top studies, and no more than that.  There has not been any fracking.  We are engaged in examination and the environmental impact assessment which accompanies this measures the social impact as well as the environmental fall-out and so on.  I would have confidence in the agencies of the State and in their independence and integrity in terms of assessing this.</p><p>  A debate is going on in Europe whether the Deputy likes it or not.  There are members states in which Ministers will argue that shale gas is a big advance in terms of meeting their climate targets and so on rather than reliance on dirty goal.   If one talks to the Polish Minister, he will have a different view from that which I expressed.  One can go through the member states and different member states have different views on it.  I do not think the Deputy is advising me to step aside from the debate.</p></speech>
