    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#A00300"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied today by Mr. John Riordan.  No apologies have been received.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of our meetings on 22 and 24 November and on 1 and 8 December last.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  In terms of matters arising from the minutes, we will take it that any relevant matters arising will be dealt with in the normal course of our work.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  We have a considerable amount of correspondence to deal with because it has been some time since we had a public meeting.  The first item of correspondence is the opening statement from Mr. Brendan McDonagh, CEO of NAMA, which we have noted and published.  We will be dealing with that later.</p> <p>  The next item is category B correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  These are follow-up items relating to previous meetings.  The first item is No. 201B, an e-mail from Brown Rudnick expressing surprise and disappointment regarding the publishing of details of a letter sent to the committee prior to its consideration by the committee.  We did receive a letter and I saw references to extracts from it in the newspapers before it was considered by this committee.  It is extremely disappointing that some members chose to go down that route.  We note the points made by Brown Rudnick, which are fair comment.  We will note it and publish that remark.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from Professor Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank, regarding State organisations lodging money with the Central Bank.  We will note and publish that letter.  The next item is correspondence from Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, providing information requested at our meeting on 20 October.  We will note and publish that.  The next item of correspondence is No. 217B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing an update to the committee on the transfer of property under the 2002 indemnity agreement.  We will note and publish that.  There is other correspondence relating to that general indemnity agreement which I will refer to later.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 219 B (i) and (ii), correspondence from the OPW regarding rents paid by that office and the Department of Social Protection.  We will note and publish that.  The next item is No. 220B, correspondence from the Minister for Finance providing a response to a request for information from the committee in relation to NAMA and Project Eagle.  We will note and publish that and will also include it on the Project Eagle section of our site, which is an internal method of recording all Project Eagle related correspondence for committee members.  The next item is No. 221B from Ms Michelle Lowe of NAMA providing a response to a request for information from the committee relating to Project Eagle.  We will note and publish that too.</p> <p>  I will now move on to Category C correspondence which is correspondence from private individuals and any other correspondence.</p><p>Nos. 181C, (i) to (iii), is correspondence from the North Meath Communities Development Association in regard to an ongoing issue with the HSE.  This matter was dealt with in some detail by the previous Committee of Public Accounts, which also wrote to the HSE at that time.  However, there was a recognition that this is a matter of a disputed contract and ultimately a matter for the HSE.  I would like to defer consideration of this matter to our next meeting to allow members time to study the documentation.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00200"><p>Prior to the summer recess I raised the issue of correspondence issued by the previous committee in January of this year citing that this matter had also been referred to the Taoiseach's Department.  This is a matter of great concern to the people involved, in respect of which a large number of public meetings were held during the summer.  The body concerned does good work and it needs to be supported.  I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has met with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the issue.  It is important that a statement is forthcoming from the Minister on this matter and that it is resolved as soon as possible.  We cannot have a situation whereby a community body engaged in this type of work is left with this debt.  The previous PAC was very strong in its statement on this matter.  I would appreciate it if it could be addressed as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00300"><p>As mentioned by Deputy Cassells, this matter has been brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Harris and the HSE.  Perhaps we should seek a response from the Minister and the HSE on the matter, following which we will consider all of the correspondence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00400"><p>The HSE has been consistent in its approach to it.  I would appreciate if the Minister's appraisal of the matter could be sought.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00500"><p>We will write to the Minister on that basis.  When the reply has been received we will examine the issue in its entirety, bearing in mind that it was been already considered by the previous PAC.  I am not familiar enough with the details to draw any conclusion on the matter this morning.</p><p>The next item is No. 200C, (i) to (iii)<b><i>.  </i></b>These items can be taken together.  They are copies of correspondence regarding directorship at Limerick Greyhound Stadium for the purposes of keeping the committee informed.  Is it agreed to note this correspondence?  Agreed.  </p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 203C<b><i></i></b>is<i></i>correspondence received from Ms Audrey Keane, Registrar of Aosd&aacute;na in the Arts Council in reply to correspondence regarding the payment of the Aosd&aacute;na Cnuas grant.  I propose that we now consider this matter closed and we forward this to the individual who wrote to the committee on this matter.Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 205C (i) and (ii) is correspondence from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, with an overall description of the tender process framework.  I thank Mr. Quinn for this information, which we will note.  We will also forward a copy of it to the company that raised the matter with us at an earlier meeting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00700"><p>Yes, public procurement is fundamental to our role and it will be included in our work programme for the new year.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 209C (i) and (ii) is correspondence from Ms Mary Higgins, CEO of Caranua.  The committee received a number of items of correspondence from individuals regarding the spending of moneys by Caranua.  We will forward this information to these individuals.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has also indicated that his office will be carrying out a report on the wider issues of the residential redress scheme.  As I mentioned earlier, correspondence has also been received on this matter from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  We will deal in detail with this matter in the new year.  Is the report being carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General a special report?</p></speech>

The committee has the financial statements for Caranua for 2014.  The 2015 audit is almost complete and I suspect it will be with the committee early in the new year.</p></speech>

Those resources are to be applied for the benefit of individuals who were in institutions.  Caranua commenced operation in 2014.  Effectively, it issues grants to the benefit of individuals who were in institutions.</p></speech>

A number of people have been in contact with the committee on this matter, including former residents of the residential institutions.  They are concerned that we deal with this matter soon and we will do so.</p><p>Nos. 210C and 222 C (i) and (ii) deal with a Mazars review of processes employed by the University of Limerick.  There is correspondence from the CEO of the Higher Education Authority and from the President of the University of Limerick in respect of actions taken following the review.  Is it agreed to note this correspondence?  Agreed.  I also propose that we make copies of it available to the individual who brought the matter to the committee&rsquo;s attention.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It may be also worth adding the University of Limerick to the work programme when we engage with third level institutions in 2017.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 211C (i) and (ii) is correspondence from the CEO of the National Transport Authority providing a response to an issue identified in its 2015 financial statements with the lease of a building.  I think this relates to the fact that the building was not occupied for some time.  If people want to raise this matter again at a future date or to deal with it in any other format they are free to do so.  </p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 213C is correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills in reply to an issue raised by an individual alleging misappropriation of public money in Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board.  The Department is aware of the matter and regards the use of the funding as appropriate in this case.  I suggest that we send a copy of this correspondence to the individual and that we now consider the matter closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 217C is correspondence, also from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills.  This is an update for the committee in regard to the transfer of property under the 2002 indemnity agreement.Is it agree to note this correspondence?  Agreed.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 223C (i) and (ii) is correspondence from an individual on the deterioration of salmon stocks.  A paper on the matter is attached.  The individual claims that this is principally a co-ordination problem and while a group has been set up under the EPA, called LAWCO, he believes there is real need for an involvement in this area by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  I propose that we write to the EPA, forwarding a copy of this correspondence and requesting a response on whether the inclusion of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would add value to this group and, if so, to invite its participation.  I also propose that we write to the Department directly asking for its response on the correspondence and whether it would consider being involved in the LAWCO group or other such group to deal with the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  When a response has been received from the two organisations we will deal with the matter. </p><p>We now move on to reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting on 24 November 2016.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B02800"><p>Before we move on from correspondence, I would like to raise again today the issue of the section 38 and 39 organisations.  I am a little uncomfortable that we have had only one hearing on the Console issue.  An internal audit carried out by the HSE raised very serious process issues.  Since then we have come across a number of other organisations where similar problems have arisen.  There appears to be a problem in terms of accountability and the relationship between the HSE and these organisations.  Is there merit in the Comptroller and Auditor General doing a special report on section 38 and 39 organisations' processes?  It would appear that this is not an isolated issue.  There are issues that arose at the Committee of Public Accounts prior to this incarnation, which were in the public domain.</p><p>We have had one engagement with the HSE and that was it.  I accept that Project Eagle came to the fore at that point but we must put some thought into what is the best way to progress the issue because a significant amount of taxpayers' money is being spent and given to those organisations.  Most deal with their funds appropriately and no issues arise but there are failures in the process.  I again flag the issue as I am concerned that we have not decided one way or the other how we should proceed.</p></speech>

Oversight of sections 38 and 39 bodies is something that is examined every year.  I drew the committee&rsquo;s attention previously to the statement on internal financial control in the HSE, which is quite extensive, and it deals every year now with the development of its processes for oversight.  Every year there is a report on it that the committee is free to examine as it wishes.  It is at a process level though, rather than at the level of individual entities.  Where there are significant failures those should be noted in the statement on internal financial control and one would expect to see in the 2016 financial statements an explanation from the HSE as to what control changes it is making, given the lapses that have occurred in individual charities or voluntary bodies.</p> <p>  The committee has a framework at any stage to bring the HSE in to give it an update.  Undoubtedly, it is a very significant line of expenditure of the order of &euro;2.5 billion to &euro;3 billion a year in transfers to sections 38 and 39 organisations.</p></speech>

It is the next item on the agenda.</p> <p>  Financial statements received since 24 November include the Athlone Institute of Technology.  It got a clear report.  We also received the 2012 and 2013 accounts from the National College of Art and Design.  It got a qualified opinion.  The college kept inadequate records for the period of account.  That is very serious.  Serious issues were raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the system of internal control.  The deferred pension funding issue is standard for all universities.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General could say why we are only getting the 2012 accounts now from the National College of Art and Design.</p></speech>

We had to do a substantial amount of working around to try to get complete explanations.  It is a matter which I have reported on in 2014.  I signalled then that the problem existed.  The qualified audit opinion has been given for the past three years in relation to NCAD.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to carry out the audit.  While we feel that the college has reached a situation where it is giving a reasonable representation of the transactions in the year, there is an element of doubt over it because of the quality of the accounting records.</p></speech>

After the report was presented by me, there was a change in the board &ndash; almost a complete change of the board membership &ndash; in the middle of 2015.  When we get to the 2014 to 2015 financial statements, which I expect we will begin auditing in the new year, I think the systems will be significantly better.  The statement on internal financial control is quite comprehensive about the problems that there have been for the college and the steps it is taking.

I anticipate that matters will be better for the 2013 to 2014 period but I cannot give an opinion until the audit is completed.  I will certainly be reporting and drawing attention to matters if I am dissatisfied.</p> <p>  I would also expect the capacity of the college to speed up the delivery of financial statements to improve.

The next item is Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which also got a clear audit report.  Next is the Crawford Art Gallery Cork Limited.  It got a clear audit report but there is a comment that it did not carry out the review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control during the course of the year.  The Kilkenny-Carlow Education and Training Board got a clear report.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is next.  Its remit is to build and equip the national paediatric hospital.  It got a clear audit report.  It might be a matter for the health committee but if anyone wants to have a look at that set of accounts they are in the Oireachtas Library and they will be published subsequent to the meeting.  It is a big investment by the Irish taxpayer.  People can raise the issue at a later date if they wish.</p> <p>  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner got a clear report.  Col&aacute;iste Mhuire gan Sm&aacute;l, Ollscoil Luimnigh, got a clear audit report.  Again, the issue of deferred pensions arises, which is common to many public sector bodies.  The Irish Film Board got a clear audit report.  The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces got a clear audit report and Horse Racing Ireland got a clear audit report for its 2015 accounts.  The agriculture committee has had the group in before it recently.</p> <p>  I have nothing formally drafted for the work programme.  I suggest that on 12 January we have a detailed meeting to consider progress on the Project Eagle report.  I hope we will be able to finalise that within the week.  I would like to be able to publish it on approximately Thursday, 19 January.  We will have a meeting on 12 January and perhaps another meeting on the following Tuesday or Wednesday to tidy up the report before we issue it on 19 January.  The normal process for issuing a report is for the committee to do so in the AV room.  It might be for an hour in the afternoon.</p><p>It is important that the committee holds some normal public meetings dealing with issues other than Project Eagle.  With that in mind, for our meetings on Thursday, 19 January 2017, Thursday, 26 January 2017 and Thursday, 2 February 2017, I have come up with three specific items which we could try to deal with.  The first is the issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  The second is the sale or disposal of the Government jet, which is a discrete chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The third item is the special report on the cost of the changes to the Prison Service.  We will try to get some normal business meetings going and in early January we will lay out our work programme for the following months.  We will be bringing in the HSE, third level institutions and so forth.  The issues I have suggested for our initial meetings next year are short and very specific and that would be preferable to opening up, for example, broader issues with regard to the HSE.</p></speech>

Sorry, my apologies, it is not a draft report but a working paper prepared by the officials.  If members could look at that before the meeting and prepare their observations on it, we can move quite quickly.  If members only open it up when we arrive, however, we will not get very far.  I think a meeting from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. should be adequate.  </p> <p>  That is the approximate work programme for the first few meetings of next year.  As there is no other business, I want to go into private session briefly to discuss the status of our work on Project Eagle before we call in our witnesses.</p></speech>

In the course of the committee's examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on NAMA's sale of Project Eagle, the committee had sought a considerable amount of information from NAMA.  We are very grateful to NAMA for the material supplied to the committee to date.  One particular item requested was a copy of the contemporaneous notes in the format taken during the meeting that were used in the subsequent preparation of the minutes of NAMA board meetings held on 12 December 2013 and 8 January 2014.  NAMA responded to the committee that once NAMA board minutes are adopted by the board members, they are the official record of that particular meeting.  As a result, the board secretary&rsquo;s contemporaneous notes of the meeting are transitory records and are not retained.  As I mentioned at our last private meeting, I was surprised by this considering the importance of the meetings and the fact that the board was considering the sale of assets worth &pound;1.3 billion.  For that reason, we have asked for NAMA to put on the record at this meeting its policy regarding the retention of contemporaneous notes in respect of the preparation of board minutes.  I will allow for some short questions at the end but I ask that members do not drift into other topics today and that they be very brief.  This session will be over within one hour at the very latest.  It may not go that far but I will be closing the meeting at 11.45 a.m. if it is not concluded by then.  There is one specific item and we should be well able to do our business in the time allowed.</p><p>I welcome the following representatives from NAMA: Mr Frank Daly, chairman, and Mr. Brendan McDonagh, chief executive.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off all mobile phones.  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving the evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Daly to make his statement.</p></speech>

It is the fifth occasion on which the chief executive and I have appeared before the committee to deal with this issue.  We estimate that NAMA representatives have already responded to about 2,000 oral questions during our appearances and to about 100 written questions, which have been submitted to us by the committee.  We received yesterday some additional questions to which we will respond very shortly.  We trust that this extensive evidence, in both oral and written form and which has been provided to the committee by NAMA, will be of much assistance to it in the preparation of its report. </p> <p>  The committee has invited us today to discuss a specific issue and it has indicated to us that the morning session will be confined to a maximum of one hour.  The specific issue relates to the contemporaneous notes taken during board meetings in late 2013 and early 2014.  These notes were used to prepare the minutes of the meetings.  According to a press release issued by the committee after its meeting on Thursday of last week, it appears surprise was expressed that the written notes used to prepare the board minutes were not retained by NAMA.  The committee will be aware that the signed board minutes are the official record of each meeting.  I propose to help the committee to explain the position on the preparation of board minutes, which would typically record the following: board members in attendance and apologies in the case of absences, the date and time of the meeting, disclosure of interests, each agenda item considered by the board, the decision or decisions in respect of each agenda item, whether a decision was required, with concise coverage of the substance of the deliberations on that agenda item, any action item arising from a decision and any concern or objection which a board member wishes to record. </p> <p>  The secretary attends the board meeting and takes written notes.  From these notes, draft typed minutes are prepared which record the decisions and the actions decided at the meeting.  As soon as practicable following the meeting, typically two to three working days, the draft minutes are sent to me, as chairman, for review.</p><p>Following the chairman's review, the draft minutes are circulated to the board members for comment, typically within five working days of the meeting.  Board members are expected to revert to the secretary with any comments they may have within three working days of receipt of the draft minutes.  The final agreed minutes, as reviewed by all board members, are then presented and approved by the board at a subsequent board meeting and they are then signed by the chairman.  The minutes approved by the board and signed by the chairman are regarded in law as evidence of the proceedings and of the decisions taken by the board.  There can be only one set of official minutes of meetings.  The secretary then disposes of the written notes taken during the meeting as they are no longer required.  The secretary's notes serve no purpose other than to assist the secretary in preparing the typed draft minutes for circulation to the chairman and board members.  Once the minutes are agreed and approved, there is no reason the secretary's handwritten notes should be retained.</p><p> This is the practice which NAMA operates and which I understand applies throughout the public service and elsewhere in line with best practice in corporate governance.  For instance, the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, ICSA, has produced a guidance note on minute taking, and I refer to the 2016 version, which recommends the following procedure for written notes:  "On balance we recommend that the notes should be retained until the minutes are approved but then promptly destroyed."</p><p> In conclusion, NAMA's procedures in relation to board minutes are therefore very much in line with recommended best practice.  Once a set of minutes has been agreed and approved by the board in relation to a particular meeting then that becomes the record of the proceedings and of the decisions taken at that meeting.  Accordingly, I cannot see what merit there would be in retaining written notes after they have fulfilled their basic purpose of assisting the board's secretary to type up the draft minutes.</p></speech>

The first time Mr. Daly appeared before the committee in this regard, I asked him to provide the minutes and I thank him for doing so.  The minutes are retrospective but it is good to have them.  I wish to refer Mr. Daly to the first page of his opening statement.  He said, "The signed board minutes are the official record of each meeting."  I would like him to state here on record whether there was an off-piste discussion.  I have been privy to meetings where during the discussions, a request was made for the tape to be stopped and a conversation ensued.  It would have been said, "We won't record this for the minutes but let us have a conversation."  I ask Mr. Daly to confirm today that no such discussion took place at the board meeting.  When one reads the minutes one can see a clear decision was made but no rationale has been given.  I am not satisfied with how or where the conversation took place.  I ask Mr. Daly to confirm that no conversations around that took place that were not recorded, as in an unofficial conversation.  He has said that the minutes are the official record.</p></speech>

There are always discussions at board meetings.  I think we went through this the last time we were here.  Certainly, one will have a lot of discussions during a board meeting or any meeting.  The essence of the record of the minutes is to record the substance of those discussions.  It is my view that there is nothing of consequence that was discussed during the board meeting that was not reflected in the minutes.  To go back to the Deputy's point, I presume she said "stop the tape" as an example because, for the record, NAMA board meetings are not recorded.</p></speech>

I find the opening statement to be reasonable.  I have no difficulty with the process of minute taking.  It is reasonable that notes are taken and then transcribed into a draft set of minutes that is sent to Mr. Daly and board members.  I also do not have a difficulty with the notes being discarded at some point as I think it is reasonable.  I have no difficulty with the process.</p> <p>  I have one question that has already been raised.  I am not sure whether it was Mr. Daly or Mr. McDonagh who mentioned in some of the previous hearings, although I think it was Mr. McDonagh, that maybe improvements could be made in how NAMA records minutes, or maybe that is something NAMA could learn from.  I refer to when Mr. Daly talked about what the minutes actually record and number 5 is an area which did not jump out in some of the minutes.  It is an area where improvements could be made.  We have had lengthy discussions about the interpretations of some minutes.</p><p>I refer to better recording of what is said here and concise coverage of the substance of the discussions on that agenda.  I do not think that is exactly what is in the minutes I have seen.  If there was an improvement to be made, I would focus on that.  It is up to NAMA, given that it offered that up.  Perhaps there could be improvements in minute taking.  Where does NAMA see those improvements?  Aside from that, I do not have a difficulty with the process itself.</p></speech>

The improvements to which I referred in my opening statement the last day would certainly be in the area of item No. 5, as the Deputy mentioned.  It has already happened.  If you looked at current minutes, you would see a greater coverage of the substance of the deliberations.  That is the essence of it.</p></speech>

It is certainly clear.  I have only one or two questions about it.  I do not know whether the Chairman will allow me to do this.  In respect of the minutes of board meetings and other meetings, Mr. Daly has clarified the policy regarding board meetings.  There are so many days allowed - periods of time - where they refer to Mr. Daly first.  Presumably, he makes changes to them as he sees it.</p></speech>

Regarding business meeting minutes, which include those two sets of minutes referred to by the Deputy, the policy is to have minutes of them but, effectively, there is no set format because they are just business meetings and everybody has their own style of doing minutes depending on who is taking the minutes at the meeting.  They are business meetings, not official board meetings.</p></speech>

Regarding the specific matter that the Deputy mentioned, namely, the change in strategy to opt for a loan sale rather than the approach that had been agreed previously, it would have been discussed.  There was a challenging of why we were going that way, but there were no contrarian views to the effect that we should not have gone down that road when the opportunity arose.  There would have been a questioning of the figures, pros and cons outlined in the paper, with people perhaps zoning in on particular aspects, but there was no contrarian view that needed to be reflected in the minutes because it was a unanimous decision of the board.</p> <p>  Although it rarely occurs, a specific provision allows for a board member to have a contrary view or particular point recorded in the minutes against his or her name.  We encourage that.</p></speech>

I probably never even saw them and it has been nearly four years since they existed.  It would probably have been helpful to us had there been greater detail in the minutes.  That might have helped this committee.  The committee has the minutes and all of the other documentation that we have sent it, and it must make a judgment on those.  Unless this process has been wasting everyone's time, I hope that members will also take account of the consistent evidence that has been given by all NAMA witnesses during this engagement.</p></speech>

It was a surprise to most of us to discover that these notes had not been kept.  We had seen other detailed contemporaneous notes of lower level or business meetings.  I would understand this in a private company, which does not need to keep as many official records and can do what it likes, but I presumed that State bodies had to keep notes of significant board discussions.  Most people have been surprised that these ones have not been retained.  If Mr. Daly is saying that this is the general practice, this committee will take up the matter.</p> <p>  Each time that the witnesses appeared before us in the past month or so, they referred specifically to their board discussions about the famous 10%.  It was that continual reference that led us to ask them to help us by giving us a copy of the notes, seeing as how the information was not contained in the documents given to the board or in the board's own minutes.  That the notes are not available has put NAMA at a disadvantage.  We are not doubting the witnesses' word, but it would have made life easier for them earlier than this had the notes been retained.  Mr. Daly gets my point.</p></speech>

Ten NAMA witnesses have attended these meetings and told the committee about the 10%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#H04800"><p>We made a point of inviting all current and former board members and senior staff.  The committee will consider whether this is a good policy for State organisations.  Maybe it is, but there is a down side.  Sometimes, the organisations can be put at a disadvantage.</p> <p>  We have asked about two sets of board minutes, including those from December.</p><p>It would be important that Mr. Daly said that everything of substance was recorded and that if it was not of substance it was not in there.  From our point of view it is fundamental that we are satisfied that the official record would be a complete and accurate record of all the decisions of substance.  We are entitled to proceed on that basis.  On the two meetings we asked about, there are two references.  It is on page 111 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It refers to a NAMA board meeting of 8 January 2014.  The last sentence in paragraph three states: "As agreed at its 12th December 2013 meeting the Board noted it would not consider the sale of Project Eagle portfolio of loans for a consideration of less than STG&pound;1.3 billion".  That was agreed at the NAMA board's December meeting.  Page 108 of the same report is entitled "Extract from signed minutes of Board&rsquo;s 12th December 2013 meeting (Private Session)".  There is no reference in that document in respect of the consideration of &pound;1.3 billion.  The January minutes state it was agreed at the December meeting, but it is not mentioned in the December minutes.  If Mr. Daly is now trying to tell me an agreement about &pound;1.3 billion, which the January minutes state was agreed at December, was not a substantial issue, I am at a loss.  Why was that not recorded in the December minutes?</p></speech>

It was a general discussion.  I would refer the Chairman to page 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which states: "The Board agreed to consider the matter of price in conjunction with consideration of the above sales process paper."  I agree with the Chairman that a bald reading of it, one would say: "Where's the decision on the 12th?"  However, there was not a decision on the 12th.</p></speech>

So there are many issues agreed at the board meeting that are not decisions of the board meeting.</p></speech>

The essence of what was said at the meeting on the 12th was as follows.  Because the figure of &pound;1.3 billion was being bandied about - it was in the paper - we did not make a decision on it at the time, but there would have been the comment, "Well look, that's the least we're going to take for this".  Then we went back to this in substance at the meeting on 8 January and that was the formal decision, which is recorded in those minutes.</p></speech>

We were talking about the whole process.  We were talking about the price.  We agreed to consider the matter of price in conjunction with the consideration of the board paper.  Then in the subsequent ones where there is a reference - I accept the Chairman's point - to "As agreed at its 12th December 2013 meeting" that we would not consider it for less than &pound;1.3 billion, but there was no decision at the earlier meeting in regard to that.</p></speech>

We take litigation, ourselves, from time to time.  Obviously, in litigation there is always discovery of documentation.  Discovery allows either side - but let us say somebody is taking an action against us - to discover the records of meetings and decisions.  In that context it is very important that there is no ambiguity about what is the record of the decision - that there are not two sets, that there are not draft sets, that there are not notes.  This would be well realised.  If the Chairman reads through the ICSA document in full, that would be part of the rationale there.  One needs to have one set of minutes, which actually records the decisions as agreed by all the board members.</p> <p>  Yes, they are discoverable.  Yes, they have been tested in court.  I do not think, as I recall, that there has ever been a case in which the minutes have been an issue or found deficient.  I am conscious of the fact that we have a couple of cases that are live, so I do not want to go into any great detail in regard to that.</p></speech>

What obligations does this place on it to retain records?  To put it simply, Deputies would be alarmed if, when dealing with a Department, for example, the Department of Health or the Department of Social Protection, they were told that the notes on how the Department arrived at a decision in a case were not retained or if the chief appeals officer in the Department of Social Protection stated that notes were not kept on how a decision was arrived at.  One would expect public bodies to be able to demonstrate how they arrived at a decision, even though the final decision is the final legal decision.  Does Mr. Daly understand that we, in our daily work, can often get behind the final decision because when we challenge how a decision was arrived at, the Department is able to produce the record?  That is the reason we were surprised that a body as large as NAMA was operating differently from the other public bodies with which we deal.   </p></speech>

If NAMA were to show the rationale, it would demonstrate that.  That is really what this is about because it begs a question that is left unanswered.  That is why I spoke earlier about extenuating circumstances when there is so much money at stake.  Mr. Daly stated NAMA would address the matter in future, which would be helpful because it would eradicate that possibility.</p></speech>

The issue there is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which controls the freedom of information legislation, issued guidance that organisations should have records management policies.  There are certain types of record which should be kept forever, certain types of records that should be kept for a certain period of time in terms of the Statute of Limitations and then there are other records, which are transitory records, which should not be kept.  That is the guidance from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and NAMA is following that guidance.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly is saying that everything of substance was recorded but he made a big issue of the 10% being a major part of the board's discussions and how the board arrived at that figure.  If he is saying that everything of substance was recorded and there is no reference to the 10% in the recorded minutes, it leads me to conclude that the board's discussion on using the 10% figure Mr. Daly says was discussed at its meetings was not a very substantial issue.  If it had been a substantial issue, reference would have been made to the 10% figure.</p></speech>

The first petition is No. P00017/16 from Mr. Aidan Devlin regarding kindness and support to native American nations in times of need, with specific reference to the campaign to stop the North Dakota pipeline.  We have considered the summary of the petition.  As the petition asks the Government to make a statement on a matter that is outside the legislative powers of the State, it is considered inadmissible under Standing Orders.  The decision of the committee is to inform the petitioner under the Standing Orders of the committee that the petition is inadmissible and is now closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The second petition is No. P00027/16 from Mr. Andrew O'Connell regarding direct debit payments for motor tax in all classes.  In its response, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has outlined a number of issues with the possible introduction of a direct debit payment.  It has confirmed that its officials are monitoring the UK's decision to abolish the requirement to have a motor tax disc.  The decision of the committee is to forward to the petitioner a copy of the response received from the Department and to advise him that the committee will respond to this letter recommending that the Department continue monitoring the situation with a view to looking favourably at abolishing the motor tax disc at a future date.  In addition, the committee will liaise with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to recommend that it should continue monitoring the situation with a view to looking favourably at abolishing the motor tax disc at a future date.  We are also proposing to close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The third petition for consideration is No. P00028/16 from Mr. Daniel Lannon and relates to the purported unconstitutionality of the Courts Bill 2016.  The decision of the committee is to inform the petitioner of the decision of the Select Committee on Justice and Equality and to close this petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The fourth petition for consideration is No. P00032/16 from Mr. Eamon Honan and argues that the petitions process should be reformed on the basis that the best ideas are not always the most popular.  It is recommended to deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Order 111C (1)(g).  A petition is admissible unless it is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise constitutes an abuse of the petitions system.  It is also recommended that we correspond with the petitioner to outline the petitions process and that we close the petition.</p><p>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The final petition for consideration today is No. P00033/16 from Mr. Eamon Honan, proposing to change the name of the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Legal Affairs.  The decision of the committee is to deem the petition inadmissible and to close the petition.  Under Standing Order 111C (1)(g), a petition is admissible unless it is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise constitutes an abuse of the petitions system.  Is the committee's recommendation agreed?  Agreed. </p></speech>

This Bill aims to facilitate efficient and effective health information systems in the interests of enhancing our capacity to utilise data and information to plan and deliver safe quality health services.</p> <p>  I would like to introduce myself and my colleagues.  I am Muiris O&rsquo;Connor, assistant secretary in charge of the research and development and health analytics division in the Department.  It is a new division, which was established in 2015, and reflects the importance that the Department attaches to information, research and eHealth.  I am joined by Mr. Kieran Smyth and Ms Louise Kenny from my division's research policy unit.  Ms Bernie Ryan and Mr. Peter Lennon are from our corporate legislation unit which has put the various elements of the general scheme together.</p> <p>  Dr Kathleen MacLellan is the director of the newly established National Patient Safety Office in the Department.  Specific patient safety policy objectives in Parts 6 and 7 are intended to promote a culture in health care where there is open acknowledgement, reporting and learning from adverse incidents when they occur and where health care activity is regularly clinically audited to ensure that areas of poor practice are identified in order to support quality improvement.  These parts were dealt with previously by the then Joint Committee on Health and Children and the points made are being considered in the Department.  Part 9 which forms parts of today&rsquo;s proceedings has the specific patient safety policy objectives to extend HIQA&rsquo;s remit to the private health service.</p> <p>  Given the range and size of the health information and patient safety Bill, I do not intend to go into details on all its provisions in my opening statement but will set out the key principles and also use the statement as an opportunity to briefly outline the broader context of what we have in mind in terms of health information policy generally.  My colleagues and I are, of course, very happy to answer any questions that the members have on the Bill.  I hope that this approach is agreeable to the committee.  </p> <p>  The key objectives of the Bill are to support a number of health service goals by providing an enabling legal basis in the following areas.  The first objective is to support the development of better information systems, information capacity, data quality and the eHealth agenda.  This will be done mainly through the provisions on prescribed national data matching programmes and prescribed national health information resources and by the provisions on setting standards to support the electronic exchange of information and best practice in the management of health data.  Data matching is where personal information collected for one purpose by one organisation is subsequently matched with data collected for another purpose by the same or another organisation.  Health information resources in the general scheme are defined as registries, databases, indexes, etc., that contain personal data.</p> <p>  The general scheme provides for the Minister to prescribe a health information resource or a data matching programme where he or she is satisfied that the purpose is of significant health importance.  A person who operates a prescribed health information resource or data matching programme will be able to require the provision of relevant personal information.  The provisions on prescribed data matching programmes and health information resources are very detailed in the general scheme, reflecting the intention to carefully regulate these areas, and the Minister must consult with both HIQA and the Data Protection Commissioner before prescribing a programme or resource.  The resources and or programmes will operate under HIQA standards.  The aim is to ensure a clear and certain governance structure for the operation of the prescribed programmes and resources in a way that balances the needs of a modern integrated health service for relevant information, which benefits everyone, with the need to have regard to the privacy considerations of individual data subjects.</p><p>Another objective of the Bill is to encourage health research in Ireland.  Health research is extremely important for innovations in health care that can directly benefit the patient and the health system and there are also benefits for the economy in terms of jobs.  EU law already governs research ethics approval for clinical trials of medicinal products for human use and medical devices and the Bill will not apply to that research.  What the Bill will do is to provide for a new voluntary research ethics structure for other health research.  The purpose is to have a more streamlined system and to avoid fragmentation which can happen at present.  This more streamlined system for research ethics approval will be through HIQA-approved research ethics committees.</p><p> There is also a separate tightly controlled data protection consent exemption for certain health research in limited and specified situations.  Only a researcher using the new research ethics approval structure will be able to apply for a data protection consent exemption.  The general scheme provides that the decision on the consent exemption will be for the Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p> The third objective is to strengthen patients' rights in relation to their health information in specific areas.  Measures include ensuring that a patient's health record at the patient's request can follow the patient from one health care provider to another, which is essential for effective continuous clinical care; requiring that the patient is made aware of arrangements for his or her health records when a health services provider is closing down or retiring; and creating an offence in relation to the buying and selling of personal health information by those who obtained it in the course of employment or business or in a professional capacity.</p><p> The final key objective is to enhance patient safety measures.  Patient safety and quality are at the heart of our health services and it is important to keep patients and service users at the centre of everything we do.  Delivery of health care is, however, inherently risky and while it is inevitable that things go wrong, there is much that can be done to prevent harm or error, identify and act when that occurs and to learn from it to improve services.</p><p> I referred earlier to Parts 6 and 7 which are intended to build a positive patient safety culture where reporting and clinical audit are part of the clinical governance agenda and can provide the evidence for assuring the quality of clinical care, drive improvements where required and inform health service planning.  In addition, health professional regulatory bodies and other regulatory bodies will be enabled to share information with each other for the better performance of their statutory functions.</p><p> As the members of the committee will be aware, HIQA has played a major role in recent years in driving improvements in patient safety and quality across a number of areas of the health system, in relation to the provision of services for older people, for people with disabilities and in many facets of our public hospitals.  However, at present HIQA has no role in relation to the regulation of private hospitals.  The Bill being considered today will rectify that situation, bringing the private sector within the scope of the Health Act 2007, allowing HIQA to set standards and monitor performance against them, as well as undertaking investigations in the same way that it does for the public system.  This development is part of the Department's phased approach to regulation in health care, and in particular the introduction of a legislative framework on hospital licensing.  This will involve the creation of a system whereby both public and private hospitals, as well as certain designated high-risk activities, will require a licence from HIQA in order to operate.</p><p> These provisions form part of a number of initiatives to improve the governance and management of patient safety and quality in general.  The national patient safety office, which was established two weeks ago in the Department of Health, will provide required patient safety policy leadership and will lead the programme of major patient safety reforms agreed by the Government last November.</p><p> Before turning to the broader health information policy context, I should say that in its development the general scheme was the subject of considerable engagement with HIQA and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and we will, of course, continue that engagement.  I mentioned the broader context.  As the committee is aware, the health system is necessarily information intensive.  The right information needs to be in the right place at the right time for both patient care and health service management.  If we cannot achieve that outcome, we will not succeed in achieving a health service fit for purpose.  The health information and patient safety Bill is, therefore, part of a bigger information project in the Department.  We have already begun work on a framework for a new health information policy.  The last time that was done was in 2004 with the national health information strategy and much has changed since then.  One of the key issues is about how we protect and safeguard people's health information which is fundamental to building public confidence.  A core part of our information policy development process is, therefore, to examine the different perspectives that exist in relation to greater information sharing in our health system.</p><p> In all of that, we are very aware of the new EU data protection regulation which becomes effective in May 2018.  Unlike most EU regulations, which are self-implementing, this regulation has scope for member states to introduce their own legislative rules on processing of personal data.  It is worth making the point that the inclusion of that flexibility in the regulation is most likely a reflection of the differences that exist in the health systems of EU member states and their information cultures.  The nature of that diversity and the historical, cultural and legal reasons for it are something to be borne in mind when looking at information systems and data protection regimes in other countries, even other EU countries.</p><p> In relation to the health information and patient safety Bill and the EU data protection regulation, it is important to point out that the general scheme was being prepared at the same time as the regulation initiated by the EU Commission in January 2012 was being considered and amended by the EU Council and EU Parliament.  While careful attention was paid to developments on the regulation in the preparation of the general scheme, the latter was finalised before the former and we are mindful of the need to ensure that there is no inconsistency between the two as we progress the Bill.  In that context, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has raised a concern about its role in making the decision on the health research data protection consent exemption.  We acknowledge and understand the point made and we are examining it.</p><p> I hope my opening statement has been helpful and I look forward to the committee&rsquo;s questions.  I have outlined a clear set of health information and patient safety requirements for a framework which will provide for a health system built on a solid foundation of data and information.  The Bill will ultimately allow our health system to utilise data and information to plan for the future and to monitor its performance in the achievement of clinical outcomes and population health.  This health information approach will lead to a health system which is more person centred, planned in line with population need and informed by trusted data ensuring that it has the capacity to benchmark and evaluate itself in real time.</p></speech>

I have one question for him before I open up the meeting to questions from Deputies and Senators.  It is about the concerns raised by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The phrase used was "insurmountable conflict".  The question is whether those concerns warrant an extensive redesign of the Bill.  I invite Mr. O'Connor to comment on that please and then I will take questions from other members.</p></speech>

We are aware of the reservations expressed about section 3 and the data protection consent exemption.  We will work with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to explore other opportunities.  We are also digesting the implications of the EU data protection regulation in areas 4 and 5 in terms of its role in giving advice on the prescribing of data sources and matching programmes.  It is our understanding that the powers ascribed in our legislation to the Data Protection Commissioner are statutory powers the office has in any event.  The concerns are about the perception that the office would be complicit in some sort of consent exemptions or data matching programmes of which it would ultimately have to be an independent arbiter.  We are satisfied that we could remove the role as specified in the Bill and still retain the functionality that is available.</p></speech>

When I referred to extensive consultation, it was extensive at an earlier point in the formulation of the general scheme.  In recent months each party has been respectively digesting and studying the implications of the EU data protection regulation.  From today, we commit to a series of intensive engagements with the Data Protection Commissioner to work through the issues, which we do not believe are insurmountable.  We respect the views of the commission in respect of the role it should appropriately play in the schemes.</p></speech>

Let us say that a GP has built up a practice over 40 years and then retires.  When they sell on their practice my experience is that the price is usually calculated on turnover, how many patients are on the list and what sort of money the practice is taking in, which is only normal.  The same also applies to community pharmacies to some extent whereby the turnover is worked out based on how much the business will be sold for.  How will that fit with what I just read out?  How will we let that sort of thing continue, which is just normal market practice, in light of the statement here?  It could be said that one is selling personal data because there are 100 patients who each spend &euro;60 per month.  Data are essentially being sold there, so how does the statement sit with existing private businesses within the health service?</p><p> The second thing concerns consent and the sharing of information within the health service.  Going back to my own experience, a community pharmacy will have patient records but there is absolutely no correlation to the records in a hospital.  There are always difficulties in clarifying what happens at the GP practice, hospital, primary care setting or community pharmacy, and how that information is collated.  There is a broader issue of consent.  If a patient is discharged from hospital on a Saturday night I would have serious concerns about practitioners, be they community pharmacists or GPs, being able to access information on a patient when the patient has not turned up on that practitioner's doorstep.  People have sensitivities and may not want to visit such and such a surgery because the receptionist is their next door neighbour.  They may not want to visit a particular pharmacy because the girl behind the counter was a student of theirs at school, or for whatever reason.</p></speech>

They do not want people in the community setting to know anything about their HIV status.  With stigma, how do we protect the patient's right to keep that as their own private business and limit the amount of people who can access such data?  Sharing data is one thing, but when one starts putting limitations in does it not all fall asunder because one is not getting good data in and out?</p></speech>

Clients of the practice would be alerted to the fact that it is closing down and would be offered an opportunity to indicate where they wanted their information transferred to.  The money that has changed hands in acquiring the practice, with the records that remain which have not been indicated to go elsewhere, would not be considered as buying or selling patient information.  It would be considered as a continuity of service, I would imagine, in relation to the practice.  The penalties for buying and selling are to bring a lot of rigour and to show our determination to ensure that data collected for one reason are not used or abused for other reasons.  It would not interfere with the transition of ownership of medical practices.</p></speech>

It is designed to address the situation where, if a GP practice is closing down, there is a requirement to inform patients that that is happening.  As members of the committee can understand, it is a long-term relationship with GPs and there is a considerable amount of information built up concerning the patient.  Head 7 is there to address the situation that we feel is relevant.  If a person's general practice is closing down they should be advised of that fact.  Such patients should be afforded an opportunity to make alternative arrangements concerning another GP and what happens to their records.</p></speech>

The question of consent was more to do with who accesses people's information.  One cannot just accept that everybody within the health service will adhere to patient confidentiality.  There is a course there for patients.</p></speech>

At the outset she pointed to the disconnect between information sources and the inability to recognise that the same individual is being referred to.  The individual health identifier which was originally part of this legislation, was taken out and enacted separately in 2014.  We are now commencing the establishment of a base register for the individual health identifier.  That will be a key building block in moving towards electronic health records and in creating the necessary connections.  In that way, the pharmacist will recognise that a client is the same individual the GP or hospital is treating.</p> <p>  The issue of data privacy and consent in the context of electronic health records is one that will require considerable further engagement.  It will be part of broader health information policy as we move towards electronic health records.  A group of European data protection experts believe that in the context of electronic health records, consent is a democratic imperative.  We are minded to ensure that as electronic health records progress, consent will be allowed for.</p></speech>

It may  be known in one area but not in another.  Is Mr. O'Connor saying it will require further consultation to ensure that does not happen?  A patient also has the right not to share information, even though it is handy to share it.  They must have the right to share it only with certain people.  There is a genuine concern about where that information will go.</p></speech>

They were supplied with their drugs there and I had no idea the man was HIV positive.  He deals with me for other aspects of his life.  It is none of my business, it just came up one day.  My point, however, is that he genuinely set about not wanting anyone in the community setting to know that.  How do we preserve that and protect it in future?  That is his right.  It is his belief that there is still a stigma there and it is his choice.  How are we going to protect that sort of situation?  Are we going to block the St. James's Hospital record from the community care person?  Has the Department of Health thought this out?</p></speech>

With the UK model, a patient is basically in full control of what goes into their summary care record.  The patient can also determine who gets access to that and what parts of the record others may get access to.  That concept of self-determination lies at the heart of developing summary care records as well as national electronic health record systems.  It is a recognised key element of that.</p></speech>

Everybody recognises there is some health information that we do not really mind being disclosed, such as allergies or a person's blood type.  That is at one level, but there are certain things about which there must be major privacy considerations and everybody is aware of that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#E00200"><p>I thank the Mr. O'Connor for his presentation.  I would raise two issues, those of clinical governance and accountability.  The general scheme of the Bill states that "The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance creates a framework for better patient safety and quality in Irish health service".  It also states, "However, the Commission recognises that fear of litigation and damage to professional reputation presents a significant challenge for professional bodies in engaging with incident reporting, open disclosure and audit process.  This is supported by international experience".  The reason I ask about this is that we in this committee are also having a discussion, in the context of another item of piece of legislation, on the issue of open disclosure and duty of candour.  The more I read this legislation the more I think it is very unlikely to be compatible with what we are trying to do in the context of other legislation.  When those in the Department were drafting this legislation did they just take into account the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance's recommendations or did they take account of the broader picture of what we are trying to do in terms of open disclosure and duty of candour?  From a first glance at the Bill some days ago it did not appear to be anywhere near where we would like to be in terms of open disclosure and duty of candour in the context of the pre-legislative discussions we are having on the other Bill.</p> <p>  That leads me to another issue.  When we talk about improving the quality of health care here we have an uncanny knack of putting the clinicians front and centre and we always absolve the administration from having any accountable standards whatsoever in terms of an obligation to ensure safe quality health care.  I would instance the Portlaoise report, which was explicit and unearthed some poor practices, to say the very least, in the administration of health.  Are we consistently putting the onus on front-line clinicians, nurses, doctors, consultants and other allied health professionals and yet absolving senior management from having any accountability in the context of potential risks to patient safety?  In this legislation again I believe we are using the professional bodies to ensure clinical governance and accountability.  Is that an area we need to examine if we are to have genuine meaningful accountability?  </p> <p>  It is fine for us as parliamentarians to bring the Minister into a committee and criticise him for an hour or two over something that has happened or blame some doctor or nurse when it is quite evident that it may have been because of administrative inability or lack of ability, or heavy-handedness or short-handedness.  Mr. O'Connor might give his observations on that.</p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of the licensing of hospitals.  There is a great pretence in our health system as we well know.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, visits hospitals, observes some our theatres and requests that the hospitals do their best to improve them and bring them up to standards but, let us be honest, if there was a full detailed audit of our health system, we would be under huge pressure in the morning.  What preparatory work is done in the licensing of our public hospital system in advance of there being a full licensing system in place in terms of an audit?  What assessment has been done of the need to get from where we are to where we must be when a licensing system is in place?  The reason I ask about this is on foot of discussion we have had in another committee on the capacity of our public health system to deal with what comes through the emergency departments and through appointments from outpatient and inpatient departments and the fact that we do not have necessary capacity.  I have concerns about the areas covered under heads 71 and 72 of the Bill regarding the issue of open disclosure and duty of candour.</p></speech>

I will pass the questions on open disclosure and the licensing of hospitals to Dr. Kathleen MacLellan but, first, I acknowledge that the Deputy has raised good points on the responsibility of administrators and managers in health care settings to make better use of information.  I would say that is the key motivation for the health information aspects of the current Bill.</p> <p>  The current situation is one of fragmented data sources, different computer systems with little interoperability and awful lot of paper that goes missing.  These deficiencies raise direct patient safety challenges and they do not service the needs of our clinicians, as the Deputy said, in their administration of care in a professional way to citizens and to patients.  I refer to the provisions around ensuring best practice, as overseen by HIQA in the management of data, in the electronic exchange of data, and the Minister's facilities to prescribe data-matching programmes and health information resources which would operate to very high standards.  These would be a small number of key national programmes that would underpin a much more robust and much more accurate and available information base that would be the responsibility of administrators and managers to maintain and to execute.  That is a key motivation here, that the clinicians and the health and social care professional be supported.</p></speech>

If an administrator who is obliged to do all that is required on HIQA's recommendations does not do that, what accounting procedure for that purpose is provided for in the Bill?  Is there any onus being placed on the individual to do this and, furthermore, if he or she does not do that and it results in an adverse outcome for a patient, who is culpable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.345" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bernadette Ryan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#E00500"><p>I take the Deputy's point that when something goes wrong in health care it is rarely one person's fault and it may be due to a combination of factors and a system failure.  Dr. Kathleen MacLellan would probably have further thoughts on this.  We are moving to a situation where it is incremental and we will get there, but it is taking longer than anybody would want.</p> <p>  To return to the Deputy's first point on open disclosure and consistency, I know he made another point about open disclosure but on the element of consistency in the context of what is in the health information and patient safety Bill, originally it was part of that Bill and it was taken out to progress it faster.  As he will have noted, this Bill is quite a large one dealing with a range of issues.  We were aware that we needed to keep things consistent as far as possible because open disclosure was part of the same package as the external notifications to authorities of an incident.  </p> <p>  On the Deputy's point regarding accountability, as we are moving forward towards licensing, clearly, a worse case scenario for a health care provider would be that the licence would be jeopardised.  That probably brings people's attention very quickly and closely to the need to react and put in place proper practices.  Dr. MacLellan might wish to respond to the Deputy's other questions.</p></speech>

We would view that the health information and patient safety Bill is complementary to the other legislation.  Within Parts 6 and 7, it particularly allows for  the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events to an external agency, and that will be the first time that this will be done.  Similar to systems we have, in the UK - this is part of the legislation there - and in Scotland, Australia and New Zealand, a particular set of, what we would call, serious reportable events or sentinel events would be reported externally to an external agency.  The health information and patient safety Bill provides for that external reporting to HIQA or the Mental Health Commission, as appropriate.  It will be the first time that we will have created such mandate in that manner and that will create a flow of information that we have not have had previously to allow for examination of analysis and learning to the system.  From the establishment of the patient safety surveillance system, which we will work on through the National Patient Safety Office of the Department, this will one will allow a flow of information that will start to help inform us in terms of patient safety issues and trends happening across the system.  That is one element within the health information and patient safety Bill.  In terms of the front-line clinicians and the management, it is important to remember that we have an accountability framework within the HSE and one of the core components of that is around quality and safety, so there is an accountability process within the HSE.</p> <p>  I would like to refer to the licensing of hospitals.  We would see Part 9, which is around extending HIQA's remit to the private health care sector, as part of a phased approach to regulation across our hospital system.</p><p>The licensing legislation we are working on is at an advanced stage and we plan to submit it in a memorandum to government in early 2017.  This legislation will provide for licensing of public and private hospitals and designated high risk activities in the community.  We established a licensing working group, which has met five times in 2016 and includes representatives of the Health Service Executive at a senior level, private hospitals, HIQA, the chief executive officers of the hospital groups and the forum of regulators.  The group has been discussing the capacity of the public and private health care systems to take on the programme of licensing.  This will provide an opportunity to make an assessment against a core set of regulations that will be based on the standards for safer better health care.  In itself, this should move forward regulation within the health care systems.  For the first time, they will be required to have a licence to operate as a private or public hospital.  HIQA will be given explicit powers in the legislation to revoke or retain a licence or impose on health service providers improvement requirements and so forth.  This is a significant step forward for the health system.  The HSE and private health care providers are examining the stage of preparedness they have reached for the introduction of licensing. </p></speech>

To return to Deputy O&rsquo;Connell's first question on information being exchanged on the sale of a practice, due diligence applies nowadays to all commercial transactions.  Does a due diligence process apply when a medical practice is being taken over?  Does the legislation provide for this?  I am not convinced by the answers provided thus far that this matter has been addressed adequately.  Due diligence would involve a careful examination of all the records of a practice before a decision is taken to pay out &euro;100,000, &euro;200,000 or &euro;1 million to take over the practice.  I do not believe the matter is either covered or excluded from this process.  I ask for a response.</p> <p>  Were the processes in place in other countries considered before the plans were made?  In Denmark, for example, patient records have been entirely digitised since 1996 and I understand the number of information technology systems in use there has been reduced to 25, with a view to reducing it further to five.  The health service here uses approximately 1,700 information technology systems.  </p> <p>  I am a little sceptical about the approach to be taken to this process.  In November 2013, I submitted a question to the Health Service Executive seeking details of the number of consultants working in the HSE and the number of consultant vacancies.  I received a detailed response in January 2014, which provided a template setting out the number of consultants in each hospital in each area, the number of vacancies, locums, etc.  It was clear that records were being kept and had been digitised.  When I submitted the same question in November 2016, however, I was informed that this system no longer exists and the HSE was developing a new system module to bring its records up to date.  Why was the system in place in January 2014 abandoned at some point before November 2016?  Information on the number of vacancies for hospital consultants and the number of locums operating in the HSE is crucial for forward planning purposes, for example, to ensure a recruitment process commences before a member of staff retires.  This basic information, which is of fundamental importance to the HSE, was abandoned at some point between January 2014 and November 2016.  While everyone is talking about paperwork, legislation and so forth, I am concerned about how the process will be implemented given the inability of the HSE to maintain such basic information.  I ask the witnesses to address that issue. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr Muiris O'Connor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#F00500"><p>I am not aware of the particular workplace planning information technology system to which the Senator refers.  I have been in the Department for one year.  The issue of the multiplicity of different information technology systems throughout the health and social care sector is of major concern.  As I indicated previously, it is highly fragmented and the systems do not even speak to each other.  Since the adoption by the Government in 2013 of the national e-health strategy, serious and significant steps have been taken to ensure a much more co-ordinated, sensible and mainframed approach to investments in information and communications technologies, ICT.  We have the appointment of a chief information officer in the HSE, Richard Corbridge, who addressed the joint committee recently.  E-health Ireland has been established with an independent advisory group and includes key experts from jurisdictions that are far ahead of Ireland in terms of investments in information technology.  A knowledge and information plan has also been developed.</p> <p>  Increasingly, what is happening under the office of the chief information officer in the HSE is that national systems are being rolled out instead of local, fragmented individual investment in technology.  For example, we have seen a national system that allows general practitioners to make electronic referrals to hospitals.  We have seen a national system being rolled out across hospitals that allows them to get back to general practitioners with notes, test results and notifications.  There is a national approach to digitisation of medical issues.  It makes no sense to do these types of things independently because they are extremely expensive and the systems frequently do not communicate with other.  </p> <p>  We share the Senator's concerns about the inadequacy of the technology base.  It suffered from under-investment over the past decade.  We have much to learn from other countries, including Denmark and Belgium.  The United Kingdom has chopped and changed in this area and we can learn a great deal both from its mistakes and what has worked.  We are paying attention to all of that. </p> <p>  We cannot expect to replicate in multiple sites the type of technological security that is required of any of these systems in terms of data protection and legislative and legal security, and the governance around that.  It is necessary to achieve a standardisation of the governance arrangements and this is provided for in the health information and patient safety legislation with the HIQA standards that will be imposed on prescribed resources.  The Bill also progresses the e-health agenda through its specifications in respect of interoperability and data management standards.</p> <p>  We can look into the specific workforce planning tool that fell off the radar and revert to the Senator on the matter.  However, the case he raises is illustrative of a broader concern of fragmentation that we are genuinely trying to address.  The establishment of the division I head up reflects the Department's appreciation of the need to pull together the different functions relating to information, analytics, research and, crucially, information technology.  I also have responsibility for international engagement, academic engagement and enterprise engagement.  This reflects the need to learn from outside the public health system with regard to how best to implement some of these systems. </p> <p>  Mr. Lennon will address the issue of due diligence in practice. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.352" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Lennon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#F00600"><p>I will follow up on Mr. O'Connor's comments.  If one looks back to 2005, 2006 and 2007, one would be forgiven for believing we were standing at the dawn of a new digital age where everybody would have a cradle to grave national electronic health record.  Some countries spent a great deal of money trying to make that happen.</p><p>In 2009-10 there was a subtle change as people realised that was not as feasible as they might have wanted it to be.  We now have systems that talk to each other such that rather than a big bang what we have is an evolving system.</p><p> Reference was made to the number of legacy systems in the HSE.  As stated by Mr. O'Connor, it is important we learn from the mistakes of others.  Often, it is good not to be first to do something because one then gets an opportunity to see what does not work.  We have looked at the landscape not only in Europe but in North America, Canada, Australia and so on.  The evolutionary approach is the one that has been adopted in the Bill.  Mr. O'Connor referenced inoperability in relation to Head 11 of the Bill.  This is about computers communicating with each other.  In this regard, we are suggesting a standard based system such that there will be clarity for everybody going forward as to how the bits of the puzzle will fit together.  One of the advantages of being where we are now is that other people rather than us have spent billions of euro and made the mistakes which, hopefully, we will learn from.  I hope my response on this matter has been helpful.</p><p> On the due diligence issue, everybody here probably attends a general practitioner, GP.  When we visit our GP we tell him or her things we would not tell anybody else because that relationship is governed by confidentiality.  The information in the records about which we are speaking is personal information.  Under the data protection Acts, the directive or the forthcoming regulation that information is regarded as sensitive, personal information that deserves the highest degree of protection.  The sale of a business which holds information on people's personal health is rather different to the sale of most other types of businesses.  To say to somebody who is interested in buying that business that he or she would have a right to examine the records in order to establish whether the client base in those records was such as to justify a particular price is inconsistent with the principle of data protection.  What we are doing in terms of this Bill is building on data protection concepts.  I do not think it is possible to allow a situation whereby a person who is thinking of a buying a business could be permitted to examine records in order to establish a monetary value on what those records suggest the business is worth.</p></speech>

The due diligence could be around review of addresses and so on.  A person considering the purchase of a practice will want to try to work out the likely future of a practice based on its information on based on patient age profile and so on, which information will also help in reaching in a determination as to what the practice is worth.</p></speech>

To what extent do we compare with other jurisdictions under each of the aforementioned headings?  What information has been requested from other jurisdictions in terms of how they have progressed in this area?  Are we up to speed?  Have we identified the precise areas where we need to improve and do we have the capacity to improve?  Are there any issues arising that have yet to be determined?</p> <p>  The second objective of the Bill is to encourage health research in Ireland.  Health research is an important element of the development and evolution of a health service.  What are the weaknesses in health research in this country as compared with other jurisdictions?  For example, to what extent do we allow modern technology such as e-systems to be incorporated into the research that takes place here?  Do we have access to what prevails in other jurisdictions, not only in Europe but globally and how do we aspire to achieve their levels of efficiency, capacity and response?</p> <p>  The third objective of the Bill is to strengthen patients' rights in relation to health information in specific areas.  In regard to patients' rights and given the experiences of the past number of years in terms of incidents that have occurred, the conditions prevailing at the time, whether or not adequate information was made available, subsequently, to the patient, will all information be made available to patients in future?  Patient rights are applicable prior to and after an event has taken place particularly if the outcome of that event was not as satisfactory as it could or should have been from the point of view of the patient. </p> <p>  Reference was made to the Data Protection Commissioner and to the lengthy engagements between the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the Data Protection Commissioner.  Presumably, the role of the Data Protection Commissioner is to ensure the information is provided to the patient or an authorised person or association.</p></speech>

In regard to where Ireland stands in the international context in terms of e-health and the use of health information, as alluded most EU countries are quite a bit ahead of Ireland in terms of their investments in information technology and how co-ordinated those investments have been.  The UK and Denmark have been cited in this regard.  Belgium also has a very sophisticated system.  The Scandinavian countries more generally operate population registers, which are so comprehensive they do not need to undertake census of population, as we do every five years.  The population registers provide information on citizens' basic characteristics and their interactions with all kinds of State services.  The richness and comprehensiveness of the evidence base available to other health systems is considerably superior to ours.  I am confident that we can catch up on other countries.</p><p>We have a very focused ambition to do so.  Basic but fundamental building blocks such as the individual health identifier are critical differentiators that other countries have had ahead of us.  The UK has an NHS number which is like a bank account number and allows service providers to recognise individuals.  The health information we get includes an enormous amount of metrics generated from service provision.  The individual health identifier will allow us to anchor all that noise against a frame of reference that looks at the impact of all of this service provision on the health and well-being of people in Ireland.  That is a critical move.</p><p> In terms of capacity, I have mentioned the more concerted investments in ICT leadership through the establishment of the CIO's office in the HSE and of my own division in the Department as well as through HIQA and other bodies.  There was sanctioned in 2016 to expand by an extra 49 people to build capability into that.  This is to move from a situation of fragmented localised investments in often disconnected technologies to national programmes of investment.  There is an electronic health record business case with the Department from the HSE that looks at a multi-annual plan to ensure the development of a comprehensive electronic health record for all citizens based on investments in acute and primary.  That shared view for people with a legitimate professional relationship with a citizen for his or her health or social care is critical to better integrated care and the greater integration between primary and secondary care that has been in each programme for Government for the last number of Governments.  We are getting there.  We are making big progress and I am confident that we can catch up with other countries.</p><p> It is similarly the case in health research.  We have some very strong performers in health research in the medical and academic worlds in Ireland but some of the provisions in section 3 will allow us to move into research of greater scale and significance in terms of analysing the impacts of various health and social care interventions on population health outcomes and utilising anonymised data to look at scale.  A great deal of energy goes into doing sample surveys at a small level and that generally does not get us to the global standard we need to get to.  The provisions in section 3 and the streamlined research ethics committees will, we hope, facilitate greater research projects of scale where Irish medics and academics can collaborate domestically and internationally to improve things.</p><p> Patient rights and their awareness of data protection are things we seriously prioritise as can be seen from the provisions of the HIPS Bill.  We prioritise the rights of patients to privacy and to have their data used in appropriate ways only and are very aware that further reflection and, potentially, further legislation will be required as we move to the implementation of electronic health records.  One of the main things that is found in other countries is that even with a great deal of consultation, patients can have little awareness of what happens to their data and of the value of their consent to have data used for health or research.  The CIO in the HSE will develop over the immediate months ahead an approach to public engagement and devising a more practical consultation strategy.  In that regard, a number of hypothetical personas are being devised.  It might be an elderly lady of 75 with certain conditions or it might be a middle-aged person or a young person.  These hypothetical personas are being developed with hypothetical electronic health records so that issues around privacy can be discussed in a much more practical way.  These things are often deliberated in very abstract terms that do not mean a whole lot to the citizen.  We want citizens to know about their privacy rights and to know, in particular, about the value that attaches to them and the public more generally when data can be used appropriately for health research and understanding the outcomes of clinical interventions.</p><p> We were asked about patient safety and Dr. MacLellan will speak more on its enhancement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kathleen MacLellan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#H00200"><p>Broadly enhancing patient safety at scale across our health system is going to require a comprehensive set of patient safety interventions.  We know that from our international patient-safety experts and our research.  To pursue this, we are tackling the issue in a number of different ways.  Within the health information and patient safety Bill we have included provisions to support and promulgate clinical audit, the reporting of the serious reportable events and also the extension of HIQA's remit to the private sector.  This is part of an overall programme of work.  For example, we have already discussed in the committee the proposals around open disclosure and, recently, the planned introduction of licensing for our public and private hospitals and high-risk designated activities.  The Deputy may be interested to know that HIQA and the mental health commission are finalising standards for patient safety instant management which will be very helpful for the system.  They will be published early in 2017.</p> <p>  In terms of the Department's policy commitment and leadership, the Minister launched the national patient safety office last week and it has three programmes of work.  These include extending the national clinical effectiveness agenda and developing the patient safety surveillance system, both of which are highly dependent on good data and good information sets to help build our system going forward.  The patient safety office will further develop and deliver a programme of policy and legislation.  Just today at the announcement of the national service plan, the HSE committed to a changed approach to its management around patient safety to a patient safety programme of work.  We are confident that within that comprehensive set of patient safety measures we will really start to move forward our patient safety agenda.</p></speech>

It is worth reflecting on the fact that the research, development and health analytics division, which Mr. O'Connor manages, was only established last year.  It is great that it has been set up and it is important that its work gets moved on rapidly.</p> <p>  Believe it or not, I am going to come at this from the angle of people with chronic conditions, disabilities and mental health needs.  While they may constitute a minority of those who use the health service, they may make up the majority of the use of its services because they are repeat customers and their conditions bring them back more intensely over time.  Mr. O'Connor referred to hypothetical personas.  Is it possible to put in instead of a persona some particular conditions?  This is just my own anecdotal experience over nearly 40 years of being involved with people with disabilities.  It was the case 40 years ago that a family that had a baby born with Down's syndrome were told they would get 30 or 35 years out of that little fellow or girl.  While those children are now men and women of 35 who still have 20 or 30 years left to live, we know there are things coming down the track with certain other co-morbidities, etc.</p> <p>  In terms of building up a trajectory or a profile of how conditions and people's experience of those conditions move, we have a sense from more developed societies with better health services that one gets a five or ten year window where one can see what is happening.</p><p>I know this from my engagements with organisations in Ireland whose work relates to specific conditions such as muscular dystrophy and Down's syndrome and their counterparts in Europe, North America and elsewhere.  They see what is happening.  It is very important to try to build up these pictures.  There is a tension in this legislation which is mirrored in its Title, the health information and patient safety Bill, which also includes the idea of confidentiality and people's confidence.  We must get this tension or, to use another word, "balance" right.  The health information side of it must not be sacrificed to the other side.  The other side must be properly looked after.  This is where we will make the gains.  I read this morning that the CSO has stated that three out of every five people over the age of 60 in Ireland has a chronic condition and that 13% of people have disabilities of some kind.  This figure can be taken as conservative.  We need to plan on the basis that it is conservative.  People are living longer and surviving more illnesses that would previously have taken them out of this world, albeit with other morbidities and so on.</p><p> The Department has set out four objectives.  The second is to encourage health research in Ireland.  I want to juxtapose this with the third and fourth, which concern the strengthening of patients' rights and the enhancement of patient safety.  This is what I am suggesting in my comments on the Title of the Bill, that this is the tension we need to get right on both accounts.  If we do not get it right on the patient confidence side, we will achieve nothing on the other side.  I will put it this way.  I have polio.  There are people with other neurological conditions.  If one were to pull the files together on the desks of the handful of consultants in this country and put those files into a great machine, one could learn an awful lot - if given patients' gender, age, life circumstance and so on - about the profile of a certain condition and how people's expectations of it and what they can do has expanded over the years.  In one way, therefore, we are close to being able to do something yet we get caught.  Every time anyone talks about doing something about this, data protection is offered as an excuse.  I do not know about data protection in detail.  However, the cancer registry has real information about real people.  Why is it only used for cancer patients?  I am not saying we should not have it at all, but why is this or some similar model not available to help us with all these other conditions?</p><p> We also know that as one problem is solved, we get over the crest of a challenge only to find the next peak ahead.  We should start planning for these things.  We should help organisations and communities that support people with disabilities to self-manage better to have better understandings and work more in partnership with clinicians.  Many organisations we call service providers, that is, organisations for people with specific conditions, are on the cusp of having a very powerful role because they have the confidence of the people and the families, they know their situations quite intimately and they can be major advocates at local and regional level.</p></speech>

I assure him that I will pass on to the HSE his recommendation that, in the context of developing these personas, we will cover the diversity of the population and include disabilities and particular conditions in order to understand how health information might be assembled and shared in respect of those disabilities and conditions.  He is correct about the demographics and many of the challenges arising from the success of modern health systems over recent decades here and elsewhere in ensuring longer life but that many co-morbidities are associated with this.</p> <p>  The issue of the balance between privacy and the benefits of information is absolutely critical and lies at the core of the Bill, and I note the Senator's advice to get this right.  He is correct in what he says.  I am new enough to the health arena but I observe a great deal of caution in the health research community surrounding the use of health information and a kind of intense awareness of everything people believe they cannot do, much of which is unfounded.  There is an onus on us in the Department and on the health service providers to be perhaps more intentional and more assertive in communicating the public value of health information and the fact that information to which personal details are associated, when anonymised, can generate data sets that are of enormous value in understanding particular conditions.  We can aggregate this data at national level.  The Bill before us takes great steps forward in allowing the cancer registry model to be applied to other areas.  Were the Minister to prescribe particular conditions or a disability data set, it would be possible under certain circumstances to develop that information and derive the value from it.</p> <p>  The Senator also touched on patient involvement in the framing of research or research questions and in the contribution to greater collective awareness even of what lifestyles, habits, support, longevity and comfort are involved in the context of particular conditions and which new drugs are impacting in what ways.  This is about the value of health information.  We would like to see this encouraged and expanded for the greater good while of course protecting privacy.</p> <p>  I thank the Senator for his observations.</p></speech>

It is amazing - I think Senator Dolan has powers of mental telepathy because his comments went along the direction in which I was about to head.  I compliment him on that.</p> <p>  My comments relate to a question Senator Colm Burke raised earlier and which I raised previously as well.  I refer to the questions that should be readily available to those interested in the health sector - for example, Members of the national Parliament - and access to this information at the touch of a button.  It is hugely important that this information is collated quickly and drawn together in such a way as to make it valuable in the context of a vision of a health service, particularly when incidents take place.  We will not learn anything from an incident unless people are alerted right throughout the system and all the details are made available.  As a result of that, we would be able to provide a better quality service.</p> <p>  Going back a number of years, regarding the cancer registry, I repeatedly raised those questions, which it was obvious to me needed to be dealt with, regarding the various forms of cancers, the incidents and the profiles.  Eventually the registry was set up.  I do not claim responsibility for it.  Nowadays politicians claim responsibility for anything and even wish to be associated with minor policy details.  The important aspect of the registry is that at the touch of a button the information is readily available, although not yet to the extent I would like.</p><p>I came from the background of membership of a health board at that time and could instantly see the necessity for it.</p><p> To what extent does the Department monitor everything that takes place at clinical trials?  There were controversies years ago about the way they were managed and the regard for the safety of those involved in the trials.  Is the Department satisfied that this proposed legislation makes adequate provision?  Will we gain some further benefit from it?  There is an urgent necessity, as the witnesses have said, for continued medical research in this jurisdiction in order that benefits accrue to the general population.  There is always a tendency to forgo information that might be available because there might be ethical questions about it.  That is where the Data Protection Commissioner and HIQA will have to lock horns in the future.  I would appreciate the witnesses' comments.</p></speech>

That is based on, and driven by, the information that has come from the cancer registry which is critically important.  Earlier this year we published the maternity strategy and were able to pull from several data sets so that we could get a sense of the demand for the system, its capacity and the areas where we needed to focus the key objectives of the maternity strategy.  The sense of being able to create data sets around various diseases and conditions is critically important for the planning and development of our system.  From a patient safety and planning point of view we very much support and see that the provisions of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill will support the growth of those types of information systems.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mary Dunnion, who is director of regulation and chief inspector of social services, and Rachel Flynn, who is our director of health information.  We are pleased to be here today with the Data Protection Commissioner to discuss the health information and patient safety Bill 2016.  I will keep my statement short to allow as much time as possible for questions at the end.</p> <p>  HIQA was established almost ten years ago to regulate Ireland's health and social care sector and to promote quality and safety in services.  Our remit has grown substantially since then.  However, our core activities remain the same, that is to monitor and regulate health and social care services, develop standards, carry out health technology assessments and advise on the collection and sharing of information across our healthcare services.  All of these functions are focused on making services safer and better, providing assurance to the public as to the quality of these services and ensuring that the findings of our work are reflected in decision-making at local and national level.  Putting the needs and the voices of the people who use these services to the fore is the essence of everything we do.  The health information and patient safety Bill is broad legislation that sets out a legislative framework for the better governance of health information and the mandatory reporting of patient safety incidents.  The Bill also includes measures to support clinical audit and provides for the extension of HIQA's remit to private health service providers, including private hospitals and cosmetic surgery clinics.  In this instance, HIQA will be required to set standards, monitor compliance with those standards and undertake investigations.  It is important legislation and we welcome the fact that it was made a priority issue in A Programme for a Partnership Government.</p> <p>  Today, I will discuss the main provisions of the Bill as they relate to HIQA.  At the request of the committee, I will not refer specifically to Parts 6 and 7, which underwent pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the thirty-first D&aacute;il.  Health information plays a vital role in improving patient safety.  Better information means better decisions and better, safer care.  While information plays a vital role in improving patient safety, it is important that information is governed correctly and personal health information is protected.  Unlike other European countries, Ireland does not have a legal framework around electronic health records or a national information governance framework for the sharing of information across the public and private sector.  Personal health information is currently governed by Irish data protection legislation, but from 2018 it will come under the general data protection regulations, which provides for a harmonisation of data protection regulations across the EU.  Notably, health care data under the general data protection regulations will be subject to a higher standard of protection than personal data in general.  Many EU member states will have national provisions that apply directly to the health care sector.  HIQA&rsquo;s health information directorate is currently responsible for developing a coherent and integrated approach to health information.</p> <p>  We set standards for all aspects of health information based on international best practice.  In 2017, we will commence a programme to monitor compliance with health information standards in order to drive improvements in the governance, quality and use of data held by national data collections.  In addition, we evaluate the quality of the information available on health and social care and make recommendations on how to address gaps where information is needed but not currently available.  The health information and patient safety Bill sets out the legislative remit for a number of important health information initiatives and, in a number of cases, assigns additional functions to HIQA, including to the private sector as regards the management of health data.  As required, HIQA will be asked by the Minister to set standards in several areas including for the electronic exchange of health information, the management of health data held by health services, for data matching programmes and for health information repositories such as national registries.  Furthermore, HIQA will be tasked with monitoring compliance with a number of these standards and will advise the Minister and the commissioner on any breaches in this regard.</p><p>However, in respect of the standards on the electronic exchange of health information in Part 2, the HSE will be required not only to follow the standards, once approved, but to report to the Minister on the extent to which they have been implemented and observed.</p><p> Enforcement is covered in Part 10.  Most breaches of the provisions dealing with personal data and personal health data will be dealt with by the commissioner.  However, summary proceedings for offences relating to false or misleading statements may be brought and prosecuted by HIQA.  The proposed health information and patient safety Bill contains many positive initiatives.  However, while it makes advances in providing an information governance framework for the management of health data, it does not address the sharing and collection of data within the private sector.  Moreover, further legislation is required to enable the sharing of electronic health records and advance the eHealth agenda in Ireland as set out in the eHealth Ireland Strategy document.  While there are many benefits to implementing eHealth solutions, there are also challenges, especially in terms of information governance and upholding the privacy and rights of individuals.  Other EU member states address this through legislation to achieve semantic, technical, organisational and legal interoperability.</p><p> Research ethics is covered under Part 3 of the proposed Bill.  A new framework for research ethics governance for research other than clinical trials is proposed.  The intention is to improve the approval process and create a voluntary national streamlined structure.  HIQA is to become the single point of contact for health researchers in its role as the supervisory body for approved research ethics committees.  Proposed national legislation will confer a similar supervisory function on HIQA with regard to research ethics approval for clinical trials.  To enable the efficient operation of research ethics committees it is important that the requirements of the systems of research ethics approval and governance are harmonised as much as possible.</p><p> Under Part 9 amendments are proposed to the Health Act 2007 to extend the powers of HIQA to private hospitals and certain private services with regard to setting standards, monitoring compliance and undertaking investigations.  High-risk services, where general anaesthetic is administered in the treatment of patients, are included.  Based on our research on health care regulation internationally and our experience of regulating services provided and funded by the HSE, HIQA strongly supports the proposal to introduce a system of regulation in the private health sector.  However, it should be noted that the regulatory system in Ireland varies significantly from those in place in other countries with regard to regulatory reach, monitoring and enforcement.  The current programme funded by the Department of Health merely allows for targeted monitoring in high-risk areas.  To date, our programmes have focused on inspecting nutrition and hydration care in hospitals, reviewing how public acute hospitals are tackling antimicrobial stewardship and monitoring the compliance of acute hospitals with the national standards for the prevention and control of health care associated infections.  We have also conducted a review of pre-hospital emergency care services, including ambulances, and an inspection of the child protection and welfare services provided to children living in direct provision accommodation.</p><p> While we believe the proposed Bill potentially provides for greater oversight of private sector compliance with nationally-mandated standards, it is important that Members and the public realise the limitations to the legal powers of HIQA.  The proposed Bill does not confer HIQA with the same powers of registration, inspection and enforcement that we have for the social care sector, for example, those relating to nursing homes and disability centres.  For this reason we have worked with the Department of Health over many years to progress the patient safety licensing Bill, which will provide for the introduction of a more formal programme of regulation to private health care service providers.  Furthermore, it should be noted and understood that the conclusions and recommendations HIQA issues on completion of an investigation are not and will not be legally binding under this Bill.  The extension of HIQA's remit in several areas and amendments to the way in which we work under the 2007 Act will have considerable resource implications.  HIQA will be required to take on a number of additional staff with specialist expertise.  Much preparatory work is required in advance of the commencement of new functions.  For this reason, sufficient staff must be in place at least six months prior to the commencement of any relevant legislation.</p><p> HIQA is generally supportive of the proposed health information and patient safety Bill with a view to improving the quality and safety of care, notwithstanding the reservations I have outlined.  Indeed, it is paramount that this legislation focuses on the patient rather than the institution.  HIQA will work closely with the Department of Health and the Oireachtas to prepare for the enactment of the Bill.  I thank members of the committee for inviting us to appear before the committee.  We are happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

Before I call on Ms Dixon I wish to advise the committee that her statement has been circulated in full.  I understand that you will give us a synopsis, Ms Dixon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.391" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#M00300"><p>Thank you, Vice Chairman.  I thank the members of the committee for the invitation to discuss the provisions of the general scheme for the health information and patient safety Bill, in particular those provisions relating to a proposed role for the Data Protection Commissioner, which is Ireland's national data protection supervisory authority.</p> <p>  I am joined by my colleague, Dale Sunderland, deputy commissioner.  He leads the function of consultation for the data protection authority.  Public and private entities consult and seek guidance from the office in respect of the planned implementation of measures that may interfere with the data privacy rights of individuals.</p> <p>  The 1995 EU data protection directive requires each member state to have a national supervisory authority which must "exercise their functions with complete independence".  This is recognised in the text of the directive as an essential component of the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data.  In the course of infringement proceedings issued against Germany, Austria and Hungary in 2010, 2012 and 2014 by the EU Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union further underlined the requirement for complete independence from government of data protection authorities.  Equally, Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights came into legal force in 2009 and provides for the right of every individual to have personal data protected.  It also stipulates that compliance with these rules shall be subject to control of an independent authority.</p> <p>  The independence of data protection authorities is a necessity in terms of performance of their obligations to hear complaints from individuals who consider their data protection rights may have been contravened.  Where a data protection authority is prescribed a role in making executive decisions of government in relation to specific projects that concern the processing of personal data, it becomes unable to fulfil its primary obligation of supervising the public authorities engaged in personal data processing and of independently examining the complaint of any individual who brings forward evidence that his or her rights have been contravened.</p> <p>  It is precisely this scenario that would arise under heads 33, 34, 35 and 54 of the health information and patient safety Bill as the Data Protection Commissioner would be required to take on the role of the organisations to which the obligations under data protection law apply.  While recognising the important safeguards the Bill introduces in respect of health-related personal data and fully respecting the prerogative of the Oireachtas to enact legislation as it deems appropriate, we respectfully request that the committee give due consideration to the concerns we have raised in our written statement in light of our view that the roles prescribed for the Data Protection Commissioner conflict with EU legislation.  We are pleased to note that the Department of Health, with which we have engaged in recent months on these issues, has acknowledged and is committed to examining the concerns we have highlighted.  Further, the committee may wish to consider if it would be useful to hear from the Department of Justice and Equality on these matters as it has policy oversight for data protection legislation.  The Data Protection Commissioner is aware of the determination of the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure that the commissioner is not only completely and concretely independent in the performance of tasks and exercise of powers as required by law, but is equally determined to ensure that the perception of independence is not compromised or undermined in any way.</p> <p>  Finally, I wish to highlight to the committee - we are aware the Department of Health has also made reference to this point - that a new legal framework in the form of a general data protection regulation will govern personal data processing in the EU from May 2018.  Provisions of this new regulation, which deals with public health research as a subset of scientific research, now set out new potential legal bases for health research without obtaining the consent of a data subject, but subject to appropriate safeguards to be set out in national legislation.</p> <p>  We would be very happy to take questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>

Before I call Deputy Kelleher, I wish to ask Mr. Quinn a question on HIQA.  In his opening statement, Mr. Quinn mentioned the potential resource implications and the need for additional expertise.  I would like to know whether that expertise would be available in the health service, or will we have to go further afield to obtain it?</p> <p>  Second, has he the detail of the number of personnel he would require?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phelim Quinn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#N00300"><p>I will deal with the matter of the resources available within the health and social care services.  I will defer to my colleagues on some of the more specialist areas.</p> <p>  In regard to the proposal for extending the functions of standard setting, monitoring and enforcement, I imagine we would be able to access the requisite knowledge, skills and expertise in the Irish context, without necessarily having to go further afield.  We have been able to meet our current remit in respect of services provided by the public sector and publicly funded services, with small incursions into other states for some of that expertise.  I will ask Ms Flynn to outline the availability of specialist expertise.</p></speech>

We currently do this under our own Health Act, so the expertise would be within the Authority, but because we will be doing it across both the public and private sectors, not just for the HSE but for those outside the executive, we would need additional resources to do that.  The expertise would be within the country and in HIQA currently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.395" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Vice Chairman" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#N00500"><p>Ms Dixon referred to an insurmountable conflict and I would be interested to learn the extent to which there has been consultation and if further consultation would resolve the conflict.  Describing the conflict as "insurmountable", does not sound to me as resolvable.  Is there scope for a resolution or could another agency provide the means to get around this "insurmountable conflict"?</p> <p>  The Department of Health referred to the engagement that it has had with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Was that a comprehensive engagement?  How have we managed to arrive at a situation where there is seemingly "insurmountable conflict"?  The Department of Health created the impression that this can be fairly easily resolved, but Ms Dixon takes a somewhat contrary view.  It would be of benefit to the committee to know whether this is resolvable.  I am particularly interested to learn the level of engagement that has taken place so far to get us to where we are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.396" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#N00600"><p>In regard to consultation between the Department of Health and the Data Protection Commissioner, I think Mr. Muiris O'Connor referenced earlier that it had in fact taken place some years prior to the publication of the Bill.  In fact, that was the case, the consultation took placer a number of years ago.  It was prior to the general data protection regulation being enacted and I think it was also prior to some of the clarifications that have come out in the Court of Justice of the European Union in recent years that have underlined both the importance of and the independence of data protection authorities and precisely how that independence has to play out.  That is the position in respect of consultation.  It took place some years prior.</p> <p>  In regard to recent engagement, post the publication of the Bill, we immediately set about engaging with the Department of Health and pointing out the concerns we have had in regard to the role prescribed for the data protection authority which, as the Vice Chairman said, conflicts with our views on the requirements for independence of the authority under EU law.  As the Department of Health outlined earlier, the Department is committed now to listening to those cancers.  They have acknowledge why we have raised those concerns.</p> <p>  On the question of whether there can be a resolution, Mr. Muiris O'Connor referenced a resolution, I think there can be a resolution to what is required under the Bill, which is that health research can take place with an appropriate legal basis and with the appropriate safeguards.  What he may have been referencing and what we referenced in our written statement to the committee is that the general data protection regulation is now opening up new legal bases for the conduct of health research as a subset of scientific research.  In our written statement, we referenced Article 9 of the general Data Protection Regulation, which sets out the conditions under which member state law could prescribe health research to be conducted in the absence of consent of individuals.  The resolution to the issue is the conduct of appropriate health research in the public interest with appropriate legal bases underpinning it.</p> <p>  In regard to the issue the Vice Chairman raised as to whether there was another agency that could substitute in place of the Data Protection Commissioner, that goes to the point of how this issue could be resolved.  Either in certain instances, alternate legal bases could be used in respect of the conduct of health research that does not require consent or if consent remains the bases upon which the Department of Health views research as relying upon, in that case potentially the health research ethics committees, who are in any case examining all of the provisions in relation to any health research project could take on the role of examining whether the requirement for consent is met or not.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#N00800"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  I am getting a little more confused.  Am I talking about two different Bills, the Bill as we discussed an hour and a half ago as opposed to the Bill now?</p> <p>  At the outset I wish to raise the role of HIQA as set out in this Bill.  I asked questions on the licensing of hospitals and there was discussion around the issue of public and private hospitals.  In the presentation it seems to be the case, that section 9 is primarily allowing for inspections and oversight in the private hospitals system.  I also questioned the previous witnesses in terms of whether there had been an audit done or discussions with HIQA in terms of public hospital and the public hospital system about what they will need to do in term of capacity requirements, investment to get to a stage whereby they will be licensed by HIQA.  I am not sure whether there are proposals in the Bill before us, having listened to Ms Dixon on the issue of the public hospitals system.  I would like to have that clarified because the purpose of today's meeting is to get information but there seems to be slight differences of opinions from the various witnesses on the governance and oversight of the public hospital system, when it will come into play, whether there are detailed discussions.  Mr. O'Brien came before a health committee some time ago, where he effectively said that if there were no further enhanced capacity investment or if we do not change how we deliver health care, that effectively we will not be able to deliver any elective surgery within seven years.  The reason I ask this question of Mr. Quinn, is that if there is to be an inspection process, we will have to have planned in advance to ensure that a health facility will comply with the standards of a HIQA inspection as opposed to having difficulties in trying to deliver health care in unsafe conditions. </p> <p>  I wish to raise issues with regard to the patient safety and pre-hospital emergency care.</p><p>HIQA oversees nursing homes and the disability sector.  The role of HIQA has dramatically expanded since its inception some years ago, which is welcome.  HIQA's work is appreciated by all involved as well as its independence and authority. </p><p> I will reference the question asked by the Chairman.  At what stage does HIQA decide it needs enhanced capacity and additional resourcing to meet its original aim and ensure its expanded role is fully implemented?  </p><p> In previous times we have raised the issue of decongregating the disability sector and for congregated settings to be inspected.  We have received some complaints that not enough discussion has taken place between service providers and HIQA to ensure service providers enhance or comply with the standards.  There have also been calls for flexibility to be shown without compromising patient safety.  My query refers to the public hospital system in general.</p><p> My question on the processing of personal data without consent is for the Data Protection Commissioner, Ms Dixon.  It must be acknowledged that a state should be able to conduct detailed health analyses and research with the information that it has at its disposal to ensure that it can establish the best health practices, promote health and well-being, observe the impact of vaccination plans, etc.  If there is a big body of information available then it surely is not beyond our capacity, as a State, to protect the rights of an individual and the individual's information while at the same time use that information in an anonymised way for the purpose of a State conducting research into health outcomes and identifying whether health promotion policies have benefitted the general health of the population.</p><p>  Sections 33(4) and 33(5) go into some detail about the processing of personal data.  Then the Data Protection Commissioner referenced that the provision is in conflict with rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union.  I refer to the role that was requested in this legislation.  Then she told us that her office has had little discussion with the Department of Health in recent times and that since then the Court of Justice of the European Union has since clarified the role and independence of the data protection held by a State on behalf of its citizens.  Who discussed the matter with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner?  The Department of Justice and Equality established the Data Protection Commission.  I assume the heads of a Bill are still circulated in the normal process to the various Departments.  Did the Department of Justice and Equality express an opinion on this issue?  Was the natter referred directly to the Data Protection Commissioner?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the general data protection regulation, which will become law in 2018, specially sets out in Article 9 that health research can, subject to member state law, be conducted in certain cases without the consent of individuals.  Subject to appropriate legal bases being put in place and safeguards, this is entirely possible.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned anonymised data.  Such data does not come within the remit of the Data Protection Acts.  Once data is anonymised to that level then it is no longer personal data.  What is at issue in many of the health research projects that are considered in the Bill is the use of personal data that is not in an anonymised format where it is necessary to use it in a format where an individual could still be identified.</p> <p>  In terms of circulating the heads of the Bill, they were not copied on any observations that the Department of Justice and Equality would make in response to memos to Government.  I cannot confirm what, if any, position it took when the memo was circulated. </p></speech>

In this case my understanding is that there was a series of meetings in 2012 and 2013 directly between the Department of Health and the data protection authority.  There was no formal sign-off in terms of a designation of a role for the data protection authority at that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.403" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phelim Quinn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#O00500"><p>I will address some of the issues raised before handing over to Ms Dunnion who is the director of regulation and chief inspector of social services.</p> <p>  Possibly what we are dealing with, both in consideration of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, we are also dealing with elements of what exists currently within the Health Act 2007 and the proposed Patient Safety (Licensing of Healthcare Facilities) Bill.  There are a range of issues that are at play and they were referenced in our opening presentation, which Ms Dunnion will talk about.</p> <p>  Critically, there is a clear differentiation even within the current Health Act 2007 about HIQA's role is, under section 8 of that Act, and HIQA's formal role under the Office of Chief Inspector of Social Services.  I ask Ms Dunnion to go into some detail on both roles.</p> <p>  In terms of the workforce planning issue and keeping pace with HIQA's expanded role, function and diversity, we have continuously tried to take a step back on this matter.  It is not always just about getting additional staff into the health information department or additional inspectors.  HIQA is an independent authority that is required to support itself in terms of ICT functions, human resources, finance, etc.  Let us remember that within our functions we must generate income through fees from registrations, etc.  Despite the fact that we are a small organisation that is comprised of 222 people at present, we carry out a wide range of functions.  It is essential that the Department of Health recognises that fact when it resources new and additional functions that we may undertake in the future. </p> <p>  I ask Ms Dunnion to address the issues related to the three pieces of legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#O00600"><p>As Mr. Quinn has outlined, one can draw a line down the 2007 Health Act.  One can consider it in the context of registry services, which is disability and older persons, and with that there is a registration cycle and enforcement powers.  There are regulations that are defined as what a service must have in place.  HIQA does not develop the regulations because they are developed by the Department of Health.  That is designated centres.</p> <p>  In terms of the public health service, we are talking about the acute general hospitals.  HIQA has no powers in that context bar the power to monitor and report.  What determines what we monitor are the national standards for safety and better health care.  While HIQA develops those standards they are handed to Government and mandated by the Minister as the direction of travel for the health service.</p> <p>  If we begin to take a look at the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill in the context of the private health service, as we are currently legislated to, what we would do and all that we could do, and the latter is the important bit, is continue the programme similar to the public service.  The resource requirement to continue to do that equates to eight wholetime equivalents.  The important piece here is that we do not regulate the health service.  We regulate the social services at present.  As Mr. Quinn outlined in his introductory paper, we conduct quality initiatives across the acute service. </p> <p>  The Health Act also gives us the power to investigate.  We can investigate at the behest of the Minister or the board of HIQA and at that time we will make recommendations.  Again, HIQA has no role in monitoring or ensuring that those recommendations are implemented.</p><p>That is the differential.  The HIPS Bill will allow us to go into private health care but we will only be able to do what we currently do.</p><p> In the context of the licensing Bill, HIQA is working in a multi-sectoral committee which is led by the Department of Health and has private health care representation and HSE representation also.  In its preparations in the context of the development of that legislation and, hopefully, to influence its design, HIQA conducted an international review of what happens in health care across all jurisdictions.  In essence, all health care has some from of regulation.  That may be called "licensing".  It can have different names but it is much the same type of thing.  Where it becomes different from Ireland is that it does not have a registration cycle.  Currently, we register an older person's home or a disability centre on a three-year cycle albeit it was extended in respect of disability to five years.  This cyclical approach does not happen in acute health care.  There would be enforcement powers in the context of the licensing of health care but whether those powers should be similar to what is involved in the regulation of social services is a subject that must be examined carefully.  By way of example, it would be untenable to suggest that one would close a hospital.</p><p> We will be looking at the potential licensing of services, which we would very much advocate.  A key thing members should consider is that many licensing agencies internationally have a commissioning service for health care.  That means the national provider will commission a hospital to provide orthopaedic surgery for example.  However, when the provider engages with the hospital, it addresses security around the quality and safety of services.  Currently, that system does not exist in Ireland.  What would enhance any licensing regime but more importantly the quality and safety of services would be if something like that was aligned to the licensing model in Hackney.  In that context, it is impossible for us to describe at this moment in time the resources that would be required for that.  We are actively working with our colleagues on what should be included in a licensing Bill.  We have drafted an expansive paper looking at other regulators and we have considered what it would look like if we were to apply the enforcement regime in designated centres across the Irish health service.  It is an interesting exercise to conduct because the feasibility of doing it is daunting.</p></speech>

It will be impossible for us to even determine at the moment what the resources would be.  However, I know HIQA has the skill to do this because over ten years we have developed that regulatory knowledge.</p> <p>  In the context of disability services, which Deputy Kelleher referenced, I can understand how one gets the perception that on occasions, HIQA is a hard regulator.  What we need to remember is that the regulations determined and described by the Department of Health, with which we have to ensure compliance, and the legislative framework are the most basic one could have.  I would be remiss if I was not doing that.  When I look at the services we regulate in the disability area, I am very encouraged by their excellence.  By way of example, we published 22 reports last week, of which 11 were on really good centres.  Where it becomes poor, it is not always a resource issue.  It is about the concepts of institutionalised care.  It is about the concept that these are citizens of Ireland who deserve the same human rights as any other citizen but somewhere along the line that may have been forgotten.  That is what HIQA does and in that context I do not feel it is a hard regulatory approach.  It is a just one and the right one and it is based on very baseline regulations.</p> <p>  In the context of decongregation of services, we are talking about moving people who have been in residential care for a long time into a more homely and welcoming environment.  HIQA works with providers in this regard, but what we expect of providers is to show us not only where the person may be moving but also how they are rehabilitating people to allow them to transition to the new environment safely.  One of the risks that HIQA is beginning to talk about involves the concept of the regulation of home care.  What can happen as an unintended consequence is that people who have had the benefit of regulation may be moved to an environment where there is none.  One is taking someone from residential care into a decongregated setting, which is positive, but there may be an unintended risk in doing that of moving a person to an unregulated place.  There may be no choice about that.  These are some of the issues that come when one begins interregulation.</p> <p>  There are huge opportunities to begin to look at how we regulate.  Currently, we regulate a centre and people will hear us talking about the regulation of St. X.  HIQA believes we should be regulating services, which would allow us to transition with people into a regulated environment.  We could work with providers and people in the service to improve quality.  I hope that answers the questions.</p></speech>

It is the difficulty I have in terms of the regulation and inspection programmes and all of that.  We talk about clinical governance and accountability.  HIQA arrives in, makes an assessment based on the regulations, but clinical governance is always the one we target in terms of holding people to account.  For example, we never seem to be able to hold the policy makers behind clinical governance or the administrators implementing the policy to account.  While I do not want to make individual comments, it is very often the case that things have been highlighted about hospital settings, including in HIQA reports, but there is never a system in place whereby there is accountability for senior management.  It is always left up to the clinicians and, by and large, that accountability is through the professional governing bodies.  I wonder where we get to a system whereby there is regulation not only of clinical governance and accountability but also accountability for senior management as opposed to clinicians.</p></speech>

I may come back in afterwards.  We have discussed here before exactly what Deputy Kelleher raises.  The buck stops with the Irish Medical Council or the pharmaceutical regulator.  The professional has to answer to his or her body.  We were discussing open disclosure here last week or the week before and the same issue arose about administrative people not having the same stick to be beaten with as a professional.  I do not see anything in what has been said that addresses that issue.  I get the idea of the commissioning and all of that and the service, which are separate things, but how many layers of regulation are needed?  If something goes wrong, does HIQA come in and identify that X, Y or Z regulation was breached and then the doctor has to go before the Irish Medical Council?  Why are so many people involved in professional regulation and does HIQA consider that we are going to move from professional regulation, which has to do with continuing professional development and all of that, to a position where adverse events and issues to do with following guidelines are dealt with in some other way?</p></speech>

I would go back to some of the points that Ms Dunnion made on the scope and limitation of HIQA's role in respect of section 8 of the Act to monitor against nationally-mandated standards.  We have demonstrated both through our investigative work and our review work that, in fact, we can highlight issues not only of clinical governance but in fact issues relating to the governance and leadership of the health and social care services.  There is a very specific theme within the national standards that deals with leadership and governance and that has been highlighted.  It was critically highlighted, for example, through the investigation by and publication of the Portlaoise report where we highlighted deficits in governance and leadership at various levels within the structure.</p><p> Ms Dunnion spoke earlier about how binding or enforceable are the recommendations.  That is a matter for policy makers and, in the absence of a commissioner of care, somebody needs to hold the HSE to account for the implementation of any recommendations we make.  Ms Dunnion made a point about commissioning as a parallel process to the regulation of health and social care and I genuinely believe this is becoming an increasingly obvious deficit.  In the main, a regulator can only make its assessment and recommendations.  It is not normally the case in other jurisdictions that the regulator manages the performance or implementation of recommendations.  In other jurisdictions, we see the commissioner stepping in to ensure the quality and safety of those services.  Critically, it is not just about what HIQA does or comments upon with regard to clinicians and care providers within services.  We have highlighted, and will continue to highlight, the issues at leadership and governance levels, be they at local hospital or hospital group level, and at national level.</p></speech>

On HIQA, I agree entirely with the two previous speakers with regard to the decongregation model.  I do not agree with it in any situation.  It seems to have taken on a life of its own and, like it or not, it is going in a particular direction.  I have serious doubts.  Legislators should have some access to a means whereby questions can be raised and the process can be halted in certain circumstances, or that it could be amended in a way that is more amenable to the requirements of the patients, be they children or people with special needs.</p> <p>  I was a member of a health board during the time of the Grangegorman closure and scaling down process.  I heard all the arguments that were put forward about the aftercare and the degree to which attention would be paid to the alternative provisions that were going to be made.  It did not happen that way.  We have seen some issues arise repeatedly, particularly in relation to homelessness.  Again and again, those issues were not addressed.  I am worried about what might happen in some of the circumstances we are talking about now.  I do not want to name specific institutions.</p> <p>  When considering children with special needs such as educational, physical or sensory difficulties, I am not sure that decongregation will serve them well.  I suppose I am only a passer-by but it has not yet been proven to me that it would serve them well.  Similarly, we should consider hospitals that cater for older people.  I run foul of HIQA on a regular basis in questioning the re-creation of private hospital wards for individuals in all cases.  It does not apply in all cases.  In some of those cases the patients have a collegiality that has existed for years and they rely on each other for support.  From an operational point of view, the nursing staff in such places can observe ten patients at a glance without having to enter ten different private rooms to find out precisely what is happening and it can contribute to the efficacy, efficiency and delivery of a service to the required quality in such circumstances.  I would like to know how we can deal with this in a way that would make us feel, in some way, in a position to influence what happens.  We do not seem to be able to do so.  We were not able to do so in the situations I have referred to.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of data protection.  I cannot allow the occasion to go without having a little one to one with the Data Protection Commissioner.  I opposed the Data Protection Act on its introduction to this House, and that is not today or yesterday.  I opposed it for the very reason and the very fears that eventfully became the issues that have caused this problem.  I foresaw that public representatives would be affected by the Data Protection Act and they are, but they should not be affected by it.  This issue applies to health and all aspects of life.  I am not blaming the Data Protection Commissioner as this is something I pointed out at the time, but we now have a situation where one can readily obtain information by way of a freedom of information request which one cannot get through a parliamentary question.  The primacy of the parliamentary question should go without saying.  We are either in a parliamentary situation or we are not.  There are no circumstances in which a senior, superior or primary body should have access to information that is restricted from the parliamentary system, or our whole parliamentary system is undermined.  I can see all the grounds for friction between HIQA, the health services and the Data Protection Commissioner.  I cannot see, for example, how the transfer or swapping of information will be done smoothly in the future for the benefit of research, patients, quality of patient care, etc., if there is a further process to be superimposed on the system where a person has to go back and forth, on a number of occasions and making a written application justifying their existence, before they get an answer to their questions.  I do not think that is going to work or can work.  I worry about it.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to care for children and direct provision.  This refers again to HIQA, and rightly so.  There have been instances, and like others here I have dealt with a fair number of those cases in recent years.  I saw serious difficulties in the community which were far worse than cases in direct provision.  People were not registered, did not have a Garda National Immigration Bureau number and were floating around in the community while vulnerable, especially small children.  I have come across countless cases, as I am sure have other members, where there may be one parent doing his or her best to ensure that he or she could care for their children.  They are staying downwind of the law, which would be ready to deport them at the first opportunity if they did not have the proper registration, and they are taking risks in the course of this that would not be at all advisable and that would be obvious to some third party.  I am not sure the witnesses can shed any light on that now.  I refer to these issues and compare them with the need for the rapid response, and there are such needs, which are regular and not occasional.  I am interested in hearing the Data Protection Commissioner's comments on this issue.  I could go for a lot longer as the Vice Chairman knows but-----</p></speech>

Decongregation is national policy.  However, the 3,500 people living in designated centres have aged and have developed health care needs, so the concept of decongregation for some of them will not be possible.  As it stands, HIQA would work with the people providing these services to see what is the best environment and also what is acceptable to persons in designated centres.</p> <p>  This emphasises the next point concerning models of care.  A ward with four or five people who have high health care needs may be safer in an environment like that.  Equally, there are people who do not require that level of care.  They may have physical requirements such as being helped to wash or whatever it may be.  Various types of services are required by people whom we are currently regulating.  However, as currently legislated, we regulate what is defined as a designated centre.  That is why I agree with Deputy Durkan that there is now an opportunity to begin to examine the regulation of services.  It means then that design can be more appropriate to what care requirements a person needs.  As it is set up, that is not possible at the moment.  I agree with the Deputy's point, however.</p></speech>

In the opening statement we spoke about our review of child protection and welfare issues in direct provision.  Childhood vulnerability, child protection and welfare issues exist in other settings.  In recent times we have expressed a concern about vulnerability which also exists in circumstances where other vulnerable adults live.  We have been trying to work within the legislative framework we have with Tusla by looking at governance and leadership elements of the national standards for child protection and welfare.  In addition, we examine how Tusla is organising itself to address issues concerning where children in need live and how that State agency is dealing with child protection, care and welfare issues for those children.  That applies to children in direct provision, in the community, children's residential services or foster care services.</p> <p>  Another issue was raised that Ms Flynn has picked up.</p></speech>

As regards the Deputy's concern about sharing information, that is a real issue, especially at the coalface in hospitals.  In other jurisdictions, there is legislation covering electronic health records which not only protects patients' privacy but also deals with consent, sharing information across professionals, and the use of secondary data for researchers.  We do not have such legislation in this country and we feel that is a deficit.  We addressed that point in our opening statement.  It should be included in the Bill and built on the principles of data protection legislation, while going into more detail to allow for the transfer and sharing of data across different professionals that provide care.  We have spoken about research data, but we need data to be shared at the coalface from a patient safety perspective.</p></speech>

His question related to the implementation of data matching and sharing projects.  He asked whether, with a system that has so many steps in it, actual implementation can occur in health research that is in the public interest.  Health research concerns the processing of sensitive personal data, which means it is inevitable that there will be robust processes involved to ensure the necessary analysis is done to underpin the lawfulness of any data sharing or matching that occurs.  However, I do not think that data protection needs to be an impediment to that analysis happening.  The Deputy is correct to say that there could be pitfalls in the implementation in terms of these projects.  However, those pitfalls could centre around data quality, interoperability assistance and other issues.  A big and complex infrastructure is necessary to underpin health research, but I do not think data protection is an impediment.  In fact, this set of laws will underpin carrying out this research in a way that ensures public trust is engendered and maintained as it is conducted.</p></speech>

My response to that is that I have already got prior permission.  The Data Protection Commissioner has issued a document to indicate that when the inquirer has already registered, by way of letter, informing the body to whom he or she is inquiring what they are about, it is normal that the information would be forthcoming.  It does not come in all cases, however.  Even some civil servants have had the temerity to question my authority from time to time.  It would not be a normal thing, but it has been known to happen.  I am sure the Vice Chairman is as surprised by that as I am.</p></speech>

There is a tendency to extend that along the road a little bit, like Lanna Machree's dog, and end up in a place one did not want to go.  In that respect, one may end up restricting information, failing to co-operate and, as a result, some person or system is put at risk.</p> <p>  I am sorry about that, Madam Chairperson.

I want to get my head straight on the licensing of services.  HIQA, therefore, does not have a role in the acute hospital setting.  It was said that a particular menu of services would be commissioned, such as knee replacements.  The Department of Health sets a standard against which boxes must be ticked.  Will it be so prescriptive that two consultants are needed on site to do ten hip operations or will it be a case of hip operations being done to a particular level of outcome without any professional input?  I want to be clear on whether it is the mechanics of it rather than the professional input.  Are these lines blurred or is it all together?  If the Department of Health is not being prescriptive about who does the operation, does it fall down somehow?  I hope I am making myself clear.</p> <p>  The witness was talking about regulatory cycles for nursing homes and mental health services in a social care setting.  Three-year and five-year cycles were mentioned.  When it comes to commissioning particular services, such as knee replacements or whatever, will there be a built-in review?  In that way, it could be checked out in three years.  What sort of protections are there for the operator, that is, the person providing a service, be they private or public?  In that way, the goalposts cannot be changed and it would protect the provider, be it the State or somebody else.</p> <p>  Home care was also mentioned, including moving people - I do not want to misquote the witness - from a regulated setting to an unregulated one.</p><p>I assume what the witness was getting at is that we do not want to do any harm to anyone.  We do not want to take people out of a good place and put them into a bad place.  We are all okay with that.  By saying that, is the witness saying that we are doing that already?  My understanding is that there is very little regulation of care in the home.  There is a correlation there with the idea of funding child care or any sort of care in the home in which the State is giving money to somebody to perform something in an unregulated setting.  For me personally, there is an issue in that there is no governance or regulation of standards.  Is the witness now saying that this is happening and that we are bringing people from regulated settings to unregulated settings?  In light of the witness's comments, have there been issues there already?  What are we doing about this for the future?</p><p> Data and data protection are so important.  We have had so many things happen in the health service in Ireland.  I am delighted that Deputy Durkan has left because I am referring to the health boards.  We have moved from the health boards to where we are now.  We are looking at patient identifier numbers and that sort of model.  Is the Data Protection Commissioner looking at a particular hospital group in which to roll the model out or will it be a national roll out?  Is it a case of seeing how it works out in fixing the mid-west and, from that, rolling it out elsewhere, or will it be a national picture straight off?  Depending on which answer is given, why is that model being chosen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phelim Quinn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#S00200"><p>I will take the issue of the regulation of home care in the first instance that the Deputy spoke about.  That also relates to our articulation of what is happening around moving people out of traditional congregated settings into more community integrated types of services.  In some instances, we have seen people move from those large congregated settings into smaller community-based settings that fall into the definition of a designated centre and therefore remain regulated.  However, in other instances we have found that the models of care that are starting to emerge can involve things like supported housing, in which case the person becomes a tenant within a particular service.  In that case, the care and support services are provided by a provider, but they do not fall in under the definition of a designated centre because it is home care that is being provided.<br/><br/>Our concern is that, at the minute and since November 2013, we have a regulatory framework that affords protection to the people in receipt of residential care services.  We are worried that if people move out of residential care services into home care services, they might be not be afforded the same protections.  In exactly the same way, people who have not been in residential care are in some instances extremely vulnerable in their own homes while in receipt of care from service providers that are providing home care.  I am not saying that as a blanket negative comment on home care provision.  Like any other service, the vast majority of service providers are well motivated.  However, people are particularly vulnerable in receipt of care in their own home on a one-to-one basis.  It is on that basis that we have been asking for the introduction of home care regulation as a policy priority.  Looking at other jurisdictions, we see that home care regulation has been established since well into the early 2000s because of the recognition of the specific vulnerabilities of people.  That includes conventional home care, which is people in what is termed their own home, or people in individual or group living settings who are tenants within that setting and require the receipt of care and support services.  For that reason, we have expressed concern.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Connell also asked about licensing and HIQA's role in, for example, the acute health care setting.  Ms Dunnion might be able to expand on this.  What I wish to highlight from today's perspective is that we are talking about the health information and patient safety Bill and what will be contained within it.  We have concerns because it is not licensing and it is really an extension of our current role and remit within publicly provided services.  Our concern is that while it will provide some level of oversight within those services, the powers that we have are relatively limited.  Under a licensing regime, I believe the powers can be much more clearly defined and, as a result of that form of regulatory model, we may effect greater improvements within services.<br/><br/>With regard to our application of standards and regulations, I repeat that regulations are developed by Government or by the Department.  We apply ourselves accordingly.  Yes, we develop standards within HIQA, but those standards are developed by HIQA for Government to mandate and prescribe to services.  We do not change those services <i>ad lib</i>.  They become the established framework for improvement and are disseminated into the sector.  The sector is allowed some time to those standards.  Another critical issue within a licensing regime is what we call a statement of purpose.  A hospital clearly sets out what it proposes to provide and how it proposes to provide it safely.  It is against that statement of purpose that we regulate the service.  Ms Dunnion might wish to expand on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.443" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#S00300"><p>The only thing I will expand on is the clarity and difference between licensing and commissioning.  Commissioning is not done by the regulator.  It is done by the entity that is purchasing the service.  In this context, that is the HSE.  That contract between the party providing the service and the party purchasing the service has controls as to quality and safety within it.  It may well state how many particular procedures will be conducted and have all of those elements to it.  It is not something that is currently in Ireland but it is in other jurisdictions.  Those kinds of safeholds such as the purchasing of a service, the funding being received based on the delivery of that quality care service and the contractual monitoring of it between both parties are parts of the arrangement made between the party purchasing and the party providing.  What the licensing or the regulator does is assess compliance with the regulations which are determined by Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Flynn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016121400002#S00400"><p>Regarding Deputy O'Connell's query about the roll-out of national systems, our role in HIQA is to set standards in the area of health information.  The Deputy mentioned the individual health identifier.  We set the standards around how that identifier is implemented within the HSE.  We talk about how it should be governed and managed, what privacy should be in place for it and the conduct of a privacy impact assessment, which is standard procedure in privacy by design.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, the Department of Health published an e-health strategy in 2014.  It relates to the introduction of things like the electronic health record, e-prescribing and identifiers.  The office of the chief information officer within the HSE published a knowledge plan that set out the plan for implementing the e-strategy over the next seven to eight years.  One of the projects it is involved in is implementing the individual health identifier.  The Deputy's question is whether it will be rolled out nationally first or whether a proof of concept will be picked.  The idea is that it will prove that it works in a jurisdiction before it is rolled out nationally.  The second area it is hoped to get funding for is around electronic records.  I referred to that earlier.  We need a legal framework around that to introduce it in Ireland.  That is well recognised in documentation produced by the Department.  Again, that would be rolled out as a proof of concept initially and then rolled out nationally.</p></speech>

My apologies for my absence.  We had votes in the Seanad.  My apologies for not being present for all the presentations.  To come back to the comments of my colleague, Deputy O'Connell, on the regulation of home care, I have published a Bill on that and it has been debated in the Seanad.  A very comprehensive report on it was produced by the Law Reform Commission.  The one problem I had when the debate took place in the Seanad was that there appears to be resistance from the Department of Health to progressing the matter.  That is a concern I have.  It is essential that we have that regulation.</p><p>There are now 32 different companies in the country providing home care and, while they are all very good, it is still something we need to do.</p><p> I will refer to the data protection issue and how far we have come.  A number of years ago I spoke to someone who worked in a maternity unit where it was accepted practice that a person living in a particular area could telephone the maternity unit to find out the up-to-date news on Margaret who was in labour and whether the baby was delivered.  It was accepted practice within the particular unit to give out information freely about the progress of someone's labour, but that has now changed and at least we have moved away from that situation.</p><p> Mr. Quinn stated that the framework for the management of health data does not address the sharing and collection of data within the private sector.  Many of the organisations that are providing care for people with intellectual or physical disability are technically in the private sector.  Is he saying that the legislation does not cover them or am I getting that wrong?  What do we need to do if we want to cover the private sector's collection of data?  Do we need to amend the proposal that is before us or is it a case of further legislation being required?</p><p> I will leave it at that because I think most of the other issues I want to raise have been raised.</p></speech>

We have data protection legislation in this area and general data protection regulation, GDPR, is coming down the tracks in 2018.  Other jurisdictions have in place at a national level either an information governance framework that is set out in legislation or very specific legislation around the introduction of electronic health records to their system.  Usually this legislation deals with matters such as consent and the sharing of information across different entities.  The way we are set up in Ireland, we go from public to private.  If a person attends a general practitioner, that is a private entity.  If he or she then attends a hospital, that is a public entity.  If he or she then goes to the pharmacy, that is another private entity.  They are all seen as data controllers under data protection legislation.  To enhance the protection of data for patients, other jurisdictions have implemented more detailed legislation that allows for the sharing of information based on a sound information governance framework and the principles of data protection legislation.</p></speech>

Through our ten years of experience within the sector, we see it as a key or critical vulnerability.  The commencement of such regulation is a policy decision and, therefore, rests with the Department of Health.  However, it is very hard for us to ignore sometimes what it is that we see in our daily activities in the health and social care sector.</p></speech>

I thank all my colleagues for attending for the early meeting.  It is a great honour and privilege for me to take over as Minister of State with responsibility for disability.  I have a long-term vision centred on the rights of persons with disabilities and on focusing on what they want.  That will be the theme of my term as Minister of State with responsibility in this area.</p> <p>  This debate is linked to that relating to the delay in the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.  Ireland is one of the few EU member states that has yet to ratify it.  While Ireland's not having ratified the CRPD is a recurring point of criticism by the United Nations, in addition to many domestic national governmental organisations, it should be noted that Ireland is in many respects more advanced than many other European Union member states in terms of the quality of service and the position of people with disabilities.  In the past six months, in particular, we have been introducing services to ensure people with disabilities have services.  We are planning in respect of signing the convention.</p> <p>  We sign conventions as a declaration of our commitment to seek to apply the convention concerned in Ireland.  We ratify when we can guarantee to our international partners that we are meeting our commitments.  Under the Constitution, while the conduct of international affairs, including ratification of treaties, is the responsibility of the Government, the sole prerogative of legislation for the State is vested in the Oireachtas.  Article 29.6 states: "No international agreement shall be part of the domestic law the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas."  That should always be the case as far as I am concerned.  Ratifying a convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance and to protect the people for whose benefit the convention exists.  We are committed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the convention are met.  I am very serious about that.</p> <p>  On 21 October 2015, the Government published a roadmap for Ireland's ratification of the CRPD.  It outlines legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the convention along with the estimated timeframe involved.  The roadmap for ratification, with a deadline at the end of 2016, shows there is a substantial legislative agenda to be completed across a number of Departments.  It also sets out the considerable work currently under way to deal with outstanding barriers to Ireland's ratification.</p> <p>  On 26 March last, the Government approved the general scheme of the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which we are focusing on today.  The Bill will overcome most of the legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the CRPD.  The Government also approved the priority drafting of the Bill within six months in order to allow for its enactment before the end of the year.  The general scheme of the Bill was submitted to this committee as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  It is published on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality and addresses issues such as the convention's requirements regarding reasonable accommodation and the deprivation of liberty, in addition to removing the archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  The Bill will also establish the independent monitoring and implementation framework in accordance with Article 33 of the convention.</p> <p>  It is intended that Ireland will sign and ratify the optional protocol to the convention at the same time as the convention is ratified.  The optional protocol provides for individual complaints to be submitted directly to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by individuals and groups of individuals, or by a third party on behalf of individuals and groups of individuals, alleging their rights have been violated under the convention.  It is important that the convention does not establish new rights and that issues concerning expenditure are not a barrier to ratification.  These are matters for progressive realisation.  Issues concerning the allocation of resources will always be subject to debate.  I am currently dealing with this in respect of the HSE service plan, which will be announced later today.  It is a matter for the individual Departments involved.  As already stated, service standards and funding are subject to what the convention describes as "progressive realisation" and to the budgetary decisions of the Government of the day.</p> <p>  The Bill is in the final stages of drafting.  There has been a delay and I am very disappointed about it.  The Office of the Attorney General is naturally striving to ensure the Bill will be perfect when published.  Some of the legal issues have apparently presented more complexity than expected and hence one of the major reasons for the delay in ratification.  I made the mistake previously of stating I would have this done by the end of 2016.  I am not in a position today to give an exact date.  I expect the Bill to be published very shortly so as to facilitate early ratification of the convention.</p> <p>  With regard to what goes on in different countries and the relevant legislation, it is important when discussing this issue that we understand that different countries take different approaches to ratification of international conventions.  We take our international conventions very seriously.  We do not ratify until we can guarantee compliance.  The actual position of people with disabilities in Ireland today is in many respects more advanced than in other European states.  I acknowledge we have had a number of years of austerity but part of my brief since taking over as Minister of State has been to try to achieve reform and to invest in services.  We are actually ahead of other countries in regard to providing services for people with disabilities.</p> <p>  From my perspective, three key issues have arisen.  Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 needed to be replaced.  This is being addressed in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, which has been passed in the Seanad and is now scheduled for Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The second issue concerns the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, enacted in 2015.  It needs to be commenced.  The third issue concerns the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is to address all the remaining issues.  As stated, drafting is almost complete.  The Department of Justice and Equality is currently working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General.  We hope to publish the Bill very shortly.  We aim to submit it to the Government as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  The Bill will address issues such as the convention's requirements on reasonable accommodation and the deprivation of liberty.  This will be achieved by way of Committee Stage amendment.  I am reluctant to give a date for publication but we are really moving on it.  I have been working very hard on pushing this issue over the past couple of weeks.</p> <p>  I am very disappointed personally that I have not yet reached my target in respect of the UN convention.  With a bit of luck, we might hit it sooner than expected.  While I am disappointed personally, I realise that there were complexities and blockages within the system.  In the meantime, I wish to give a commitment to colleagues right across all the various Departments to work very hard to invest in services to ensure all people with a physical or intellectual disability will be respected.</p><p>The best way to do so is to ensure that there is quality and proper access to services.  Hopefully, we can then ratify the UN Convention.</p></speech>

I take the Minister of State at face value and believe he is genuinely committed to this issue.  It is a pity that he did not meet his target.  I ask him to elaborate further on the reasons for the delay.  He mentioned the Attorney General and having to deal with complex legal issues.  I am perplexed by what he meant by the term "complex legal issues" and I ask him to develop the matter further.  The several hundred thousand people in this country with disabilities, NGOs and others expect ratification and would be perplexed by his comments.  There is an onus on him to explain the matter further.</p></speech>

There were delays in both the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Health, and in recent weeks in respect of certain aspects of the legislation.  People want to be very sure.  Recently, I visited Galway where I met people from the Galway Centre for Independent Living and Marion Maloney.  Ms Maloney asked me to ratify the UN convention but warned me to be careful to ensure that the legislation was well thought out, planned and unhurried.  When I came back to Dublin, I talked to my officials in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General who expressed the same view that we must get this matter right.  Two of the issues are reasonable accommodation and the deprivation of liberty.  There are also issues with the Supreme Court that I am reluctant to discuss.  I give the Senator a commitment that I will get back to him with a direct answer to his question.</p></speech>

There is a legitimate expectation of a timeframe.  I am worried that the Minister of State is not prepared to commit to a timeframe now.  When he took up office, he was happy to stipulate the end of 2016.  We have reached the end of 2016 but he is reluctant to give a timeframe.  People share my concern about the matter.  I notify the Chairman that I wish to ask a follow-up question after the Minister of State answers.</p></speech>

I will not hang around and I give the Senator a commitment that I will do this as soon as possible.  I hope this will take place early in the new year.  I am still optimistic that I will get some work done on it before Christmas.  Honestly, I have learned since coming into this job that when one adopts dates and deadlines but does not achieve them, one is left feeling bad and that one has let people down.  Six months ago, when I took over as Minister of State, I genuinely felt that we would get this work done by the end of December.  I believe that we will probably go a couple of weeks over that deadline.  I want to ensure that the legislation is put in place and is done properly and professionally.</p></speech>

He has a new portfolio and it is the first time that disability has been represented at Cabinet.  Has he met his expectations?  Today we are debating one specific issue but in terms of the overall  service provision for people with disabilities and what he hoped to achieve under the programme for partnership Government and so forth, does he feel that he has got co-operation?  Has he made the inroads that he expected to make on taking up his position as Minister of State?</p></speech>

It is up to the members to decide if there has been progress.  I believe I have made major progress because I have invested in services and I am transforming them.  I have discovered many examples of bad practice and services, but I am trying to change and reform them.  Conversely, I have discovered many examples of good practice.  My focus is on investment and reform.  I have received 100% support from the Cabinet and I am delighted to have received support from most of the Opposition parties.  I urge members to judge me by my actions.</p> <p>  Today's announcement of the HSE's service plan will see a major footprint of disabilities all over it because we have managed to secure improvements in services, particularly for people with intellectual disabilities, but also for people with broader disabilities.  I love my job every single day.  Over the past six months, I have met over 4,000 people, comprising service providers, people with disabilities and people involved in the whole area, and I will continue with this work.  By the end of December I will have hit my target of meeting everyone who works in the services.</p></speech>

I call Senator John Dolan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#C01300"><p>I thank my colleague, Senator Frances Black, for allowing me to take her slot at this meeting.  I am delighted that Senator Colette Kelleher and other colleagues from the Seanad are here this morning.</p> <p>  I will put this issue in context.  The Minister of State has honourably opened this debate by saying that promised ratification will not take place by the end of this year.  We have received strong and worthy submissions from a number of bodies this morning.  The Human Rights Commission, GLEN and the Centre for Disability Law and Policy have gone to a lot of trouble to scrutinise elements of the heads of the Bill. </p> <p>  I have asked myself now and again whether ratification of the convention is a pie in the sky endeavour and something unconnected to the day-to-day lives of people with disabilities.  I quickly reached the conclusion that it is quite the opposite.  As the Minister of State has said, the convention was adopted in 2006 and was quickly accepted by the Irish State.  Non-ratification is simply no longer justifiable.  I believe there has been an ongoing dragging of feet, which is a disgrace, although I accept that the Minister of State is committed to this area.</p> <p>  There are three hallmarks to disability and mental health and the first two are poverty and exclusion.  They bring a loss of hope for a real life and that is still a fact of life for people.  Austerity still stalks the lives of people with disabilities and their families.  When they see what has not happened after repeated commitments have been given, they do not have a reasonable hope that things will change.  It would be helpful this morning if the Minister of State levelled with the 600,000 people with disabilities, their families and carers.</p><p>It would also be useful and appreciated if he would share his best estimate, his gut feeling, as to why the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has not been ratified given that the timing of its ratification has been repeatedly, and very recently, set out on behalf of the Government.  The Minister of State said that he made the mistake of putting a date on it.  It is not only him who spoke of this; the former Government spoke of this and the current Government has said over the past year that this would be done and dusted.  There are many other elements involved in this aside from the Minister of Sate.  <br/><br/>There are three important aspects to the Minister of State's role in this matter.  The first is that he participates in Cabinet.  My organisation, the Disability Federation of Ireland, has for many years campaigned for a Minister at Cabinet to throw an eye over what is happening across the whole gamut of government.  The Minister of State was involved in the programme for Government negotiations and he engages with the Taoiseach and Ministers on a regular basis.  Given those three aspects, people  with disabilities deserve, if nothing else, some straight talking at this stage.  We have gone beyond hearing the giving of further commitments.  In fact, the Minister of Sate is understandably shy about making a further commitment this morning on the timeline.  These commitments are now debased as a currency.  It is important the political reasons as to why this has not happened are set out for people with disabilities.  Talk of technical hitches in this Department and that office do not cut it any more.  <br/><br/>In putting my question to the Minister of State, I will offer a multiple choice because these are the type of concerns people have raised and are bothered about.  There are four points.  Is the reason the convention has not been ratified down to the fact that there simply are not enough votes in this issue?  Is disability too much of a drag on our scarce resources?  Are there powerful and influential competing interests, or are there more important and urgent issues?  Those are the core concerns and questions people with disabilities and their families have regarding this matter.  <br/><br/>I will support my question, which is underpinned by assertions about which I will be clear, by reference to two areas of evidence.  One I would describe as coming from the mouth of Government and the other one comes from other reputable and independent sources.  The roadmap to ratification document in October 2015 states: &quot;Further Consultations in 2016.  Legislative provisions to be included as necessary in the... Bill, for enactment in 2016.&quot;  A Programme for A Partnership Government states: &quot;The drafting of legislation to address a range of legislative barriers to ratification is underway with a view to putting it before the Oireachtas before the end of 2016.&quot;  On 10 May 2016, an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>stated:</p><blockquote>The Government and Minister for Justice have promised the... Convention... will be ratified &quot;within six months&quot;, according to the new Minister for the area.<br /><br />Finian McGrath, an independent TD and newly appointed Minister of State with responsibility... said he got the ratification into the programme for Government and got &quot;a commitment from Frances Fitzgerald and from that the Government that will be ratified within six months&quot;.  </blockquote><p>Six months from that date was 9 November 2016 to be a little fussy about it.  <br/><br/>On 22 June 2016, the Minister of State replied to a Commencement matter I tabled on this matter in the Seanad and he stated: &quot;When we ratify the convention by the end of this year, we will be making a solemn commitment to the international community that our body of domestic legislation is fully in line with the convention and fully meets the standards required [of the convention]...&quot;  The Minister of State spoke of making a solemn commitment to the international community but what is more important to me is the making of a solemn commitment to the people of Ireland to the 600,000 disabled people, 200,000 carers and their families.  That is the nub of the issue.<br/><br/>On 16 November 2016, the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, stated:</p><blockquote>The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability... Bill is available on the Department's website.  The Bill is at the final stages of drafting and while I am not in a position to give an exact date, I expect to publish the Bill very shortly so as to facilitate ratification of the Convention by end-2016.</blockquote><p>On 1 December 2016, the Minister of Sate in response to a Deputy's question stated: </p><blockquote>...I set myself the objective of ratifying the convention by the end of 2016.  I knew there were blockages to that and I am now getting the feeling that I might not meet my target.  That said, it might be possible to meet it only a number of weeks later.  It will be done shortly.  There are blockages within the legislative process and problems which must be resolved, which is why I have not signed it yet.  I hope to see it done as quickly as possible - in a matter of weeks, in fact.  </blockquote><p>That is an outline of the litany of what we have heard.<br/><br/>I will now briefly set out the facts and figures.  We know there are 600,000 people with disabilities and about their carers and families.  Those with disabilities account for 13% of our population.  Three out of every five people over the age of 60 have a chronic condition or disability.  There are high levels of consistent poverty among those with disabilities, 13% compared to 2% among those at work.  A total of 51% of people are not at work due to illness or disability suffer enforced deprivation, which represents an increase of over 40% since 2008.  Enforced deprivation is not being able to have a bit of meat or fish with one's dinner now and again.  It is not having sufficient heating and other such items.  A total of 30% of people with disabilities are active in the labour force.  That is a participation rate of less than 50% of that of the overall population.  People with disabilities are way more likely to be unemployed.  <br/><br/>Housing is a topical issue currently and particularly yesterday and today.  The Rebuilding Ireland action plan did not even reference the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government's figures of just under 4,000 people with disabilities on the social housing waiting list, never mind make any commitment to do something about it in the next four years.  A third of people with disabilities have been found to leave education before they intended.  We may be ahead of some countries in this area but we need to be where we have committed to be, not just better than other countries.  <br/><br/>I repeat that the hallmarks of life with a disability are poverty, exclusion and a loss of hope to be a real participant in this country.  Austerity is still stalking the day to day lives of people with disabilities and mental health issues.  They have no reasonable hope based on what has been happening with commitment after commitment having been given but this still not being done.  Can the Minister of State level with us and give us some reasonable explanation at a political level as to why this convention has not been ratified by Government a decade after Ireland signed it?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#D00300"><p>I totally disagree with many of the arguments the Senator put forward.  I am well aware of the issues in the disability sector, as the Senator well knows.  I have been involved in disability rights for the past 25 years.  I know about the poverty and the exclusion.  I know the details.  I have spent the past six months meeting all the families again.  I have a strong record in that area.  This is not pie in the sky.  I do not accept that, and I do not accept that I or any politicians in government are dragging their feet on this issue.  I totally disagree with that argument.  As far as I am concerned, I am getting great support at Government and Cabinet levels.  At backbench level and across the D&aacute;il, including from members in this room, I am getting great support to push for the delivery of services for people with disabilities.</p> <p>  As to why this has not been done, I do not believe there is any hidden political reason for it.  Changing a system and implementing change takes time.  The Senator will see those changes shortly.  I will not accept responsibility for the inactions of previous Governments.</p><p>I have been Minister of State for only six months.  I accept I was naive to have set a target of six months in respect of the ratification of the convention but I ask that members judge me in time.  This is provided for in the programme for Government and I am determined that it will be done.  It is a top priority for me.</p><p> In the meantime - this is where I disagree profoundly with Senator Dolan - I am doing my best to ensure that people with disabilities get the services.  Yesterday was a historic day in Cabinet in terms of the &euro;10 million secured in the 2017 budget to enable all children who qualify for the domiciliary care allowance to be given medical cards.  Three months into my tenure I secured an additional &euro;31 million for emergency residential supports.  Within four months, I had established a task force, which is working very hard.  We have managed to secure &euro;20 million per annum from the HSE to take people out of congregated settings, thereby ending the type of exclusion about which Senator Dolan has spoken.  This is being done with the agreement and support of families.</p><p> I am also working hard on other issues.  Approximately &euro;2 million has been secured for pre-activation supports for people with disabilities and social protection benefits, such as carer's allowance, disability allowance, blind person's allowance, widow's allowance, lone-parent allowance and jobseeker's benefit, are to increase by &euro;5 per week.  I went into the talks looking for more but, ultimately, I was happy to I walk away with something rather than nothing in my pocket.  I accept that there is much work to be done regarding children and adult disability services.  That work has commenced.  As I said earlier, people should judge me on the basis of the number of policies I have managed to implement during my first few months in office.  I accept that Senator Dolan is disappointed.  However, as I said earlier, ratification of the convention is a political priority for  me.  There are no political reasons that this has been held up.  The delay is due to complex legislative issues.  We will do our best to ensure that this legislation is top-class and implemented.</p></speech>

I was speaking about the measures which he confidently said he had managed to secure in the context of the negotiations on the current programme for Government.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, is on record on this issue.  I have quoted the position of Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, graciously accepted that the mistake was on his part but in my view it was a mistake by the entire Government and not just him.  My evidence is based on what Ministers have said.  The facts, in terms of people's lives, are based on data provided by the CSO, ESRI and other reputable third-party sources.</p> <p>  In regard to the Minister of State's reference to congregated settings, even if we meet the target of removing 180 people each year from such settings, it will take 15 years to complete the process.  I mentioned earlier that there are 4,000 people on the social housing waiting list.  These people will not even rise above water level in the context of Rebuilding Ireland.  There are serious issues to be addressed not only by the Minister of State, but also by the entire Government, if we are to make progress in this area.  That is the thrust of what I was saying.</p></speech>

I have raised these issues with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  I accept we need to do more in terms of housing, particularly social housing for people with disabilities, and I am pushing for that.</p></speech>

I accept that the intention is to legislate to progressively ratify the convention.  From a cross-departmental perspective, how many officials are involved in the interdepartmental committee?  It is important that, as part of the disability aspect, there is a range of intergovernmental and interdepartmental officials involved.  What interaction has taken place across Departments on issues such as housing, local government, transport and so on?  This legislation, when enacted, will do little unless there is a cross-departmental action plan in place.  Is such a plan being developed?</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to the additional funding provided for medical cards for children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  Legislation to give effect to that funding position is expected to be brought forward early next year.  What is the timeline in that regard?  Is it expected that the legislation will be brought forward as planned?  We appear to be at a legislative road-block on a number of issues.  I accept that the legislative process can be slow but people in this sector have too often been left waiting too long.  It is important that the Minister of State works hard to ensure that some of the targets in this area are achieved despite legislative road-blocks and so on.  There must be a timeline in terms of progress such that people can anticipate better prospects for them into the future.  The cross-departmental aspect is very important.  Without a cross-departmental action plan, it will be difficult to give meaningful effect to this legislation.  I would welcome a response from the Minister of State in that regard.</p></speech>

A range of officials is involved, including those from the Departments of Justice and Equality, Social Protection and Health, and Children and Youth Affairs which are my line Departments.  All Departments are represented on the new interdepartmental committee.  On most days of the week I interact with between ten and 15 people across the Departments.  I also have a special disability adviser, Mr. Gerry Maguire, who advises me specifically on disability issues.  I am confident that the work of the interdepartmental committee will lead to quicker ratification of the UN convention.  As I said earlier, I accept that I may have set too high a target on this issue.  When I took up office, I set 100-day targets regarding many issues.  I like to set short-term targets in the context of achieving things.  I am confident that the convention can be ratified.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question regarding medical card provision, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, brought a memo on this matter before Cabinet yesterday.  This is a priority issue for the Minister and the Government.  I take on board Deputy Jack Chambers' point regarding the legislative process.  The Deputy can be assured that legislation providing for medical cards for those in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance is a priority for the Minister and the Government and it will be brought forward soon.  I will raise the issue of the timeline for the introduction of the legislation with the Minister for Health, following which I will come back to the Deputy with more details.</p></speech>

In fairness to him, the convention was signed in 2007 and so I do not blame him for it not having been ratified yet.  That said, this committee is anxious that it be ratified soon.  As the Minister of State is the person in the hot-seat, the committee would like him to become an irritant within Government and, if told that the matter is before the Attorney General's office, to harass the civil servants to ensure it is ratified.  We are reliant on the Minister of State, who I know is committed to this issue, ensuring this gets through Government.</p> <p>  On the Bill, head 3 deals with the deprivation of liberty.  This is a difficult area.  It is important that people at risk of self-harm are recognised in the legislation.  I am slightly concerned by the Minister of State's statement that it is proposed to introduce sections on deprivation of liberty on Committee Stage.  It is important that the Oireachtas would have ample time to consider such provisions.</p><p> I welcome the fact the Electoral Act 1992 will be amended to ensure that no longer will people of unsound mind be precluded from election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I do not know how that was previously tested.  One area we need to examine in the Electoral Act is the need to improve the capacity and ability for people with disabilities to vote.  During election times, we meet people in wheelchairs or nursing homes who have to go through a process to ensure they get on the electoral register or receive a postal vote.  We need to make it much easier for people with disabilities to vote in elections.</p><p> Obviously, there is also the issue with juries.  People with disabilities have to be facilitated to serve on juries.  While it might be provided for already in legislation, there are practical matters such as gaining physical access to a jury box which is difficult for people with disabilities.  Has the Minister of State any proposals in respect of making it easier for people with disabilities to vote?</p></speech>

I assure him I am trying to become an irritant in the different Departments.  In the recent debate about Irish Sign Language he made the point about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  While I will be the advocate for this in the Cabinet, this issue is important for all members of the Government.</p> <p>  The heads of the Bill dealing with the deprivation of liberty safeguards will be published and there will be a broad discussion on that.  I will raise with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, the issue of ensuring easier access to elections for people with disabilities.  Over recent weeks, I have been working on a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  Difficulties with transport and accessibility to the workplace are an issue.  I will be bringing this to the attention of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  We must ensure everyone with a physical and intellectual disability can vote like the rest of us and there are no barriers in their way.</p> <p>  Last Friday, I attended the Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland resource centre in Clonshaugh.  It raised the issue that loos in public offices are not often designed for people with a physical disability.  We must also ensure legislation is implemented.  There is no point in passing legislation if public offices are not accessible to people with disabilities.  There is a broader issue that if we are serious about an inclusive and just society, we must ensure all people with disabilities are treated like everyone else.  They are not looking for anything more but the equality and their rights as citizens.</p></speech>

I am still waiting to hear about a date for a meeting.</p> <p>  The ordinary rights of citizens are not realised if one has a disability.  I was at a meeting in Cork on Monday about a massive shortfall in access to education in spite of legislation which was introduced.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin raised it yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  In Cork, a child with autism moving into second level education has a poor chance of getting the place he or she needs.  There are 81 classes for children with autism in primary schools, but only 41 at secondary school level in Cork.  Children with autism experience significant anxieties with transitions and this significant change from primary to secondary creates problems not just in Cork, but throughout the country.</p> <p>  That is why the UN convention needs to be signed in order that pressure can be put on all the agencies, including the schools which choose not to set up autism classes because it is within their rights not to do so.  I would like if the Minister of State would put on his lobbying hat.  There is an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill coming through which could strengthen the powers of the National Council for Special Education to instruct schools to offer places with proper settings to children with educational special needs.  A place without a decent setting for a child with autism is not a place at all.  Sinn F&eacute;in, the AAA-PBP and the Labour Party supported an amendment to the Bill which would strengthen the powers of the National Council for Special Education to ensure every child with autism could get a place in a class and take that dreadful anxiety out of the situation.  A child with autism has the right to education, a job, a house and a decent life.  We need the UN convention to be ratified.</p> <p>  I am concerned at the snail&rsquo;s pace in the progress in dealing with congregated settings.  There are people living in institutions throughout the country.  I was responsible for some.  They are not the right setting for people.  People are not exercising ordinary rights.  People have to go to bed at 6 o&rsquo;clock and 7 o&rsquo;clock because of shift patterns.  That is not good enough and we should not accept it.  The UN convention is really important for realising those rights for people living in institutions, children with autism and a whole range of others.  I understand there have been some blockages but there is a huge urgency on this for people throughout the country.</p></speech>

Every school in Ireland, regardless of where one is geographically located, should be inclusive.  I have been in many schools which have opened up and become inclusive for people with disabilities.  There are some schools with appalling records where they blatantly discriminate against children with disabilities, only taking high achievers.  They often tell parents to send their children to the school down the road because it is good for children with disabilities while they tend to be more academic and are interested in points for college.  My vision is for inclusive schools and that every school, where possible, should have an autism department and some section dealing specifically with disabilities.</p> <p>  I will look at the amendment to the education admissions Bill.  What parties were supporting it?</p></speech>

We had a great turnout of parents who were angry and upset.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to ensure those schools which cherry-pick do not get the chance to do so anymore.</p></speech>

I will get more detail on this.</p><p> On the final comment, I am delighted that it was noted that we need to up our game to deal with congregated settings because we have managed to get &euro;100 million over five years, which is &euro;20 million a year.  I feel we need to do a hell of a lot more.  We have bought 50 houses in the past seven or eight months to bring people into smaller residential settings but I have also had colleagues in the House give out to me for taking people out of congregated settings and implying we are forcing them out of places and services.  That is not true.  Everything is being done in consultation with the person with the disability and the family.  There are people in institutions at the moment who should not be there.  I was with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in Monaghan recently where there are absolutely no congregated settings.  Every person with an intellectual disability there lives in a small community house which houses three or four people attended by staff.  There are examples of good practice also and that is the direction in which we should go.  I thank the Chairman for this morning.  I appreciate his work.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State is researching that, he might also look at this Chairman's contribution on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il because Senator Kelleher has reflected all the points I made on that.  She is absolutely right.  Across the board, we believe in the establishment of special class provision in relation to autism.  What we need now is the power of compellability.  That is absolutely required.</p></speech>

I take the point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#G00400"><p>On the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, does the Minister of State know and does he have the detail with him on the number of Acts which will be directly impacted by amendment through the passage of this legislation?  My own count is 11 Acts, but I am curious to know if I have missed out on any having gone through it quite carefully.  I am anxious to know about the promotion, protection and monitoring framework.  According to the heads of the Bill, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will establish an advisory committee the members of which shall have "the lived experience of disability".  It does not indicate the numbers who might be in the make-up of the committee.  Will the Minister of State advise whether numbers have been determined, how soon we can have that monitoring committee up and running and, in terms of the lived experience of disability, if that formula of words accepts the reality of carers and those who have provided supports to people with varying degrees of disability challenge in their lives?  I am interested to know how all-encompassing that phrase is of the numbers to which Senator Dolan has referred of 400,000 and 600,000.  It is not only specific to those who have the personal reality of disability, but to the wider involvement and support, both familial and external.  All these have a unique and particular contribution to make, in the Chair's opinion.  I am curious to know if there has been any fine-tuning of that expectation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.493" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#G00500"><p>The Chairman's figure of "11" is pretty accurate on the first question.  On the issue of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, it is very difficult to micromanage it.  When we refer to the lived experience of disability, we are talking about getting as many people involved as possible.  It includes people with disabilities as well as carers.  I cannot micromanage that and tell the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission about some of its proposals, but the Chairman can take it that since I have taken over, it is about as many people as possible with lived experience of people with disabilities.  In respect of the personalised budget issue, for example, I have many people on that committee who have a physical disability as well as many carers.  For me, "lived experience of disability" refers to carers as well as people with disabilities themselves.</p></speech>

Before concluding and with no other hands showing, I ask if it is agreed that the Clerk should write to the T&aacute;naiste informing her that the committee has considered the general scheme of the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2016 and is of the view that it is extremely important that the legislation be enacted without further delay in order that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities can be ratified at the earliest possible date in 2017.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will so write to the T&aacute;naiste.  We would appreciate if in tandem the Minister of State continued his efforts with his senior Minister in the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure the legislation is enacted at the earliest possible date.</p> <p>  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for the significant work it has put into preparing for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is also to be thanked for its substantial work and effort, as is the combination of groups including the Transgender Equality Network Ireland, GLEN and BeLonG on their respective interests and focus.  All these bodies have provided invaluable information to inform the committee.  That concludes this section of our public session today.  I thank the Minister of State and take the opportunity on behalf of the committee to wish him well for the Christmas season.</p></speech>

The purpose of our second session today is a discussion on these matters with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton.</p><p>The joint committee identified immigration and the refugee crisis as one of its priority issues in the preparation of its work programme for 2016.  The Minister of State may be aware that on 23 November the committee heard evidence from Migrant Rights Centre Ireland on immigration and from Nasc, which is based in Cork, on the refugee crisis.  It is the intention of the joint committee to produce a report on these issues.  We have not yet finally determined whether we will hold any further hearings, but this is a matter for address early in the new year.  The format of today's meeting is that I will ask the Minister of State to make his opening remarks and then invite questions from members.  As this is the Minister of State's first appearance before us as a joint committee - we have had some interesting select committee experiences in the recent past - on behalf of the committee, I welcome him back as the former Chairman of the committee and extend a welcome to his officials who have joined him.  Without any further ado, I invite him to make his opening address.</p></speech>

I know at first hand the important contribution the committee makes to the development of policy on justice issues.  If I or my office can assist the Chairman and his colleagues in the committee in any way with the work they are doing, they should feel free to call on us.  Furthermore, I would very much welcome the views and suggestions of members of the committee on any of the aspects for which I have responsibility.  I propose to focus this morning on the refugee crisis, as the Chairman has said.</p><p>It is clear the ongoing refugee and migration crisis has tested the European Union.  It has tested our capacity as 28 individual member states to respond collectively with one voice and in a coherent way.  It has exposed some harsh realities, among them that the seeds of xenophobia and isolationism have begun to grow in the rhetoric of far-right parties in some parliaments across the European Union and of some media outlets.  These people preach a message of hate and intolerance towards refugees and migrants which is at odds with the very principles on which the European Union is founded.  As we look forward to the 60th anniversary next year of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, I ask myself whether we can really call ourselves Europeans if we do not protect the shared values embedded in the treaties: human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.  These should be the basic tenets which underpin all we do.</p><p>I am very proud that the reaction to the crisis of all political parties across both Houses of the Oireachtas and people who are not in political parties has been proactively to seek ways in which we can help.  By voluntarily opting into the two Council decisions on relocation, we sent an important message of solidarity both to our member state colleagues facing severe pressure and to vulnerable people fleeing persecution and conflict.</p><p>Our course of action has always been to respond in a humanitarian way and to prevent further loss of life where possible.  One of the most tangible expressions of our support has been the heroic work undertaken by our Naval Service personnel in the Mediterranean, who have rescued more than 15,400 migrants since the first deployment of the <i>LE Eithne</i>in May 2015 under Operation Pontus.  Some members of the committee may have seen the programme &quot;The Crossing&quot; on RTE last Monday night.  It showed the crew of the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>in the Mediterranean undertaking vital search and rescue missions in extremely challenging circumstances.  I express my gratitude, and I am sure the gratitude of all present here, to all Naval Service personnel, who have been a credit to our country and the work in the Mediterranean, and I commend them on receiving the European of the Year award earlier this week.  I have met many of these Naval Service personnel.  Their work has had an impact on them that they will never forget, but they have done Trojan work in the Mediterranean.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste and I will continue to work closely with our ministerial colleagues on all issues relating to the crisis and to make our commitments a reality.  As the Chairman knows, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Children only this week travelled to Greece to see how we might expedite the relocation of people there to Ireland.</p><p>As all members of the committee are aware, the main vehicle meeting the Government's humanitarian commitments in this regard is the Irish refugee protection programme.  The programme was established by Government decision in September 2015 with a view to bringing the implementation of our commitments under the EU relocation decisions and our EU refugee resettlement programme activities under a single programme.</p><p>There are two distinct sub-programmes, as it were.  One is resettlement, which entails taking in refugees currently living in Lebanon.  This is a long-standing programme in which Ireland selects refugees for resettlement with the assistance of the UNHCR.  Under the resettlement programme, 519 of our original target of 520 refugees have already arrived in the State a full year ahead of the European deadline.  Initially we were asked by the European Union to take in 272, but the Government has recently decided voluntarily to double this target to 520 to help us meet our commitment to bring 4,000 people to Ireland under the IRPP.  The next 260 persons to arrive under the resettlement programme are expected to come in spring 2017.  The Government last month approved the decision to take a further 260 persons under this strand.  A selection mission will go to Lebanon next spring to select this additional group.</p><p>The second strand we operate is that of relocation.  This is an EU programme which involves bringing asylum seekers currently located in Greece and Italy to Ireland.  Those eligible for relocation must come from countries with a 75% or higher rate of recognition as these persons benefit from a fast-track process to determine whether they are refugees.  While the early pace of the relocation programme was frustratingly slow, 239 people will have arrived in the State by the end of this week and a further 164 have been assessed and cleared for travel in the new year.  Thereafter, a schedule has been agreed with Greece which will see approximately 1,100 persons relocated from there to Ireland from now until September 2017.</p><p>Efforts are continuing to resolve issues regarding security assessments which hampered relocations from Italy.  I met and engaged bilaterally with the Italian officials recently to see whether we could resolve this issue.  I am sure once a resolution is found, it will greatly enhance Ireland's ability to achieve its commitments under this programme.</p><p>As we all know, the work of the programme does not stop once migrants have arrived on Irish soil.  The task of providing emergency accommodation, cultural orientation, long-term housing, medical care, school placements, language training and social protection supports is complex, highly resource-heavy and requires all arms of the State and voluntary sectors to co-operate closely.  The Government has established a cross-departmental task force chaired by the T&aacute;naiste which is co-ordinating the identification of refugee needs.  Bodies involved include the Red Cross, the UNHCR, the HSE, Tusla, the Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection and so on.  This task force is working actively to meet the complex needs of the refugees such as those relating to housing.</p><p>The D&aacute;il motion on the transfer of unaccompanied minors to Ireland who had previously been living in the camp in Calais reflects a strong interest across parties and Independents in helping young people affected by the migration and refugee crisis.  Officials of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Justice and Equality have been linking with the Irish NGOs active in France and with the French and UK authorities on preparations for bringing unaccompanied minors in this situation to Ireland.  The T&aacute;naiste met the French Interior Minister about this issue on 9 December.  In view of the capacity demands anticipated for Tusla, it is working to see how we can meet this need.  It is anticipated the minors will come to Ireland on a phased basis.</p><p>At national level we have implemented the single biggest reform to our international protection process in the past 20 years.  I am pleased to say that the International Protection Act 2015 will be commenced in full on 31 December and will introduce a single application procedure to our protection process.  This is a significant step forward in modernising our asylum legislation from the current cumbersome, multi-layered and sequential procedure under the Refugee Act 1996 to a single application procedure whereby an applicant will have all grounds for seeking international protection and to be permitted to remain in the State examined and determined in one process.  The Department has been engaged in intensive and detailed preparations over the past year to ensure all the necessary preparations are in place to allow all applications for national protection to be processed under the new single applications procedure starting from January.</p><p>I am conscious of the misery and suffering experienced by refugees fleeing war and conflict.  The Government is working actively to play its part and help those coming to Ireland to rebuild their lives here.  However, the scale of the crisis requires a global response.  No one country can solve the problem unilaterally.  This is why Ireland is also working at UN level to develop an international response to this crucial issue.</p></speech>

He started his contribution by telling us that truly to call ourselves Europeans, we must protect and share values embedded in the treaties.  We feel that Ireland has not played a very strong role.  I do not think we could really call ourselves Europeans, given our approach to date, and I do not think we are alone in feeling this way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.505" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>I have a number of questions for the Minister of State.  As he will probably be aware, representatives of the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, and the Irish Immigrant Support Centre, Nasc, appeared before the joint committee recently.  They raised a few questions which I would like to put to the Minister of State.  Last year, the committee made a recommendation on the regularisation of undocumented migrants.  It proposed a once-off, time-bound regularisation scheme which would give undocumented migrants an opportunity to regularise their position.  The committee wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality detailing this recommendation.  However, Edel McGinley of the MRCI noted in November 2016 that no response to the recommendation had been received.  What is the position regarding the recommendation?</p><p>The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child made a similar recommendation and has insisted that all children be recognised and entitled to the full protection and implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, irrespective of the status of their parents.  The MRCI also pointed out that it has been seeking a meeting with the Minister and Minister of State and is wondering when such a meeting will take place.  It is disappointed it has not heard a response from the Ministers.</p><p>Europe has received 6% of the world&rsquo;s refugee population.  Given that such large numbers of the refugees arriving in Europe are from war torn countries and that Europe has been eager to support wars in many of these countries, albeit not always with military support, and given the level of destruction that has occurred in the regions in question, the notion that Europe would only take 6% of the world&rsquo;s refugee population is scary.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s response to the refugee crisis is among the worst in Europe and does not cover the country in glory.  Domestically, we have been slow to address the issue of undocumented persons, of whom there are between 20,000 and 26,000.  I understand that more than 80% of this group are working and most are poorly paid.  What is the logic for not addressing the issue of the undocumented?  The number of deportations is higher than I would like it to be.  Why has the Government not responded positively on this issue?</p><p>The Minister of State referred to security assessments which have hampered relocations from Italy and indicated he has engaged bilaterally with his Italian counterparts on the matter.  It appears that we are engaging in more profiling than many other countries.  Are we refusing to take certain nationalities, for example, Afghans, Iraqis and Kurds?  Are we allowing people from those countries to come here or are we trying to confine our efforts to Syrians?  As I pointed out previously, on our visit to Calais and Dunkirk, Deputy Clare Daly and I found many Afghans and Kurds in the camps.  The Syrians we met in the camps were much better off financially than most of the other refugees.  There is a belief that the Syrians who have reached western Europe tend to come from better-off backgrounds.  I wonder if Ireland is showing favouritism towards Syrian refugees.  I ask the Minister of State to respond.</p><p>Speaking of being good Europeans, the Minister of State will probably have noticed a report in October that the European Union had struck a tentative deal with Afghanistan to return an unlimited number of Afghan asylum seekers.  It is reported that the number to be returned may be as high as 80,000.  One might as well throw these people under a bus as return them to Afghanistan.  The Afghans we met in Calais and Dunkirk will do anything before agreeing to return to Afghanistan, which they left for good reason.  More often than not, they had fallen foul of either the Taliban or ISIS.  Unfortunately for some of them, their families had worked with the US security forces and military and the concept of the family in Afghanistan extends a long way.  The notion that Europe would send these people back to Afghanistan is beyond belief.</p><p>I heard this morning that the European Union is in talks with the Libyans.  Who could the EU talk to in Libya at the moment?  Europe has played a significant part in destroying that country and the notion that people would be sent back to Libya beggars belief.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether this morning&rsquo;s report is accurate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#J00200"><p>I thank Deputy Wallace for a comprehensive series of questions and points.  As I indicated, this is a global issue.  I have met people from different parts of the world, including from Central America, the African sub-continent and further afield, and this is a major issue.  The Deputy is correct to describe it as global in nature.</p> <p>  The first point Deputy Wallace raised related to undocumented migrants.  It is important to consider this issue in the wider context of Ireland&rsquo;s immigration policy and migration flows.  Ireland is forecast to return to net inward migration this year for the first time since 2009.  This is a positive development which reflects the improving economic position.  It is important, however, to be aware that the overall level of net inward migration, which is very modest and amounts to 3,100 persons, consists of three distinct underlying trends.  There was a downward trend of net outward migration of Irish nationals, albeit at a lower level than in recent years.  Migration of EU nationals, which tends to be closely linked to labour market opportunities, was neutral last year.  These two trends were offset by the relatively strong inward migration flow from non-Irish nationals from outside the European Union.  This demonstrates that, in the context of the continuing inward migration of some of our nationals, Ireland has not closed its door on the immigration of non-EEA nationals.  On the contrary, we value the contribution of non-EEA nationals as part of a balanced migration strategy.</p> <p>  The overall goal of our immigration policy is to ensure we strike an appropriate balance between the aspirations of the applicant and ensuring the wider public interests are protected, including that the person concerned does not become a burden on the State.  For this process to work effectively, it is entirely reasonable at this stage to expect that a person should abide by the conditions of the immigration permission he or she receives initially.  For example, a person with a tourist permission cannot settle permanently and, with some rare exceptions, a student permission does not entitle a person to bring a child to live here during a course of study in Ireland.  These conditions are transparently set out during the application process and form part of what may be described as the &ldquo;immigration contract&rdquo;.  This does not exclude the possibility that a person may wish to change the nature of his or her permission.  Procedures and guidelines are in place for what is termed &ldquo;a change of status application&rdquo;.</p> <p>  This takes me to the specific issue the Deputy raised, namely, the position of undocumented persons in Ireland, the number of whom is estimated by the NGO or non-governmental organisation community to be in the region of 26,000 persons.  By definition, it is not possible to have any precision in respect of the true number of illegal immigrants.  The figures I have cited are not insignificant.  The Migrant Rights Council Ireland has identified that these persons fall into three broad categories, namely, visa over-stayers, migrants with unenforced deportation orders and children of undocumented migrants.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, spoke about this issue in the D&aacute;il on previous occasions and I will recall the position of the Government in that regard.  As I stated, we are entitled to expect that people coming to Ireland will obey our laws, including those that relate to immigration, and the conditions that are set out as part of their permission to remain.  It is open to any foreign national who finds himself or herself in an undocumented position to apply to the authorities for permission to remain.  Cases are carefully considered before a decision is made and it is reasonable for the State to expect people to respect that decision.</p> <p>  It should also be remembered that most people become undocumented through their own conscious actions or omissions.  Recognising that this may not be the case in a minority of instances, the Department has implemented a number of projects that provide a process for regularisation in certain circumstances.  However, none of these processes involves automatic entitlement and all apply to a particular set of circumstances as opposed to a blanket approach.  As a former Chairman of the committee and in my current capacity, I am fully aware of the proposal made by the MRCI to introduce the regularisation scheme.  I am also aware that the committee met representatives of the MRCI and plans to produce a report on the matter.  I look forward to examining its report when it is published. </p> <p>  As I indicated, it is important to examine this issue within the broader context of Ireland&rsquo;s immigration policy as a whole.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter with the joint committee today, with a view to contributing to its ongoing contribution on this important matter.</p> <p>  There are no plans to introduce a general regularisation scheme for those who are currently undocumented in the State.  A proposal of this nature could give rise to large, unpredictable and potentially costly impacts across a full range of public and social services.</p><p>For example, in the late 1990s the then Government allowed a limited right-to-work concession for some asylum seekers   This was misrepresented, with the result that the number applying for asylum increased exponentially in a matter of months.  In addition, any possible implications for the operation of the common travel area would have to be carefully considered.  We are all aware and alert to the Brexit situation.  Even today there have been reports that the Republic could serve as a backdoor to the UK.  We must be careful in that regard because we want to protect the common travel area at all costs.</p><p> It is also important to note that there is a long-standing policy and practice whereby when an illegal immigrant comes forward and makes a reasonable case for regularisation, that case is invariably considered in a fair and humanitarian way, subject to overall public policy consideration.  If Deputies and Senators are aware of such cases and want to make that fact known or if there are particular cases, they can be looked at, as happened in the past, on a case-by-case basis.  I am aware of the MRCI projections.  They would have to be carefully analysed and tested by relevant Departments and agencies.</p><p> On the other questions, we do not profile.  What we really want to do is meet the people before they come here.  We want a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to sit across the table from them and conduct an interview.  We want to ensure that whoever comes here will not cause problems and we have made that promise to the Irish people.  The Italian Government has issues with that goal.  It has them with every country, however, not just with Ireland.  We hope to correct the situation but so far it has not been possible to do so.  I have informed the Italian authorities that we are anxious to help, assist and bring people to this country.</p><p> There were bureaucratic issues in Greece.  Last weekend, the T&aacute;naiste visited the country in order to see if some of them might be resolved.  We are anxious to fulfil our commitment to bring 4,000 people here.  The EU quota for Ireland was 2,900 refugees but we have greatly exceeded that target and have voluntarily agreed to bring in 4,000 refugees.  We have tried to be as proactive as possible.  We want to bring people here and we are bringing them.  Thankfully, the situation in Greece has been resolved and the situation is improving.  We hope to bring in an increasing number of refugees in the next year.  We hope to bring 1,100 refugees from Greece by next September.  We have already doubled the EU quota a year ahead of time and taken in refugees from the Lebanon.  We have doubled that figure again and we will bring in quite a lot more refugees in the coming period.  We are doing what we can to bring refugees here.</p></speech>

I would like an update on the proposal to bring in 200 unaccompanied minors that were originally based in Calais.  Last week, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality stated that the French would identify young people as suitable to go to Ireland.  What is meant by the term "suitable"?</p> <p>  I draw the Minister of State's attention to a comment made by Ms Fiona Finn, NASC.  She said, speaking of feedback that NASC has received, that it is much easier to get a positive decision for a female, particularly a female Christian, that the cases of males are more challenging and that the majority of the decisions on new Muslim males are negative.  She also said that this is never overt but, rather, covert.  She claims it is a form of discrimination and that profiling is involved.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to my points.</p></speech>

On the Calais situation, when the decision was taken in the D&aacute;il, the French authorities had already moved people from Calais to accommodation located across France.  The officials from my Department and that of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs have engaged with the NGOs who raised this matter with us.  I have met some of the NGO representatives as well.  We have engaged with the French authorities to see what can be done.  We also want to ensure that we can look after children properly when they come here, in other words, that Tusla will have the appropriate facilities.  We are talking, in the main, about providing foster care for children or minors.  My Department must work with our colleagues in France, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  My Department's role is to provide a legal mechanism for children.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla have the responsibility to look after the children when they come here and to engage with them in France.  We are anxious to have proper foster homes arranged for when the children arrive.</p> <p>  As the D&aacute;il motion, to which everyone agreed, outlined, we want to identify children who want to come here and stay but who do not want to go to the UK.  Most of the children or young people were in Calais because they wanted to travel to the UK.  That is why they were there in the first instance.  There are some challenges in respect of this matter.  We will bring up to 200 people here, which is what was agreed by the D&aacute;il, and they will stay here.  This will be done in co-operation with the French authorities.  There is no profiling, or anything like it, involved.  Ideally, we want to bring in younger people who are in their early teens or pre-teens because they are young enough to settle into families.  Older teens would find it more difficult to settle.  I have been informed that many of the people that were in Calais were older teens.  They may not want to come to Ireland and prefer the UK.</p> <p>  We are trying to work through the many challenges.  I will keep the committee updated on progress on these matters because I was quite involved in the negotiations and work to have the motion passed in the D&aacute;il and agreed.  We will charter a plane to bring a further 130 people to this country on Friday.  Part of the challenge has been transport, particularly as Ireland is an island.  It is challenging to find transport links to transfer people from Lebanon and Greece to Ireland.  Sometimes getting flights can be a challenge.  It is hard to secure seats on planes during the high season of tourism.  We have decided to charter planes to transport people here and 130 individuals will come here on Friday.  I hope I have answered the questions.</p> <p>  I can confirm that profiling does not take place.  We must ensure, to the best of our ability, that we do not bring somebody in here who has links with well known organisations or a tendency to take a terrorism route.  We would have issues with those kind of indications.  That is why we want the Garda to interview people in order to ascertain whether the refugees will pose problems.  In the vast majority of cases, these people pose no problem but we must make sure.  We must be able to say to the people of Ireland that we have carried out a minimum of security checks on those involved.  We would face challenges if we did not do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.513" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#K00700"><p>I am not saying that security checks should not take place.  The people we met in Calais and Dunkirk ran away from militant organisations so I have no worries about them coming here.  Most of the people who travelled to Calais did so with the hope of getting to the UK.  Many of those we met did not have connections in England.  They simply liked the idea of settling in an English-speaking country and had never heard of Ireland.  When we spoke to them about Ireland, many of them became interested in coming here.  Some of them remained interested in the UK but some of them were very interested in travelling to Ireland.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has said that various Departments would incur serious costs in order to regularise the undocumented.  We have no doubt that looking after people that are most in need of our help will always cost something.  There is a huge onus on us to do the right thing.  We find money to do certain things and we make choices about the money available to us.</p><p>I always insist that the primary objective of a government should be to take best care of those who most need its help, and the undocumented in Ireland could do with our help, even if it does cost us a few bob.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.515" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#L00200"><p>We have been engaging with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland on this issue and it has amended some of its original suggestions on that basis.  We will continue to engage with it.  If there are undocumented people of whom colleagues are aware, they can draw our attention to them on a case-by-case basis and we will examine them.  If members have the names of anyone in Calais, which the Deputy spoke about, who wish to come here they should pass them on to us and we will investigate them.  The issue now is to locate and identify some of the people who want to come here.</p> <p>  I refer to minors.  The motion in the D&aacute;il related to minors and if one brings in a person aged over 18, he or she is an adult.  There are also definitions about what is an unaccompanied minor.  In some places it means being without a mother or father, but in other places it means without any family member.  A minor with a grandmother, older sibling or aunt might not be classified as unaccompanied, as such, so issues arise in that regard also.  I welcome the suggestions made by the Deputy and the suggestions of other members present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#L00300"><p>I wish to make a couple of brief points.  First, I note the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on undocumented minors that we expect them to adhere to their original visa conditions but is there not a double standard given the approach we take to the Americans?  We go cap in hand and expect the undocumented Irish in America to have their status legitimised but we do not adopt the same position with people of various nationalities who end up in Ireland.  As Deputy Wallace said, most of them are not getting any benefits from the system and they are surviving on the charity or support of friends they have made along the way or primarily through working and providing a pool of cheap labour.  If we were to legitimise their status, there would be a knock-on benefit in that they would contribute in terms of tax and other elements of the system.  The benefit would be positive as more than 80% of such people are working here.  It is not a case that if we become liberal on the issue, people would come here from all over the place.</p> <p>  While there must be a process, the reality is that it has been very difficult for people who perhaps have been trying to bring in a family member or for those who have developed a relationship in this country and want the opportunity to stay to further a personal relationship with a partner.  It has been most difficult for people to get their status legitimised.  We were not members of the previous justice committee but the Minister of State was and he probably agrees with the points we are making.  The committee recommended that certain measures would be put in place to deal with the categories the Minister of State has outlined, namely, the people who are here, who are integrated.  They are a reality but we just keep them hidden and do not accept them.  We will return to the issue because we cannot have it both ways and argue one thing in Ireland and one thing in America.  That is a very important issue the committee will pursue.</p> <p>  We have not spoken about direct provision but the Minister of State responded to a parliamentary question I tabled about the number of children in direct provision.  I asked the question given that we are coming up to Christmas and the figures are quite shocking.  More than 1,100 children are living in direct provision.  A total of 425 of them are aged under five and 514 are aged under 12.  The situation is very difficult and there is a need to address it and to integrate people properly into society.  Parents who have been in direct provision for a long time make the point that while it is hard when the children are going to school, at least they are going to school and there is something for them to do, but when they leave school and cannot go to college they are stuck there and frustrated.  Their talents are not being recognised.  That is a critically important problem that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  I have a couple of other very brief points to make.  There is a view that while we have had a lot of talk about going way beyond what has been asked of us, we have not delivered on the refugee targets.  The resettlement scheme from Lebanon is taking a long time to achieve.  We have finally got some people coming here but that is a long established programme.  I am keen to hear about the relocation programme of 4,000 people.  Are the 630 people who have arrived under the relocation programme as distinct from the resettlement programme in Lebanon?</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that we are bringing in a chartered plane but it has been a long time coming.  In reality, we are behind our targets of getting people on the ground.  While we are talking about it, in essence, the asylum process in this country has shut down.  We are refusing the highest level of asylum seekers in the EU other than refugees that we are bringing in from Turkey, Lebanon or other places.  People who arrive here seeking refuge are being refused in huge numbers.  More than 3,500 people were deported last year.  As Deputy Wallace said, we get relatively small numbers of asylum seekers.  There is a view that processes are being put in place to, in effect, shut down the appeals process for asylum seekers and it is most difficult to succeed.  The EUROSTAT figures do not show Ireland in a favourable light.</p> <p>  My final point is on Calais.  I appreciate the Minister of State's role in delivering on the motion that was before the House.  I very much recognise that.  It is an initiative Members on many sides of the House want to see delivered.  While we feel very strongly about unaccompanied children in Calais, there are also unaccompanied children and other refugees in Greece, Italy and other places.  We cannot just elevate Calais and lose sight of the bigger picture.  The processes need to be in place to deal with the issue in its totality.  What level of dialogue takes place with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on the issue?  I am worried that we are not sufficiently equipped to deal with the issue.  We have a very poor history in terms of taking unaccompanied minors into this country and the type of accommodation they were put into.  Traditionally, there has been a very low level of care.  Care assessments were cursory.  Many minors were housed in hostels and did not even have a social worker.  That has been completely stood on its head now.  On paper, we have gold-plated standards of child care but there is not enough coming through.  We must examine the balance.</p> <p>  I do not in any way argue that we should go back to old regime.  Children deserve to come and to be treated like Irish children, to be in a home environment and all the rest of it, but at the same time we must put resources into the area if we want to deliver on our commitments.  We do not have sufficient resources in place.  Tusla does not have sufficient staff at the coalface.  Are there timelines for the delivery of some of the minors from Calais?  We will take up the Minister of State&rsquo;s offer of providing names to him.  How much extra money is being put into this area, because it takes time to train people?  Where is the public advertising campaign not just for the Calais children, but the others ones for foster parents to come forward because foster care is far cheaper than residential care and far preferable in terms of integrating people into society?  There has not been any programme.  Once people apply to become foster parents or to provide supported lodgings, they should be put through the mill in terms of being vetted and all the rest but the process is really off-putting and lengthy.  It takes more than four months.  That should not be the case.  The process is completely unwieldy.  What targets and measures are in place so that we can deliver on our commitments because I am worried about the issue?</p></speech>

A couple of the questions I wished to ask have now been asked by her.</p><p>I have a brief comment to make and a question to ask.  The previous justice committee did a great deal of work in this area.  I have been a member of the <i>ad hoc</i>committee on direct provision.  The situation in respect of direct provision has certainly been a very shameful for this country.  I have always believed that a figure of 4,000 was not enough.  During the term of the previous Seanad, I proposed that we should have been prepared to take 40,000 people in and at least give ourselves the option in this regard.  Obviously, that is not the Government position and, unfortunately, I do not believe it ever will be.<br/><br/>How are the 230 immigrants who have come already settling in?  What practical support structures are in place for them?  Are they being facilitated in terms of education and proper integration?  How are the children getting on?  Are there many children among the 230?<br/><br/>It is great news that there are 120 immigrants coming this side of Christmas.  My concern is that the necessary support structures are not in place to deal with those who are coming.  I hope that we will achieve a great deal more in this regard in 2017.  I welcome the fact that there has been an extension of an invitation to people who have been in Calais who may have names of people who want to come to Ireland.  That is the type of engagement we need.<br/><br/>How have the people who came here in recent months settled?  What support structures are in place for them?  What are the lead agencies involved?  Is the Minister of State's Department the lead agency?  Are local authorities lead agencies?  How is the system working?  What is the practical structure?  I apologise for the fact that I will not be here to hear the answer but I will obtain it from the report of proceedings later.</p></speech>

There were many questions and comments and I will probably need an hour, or perhaps more, to answer all of them.</p> <p>  On direct provision, most countries in the world face policy challenges posed by undocumented migrants.  There is no doubt about that.  We must try to do what is best for our country and for Irish citizens abroad.  As I stated, there have been a number of schemes under which people have been regularised here.  There have been at least four.  We can send the relevant information to the secretariat rather than going through it now.  It is quite detailed.</p> <p>  As already stated , if humanitarian cases are brought to our attention, they will certainly be examined in a fair way.  There is no blanket amnesty.  That is out; we are not doing that.  We will certainly consider applications on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>  On the issue of direct provision, I have visited most of the direct provision centres at this stage.  I have not gone to all of them yet.  I have visited a few twice.  I will give figures to indicate the current position.  At the end of November this year, there were 4,354 people residing in the 34 State-provided accommodation centres throughout the country.  This number comprises 3,256 adults and 1,098 children.  There were 1,194 adult females and 2,062 adult males.  There were 426 children aged between zero and four years, 514 between five and 12, and 154 between 13 and 17.  It is quite interesting that a total of 1,955 people left the system of State-provided accommodation between January and the end of November 2016.  In the same period, 1,528 people entered the system.  Therefore, there is movement of people through the accommodation centres all the time.</p> <p>  I was interested in the duration of stay.  A total of 1,690 people, or 38%, were in direct provision for under 12 months.  Over 1,000 people were in direct provision for between one and two years.  Therefore, 63% of people were in direct provision for under two years.  Five hundred and eight people were in accommodation for between two and three years, 283 people for between three and four years, 185 for between four and five years, 150 for between five and six years, 98 for between six and seven years, and 358 for seven years plus.  Many people in the system for more than five years have actually been given some form of status here.  There are a number of people involved in legal challenges.  Obviously, we cannot make any decision until the courts make a decision on those cases.  At least 362 children under the age of ten left the State-provided accommodation system in the 12 months from 1 December 2015 to 30 November 2016.</p> <p>  An issue on which Senators and Deputies might be able to help concerns the 463 persons with some form of status residing in State-provided accommodation centres at present.  We are having difficulty in finding accommodation for them.  Nobody is told he or she has to go when accorded status.  The Reception and Integration Agency will look after them and provide accommodation.</p> <p>  The point about direct provision is that education, health, medical services, food, heat and light are all supplied.  That is why it is called direct provision.  Counselling is provided in some instances.  As Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly said, some of the immigrants have been through fairly traumatic experiences.  Counselling and psychiatric and health services are all provided.  As one can see from the figures, there is a movement of people through the centres all the time.  We are anxious to move people out.</p> <p>  On Senator Conway's question about resettlement, a resettlement worker is provided.  These workers support refugees when they move into accommodation.  I have visited people who have been resettled in houses to listen to what they have to say.  I sat down to listen to what issues they had to raise.  In the main, they are quite happy when resettled in houses.</p> <p>  We are launching a community integration fund in the new year.  We are asking communities around the country to put forward ideas on how to integrate asylum seekers or refugees.  If a community has an idea, it can apply for funding.  Approximately &euro;500,000 is available for that fund.  It will be launched in January.  We are hoping to spread the money across the country using NGOs, etc., in communities that want to do something to help integrate people and make them feel welcome.  One can house people but sometimes they can feel isolated if they do not know their neighbours.  I have learned from my visits that if people get to know each other and talk to each other, integration occurs and concerns diminish quickly.  It is hoped the fund will continue to be available year in, year out.  I ask my colleagues to spread the word among their communities that the fund will be launched in January.</p></speech>

Where a vulnerable child is brought to Ireland, it is important that he or she be placed appropriately.  This committee would be really cross with us if we did not vet families properly and if they did not receive some training.  We are talking about children from a different culture, not just about fostering an Irish child, so training, orientation and other steps are required.  Tusla is seized of this matter and is working as hard as it can to provide appropriate accommodation for children.  We do not really want to have children in institutions.  We have had this experience before.  Ideally, we should use fostering.  If colleagues know of families that would be interested in fostering a child, perhaps a young person between 14 and 17, they should ask them to make themselves known to Tusla so we can further the process.</p></speech>

If families were to do as proposed, they would be left waiting.  We have initiated the process.  A number of Deputies have done as described.  Cases are in the pipeline for a long time.  In my case, for example, I was offered two afternoons in December for an appointment.  When I tried to make arrangements for an appointment, the opportunities were gone.</p><p>The next appointment is 10 January for a process that started in October.  I appreciate that people must get the training, but since the initial contact in October there has been one meeting, a huge number of forms, health screening, talking, looking at the house and so forth.  After all of that there is now a meeting on 10 January, but there was nothing in December.  If people were to come forward, the structure is just not in place in terms of resources.  There must be more money and recruitment.  That is not easy, but it must be in place.  Perhaps it is something that should be teased out between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#N00200"><p>I wish to raise some points with the Minister.  Direct provision has been raised by my colleagues.  The Minister will recall that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality responded to one of my questions a couple of weeks ago in the D&aacute;il during Leaders' Questions, when I was asking questions for Deputy Adams.  She passed the baton to the Minister of State to reply to my question.  In his response, he spoke about visiting and engaging with the centres.  He pointed to a number of improvements that have taken place and he reported that all were happy there.  I do not have the direct quotation but that was the essence of it.  Certainly, those words were in his sentence.  I have no doubt there are people who are in short-term residence in direct provision centres who could say they are happy there given the improvements made and the reality of the situations they have left.</p> <p>  I am a resident in a town that provides direct provision and I have previously visited a number of direct provision centres along with my colleagues in the former committee on health and children.  People are not happy.  The primary disappointment and disgruntlement, which is understandable, is the unacceptable period of time taken to process applications.  In terms of the methodology of providing for them, the Minister of State said a few minutes ago that all of their specific needs are being provided.  I will set aside, for the moment, the minuscule weekly support of &euro;19.10 and the Christmas bonus, which is embarrassing even to talk about as it was based on a percentage of what they are getting weekly.  I can understand and tolerate, which is probably the best word I can use, the employment of direct provision for a limited time period for the processing of applications to stay, but I know people who have been in these settings for years.  They are not just individuals but families in some instances.  I have not been across the thresholds of centres in recent times but, the Minister of State's assurances of improvements aside, I have no doubt that the circumstances are unsuitable for any medium to long-term duration.  This can only be acceptable for short-term provision, not medium to long-term provision.  It is wrong and unacceptable.  We would not want that to happen to any of our citizens and fellow nationals.  In any other situation, we would be in uproar about it.</p> <p>  The time factor is absolutely unacceptable.  Whatever about structural changes and the opportunity to prepare their own meals and so forth, the fact is that our system of processing is not functioning as it should.  Regardless of the outcome and the decision that is taken, people should not have their lives suspended and be left in limbo situations indefinitely.  That is the most unacceptable and disgraceful part of what we are witnessing in direct provision.  It must change.</p> <p>  I also wish to reflect on what Deputy Wallace said.  Migrant Rights Centre Ireland gave a presentation to the committee.  We also had the honour to hear directly from an undocumented non-national, and the people in the Gallery that day included a member of that person's family.  Those young people are making a good new life in this country.  They are people who clearly have a positive contribution to make.  What annoys me is the fact that we can collectively articulate a case to the Unites States for our undocumented people, who number 50,000 to 60,000 or even more.  I know a significant number of them and their families personally.  I share their pain and anguish at times of bereavement and during times such as now, with the advent of Christmas, at the inability of these displaced fellow Irish citizens to visit home and to be part of a family grieving or celebration, because they run the risk of losing all they have endeavoured to build during their lives in that country.  We cannot politically make the case to another jurisdiction that we are not prepared to extend to people who are undocumented in our own jurisdiction.</p> <p>  We must lead by example.  It would only enhance and improve our prospects of being listened to in a more favourable way if we were to take an international lead and demonstrate the real compassion of the Irish people.  Our failure to do that is contributing, in its own way, to the difficulties our citizens are experiencing in the United States and perhaps in other jurisdictions.  Whether it is a general regularisation scheme for the undocumented, we must put in place a compassionate, humanitarian opportunity for people to come forward not out of fear of an impending deportation, but in the hope that, all things being equal in their lives and in their prospects of contributing positively to Irish society, they can look forward in expectation to their cases being accepted and processed favourably.  I cannot urge anything in these matters more strongly on the Minister of State in the last days before Christmas and the last week of the committee's sittings in 2016.</p> <p>  My final point relates to the Calais 200.  On the last occasion we asked a question about this matter, although I am open to correction as it might not have been the Calais 200, one child had been provided for.  I have been corrected - it was Greece.  There was only one involved.  The Minister of State confirmed this.  What are the reasons for that?</p><p>I accept and welcome the Minister of State's invitation to those who may be able to offer detailed information regarding named individuals but it is very apparent that Tusla's role is critical.</p><p> The Minister of State tells me there is no profiling but it has already set out a profile for undocumented children in respect of age and so forth.  This committee has addressed Tusla's recommendation for a cohort that could be successfully relocated here.  I reject that.  It is wrong but I know Tusla is unable to provide the necessary supports for its own direct project and responsibility in this jurisdiction never mind for the newly arrived children we want to welcome in our midst.  I can see there is a brake on, or obstacles to, its being able to achieve what it needs to be able to do to provide the backup, continuing support and evaluation of a child newly arrived on our shores.  That has to be faced up to.</p><p> It is not just the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality but of a compendium of Departments, Cabinet and Government to ensure Tusla is properly resourced to carry out its functions in this regard.  It is imperative that is done across the board, and in the current crisis of so many thousands displaced but specifically unaccompanied children, it must be properly provisioned and resourced to accommodate the commitment we have made.  How many undocumented children have we accepted?  I hope it is more than we were told on the previous occasion we asked.  Does the Minister of State have anything further to report from the visit by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to Greece this week?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.528" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016121400002#O00200"><p>The Chairman has raised a lot of issues.  With respect to the first point about the time spent in direct provision, I do not want to see persons residing in the State-provided accommodation for long periods.  The McMahon working group did recognise that length of stay is a key challenge to be addressed in the asylum process.  The implementation of the International Protection Act 2015 will see more efficient and effective case processing in decisions on protection applications.  This will have a positive impact on the duration of stay in State-provided accommodation in the future.  Approximately half of asylum seekers are not in State-provided accommodation.  People are free to leave State-provided accommodation when they wish.  People move in and out of State-provided accommodation.  There are some who have leave to remain and do not want to leave the State-provided accommodation.  I have met people who are happy that their needs are being met and they are grateful because many have come from appalling situations.  There are people who are not happy, and the Chairman is right, because of the length of time they have had to stay there, but that is being changed.  The International Protection Act 2015 will come into force at the end of this year and the intention and hope will be that, within eight to 12 months, the decision will be made that a person stays or goes.</p> <p>  That will address another issue that colleagues did not raise this morning, the right to work.  Once people have refugee status, they have the right to work.  They have virtually the same rights as an Irish citizen, except the right to vote.  Ireland is a country that is open to migration.  We have naturalised more than 100,000 people in the past five years to become Irish citizens.  That has to be acknowledged.  I am not sure whether colleagues here have been at any of the citizenship ceremonies, and if not, they might like to attend.  They are amazing occasions, when people from virtually all countries of the world attend, very often in their traditional costumes.  The sense of joy they have on becoming Irish citizens is amazing.  I do not agree with the proposal that we are not open to migration.  People come here all the time.</p> <p>  The McMahon working group and the single application procedure will make a huge difference and will be implemented in full from 31 December.  We will see big changes there.  Decisions will be made much faster and so forth.</p> <p>  As I have said in the D&aacute;il, colleagues who wish to visit a direct provision centre should contact the Department and we will make arrangements.  If they do visit, I would ask that they go alone.  We have to respect these people's privacy.  This is their home for the time being.  If colleagues want to go in and meet people and chat to them, they should contact us, but they should not make it a huge media event because people might be worried and intimidated by that.  If they have a suggestion following that on something they have seen or would like improved, we would be more than interested to hear from them.</p> <p>  I was aware of the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, issue and I was chairman of this committee when a report was brought forward.  If there are people who through no fault of their own are undocumented and want to make representations to us, the Department will consider those cases, but there will be no blanket amnesty because each case has to be considered individually.</p> <p>  There are several definitions of an unaccompanied minor.  The Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups, and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children, it should be noted that a significant number who arrived to date are young children with one or two parents.  I think approximately half are children we have taken in and that will continue.  The Greek and Irish definitions of an unaccompanied minor differ.  In Ireland an unaccompanied minor is anyone younger than 18 who is not accompanied by an adult family member, mother, father, siblings, grandparents or spouse or legally appointed guardian.  In Greece, an unaccompanied minor is anyone younger than 18 not accompanied by a member of the nuclear family, mother, father or adult sibling.  For example, a girl aged 17 married to a man aged 20 plus is technically an unaccompanied minor in Greece.  The European Asylum Support Office uses statistics from Greece in its regular updates on the migration crisis, and recently obtained figures from Greece show that by its definition Ireland has taken in 17 unaccompanied minors whereas under the Irish definition we have taken in five.</p> <p>  The Tusla officials have travelled to Athens several times to interview and assess unaccompanied minors and will continue to do so in future missions.  Tusla is initially committed to taking in 20 unaccompanied minors by the Irish definition during the course of the programme.  The initial commitment has been increased more than tenfold with the issuing of the Government's recent commitment to identify up to 200 unaccompanied minors from former migrant camps in Calais still residing in France and who may wish to relocate to Ireland.  We are anxious to do it.  Deputy Daly has identified the challenges of fostering.  I have taken note of what she said and will pass it on to my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p> <p>  That addresses most of the issues the Chairman raised.  I welcome any constructive criticism people may have of any of the services being provided by the State.  The officials are working hard to ensure the accommodation and services provided are as good as we can make them.  I know the Chairman is aware that, for instance, in Mosney and other centres, we are putting in cooking facilities for families. Many of the single men prefer to be in city centre accommodation whereas families like places like Mosney where children can play and where there is a cr&egrave;che, a preschool and school bus service.  Quite a few people have moved out of these centres in the past 12 months and will move out next year and more will move in.</p><p>This is the nature of it.  Some people move out and stay with friends and relatives and make their own arrangements, which is fine.  People are free to come and go as they wish in direct provision if they have the resources and supports outside to do so.  In some instances, Irish citizens have actually made friends with people in direct provision and have assisted them to move out while they are still waiting for their asylum cases to be processed.  I hope this answers the Chairman's question.</p></speech>

We are hoping, and trying, to up that number all the time.  Tusla has gone to Athens on a number of occasions to interview them.  An unaccompanied minor is a child who is totally on his or her own.  Tusla has gone to the area to assess the situation and will continue to do so.  We have committed to taking in 20 unaccompanied minors and we will continue to work on that.  As I have already said, if Deputy Wallace or other Deputies have names of people from the Calais camps who are under the age of 18 and who want to be in Ireland, please pass them on to us and we will see if we can locate them.  They may be spread across France at this stage, which presents challenges, as the committee will understand.</p></speech>

I remake the point to the Minister of State that we have an opportunity here to give some leadership and to demonstrate compassion and a humanitarian approach to this situation.  The beneficiaries of this not only will be those who will be accommodated in Ireland, but also could very well be those we know personally and with whom we have shared many years of our lives.</p> <p>  As the discussion has now been completed, on behalf of the committee I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their attendance today.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Kelly" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016121400002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I am the interim chief executive of Galway County Council.  I am joined by Councillor Joe Byrne, leas-cathaoirleach of Galway County Council, Mr. Robert Meehan, law agent, Mr. Kevin Finn, senior executive engineer, and Ms Nuala Heffernan, administrative officer.</p> <p>  Members will be aware that ferry service to Inis M&oacute;r is a privately-operated ferry service currently undertaken on a year-round basis by Island Ferries Teoranta, with other ferry service operators operating during the tourist season.  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has a role in ensuring the provision of ferry services to all of the islands.  It is understood that the Department operates a State-subsidised service contract to two of the Aran Islands for the purpose of maintaining a regular, all-year-round ferry service.  It appears that there is no State-subsidised contract in place in respect of Inis M&oacute;r.  While the service may be of questionable commercial viability in the winter months, it is considered to be a viable route on a year-round basis.  The current ferry service operator to Inis M&oacute;r is a private entity and, therefore, is not under contract to provide a regular service and is free to cease the service provided by it at any time as a commercial decision.</p> <p>  Galway County Council has no role in the provision of ferry services to the islands, other than being responsible for Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in harbour.  More recently, it has had an indirect association arising from the introduction of by-laws to provide for the management and maintenance of a new harbour facility at Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in.  The previous facilities operated in an extremely hazardous and dangerous manner.  All activities including shipment of goods, livestock, vehicles, plant and machinery, building and construction supplies and activities associated with fishing vessels, together with the arrival of up to 200,000 passengers per year, took place on the existing harbour which was completely inadequate to deal with the type and level of activity.  The requirement for a new harbour was identified to address the various safety issues, safeguard the island's significant tourism sector and secure the sustainable development of Inis M&oacute;r.  The contract for the construction of a new harbour development was signed on 17 December 2007, works commenced in early 2008 and substantial completion was confirmed by November 2011.  The harbour remained open throughout this period and the final cost of the project was approximately &euro;48 million.</p><p>It was considered necessary to introduce by-laws in order to regulate and control activities at the harbour, including collecting charges for the purpose of managing the harbour and its facilities especially with there being in excess of 200,000 passengers disembarking and using the facility annually.  Approximately eight passenger vessels operate during the busy tourist season.  Some of them undertake multiple trips each day depending on the demand.  In the case of those vessels, a charge per passenger per entry of 80 cent, with a multi-user charge for those using the service more than five times per annum, applies.  Those in that category, including island residents, are required to pay &euro;5 per annum.  The approach of the council was that the charges collected from the users of Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in Harbour would be used to pay for a portion of the annual costs associated with the management and maintenance of the harbour.</p><p> Galway County Council has a full-time harbour master who is assisted by other outdoor staff to manage the facility to ensure it is safe and orderly for all harbour users and most important to guarantee that the harbour will not return to what was an unacceptable and dangerous location in the past.  There is a cost associated with providing this service which must be funded and a payment to be made by the users of the facilities is a means of part funding this cost.</p><p> The consideration and adoption of the by-laws is a reserved function of the councillors and the draft by-laws were debated extensively at meetings of the Connemara electoral area committee and subsequently considered by the roads and transportation strategic policy committee.  Ultimately, the public submissions were considered and the by-laws were adopted by full council.  This process occurred between September 2010 and October 2011 when several amendments were made to the by-laws, including a reduction in the fee per passenger from &euro;1.20 to 80 cent and the modification of the charge for residents of the island and frequent travellers to &euro;5 per annum.  Following the adoption of the by-laws, Island Ferries Teo, IFT, was successful in being granted leave to apply for a judicial review which was heard over 11 days in the High Court and at which both parties gave detailed evidence.  </p><p> Galway County Council successfully defended the case in the High Court and IFT then appealed the case to the Supreme Court.  Given that all of the issues involved in respect of the council's actions in bringing forward and adopting these by-laws were fully considered by the High Court and Supreme Court, which both found in favour of Galway County Council.  I have provided, for ease of reference, copies of the judgments in those two cases.  The Supreme Court stated that there is nothing in the judgment of the trial judge in the High Court to suggest that what he characterised as a "modest charge" could not be passed on to passengers.  It was considered that the levying of a fee based on passenger numbers is not characteristic of a tax but a standard method of charging for use.  The court found that "Galway County Council set the charges for Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in through a process of debate and analysis within the scope of their delegated governmental function."  The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court trial judge who found the value of the facility to be considerable and that the imposition of the charge involved no serious additional burden in terms of the counting of numbers to Island Ferries, is a reasonable means of charging and, is no more than the fixing of "a very modest per capita fee of &euro;0.80 on individual passengers arriving most of whom will make the trip only once".  The use of multiple tickets, and a reasonable charge in that regard, protects the interests of islanders who, given their isolation from many other State services, are entitled to some compensatory benefit in the eyes of the court.  It was found that the charges on visitors using the harbour are both modest and reasonable and that Galway County Council had ample statutory basis for imposing the charge and for doing so in the manner in which it did.  The Supreme Court found that there was no basis upon which any of the appeal grounds could succeed.</p><p> There has been significant discourse on the operation and maintenance costs of Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in Harbour and these costs, which were only estimates at the time, were outlined during the discussions as being between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000 per annum.  This issue was raised in court where further detail was outlined in terms of the cost, particularly in 2012, which was presented as &euro;176,600.  Using the same approach for the period 2012&ndash;2015, the annual costs are between &euro;118,400 and &euro;204,420.  Any moneys derived from the passenger would equate to only a portion of those costs.  Other costs that must be met include indirect payroll costs, foreshore licence and ongoing maintenance which will be significant given the harsh coastal environment which will cause rapid wear on the facilities such as public lighting, navigational lighting, CCTV network, safety ladders, railings and so on.  It was intended to establish a sinking fund to provide for the replacement of those items in due course in the absence of any other funding arrangement.  There will also be a requirement at intervals for the maintenance dredging of ferry berths 1 and 2 due to the proximity of the Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in beach.  The total for all of the costs including indirect costs and the sinking fund requirements each year could be in the range of &euro;192,300 to &euro;269,000.  That is based on figures derived between 2012 to 2015.</p><p> Following the decision of the Supreme Court in December 2015 Island Ferries Teo announced that it was going to withdraw its winter service on 16 January 2016, apparently with the intention that the service would resume at a later date in the context of the commencement of the tourist season.  The council met with representatives of Island Ferries Teo and Comharchumann Forbartha Arann as well as the Department immediately before and after Christmas 2015.  In January last, Island Ferries Teo agreed to make a payment per vessel on a per entry, per month or per annum basis, depending on the usage of the vessel but the total estimate for the amount that would accrue in those scenarios was very small.  Following all those discussions, the cessation of the service did not occur at that time.  Between June and October of this year, as chief executive of Galway County Council, I met a representative of Island Ferries Teo on two occasions during which the resistance to the by-laws was still voiced and the offer of a payment based on each vessel remained the desired approach from the company's perspective, at a much lower rate than might accrue under the by-laws.  In October, the company put forward a written proposal, one of the main changes being a reduction of the fee per passenger to 40 cent from 80 cent.  As I have outlined, the fee had already been reduced by the council from &euro;1.20 to 80 cent.  It was suggested that the higher fee would be financially unviable for the company.  This proposal was discussed at a meeting of the corporate policy group of Galway County Council in early November where it was not considered favourably.</p><p> At a meeting of Galway County Council on 24 October 2016, the members unanimously agreed that "Galway County Council would request that the Department would implement a PSO Service to Inis M&oacute;r so as to give certainty of services to the Islanders."  At a subsequent meeting of Galway County Council on 23 November 2016, following the withdrawal of the ferry service by Island Ferries Teo, the members mandated the chief executive to engage in further discussions with Island Ferries Teo and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Rural, Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs.  These discussions were to be held in the context of the company's assertion that a fee of 80 cent would impact on the commercial viability of the operation while the approach was not to impact on the integrity of the by-laws.  These discussions have commenced, are continuing and have made progress.  The discussions are mainly of a financial nature, including consideration of the fee per passenger, the arrears of fees due from the company since 2012 , the substantial court costs which remain outstanding and the methodology for collating and agreeing passenger numbers in the future.</p><p> The adoption and implementation of the by-laws has been fully examined by the Courts and upheld.  The by-laws in question were adopted following extensive public consultation and careful consideration of the various issues raised, and it has always been expected that the operator could pass on the charge to the passenger but has chosen not to do so at the present time.  Island Ferries Teo now accepts the by-laws and the discussions centre on the financial aspects that arise.  The principles and procedures involved have been fully considered by the courts and found to withstand detailed scrutiny.  The current by-laws and method of calculating the charges have been found to be entirely legal and within the powers and competence of the council.  The council remains committed to the current discussions relating to the outstanding financial matters.</p><p>Those discussions are ongoing.</p></speech>

D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; i mB&eacute;arla agus i nGaeilge &eacute;.  T&aacute;imse anseo ar son comharchumann forbartha Inis M&oacute;r.  We thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to appear before the joint committee.  It is exciting and daunting to come to the Oireachtas.  I am joined by the school principal of Col&aacute;iste Naomh Eoin from Inis M&oacute;r because we want to tie in education and Mr. Simon Murray, the Chairperson of Islands Federation of Ireland.  We are interlinked on the issue of the Inis M&oacute;r ferry service.  We have provided the committee with our opening statement, but I am not going to read it.  I will speak from the heart.</p> <p>  We travelled across the Wild Atlantic Way.  We were lucky enough to get across on the ferry, a service which has been in danger for a number of weeks.  We are blessed to live in such a wonderful place as Inis M&oacute;r, which is part of the Aran Islands.  We appreciate the culture and the heritage of our island.  One makes a decision to live on an island.  Rural living can be difficult, but living on an island is even more difficult and challenging.  As an islander born and bred, when I made the decision to move back to Inis M&oacute;r, one of the many factors involved was the availability of services and access facilities.  I suffer from sea sickness so it is not great to live on an island when that is the case.  The fact that services had improved greatly since I was a child was a major factor in my decision to move home.  We had both an excellent air and boat service, which had improved in the course of time.  One makes a decision to move to or remain on an island based on many factors.  Unfortunately, in the past four years this has become more challenging.  The reason I go back four years is that I will deal with both the air service and the ferry service.</p> <p>  Members may have seen or heard us on the media because we have been battling to keep basic services going.  Our air service was nearly cut back.  It all stems from the failure to listen to the views of the islanders.  There is an ongoing issue with the ferry service because no Government contract was put in place by Roinn na Gaeltachta.  The previous speaker, Mr. Kevin Kelly, touched on that point.  The ferry company does not want a Government contract, but the islanders want a Government contract to ensure that a service continues all year round.</p> <p>  In 2011, Galway County Council decided to introduce by-laws for Kilronan Harbour.  A significant amount of money has been spent on Kilronan Harbour, a development that was badly needed and was between 50 and 60 years overdue.  Galway County Council was the project co-ordinator as the owner of the pier, but the work was the result of the effort of people from the bottom up, the people of Inis M&oacute;r.  The fishermen and the people knew that the harbour was an absolute danger and that we, the islanders needed a sheltered harbour.  We lobbied for 15 years and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows because we had his ears reddened begging for the funding of infrastructure, which we got from Galway County Council and Roinn na Gaeltachta.  We were delighted to get it.  We feel that it was great to get the development and it has been worth every cent in our opinion, but I do not think we should have been penalised for that development.  We never agreed in principle with levies.  We agree there are running costs and that there should have been some other form of charge, but we did not agree with the levies.  We verbalised that vocally as my friends in the council know and we were outside protesting and talking to politicians about it.  We as islanders believe it stems from not being listened to.  If the councillors had listened to us from 2011, I do not think we would be in the mess we are today.  As Mr. Kelly stated, the case went to the High Court and there have been costs, including the cost of appeals.  All of this has been hanging over the people of Inis M&oacute;r, who do not know if they will have a service the following week.</p> <p>  We did not agree with the levies.  There was a vote in Galway County Council and democracy won through.  While I am totally in favour of democracy, sometimes it does not work and in this case, I do not think it worked.  The people who use and understand the service were not listened to and that was the inhabitants of the island.  We are sick of battling to keep basic services that we should have.  I would say the politicians are tired of us calling meetings and begging for help and assistance.  That is wrong.  We want a ferry service.  We are aware of the factors.  The company, Island Ferries, runs an excellent service but it is a private company that can do what it likes when it likes.  This is why we want a Government contract to be put in place and that is what we will be looking for going forward.</p> <p>  The issue of levies created a problem.  The company made public the difficulties with running costs in the winter time but the end result is that the islanders face the possibility of no service from 1 December to March.  We did not know when the ferry pulled out on 1 December whether it would be back until March.  If we had not fought to keep our air service, that would have been gone and we would have been totally stranded.</p> <p>  We are grateful for the opportunity to come before the committee today.  I think it is counterproductive to spend this time blaming and pointing fingers at others.  We hope that our views will be listened to.  After Mr &Oacute; Cualain's contribution, Mr. Simon Murray will speak on policy issues and the need for a policy for islands.  We have seen the impact of what is lacking on islands for the past four or five years.  We have raised the issues but we are not being listened to and basic services are being pulled.  We accept there are costs associated with the pier, but we felt there were other ways to cover them, be it a price based on the tonnage per vessel.  In our campaign against the levies at the time, our banner headline was "Penalised for being islanders".  That is what we felt.</p> <p>  There is great talk about the Wild Atlantic Way, and we are on the Wild Atlantic Way.  D&uacute;n Aengus is listed in the Top Ten Ocean Views in the world by National Geographic.  That is significant.  The views are amazing and we live in an amazing place, but at the end of the day it is the people who make a place.  If we do not have a vibrant community, with the population increasing, then the Aran Islands are in trouble and Inis M&oacute;r is the largest populated island on the coast of Ireland.  The population is dropping as it is on all islands.  Our fear is that it is difficult to encourage people to return to the islands.  I have relatives who were considering coming back from overseas and they are now saying there might not be a plane or a boat service.  That is hanging over us.</p> <p>  We need a change of policy.  We are discussing the levy today, but something has to change and our views must be listened to as we should not be in this position.  We should not have to come to fight and beg for the right to travel.  We have a right to the right of travel within our country.  We need a ferry to get from A to B.  A ferry operator should not be penalised for providing a good service.  Costs need to be covered but I think there are other ways to deal with that.  If our views had been listened to four years ago, there would not have been the court cases with related accumulating costs.  We also would not be living with the stress of not knowing if we would be able to go from Inis M&oacute;r to the mainland on a given day.</p> <p>Ar an bpointe sin, cr&iacute;ochn&oacute;idh m&eacute; mo spiel.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an tUasal &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in ag iarraidh teacht isteach ar an taobh oideachais d&oacute;.   Education is interlinked.  It is like a dominoes effect, if one goes, they all tumble.  For us access and infrastructure is a significant factor to living on an island.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon Murray" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016121400002#F00300"><p>I wish to cover the issue in the overall context of the collective, which is Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, the federation for the offshore islands.  I will start with a very simple question.  How many people in this room can name a depopulated island?  I am sure everybody can think of one, two, three or maybe four.  How many of those have been repopulated?  The answer is none.  That is why we are here.</p> <p>  The islands collective is facing an uncertain future.  It is being phrased in the media as "death by a thousand cuts", and that is not too far off the mark.  Sometimes they are little things and sometimes they are huge things.  They relate to education, health, arts, culture, heritage, fishing, farming and all aspects.  Small things can sometimes go an awfully long way in small island populations.  We are under 3,000 people between all of the islands combined and we are not heading in the right direction.  We are effectively trying to hold on to who we are and how we are defined in Irish society.  I am not too sure where that lies at the moment.  We have been dealing with successive Governments and we still do not have a proper policy from Government level on the organisation and management of our islands that translates from one Government to the next.</p><p> With regard to transportation services, we are seeking the infrastructural work that needs to be done on the islands.  The operational side of it is the running of the co-operatives and the community development projects across the islands, which are front-line services on behalf of the State on each island.  We are seeking a budget of between &euro;12 million and &euro;15 million per year to take care of many of the constant outstanding issues that are ongoing with the islands each day.  That would protect what we have just spoken about - the ferry services, the air services and the ones to be developed and the infrastructure that needs to be developed, such as the piers that are still outstanding and which need to be done in the future.  If there is a roll-over budget every year, the great work we have done with our partners in the council in the past can continue.  However, there cannot be a famine or feast situation, and I am not just talking about the recent past.  In the 1990s, the early 2000s and even before that the islands were starved of funding.  There was a flash in the pan for eight or nine years in which great work was done, but then we were abandoned again.  There must be a consistent approach, at both council and Government levels.  The council cannot do it if it does not get the money.</p><p> It is not a huge amount of money, but what would it mean?  The island way of life would be protected.  It is clear from the D&aacute;il records and elsewhere that this State abandoned the islands when the State was needed most.  As most of the members know, I live on Inishbofin.  Inishark beside it was depopulated in 1960.  The next two islands to us are Inishturbot and Inishturk South, which were depopulated in 1978.  Our three nearest neighbours are gone.  Those islands will never be repopulated.  It is a huge issue.  It is not just about money but about what we want to do as a nation.  Not every country has islands.  Many of our European partners in the European Small Islands Federation value their islands.  Scotland pumps a great deal of money into the infrastructure and maintenance of its islands.  That is true of France and other countries as well.  However, we are discussing our islands.  We must take a new and realistic look at the question of whether we want to ensure that our island life continues.  There is no point in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport trumpeting the Wild Atlantic Way and the islands when six other Departments are cutting the legs out from under us.  That is what is happening.  The case with Inis M&oacute;r is a complicated situation but if a proper subsidy had been put in place at the start, would the question have arisen now?  I do not believe so.  The aeroplane service operating across the three Aran Islands is still in jeopardy.  There is no guarantee.  The one in Inishbofin never got off the ground, if the committee will excuse the pun.  The infrastructure is there and will be there for the next 400 or 500 years.  Why can we not get a small budget from somewhere to run the service?</p><p> I have been a taxpayer since I was 18 years of age.  I own a few companies and they all pay tax.  I never complain about my taxes being spent anywhere else in this country, but I would like to see some of them coming back to the islands.  We elect a Government for two fundamental reasons.  One is the protection of the State internally and externally from a security point of view.  The other, which is really contentious now, is the collection and redistribution of tax.  A large amount of tax is collected on the islands.  If one considers the islands collectively, even from the tourism perspective, they give the State a very large amount of money.  We are only seeking our share back to try to maintain the infrastructure, transportation, education, health and essential services we need.  We are not asking for a hospital to be built on any of the islands, for example.  We are being realistic as we know what can work.  The most disappointing aspect of all of this, and Cathy N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill touched on it earlier, is that sometimes the last people who are ever asked about anything are the islanders.  We have survived on our islands for 5,000 or 6,000 years.  We know how to live there, so what about talking to us first to see if something will work before it is implemented from the top down?  That is the key principle of sustaining island life.  A consistent plan should be put in place so we do not have to keep appearing in the media, as Cathy N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill said.  It sounds terrible in some cases and people say, "Oh, they are at it again".  However, I never complain about my money being pumped into a motorway which I will hardly ever use.  There are plenty of them in the country on which I have never driven.  I would like to see some of my money coming back to sustain our islands.</p><p> There must be a consistent annual budget for the islands through the island section in the Department.  That would cure many of the problems that are arising on a regular basis.  If we reach that point, we will acknowledge that the islands are worth something from the perspective of our culture, arts, heritage, who we are and our history.  I believe we are worth that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.557" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016121400002#G00200"><p>Is maith go bhfuil an pl&eacute; seo ar bun.  I understand that negotiations are taking place and that it would not be appropriate to go into the details of the negotiations, but it is important to lay down a few basic markers which should guide the Oireachtas, the Government and the local authority.  We must consider this not from the view of any company or authority but from the viewpoint of the need to sustain our islands.  It is a clear Government policy and every party has stated that it wishes to sustain the islands.  Fundamental to that is the need to provide a good transport service to every island at a fair cost.  When I was appointed a Minister I set about ensuring that.  For example, at that time there was no contracted service to any non-Gaeltacht island.  I brought it all under a single system to ensure that every island had a good transport service.  When I left the Department every island with a significant population of 12, 20 or more had a service and there was a maximum fare for islanders of &euro;8 and &euro;5 for students.  That was in recognition of the fact that there is no choice of getting into a car and driving somewhere - one can only get on or off the island by boat or aeroplane.</p> <p>  My second comment is to the county council.  A thing can be legal but still not be right.  We must accept that, according to the courts, it is the council's legal right to what it did.  I would dispute whether it was right.  I dispute whether the council was right or whether the Department was right.  The authorities let the islanders down.  Why do I think that?  It is a charge on the islanders and a charge on transport to the island.  Some people might say, "It is a once-off visit at 80 cent so what difference does it make?".  First, tourists can be notoriously price sensitive.  Second, one would think that the only non-islanders who visit the islands are tourists.  However, the washing machine service person and other service personnel go to the islands.  The council is charging them the 80 cent.  The HSE use it very frequently and its people are being charged the 80 cent.  The Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, GRETB, which runs the schools, use it all of the time, as well as all of the ancillary services that come to the island.  Many people, including politicians, go to the islands on a frequent basis.  A large amount of business into and out of the islands is not once-off but repetitive.  Imagine the outrage if every time somebody from outside Connemara who travelled beyond Moycullen had to pay 80 cent for the pleasure of doing so.  It is a cost on the island.  Every time one charges or makes it more expensive to do anything on the island there is an impact on the island.</p> <p>  Who should have borne the cost?  First, I do not accept all the costs given by the manager or chief executive.  The reason is that he has control over many piers in County Galway and he funds those out of the rates, general taxation and all the other money that comes in from the State.  Many of those costs would have arisen on any pier he controls, but he does not have levies on those piers.  There are extra costs involved in running the pier in Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in, and rightly so.  I must compliment the county council on radically improving the way that pier is organised.</p><p>It has been a bumpy road getting there, but most people would say that the islander and tourist experience of landing on the pier is much safer, more organised and better than it was in the past and also that we need a harbour master.  However, I believe that the State should have picked up the tab and that this should not have fallen on the islanders.  It undermines the principle behind the &euro;8 and &euro;5 I had laid out.  I think it is &euro;10 and &euro;6 now since the last Government.</p><p> I will raise a few key issues.  An f&eacute;idir le muintir na n-oile&aacute;n - go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r an bheirt anseo as Inis M&oacute;r - a dheimhni&uacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; de riachtanas, m&aacute; thagtar ar shocr&uacute; an tseachtain seo n&oacute; an tseachtain dar gcionn, go mbeadh an t&aacute;ille &euro;10 i gceist do dhaoine f&aacute;sta agus &euro;6 do gas&uacute;r agus scol&aacute;ir&iacute; scoile?  An bhfuil an ceart agam go bhfuil s&eacute; riachtanach amach is amach go dtiocfadh s&eacute; sin i bhfeidhm l&aacute;ithreach in aon shocr&uacute; nua agus nach mbeidh s&eacute; inghlactha ar chor ar bith, dubh, b&aacute;n n&oacute; riabhach, do mhuintir an oile&aacute;in m&aacute; dh&eacute;antar socr&uacute; nach bhfuil s&eacute; sin mar chuid d&oacute;?</p><p> T&aacute; ceist agam ar an Uasal &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in.  Nuair a bh&iacute;onn na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; ar scol&aacute;ireacht sa scoil ag dul isteach agus amach, an n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear iad mar oile&aacute;naigh don tr&eacute;imhse scoilbhliana n&oacute; an n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear iad mar thuras&oacute;ir&iacute; n&oacute; daoine &oacute;n taobh amuigh?  Bheadh tionchar ollmh&oacute;r aige sin ar an gcostas at&aacute; orthu.  Taca&iacute;m go hioml&aacute;n leis an &eacute;ileamh at&aacute; ag an Uasal &Oacute; C&uacute;al&aacute;in i dtaobh ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais.  Mar is eol d&oacute;, bh&iacute; s&eacute; mar chuid den pholasa&iacute; oile&aacute;nda a d'fhoilsigh muid ag an toghch&aacute;n deiridh.  Seasann muid leis sin.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh agus &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh go sciobtha.</p><p> Finally, I will say to Mr. Simon Murray that one thing I have learned in life is that one cannot forecast the future.  We have elections so that Governments can change policies.  Sometimes they change them very much for the worse rather than for the better, but that is the choice of the electorate.  It is not possible to absolutely insulate oneself from the future.  It is important, however, that there would be a clearly articulated island policy.  It is important that the islanders and the people of Ireland know what the various parties stand for when it comes to the islands and that they know whether we are willing to make what is actually, financially, a very modest contribution to ring-fence special things, as we did for example with the car tax on the islands and so on.  There were many examples of how it can be done without any significant impact on the national budget.  To put it in context, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in mentioned a cost of &euro;300,000 to put a package together to sort out the secondary education difficulties on the island.  The sum of &euro;300,000 out of &euro;58 billion is the equivalent of a family that has a take home salary of &euro;58,000 committing 30 cents a year to something.  That is the proportion.</p></speech>

I was learning Irish as a mature student.  I loved it.  The witnesses are evoking many memories.  I lived on the island for a year.  I came away as an islander.  I think I looked like an islander.  It was a long time ago.  I thank the witnesses and I am delighted to meet them.  I am approaching this issue with a great innocence in one way, but not in another way.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about the inferences that are made when people speak about rural development.  We cannot neglect communities outside the M50.  It would be absolutely ridiculous for us to do so.  I include the islands in what I am saying.</p> <p>  Why is the State not providing a service to Inis M&oacute;r?  It is providing a service to Inis Me&aacute;in.  Can somebody tell me why there is no State service to Inis M&oacute;r?  What is wrong?  I do not want a history lesson.  Why is there no State service to Inis M&oacute;r?</p> <p>  Mr. Kelly has told the committee that the work which started in 2007 cost approximately &euro;48 million.  Would we have paid so much money in 2011?  We paid &euro;48 million at the height of the Celtic tiger.  What was built down there?  Are there outstanding hotels, caf&eacute;s and toilets with world-class bells and whistles in Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in?  I think the &euro;48 million bill is the county council's business and not that of the islanders.</p> <p>  I agree with much of what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said in this regard.  That might be extreme, but that is how I feel about it.  We have to get on with living on the island, educating people on it, visiting it and using it as part of the great Wild Atlantic Way.  The islanders' transport to and from the island is like our rural transport.  We had people in here last week to talk about rural communities.</p> <p>  How much money did Galway County Council spend on legal advice?  I think that is a good question.  When I look at the witnesses, why do I feel that communication between those on the mainland and those on the island has broken down?  I suppose it is because I come from a background in communications.  I have a strong sense that right seems to be on one side and not on the other.  Why do I feel that?  Maybe the witnesses will answer that question.</p> <p>  My final question relates to services.  Do the islanders have a service now?  Maybe they will answer that.</p></speech>

As there are eight inhabited islands in my constituency of Cork South-West, I have a fair idea of the struggle faced by islanders.  Nothing has surprised me as I have been listening to the witnesses speaking about the current situation, which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has been raising in the D&aacute;il on behalf of the people of Inis M&oacute;r.  It seems to me that this must have been coming down the road for quite some time.  Why was it allowed to reach the point of crisis?  Cathy N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill has said she was lucky to get a service out of the island today.  Why was this point allowed to be reached?  I should not be surprised, given that the cable car to Dursey Island was withdrawn on Friday evening for the weekend, with little communication on the issue in west Cork.  It became a crisis for the islanders over the weekend.  There is only one operator of the cable car.  That is a long-term issue in west Cork.  I know there are many good ferry operators out there.  The ferry services to and from places like Whiddy Island and Long Island are run to the liking of the island community, as much as possible.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray mentioned some of the great difficulties encountered on our islands, including population decreases.  Housing policy is being debated in the D&aacute;il Chamber today, but I wonder whether there is any housing policy in relation to our islands.  Island populations are decreasing.  The nearest social housing is on the mainland.  That in itself sends a clear message to me about the Government's thoughts for the future of our islands.  When I attended a meeting a couple of weeks ago on Bere Island, which is off the coast near Castletownbere, I learned about the disrespect shown to islanders when they come to the mainland.  They are unable to tie up their boats in Castletownbere.  It is scandalous that elderly and pregnant women have to walk across boats to get onto the pier.  There is little or no sympathy for islanders or understanding of island life.  I come from a peninsula that is like an island.  When the programme for Government was being drawn up, I made the case for people who live on islands and peninsulas, but I found there was a lack of understanding of their way of living.  This is more of it here today.  I sympathise with the witnesses as they contend with these serious issues.</p></speech>

There is a lot of dialogue, although there is a divergence of opinion on this particular issue.  I would not in any way classify it as a question of being right or wrong.  A democratic decision was made in the context of having an increased cost for a facility and, in straitened times, how that might be paid for.  Galway County Council had a budget of &euro;160 million prior to the demise of the economy, but the figure is now &euro;105.  In a scenario where the Government had provided for the capital cost of the infrastructure, there was an increased cost which had to be paid for.  The democratic decision was that part of that cost would be paid by users of the facility.  It was always expected that cost would be passed on to the passenger.  I want to be clear that the cost for islanders and every regular visitor to the island would be &euro;5 per annum, not 80 cent per trip.  Anybody going there regularly, for any reason, be they islanders or not, it would cost them &euro;5 per annum.</p> <p>  Significant figures have been quoted in the recent discussions concerning the number of regular trips for islanders as a proportion of the total.  Members of the committee have expressed surprise over the size of the contract.  Due to its nature, however, it was not a fixed price contract.  It had to be a measured contract which involves building a significant facility in the Atlantic Ocean.  Therefore, the costs were significant.  One can talk at any level of detail about the facilities but it is essentially a harbour.  Those costs are derived from the type and scale of activity, and its location.  Indeed, there are plans for other facilities and, no doubt, cost will become an issue there in due course.</p> <p>  Of course, Galway County Council would prefer if it did not have to impose charges.  However, in the instance it did so, the court cases that followed were not instigated by the council but needed to be defended by it, having undertaken a democratic process in order to uphold the democratic right of elected members to make a decision on by-laws, and not simply roll over in the face of opposition particularly in the context of an individual operator.</p> <p>  I think Ms N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill will agree that there was a lot of discussion on the by-laws from the outset.  If memory serves me correctly, when they were first mooted in September 2010 within weeks there was a public meeting on the island where the discussion started.  Over the 13 months of the process, there were a number of changes.  Members have mentioned that there were various other avenues for charging and all those were discussed.  There were many other charges in the by-laws which were removed as part of that consultation process, including consultation with the islanders.  Therefore, significant changes were made to the by-laws and the amount of money that could be derived from them is substantially less now than it would have been at the initial iteration of same.</p> <p>  I do not have an accurate figure for the costs pre-the new harbour and post it.  However, as regards the figures outlined, it is not an increase of &euro;100,000.  As I have outlined, at the early stages of the process, the estimated costs were between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000 per annum.  During the court case, the estimated costs were &euro;176,600.  The actual costs, outlined in the context of costs incurred over the period 2012 to 2015, are between &euro;118,000 and &euro;204,000 for direct costs, including the harbour master and the general operative costs of insurance, electricity and materials.  There are additional costs which we also need to provide for at this stage.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the foreshore lease, in particular.  That issue is currently under discussion and consideration.  However, the figure that was given to us as an annual fee for the foreshore lease was &euro;35,000 or an option of a once-off capital payment in excess of &euro;400,000.  That is an issue of concern to us and if we were able to eliminate such a cost it would significantly improve our scenario.  It should be clear that no matter what emerges from the discussions, or if there ever had to be any discussions in the first instance, the amount of revenue generated by the by-laws was only going to be a portion of the annual running costs.  The costs have nothing to do with the construction of the harbour itself.  As I outlined earlier in the submission, part of those costs relate to significant ongoing maintenance costs and equipment replacement due to the harsh environment of the facility, which included navigational aids, public lighting and safety ladders.</p> <p>  Galway County Council's policies in respect of the islands are very positive.  I would like to think that while we are having a discussion here on a particular issue over which there is disagreement, and Ms N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill and I have discussed it on a number of occasions, the policies of the council towards the islands are supportive in the context of our current resources.  Perhaps Ms N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill will talk about why the State has no service to Inis M&oacute;r.  It is not something that I can comment on.</p> <p>  A significant amount of money has been spent on the legal process.  When one spends 11 days in the High Court and then goes on to the Supreme Court, it is a significant cost.  Those costs are currently with the accountants and the Taxing Master.  A significant amount of money is due to Galway County Council arising from that court case and the fact that the findings were in the council's favour in both courts.</p> <p>  Island Ferries Teoranta has clearly indicated that having regard to the financial issues which pertain, though the arrears of fees due for the period from 2012 to 2015, plus the significant legal costs which are due to Galway County Council, plus the fee-----</p></speech>

Those matters are all under discussion at present.  I have indicated to the committee that discussions are ongoing.  We have made progress and they will resume tomorrow.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that this scenario has occurred, I am keen to emphasise the importance of recognising that the issue of the by-laws and the 80 cent is only one small part of an overall puzzle involving the ferry service to Inis M&oacute;r.  Galway County Council is involved in that part, but other aspects are being dealt with by the Department.  Discussions are ongoing between the Department and the operators in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.582" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Finn" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016121400002#L00300"><p>The project was a significant development.  We have always taken the position that we were mere agents in delivering it.  Our contribution to the development was approximately &euro;190,000, while the remainder of the money was provided through the Department Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p> <p>  Significant expenditure was incurred.  Since it is offshore, the cost almost automatically increases by up to 40% on account of getting materials there and labour costs.  We have a passenger shelter that was not there previously.  We have long-term and short-term car parking facilities that were not there before.  Previously, parking was a major issue.  We have separated the cargo traffic to another part of the harbour so there is no congestion in the harbour for the delivery and handling of cargo.  All that has been transferred to another side of the harbour, leaving it far safer for foot passengers.  We have put in a boardwalk for the large number of foot passengers.  It leads up through the harbour and brings them up and into the village.  The fishing vessels now have separate berthing facilities.  They are no longer mixed with the cargo or passenger vessels.  Passenger vessels have their own berthing facilities.  The RNLI vessel used to berth offshore.  A good deal of time was required following an incident.  The crew had to use a smaller vessel to get out to the boat.  It is now attached in the harbour.  A deep-water slipway is in place now.  The people on the island can now bring materials or vehicles to be offloaded far easier by means of the slipway.  CCTV cameras are in place.  There is far greater shelter and depth in the harbour for vessels.  Issues arose previously, especially during the busy season when fishing vessels were tied up.  Passenger vessels now use that space.  Arguably, there was only one berth and the only way on to the island was by walking over passenger vessels &ndash; the island residents are aware of this.  It was an unsafe set-up.  There are no toilets or showers at the harbour.  I have moved away from the section now but that was something we were trying to develop.  There is a warehouse, a protected structure, at the harbour which could be utilised for that purpose.  The &euro;48 million investment has produced state-of-the-art facilities.  There is no doubt about that.  We were delighted to be part of it and to deliver the project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016121400002#L00400"><p>I wish to ask Mr. Finn about the cost.  This point has been raised sporadically.  Can Mr. Finn confirm that this harbour is built on an island in the Atlantic?  Can he confirm that in fact a significant amount of the cost had nothing to do with the pier but everything to do with the tonnchosc or breakwater built in a big arc around it?  In fact, when it was being built we brought the plans over to London.  Models were developed to show us what would happen in the case of a one-in-100-year storm and a one-in-1,000-year storm.  The fishermen came with us and it was proven to their satisfaction that it would withstand a one-in-1,000-year storm.  It was proven that the boats in the harbour would be safe.  In fact, we have had some tremendous storms since the harbour was finished.  If a paper boat had been in the harbour during those times it would have stayed afloat without destruction.  The major cost was in fact creating a barrier to the Atlantic in order that boats in the harbour would be safe in all weather.  It allowed people to get in there easily and shelter in all weathers.  Unlike other harbours along the coast, there is no fear that at night owners have to move the boat out of the harbour if a bad storm is forecast.</p> <p>  The issues raised by an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh are desirable.  We had plans to develop the old store but legal issues remain to be overcome in order to provide the ancillary facilities, but they are running into hundreds of thousands of euro.  However, millions went into the actual pier and, more important, into designing a breakwater to ensure the Atlantic would never hit the harbour at force.  Can the deputation confirm that?  There is a misunderstanding about the Atlantic.  It is not a question of the investment being proportionate to the population on the island.  The amount of money to be spent is proportionate to the waves in the Atlantic.</p></speech>

I am not a member of the committee.  I welcome the officials, including Councillor Joe Byrne from Galway County Council and the representative from the Aran Islands.  No one could question the set-up of the pier.  It is an excellent facility.  I compliment Galway County Council on the tremendous work done and the investment made.  It was needed and the facility is now state-of-the-art in nature.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, year after year issues arise with services to the Aran Islands.  If it is not the air service, it is the boat service.  It seems to be an annual battle to try to keep the services going to the islands and to keep the people living on the islands.  One thing about all Oireachtas Members is that we work together on this to try to find a solution.  We must find some solution because we cannot continue to have this annual battle to keep the services and to keep people living on the islands.  That is crucial.</p> <p>  Perhaps my question has been asked already.  Is a ferry service available from Doolin to the Aran Islands or is it a cargo service?  If a ferry service comes from Doolin, are the operators paying the levy to Galway County Council?  Does the issue only relate to the service from Ros a' Mh&iacute;l?</p></speech>

The position is the same for other ferry operators.  There is a ferry service from Doolin to Inis M&oacute;r.  Those responsible have been billed.  My understanding is they have not paid as of yet.  We should recognise that the court determination was only in December last year.  Obviously, there have been numerous discussions in the meantime.  My expectation is that there will be further discussions with other operators with a view to bringing all those issues to a conclusion.</p></speech>

I am deputising for the cathaoirleach of Galway County Council who cannot be with us today.  It is welcome to have had five Galway Oireachtas Members at the committee today.  That is positive.  As the discussion has developed, the context has become far wider than matters relating to Galway County Council.  Perhaps, in a way, Galway County Council is a pawn in the game and that is a matter of regret.  As leas-chathaoirleach of the council, I am keen to endorse the contribution of our chief executive.  The joined-up thinking between our executive and elected members has been excellent in this matter.  The level of information given to us and the numbers of discussions at council meetings are points on which we should really compliment our executive.</p><p>It is, of course, a difficult issue for Ms N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill and others.  I live in south Galway and probably the farthest from Ros an Mh&iacute;l, but I lived on Inis M&oacute;r for two years and I remember Ms N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill from those days.  Like all in Galway County Council, I have a connection.  To answer Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, the Connemara municipal district councillors in particular have an incredibly good connection with the residents of Inis M&oacute;r, the executive and our Oireachtas Members.  There is very good connection there.</p><p> The real issue is that we as a council have to sign off on budgets and we are constrained.  The councillors of Galway want a call for some form a State-provided PSO service for the Aran Islands.  At our October plenary council meeting, Galway County Council unanimously requested our CEO to engage with the Department officials to have that service provided.  I concur with all the comments, be they from Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Grealish or Connolly or Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  The real issue is that we need more State funding for the Aran Islands.  In reality, it is not an issue to be discussed at Galway County Council level because we cannot resolve the situation.  Be they right or wrong, the by-laws are in place and they were introduced in good faith.  We want a resolution and that is why we impress on Oireachtas Members the need to come up with a solution.  We in Galway County Council cannot afford to run the service without funding being made available.  That is a really important point and, from that point of view, today's discussion has been very welcome.</p></speech>

This compounds the situation and comes back to not being listened to.  When decisions are being made, we are left out in the cold.  It happened again last week.  There was a decision of the stakeholders concerning this crisis last Friday but the biggest stakeholder, the islanders, were not allowed to attend that meeting.  To be fair, Mr. Kelly has met me, taken every call and answered every e-mail and we have had dialogue.  However, when it comes to being in the room when the decisions are being, we are not there and we are left in the dark.  It also happened when the levies were being brought in four years ago.  In terms of democracy, as I stated earlier, it was the wrong decision.  If we had been listened to at the time, we would not be in this mess, but the councillors, unfortunately, did not listen to us.</p> <p>  I hate to put this bluntly but I feel they saw Inis M&oacute;r as some kind of a cash cow.  There is plenty being spent on infrastructure throughout the county but there are no charges or levies to use it.  This was a cash cow given the number of tourists coming to Inis M&oacute;r.  That is putting it bluntly.  I do not want to knock any more bridges.  I want to build bridges with the council so that we can move forward in a way that this will not happen again.  I want to improve our dialogue with the council.  At the end of the day, we are all proud of our county.  The Aran Islands, and Inis M&oacute;r, are often treated as the jewel in the crown of County Galway but it is time that jewel was taken care of.  It is very tarnished at the moment and needs shining up because we are struggling while fighting for these services.  This has taken two days out of our week.  We have left young kids to come up here.  It is my job and I will do it as best I can and with a heart and a half because I believe in the island, but this is ridiculous.  We are four years at it.  Deputy Grealish touched on it.  The members are sick of looking at us.  We are coming in, begging, and asking why is the plane going to be pulled and why we do not have a ferry.  Dialogue has to be improved.</p><p>We are part of Galway County Council.  We are part of the county.  I hope we can work on that as we move forward.

Galway County Council used to have an islands committee for the three Aran Islands and Inishbofin.  It met at least once every six months.  Mr. Kelly is probably the only person in attendance who was originally a member of the committee.  We all found it to be a very effective platform for direct dialogue.  We used to meet the senior representatives in each section every six months or so to discuss the island issues.  I always felt that problems associated with things that were happening, or were due to happen in the future, were headed off by being discussed at these meetings.  Many matters were dealt with within the council at that level.  I have been calling for the reinstatement of this committee since 2007 or 2008.  I am calling on the representatives of the council who are present at this meeting to consider the matter.  The existence of such a committee would give us a recognition within the council.  It would show that the council is willing to meet representatives of the four islands in Galway to deal with council-related issues that are arising or are planned for the future.  I wonder whether we would be here today if such a forum was still in place.  It is a question of communications.  I do not think it is too much to ask for people to sit down for an hour or an hour and a half every six months.  I think such dialogue will be crucial from here on in.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I would not want anyone to think these by-laws were introduced overnight without any dialogue.  There was a great deal of dialogue, contention and discussion over a 13-month period until the by-laws were eventually adopted.  I acknowledge Ms N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill's confirmation that I have always met people to discuss these issues.  I want to respond to what she said about last Friday's discussions with the operator, which took place on the basis of the commercial viability of the enterprise.  The discussions were meant to involve detailed financial consideration of the issue.  I had indicated to Ms N&iacute; Gh&oacute;ill that I would raise the question of her group's attendance at the meeting.  I would have had no difficulty with that.  I understand she had already departed County Hall by the time the meeting started.  On a personal basis, I have absolutely no problem talking to anybody at any point.</p></speech>

The legal sensitivities pertaining to the ongoing proceedings about the historic levies that have been in place for a certain number of years - four years, in particular - form quite a substantial part of the discussion.  The chief executive is bound by certain issues and legal requirements that mean there cannot be an open discussion.  The discussion has to be specifically with the operator itself because certain matters would be<i>sub judice</i>if they were brought into question.  That also presents a difficulty for the council.</p></speech>

An bhfuil muintir Inis M&oacute;r s&aacute;sta leis an gc&eacute;ibh a fuair siad?  An gceapann siad gur c&eacute;ibh mhaith &iacute;?  An bhfuil an ch&eacute;ibh ag d&eacute;anamh an jab gur cheart di a dh&eacute;anamh &oacute; thaobh foscadh a thabhairt do bh&aacute;id a thagann isteach go dt&iacute; an oile&aacute;n?

N&iacute; bheidh aon chonradh buan ann an bhliain seo chugainn.  De r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim, t&oacute;gfaidh s&eacute; bliain a leith&eacute;id de chonradh a chur in &aacute;it.

First, if the Department were to offer it an annual lump sum equivalent to what it estimates it will get from the levies each year, would it rescind the by-laws and take the money from the Department?  That is what should have happened from the beginning.  I am not referring to the full cost of running the pier, but to the amount of money that the county council hopes to raise from the levies.  Second, will the county council confirm that the councillors in east Galway were willing to get rid of the levies as long as the money foregone was taken 100% out of the roads money for Connemara?  I think we need to be bluntly honest about this issue.  Thirty of the 39 councillors on Galway County Council are from the east and nine are from the west.  The councillors from the east said they would have no problem getting rid of the by-laws as long as the money came out of the roads money for Connemara.  That would leave Connemara with no roads money.</p></speech>

I was going to ask Mr. Kelly the same question.  Have there been any discussions with the Department on whether funds might be secured from it to cover the costs?  I know that Galway County Council had a huge deficit after the works were done on the pier.  Has the Department been approached to see whether moneys could be recouped in the manner suggested by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v?  That might be better than the imposition of a levy.  I do not know what kind of relationship the Department has with Ms N&iacute; Ghoill and her colleagues in the co-op on the island.  It seems from what I can gather from my dealings with the officials in the Department that there is a belief that the Aran Islands are getting too much of the budget for the islands.  I can honestly say there is a feeling that they would not be happy to provide the islands with one service a week.  It seems to be a battle.  When one goes in to talk with the officials, there seems to be a general feeling that the Aran Islands are getting the bulk of the funds.  I suggest that consideration should be given to what the Aran Islands are worth to the Irish economy.  We should be looking at the money that tourism on the islands brings in, rather than at how much it costs us to keep the service we are discussing.  Can Mr. Kelly tell us whether discussions have taken place between the Department and Galway County Council since the issue of the levy arose?  As Ms N&iacute; Ghoill could tell us, when the tender for the provision of a ferry service to the islands was advertised, no one else tendered for it.  We have to work with what is there.  That is the bottom line.</p></speech>

I still think costas riaradh na c&eacute;ibhe is very high.  I would appreciate it if a detailed breakdown could be forwarded to the committee so we can see those details.  We are going to be meeting officials from the Department to discuss this issue.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray referred to the reconvening of the islands committee, which is a very good idea.  Are the representatives of Galway County Council in favour of that?  Perhaps the remit of a reconstituted committee could include transport issues involving the Department and other stakeholders.  This would enable it to act as the coiste iompair I discussed previously.  Would the council be in favour of that?</p> <p>  According to the figures we have heard, there was a willingness to accept a figure of 80 cent in respect of 200,000 passengers each year.  That would equate to &euro;160,000 per annum.  It is obvious that there is some horsetrading going on with the Department.  According to the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, the Department was willing to put &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 on the table last year to try to resolve this issue.  Surely there can be a meeting of budgets or funding to try to sort this issue out for once and for all.  Galway County Council is looking for a certain amount of money to cover its costs.  The Department and the operator are willing to come some of the way.  Is that the approach we should be taking to try to put the by-laws to bed for once and for all?</p></speech>

It is right that I have been hearing about this issue day and night since I returned to the Seanad.  Something happened in the general election this year because rural Ireland felt it had been forgotten about.  Ireland does not stop at the Red Cow roundabout.  It has so much to offer.</p> <p>  Although I reiterate my point that &euro;48 million seems to have been a substantial amount of money in 2007, I take the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Mr. Kelly that significant costs were associated with building this facility.  There cannot be a tax on the islanders.  I wonder about the possibility of cross-fertilisation or cross-subsidisation with regard to the extra moneys that islanders coming off Inis M&oacute;r have to pay.</p> <p>  I would like someone to answer a question I asked earlier.  Why did the State company stop providing this service four years ago?  If it had not done so, the islanders and others would not have been in the High Court or the Supreme Court.</p></speech>

It is obvious that county councils are entitled to have by-laws.  We need to ask why the by-laws were introduced in the first place.  They should not have been introduced.  The effect of the by-laws was to divide the islanders from the rest of the county.  We can keep saying the county council was right - clearly, it must be entitled to bring in by-laws - but I think it started from the wrong point in this instance.  This should not have happened.  It divided councillors from councillors and islanders from people in the rest of the county.</p> <p>  We still do not have a policy for the islands.  None of this would have happened if such a policy had been in place.  It is greatly lacking.  This committee and the committee I chair both have roles in this regard.  It is clear that we need to focus our efforts in this area.</p> <p>  The islanders have gone from emergency to emergency.  We have gone to meetings to support them.  It seems to me that they are not valued as stakeholders.  They are not consulted until after the event.  We have repeatedly asked for the islanders to be present at many of the crucial meetings we have attended, for example in respect of the air service, but the Department has flatly refused to enable this.  The Department's position is that it is not the role of the islanders to be at those meetings.  Many of the problems with the air and ferry services could have been avoided if the islanders had been included from the outset.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to the renewal of relationships that have broken down.  That can only work based on a policy.  These meetings are not important unless they based on policies that value island life and the provision of resources accordingly.  Like Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, when I heard it being suggested that 40% can be added to the costs of projects on the islands, it immediately struck me that this must apply to all the people living on the islands.  It seems to me that this aspect of the matter was not discussed at any stage before these by-laws were brought in.  This should have happened in the interests of balance.</p></speech>

We are recognised by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the islands are collectively branded.  It took some time to get there, but we got there in the end.  Through that process, we are a huge contributor to national revenue.  That comes back to seeking our share of the revenue in order to sustain the islands into the future.</p> <p>  I own a hotel myself so I have a fair idea of what I am talking about.  Of our customer base, I would say that 75% to 80% are Irish people.  That is quite common across all of the islands.  The people who are staying and booking for two or three nights for weddings, self-catering, hostels, holiday homes or whatever it may be are all Irish people.  Irish people are invested in the islands.  All we are looking for is for our Government to think the same way and do the same thing.  Irrespective of what Government is in power, there must be a continuous policy on the sustainability of islands at council level, county development plan level, national plan level and, for us involved with the European Small Islands Federation, at European level as well.  It does not take a huge amount for people to think consistently that this is a country that has islands that need to be protected to ensure their sustainability into the future.</p></speech>

From the point of view of engaging with the island communities, on behalf of Galway County Council, I have absolutely no difficulty with that.  It would be ideal if, in addition to the local authority, it was a cross-departmental engagement in order that all of the issues could be adequately teased out.</p> <p>  With regard to the issue of Connemara electoral area, there may well have been some suggestion that the cost would have to be met by the Connemara electoral area, but there was no decision in that regard.  With the advent of the new municipal districts, it is not a consideration that is unique to the islands or the Connemara community.  At our budget meeting more recently, there was a decision that had to be made in respect of a saving in the east of the county.  A substantial part of that saving had to be found within the municipal districts.  That is a general approach.</p> <p>  I cannot read my notes in the dark, but the only thing I can say with regard to the grant is that we have come through a democratic process involving the decision of the elected members.  The most I can say on that is that I will put any such proposal to the elected members for consideration, having regard to the functions that are reserved to them.</p></speech>

I apologise and do not mean to cut across others.  A question was raised about the positivity being put out in terms of the development of the pier and the product that is there.  The council was complimented on the work that was done and on the development itself.  However, there were statements made and I wish to clarify them.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked whether the council would get rid of the by-laws if this grant, funding, subsidy or whatever format it takes is provided by the Government.  Deputy Connolly was suggesting that the council was legally entitled to do so in whatever cases, but that it was the incorrect thing to do to formulate the by-laws.  It is essential that this is made clear.  What the Deputies are perhaps trying to refer to are the levies.  This is a huge structure.  It is a huge pier and harbour in itself.  It does require the by-laws.  Whether they would have to be dropped in essence-----</p></speech>

The project has been given the go-ahead.  We are progressing it and taking up from where we left off with the consultants.  There is some updating of the environmental reports required.  Obviously, we have been through the planning process.  There is a lack of clarity around the Inis Me&aacute;in project at the moment.  I have been in correspondence with the island community on that in the past week.  Unfortunately, we lost a colleague recently who was heavily involved in the discussions in respect of those two projects.  We are just picking that up again now.  Inis O&iacute;rr is progressing ahead and, from my perspective, further clarity is required in respect of Inis Me&aacute;in.</p></speech>
