    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#A00300"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied today by Mr. John Riordan.  No apologies have been received.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of our meetings on 22 and 24 November and on 1 and 8 December last.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  In terms of matters arising from the minutes, we will take it that any relevant matters arising will be dealt with in the normal course of our work.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  We have a considerable amount of correspondence to deal with because it has been some time since we had a public meeting.  The first item of correspondence is the opening statement from Mr. Brendan McDonagh, CEO of NAMA, which we have noted and published.  We will be dealing with that later.</p> <p>  The next item is category B correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  These are follow-up items relating to previous meetings.  The first item is No. 201B, an e-mail from Brown Rudnick expressing surprise and disappointment regarding the publishing of details of a letter sent to the committee prior to its consideration by the committee.  We did receive a letter and I saw references to extracts from it in the newspapers before it was considered by this committee.  It is extremely disappointing that some members chose to go down that route.  We note the points made by Brown Rudnick, which are fair comment.  We will note it and publish that remark.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from Professor Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank, regarding State organisations lodging money with the Central Bank.  We will note and publish that letter.  The next item is correspondence from Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, providing information requested at our meeting on 20 October.  We will note and publish that.  The next item of correspondence is No. 217B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing an update to the committee on the transfer of property under the 2002 indemnity agreement.  We will note and publish that.  There is other correspondence relating to that general indemnity agreement which I will refer to later.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 219 B (i) and (ii), correspondence from the OPW regarding rents paid by that office and the Department of Social Protection.  We will note and publish that.  The next item is No. 220B, correspondence from the Minister for Finance providing a response to a request for information from the committee in relation to NAMA and Project Eagle.  We will note and publish that and will also include it on the Project Eagle section of our site, which is an internal method of recording all Project Eagle related correspondence for committee members.  The next item is No. 221B from Ms Michelle Lowe of NAMA providing a response to a request for information from the committee relating to Project Eagle.  We will note and publish that too.</p> <p>  I will now move on to Category C correspondence which is correspondence from private individuals and any other correspondence.</p><p>Nos. 181C, (i) to (iii), is correspondence from the North Meath Communities Development Association in regard to an ongoing issue with the HSE.  This matter was dealt with in some detail by the previous Committee of Public Accounts, which also wrote to the HSE at that time.  However, there was a recognition that this is a matter of a disputed contract and ultimately a matter for the HSE.  I would like to defer consideration of this matter to our next meeting to allow members time to study the documentation.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00200"><p>Prior to the summer recess I raised the issue of correspondence issued by the previous committee in January of this year citing that this matter had also been referred to the Taoiseach's Department.  This is a matter of great concern to the people involved, in respect of which a large number of public meetings were held during the summer.  The body concerned does good work and it needs to be supported.  I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has met with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the issue.  It is important that a statement is forthcoming from the Minister on this matter and that it is resolved as soon as possible.  We cannot have a situation whereby a community body engaged in this type of work is left with this debt.  The previous PAC was very strong in its statement on this matter.  I would appreciate it if it could be addressed as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00300"><p>As mentioned by Deputy Cassells, this matter has been brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Harris and the HSE.  Perhaps we should seek a response from the Minister and the HSE on the matter, following which we will consider all of the correspondence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00400"><p>The HSE has been consistent in its approach to it.  I would appreciate if the Minister's appraisal of the matter could be sought.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00500"><p>We will write to the Minister on that basis.  When the reply has been received we will examine the issue in its entirety, bearing in mind that it was been already considered by the previous PAC.  I am not familiar enough with the details to draw any conclusion on the matter this morning.</p><p>The next item is No. 200C, (i) to (iii)<b><i>.  </i></b>These items can be taken together.  They are copies of correspondence regarding directorship at Limerick Greyhound Stadium for the purposes of keeping the committee informed.  Is it agreed to note this correspondence?  Agreed.  </p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 203C<b><i></i></b>is<i></i>correspondence received from Ms Audrey Keane, Registrar of Aosd&aacute;na in the Arts Council in reply to correspondence regarding the payment of the Aosd&aacute;na Cnuas grant.  I propose that we now consider this matter closed and we forward this to the individual who wrote to the committee on this matter.Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 205C (i) and (ii) is correspondence from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, with an overall description of the tender process framework.  I thank Mr. Quinn for this information, which we will note.  We will also forward a copy of it to the company that raised the matter with us at an earlier meeting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B00700"><p>Yes, public procurement is fundamental to our role and it will be included in our work programme for the new year.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 209C (i) and (ii) is correspondence from Ms Mary Higgins, CEO of Caranua.  The committee received a number of items of correspondence from individuals regarding the spending of moneys by Caranua.  We will forward this information to these individuals.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has also indicated that his office will be carrying out a report on the wider issues of the residential redress scheme.  As I mentioned earlier, correspondence has also been received on this matter from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  We will deal in detail with this matter in the new year.  Is the report being carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General a special report?</p></speech>

The committee has the financial statements for Caranua for 2014.  The 2015 audit is almost complete and I suspect it will be with the committee early in the new year.</p></speech>

Those resources are to be applied for the benefit of individuals who were in institutions.  Caranua commenced operation in 2014.  Effectively, it issues grants to the benefit of individuals who were in institutions.</p></speech>

A number of people have been in contact with the committee on this matter, including former residents of the residential institutions.  They are concerned that we deal with this matter soon and we will do so.</p><p>Nos. 210C and 222 C (i) and (ii) deal with a Mazars review of processes employed by the University of Limerick.  There is correspondence from the CEO of the Higher Education Authority and from the President of the University of Limerick in respect of actions taken following the review.  Is it agreed to note this correspondence?  Agreed.  I also propose that we make copies of it available to the individual who brought the matter to the committee&rsquo;s attention.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It may be also worth adding the University of Limerick to the work programme when we engage with third level institutions in 2017.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 211C (i) and (ii) is correspondence from the CEO of the National Transport Authority providing a response to an issue identified in its 2015 financial statements with the lease of a building.  I think this relates to the fact that the building was not occupied for some time.  If people want to raise this matter again at a future date or to deal with it in any other format they are free to do so.  </p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 213C is correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills in reply to an issue raised by an individual alleging misappropriation of public money in Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board.  The Department is aware of the matter and regards the use of the funding as appropriate in this case.  I suggest that we send a copy of this correspondence to the individual and that we now consider the matter closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 217C is correspondence, also from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills.  This is an update for the committee in regard to the transfer of property under the 2002 indemnity agreement.Is it agree to note this correspondence?  Agreed.</p><p><b><i></i></b>No. 223C (i) and (ii) is correspondence from an individual on the deterioration of salmon stocks.  A paper on the matter is attached.  The individual claims that this is principally a co-ordination problem and while a group has been set up under the EPA, called LAWCO, he believes there is real need for an involvement in this area by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  I propose that we write to the EPA, forwarding a copy of this correspondence and requesting a response on whether the inclusion of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would add value to this group and, if so, to invite its participation.  I also propose that we write to the Department directly asking for its response on the correspondence and whether it would consider being involved in the LAWCO group or other such group to deal with the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  When a response has been received from the two organisations we will deal with the matter. </p><p>We now move on to reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting on 24 November 2016.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#B02800"><p>Before we move on from correspondence, I would like to raise again today the issue of the section 38 and 39 organisations.  I am a little uncomfortable that we have had only one hearing on the Console issue.  An internal audit carried out by the HSE raised very serious process issues.  Since then we have come across a number of other organisations where similar problems have arisen.  There appears to be a problem in terms of accountability and the relationship between the HSE and these organisations.  Is there merit in the Comptroller and Auditor General doing a special report on section 38 and 39 organisations' processes?  It would appear that this is not an isolated issue.  There are issues that arose at the Committee of Public Accounts prior to this incarnation, which were in the public domain.</p><p>We have had one engagement with the HSE and that was it.  I accept that Project Eagle came to the fore at that point but we must put some thought into what is the best way to progress the issue because a significant amount of taxpayers' money is being spent and given to those organisations.  Most deal with their funds appropriately and no issues arise but there are failures in the process.  I again flag the issue as I am concerned that we have not decided one way or the other how we should proceed.</p></speech>

Oversight of sections 38 and 39 bodies is something that is examined every year.  I drew the committee&rsquo;s attention previously to the statement on internal financial control in the HSE, which is quite extensive, and it deals every year now with the development of its processes for oversight.  Every year there is a report on it that the committee is free to examine as it wishes.  It is at a process level though, rather than at the level of individual entities.  Where there are significant failures those should be noted in the statement on internal financial control and one would expect to see in the 2016 financial statements an explanation from the HSE as to what control changes it is making, given the lapses that have occurred in individual charities or voluntary bodies.</p> <p>  The committee has a framework at any stage to bring the HSE in to give it an update.  Undoubtedly, it is a very significant line of expenditure of the order of &euro;2.5 billion to &euro;3 billion a year in transfers to sections 38 and 39 organisations.</p></speech>

It is the next item on the agenda.</p> <p>  Financial statements received since 24 November include the Athlone Institute of Technology.  It got a clear report.  We also received the 2012 and 2013 accounts from the National College of Art and Design.  It got a qualified opinion.  The college kept inadequate records for the period of account.  That is very serious.  Serious issues were raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the system of internal control.  The deferred pension funding issue is standard for all universities.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General could say why we are only getting the 2012 accounts now from the National College of Art and Design.</p></speech>

We had to do a substantial amount of working around to try to get complete explanations.  It is a matter which I have reported on in 2014.  I signalled then that the problem existed.  The qualified audit opinion has been given for the past three years in relation to NCAD.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to carry out the audit.  While we feel that the college has reached a situation where it is giving a reasonable representation of the transactions in the year, there is an element of doubt over it because of the quality of the accounting records.</p></speech>

After the report was presented by me, there was a change in the board &ndash; almost a complete change of the board membership &ndash; in the middle of 2015.  When we get to the 2014 to 2015 financial statements, which I expect we will begin auditing in the new year, I think the systems will be significantly better.  The statement on internal financial control is quite comprehensive about the problems that there have been for the college and the steps it is taking.

I anticipate that matters will be better for the 2013 to 2014 period but I cannot give an opinion until the audit is completed.  I will certainly be reporting and drawing attention to matters if I am dissatisfied.</p> <p>  I would also expect the capacity of the college to speed up the delivery of financial statements to improve.

The next item is Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which also got a clear audit report.  Next is the Crawford Art Gallery Cork Limited.  It got a clear audit report but there is a comment that it did not carry out the review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control during the course of the year.  The Kilkenny-Carlow Education and Training Board got a clear report.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is next.  Its remit is to build and equip the national paediatric hospital.  It got a clear audit report.  It might be a matter for the health committee but if anyone wants to have a look at that set of accounts they are in the Oireachtas Library and they will be published subsequent to the meeting.  It is a big investment by the Irish taxpayer.  People can raise the issue at a later date if they wish.</p> <p>  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner got a clear report.  Col&aacute;iste Mhuire gan Sm&aacute;l, Ollscoil Luimnigh, got a clear audit report.  Again, the issue of deferred pensions arises, which is common to many public sector bodies.  The Irish Film Board got a clear audit report.  The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces got a clear audit report and Horse Racing Ireland got a clear audit report for its 2015 accounts.  The agriculture committee has had the group in before it recently.</p> <p>  I have nothing formally drafted for the work programme.  I suggest that on 12 January we have a detailed meeting to consider progress on the Project Eagle report.  I hope we will be able to finalise that within the week.  I would like to be able to publish it on approximately Thursday, 19 January.  We will have a meeting on 12 January and perhaps another meeting on the following Tuesday or Wednesday to tidy up the report before we issue it on 19 January.  The normal process for issuing a report is for the committee to do so in the AV room.  It might be for an hour in the afternoon.</p><p>It is important that the committee holds some normal public meetings dealing with issues other than Project Eagle.  With that in mind, for our meetings on Thursday, 19 January 2017, Thursday, 26 January 2017 and Thursday, 2 February 2017, I have come up with three specific items which we could try to deal with.  The first is the issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  The second is the sale or disposal of the Government jet, which is a discrete chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The third item is the special report on the cost of the changes to the Prison Service.  We will try to get some normal business meetings going and in early January we will lay out our work programme for the following months.  We will be bringing in the HSE, third level institutions and so forth.  The issues I have suggested for our initial meetings next year are short and very specific and that would be preferable to opening up, for example, broader issues with regard to the HSE.</p></speech>

Sorry, my apologies, it is not a draft report but a working paper prepared by the officials.  If members could look at that before the meeting and prepare their observations on it, we can move quite quickly.  If members only open it up when we arrive, however, we will not get very far.  I think a meeting from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. should be adequate.  </p> <p>  That is the approximate work programme for the first few meetings of next year.  As there is no other business, I want to go into private session briefly to discuss the status of our work on Project Eagle before we call in our witnesses.</p></speech>

In the course of the committee's examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on NAMA's sale of Project Eagle, the committee had sought a considerable amount of information from NAMA.  We are very grateful to NAMA for the material supplied to the committee to date.  One particular item requested was a copy of the contemporaneous notes in the format taken during the meeting that were used in the subsequent preparation of the minutes of NAMA board meetings held on 12 December 2013 and 8 January 2014.  NAMA responded to the committee that once NAMA board minutes are adopted by the board members, they are the official record of that particular meeting.  As a result, the board secretary&rsquo;s contemporaneous notes of the meeting are transitory records and are not retained.  As I mentioned at our last private meeting, I was surprised by this considering the importance of the meetings and the fact that the board was considering the sale of assets worth &pound;1.3 billion.  For that reason, we have asked for NAMA to put on the record at this meeting its policy regarding the retention of contemporaneous notes in respect of the preparation of board minutes.  I will allow for some short questions at the end but I ask that members do not drift into other topics today and that they be very brief.  This session will be over within one hour at the very latest.  It may not go that far but I will be closing the meeting at 11.45 a.m. if it is not concluded by then.  There is one specific item and we should be well able to do our business in the time allowed.</p><p>I welcome the following representatives from NAMA: Mr Frank Daly, chairman, and Mr. Brendan McDonagh, chief executive.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off all mobile phones.  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving the evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Daly to make his statement.</p></speech>

It is the fifth occasion on which the chief executive and I have appeared before the committee to deal with this issue.  We estimate that NAMA representatives have already responded to about 2,000 oral questions during our appearances and to about 100 written questions, which have been submitted to us by the committee.  We received yesterday some additional questions to which we will respond very shortly.  We trust that this extensive evidence, in both oral and written form and which has been provided to the committee by NAMA, will be of much assistance to it in the preparation of its report. </p> <p>  The committee has invited us today to discuss a specific issue and it has indicated to us that the morning session will be confined to a maximum of one hour.  The specific issue relates to the contemporaneous notes taken during board meetings in late 2013 and early 2014.  These notes were used to prepare the minutes of the meetings.  According to a press release issued by the committee after its meeting on Thursday of last week, it appears surprise was expressed that the written notes used to prepare the board minutes were not retained by NAMA.  The committee will be aware that the signed board minutes are the official record of each meeting.  I propose to help the committee to explain the position on the preparation of board minutes, which would typically record the following: board members in attendance and apologies in the case of absences, the date and time of the meeting, disclosure of interests, each agenda item considered by the board, the decision or decisions in respect of each agenda item, whether a decision was required, with concise coverage of the substance of the deliberations on that agenda item, any action item arising from a decision and any concern or objection which a board member wishes to record. </p> <p>  The secretary attends the board meeting and takes written notes.  From these notes, draft typed minutes are prepared which record the decisions and the actions decided at the meeting.  As soon as practicable following the meeting, typically two to three working days, the draft minutes are sent to me, as chairman, for review.</p><p>Following the chairman's review, the draft minutes are circulated to the board members for comment, typically within five working days of the meeting.  Board members are expected to revert to the secretary with any comments they may have within three working days of receipt of the draft minutes.  The final agreed minutes, as reviewed by all board members, are then presented and approved by the board at a subsequent board meeting and they are then signed by the chairman.  The minutes approved by the board and signed by the chairman are regarded in law as evidence of the proceedings and of the decisions taken by the board.  There can be only one set of official minutes of meetings.  The secretary then disposes of the written notes taken during the meeting as they are no longer required.  The secretary's notes serve no purpose other than to assist the secretary in preparing the typed draft minutes for circulation to the chairman and board members.  Once the minutes are agreed and approved, there is no reason the secretary's handwritten notes should be retained.</p><p> This is the practice which NAMA operates and which I understand applies throughout the public service and elsewhere in line with best practice in corporate governance.  For instance, the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, ICSA, has produced a guidance note on minute taking, and I refer to the 2016 version, which recommends the following procedure for written notes:  "On balance we recommend that the notes should be retained until the minutes are approved but then promptly destroyed."</p><p> In conclusion, NAMA's procedures in relation to board minutes are therefore very much in line with recommended best practice.  Once a set of minutes has been agreed and approved by the board in relation to a particular meeting then that becomes the record of the proceedings and of the decisions taken at that meeting.  Accordingly, I cannot see what merit there would be in retaining written notes after they have fulfilled their basic purpose of assisting the board's secretary to type up the draft minutes.</p></speech>

The first time Mr. Daly appeared before the committee in this regard, I asked him to provide the minutes and I thank him for doing so.  The minutes are retrospective but it is good to have them.  I wish to refer Mr. Daly to the first page of his opening statement.  He said, "The signed board minutes are the official record of each meeting."  I would like him to state here on record whether there was an off-piste discussion.  I have been privy to meetings where during the discussions, a request was made for the tape to be stopped and a conversation ensued.  It would have been said, "We won't record this for the minutes but let us have a conversation."  I ask Mr. Daly to confirm today that no such discussion took place at the board meeting.  When one reads the minutes one can see a clear decision was made but no rationale has been given.  I am not satisfied with how or where the conversation took place.  I ask Mr. Daly to confirm that no conversations around that took place that were not recorded, as in an unofficial conversation.  He has said that the minutes are the official record.</p></speech>

There are always discussions at board meetings.  I think we went through this the last time we were here.  Certainly, one will have a lot of discussions during a board meeting or any meeting.  The essence of the record of the minutes is to record the substance of those discussions.  It is my view that there is nothing of consequence that was discussed during the board meeting that was not reflected in the minutes.  To go back to the Deputy's point, I presume she said "stop the tape" as an example because, for the record, NAMA board meetings are not recorded.</p></speech>

I find the opening statement to be reasonable.  I have no difficulty with the process of minute taking.  It is reasonable that notes are taken and then transcribed into a draft set of minutes that is sent to Mr. Daly and board members.  I also do not have a difficulty with the notes being discarded at some point as I think it is reasonable.  I have no difficulty with the process.</p> <p>  I have one question that has already been raised.  I am not sure whether it was Mr. Daly or Mr. McDonagh who mentioned in some of the previous hearings, although I think it was Mr. McDonagh, that maybe improvements could be made in how NAMA records minutes, or maybe that is something NAMA could learn from.  I refer to when Mr. Daly talked about what the minutes actually record and number 5 is an area which did not jump out in some of the minutes.  It is an area where improvements could be made.  We have had lengthy discussions about the interpretations of some minutes.</p><p>I refer to better recording of what is said here and concise coverage of the substance of the discussions on that agenda.  I do not think that is exactly what is in the minutes I have seen.  If there was an improvement to be made, I would focus on that.  It is up to NAMA, given that it offered that up.  Perhaps there could be improvements in minute taking.  Where does NAMA see those improvements?  Aside from that, I do not have a difficulty with the process itself.</p></speech>

The improvements to which I referred in my opening statement the last day would certainly be in the area of item No. 5, as the Deputy mentioned.  It has already happened.  If you looked at current minutes, you would see a greater coverage of the substance of the deliberations.  That is the essence of it.</p></speech>

It is certainly clear.  I have only one or two questions about it.  I do not know whether the Chairman will allow me to do this.  In respect of the minutes of board meetings and other meetings, Mr. Daly has clarified the policy regarding board meetings.  There are so many days allowed - periods of time - where they refer to Mr. Daly first.  Presumably, he makes changes to them as he sees it.</p></speech>

Regarding business meeting minutes, which include those two sets of minutes referred to by the Deputy, the policy is to have minutes of them but, effectively, there is no set format because they are just business meetings and everybody has their own style of doing minutes depending on who is taking the minutes at the meeting.  They are business meetings, not official board meetings.</p></speech>

Regarding the specific matter that the Deputy mentioned, namely, the change in strategy to opt for a loan sale rather than the approach that had been agreed previously, it would have been discussed.  There was a challenging of why we were going that way, but there were no contrarian views to the effect that we should not have gone down that road when the opportunity arose.  There would have been a questioning of the figures, pros and cons outlined in the paper, with people perhaps zoning in on particular aspects, but there was no contrarian view that needed to be reflected in the minutes because it was a unanimous decision of the board.</p> <p>  Although it rarely occurs, a specific provision allows for a board member to have a contrary view or particular point recorded in the minutes against his or her name.  We encourage that.</p></speech>

I probably never even saw them and it has been nearly four years since they existed.  It would probably have been helpful to us had there been greater detail in the minutes.  That might have helped this committee.  The committee has the minutes and all of the other documentation that we have sent it, and it must make a judgment on those.  Unless this process has been wasting everyone's time, I hope that members will also take account of the consistent evidence that has been given by all NAMA witnesses during this engagement.</p></speech>

It was a surprise to most of us to discover that these notes had not been kept.  We had seen other detailed contemporaneous notes of lower level or business meetings.  I would understand this in a private company, which does not need to keep as many official records and can do what it likes, but I presumed that State bodies had to keep notes of significant board discussions.  Most people have been surprised that these ones have not been retained.  If Mr. Daly is saying that this is the general practice, this committee will take up the matter.</p> <p>  Each time that the witnesses appeared before us in the past month or so, they referred specifically to their board discussions about the famous 10%.  It was that continual reference that led us to ask them to help us by giving us a copy of the notes, seeing as how the information was not contained in the documents given to the board or in the board's own minutes.  That the notes are not available has put NAMA at a disadvantage.  We are not doubting the witnesses' word, but it would have made life easier for them earlier than this had the notes been retained.  Mr. Daly gets my point.</p></speech>

Ten NAMA witnesses have attended these meetings and told the committee about the 10%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-14a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016121400002#H04800"><p>We made a point of inviting all current and former board members and senior staff.  The committee will consider whether this is a good policy for State organisations.  Maybe it is, but there is a down side.  Sometimes, the organisations can be put at a disadvantage.</p> <p>  We have asked about two sets of board minutes, including those from December.</p><p>It would be important that Mr. Daly said that everything of substance was recorded and that if it was not of substance it was not in there.  From our point of view it is fundamental that we are satisfied that the official record would be a complete and accurate record of all the decisions of substance.  We are entitled to proceed on that basis.  On the two meetings we asked about, there are two references.  It is on page 111 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It refers to a NAMA board meeting of 8 January 2014.  The last sentence in paragraph three states: "As agreed at its 12th December 2013 meeting the Board noted it would not consider the sale of Project Eagle portfolio of loans for a consideration of less than STG&pound;1.3 billion".  That was agreed at the NAMA board's December meeting.  Page 108 of the same report is entitled "Extract from signed minutes of Board&rsquo;s 12th December 2013 meeting (Private Session)".  There is no reference in that document in respect of the consideration of &pound;1.3 billion.  The January minutes state it was agreed at the December meeting, but it is not mentioned in the December minutes.  If Mr. Daly is now trying to tell me an agreement about &pound;1.3 billion, which the January minutes state was agreed at December, was not a substantial issue, I am at a loss.  Why was that not recorded in the December minutes?</p></speech>

It was a general discussion.  I would refer the Chairman to page 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which states: "The Board agreed to consider the matter of price in conjunction with consideration of the above sales process paper."  I agree with the Chairman that a bald reading of it, one would say: "Where's the decision on the 12th?"  However, there was not a decision on the 12th.</p></speech>

So there are many issues agreed at the board meeting that are not decisions of the board meeting.</p></speech>

The essence of what was said at the meeting on the 12th was as follows.  Because the figure of &pound;1.3 billion was being bandied about - it was in the paper - we did not make a decision on it at the time, but there would have been the comment, "Well look, that's the least we're going to take for this".  Then we went back to this in substance at the meeting on 8 January and that was the formal decision, which is recorded in those minutes.</p></speech>

We were talking about the whole process.  We were talking about the price.  We agreed to consider the matter of price in conjunction with the consideration of the board paper.  Then in the subsequent ones where there is a reference - I accept the Chairman's point - to "As agreed at its 12th December 2013 meeting" that we would not consider it for less than &pound;1.3 billion, but there was no decision at the earlier meeting in regard to that.</p></speech>

We take litigation, ourselves, from time to time.  Obviously, in litigation there is always discovery of documentation.  Discovery allows either side - but let us say somebody is taking an action against us - to discover the records of meetings and decisions.  In that context it is very important that there is no ambiguity about what is the record of the decision - that there are not two sets, that there are not draft sets, that there are not notes.  This would be well realised.  If the Chairman reads through the ICSA document in full, that would be part of the rationale there.  One needs to have one set of minutes, which actually records the decisions as agreed by all the board members.</p> <p>  Yes, they are discoverable.  Yes, they have been tested in court.  I do not think, as I recall, that there has ever been a case in which the minutes have been an issue or found deficient.  I am conscious of the fact that we have a couple of cases that are live, so I do not want to go into any great detail in regard to that.</p></speech>

What obligations does this place on it to retain records?  To put it simply, Deputies would be alarmed if, when dealing with a Department, for example, the Department of Health or the Department of Social Protection, they were told that the notes on how the Department arrived at a decision in a case were not retained or if the chief appeals officer in the Department of Social Protection stated that notes were not kept on how a decision was arrived at.  One would expect public bodies to be able to demonstrate how they arrived at a decision, even though the final decision is the final legal decision.  Does Mr. Daly understand that we, in our daily work, can often get behind the final decision because when we challenge how a decision was arrived at, the Department is able to produce the record?  That is the reason we were surprised that a body as large as NAMA was operating differently from the other public bodies with which we deal.   </p></speech>

If NAMA were to show the rationale, it would demonstrate that.  That is really what this is about because it begs a question that is left unanswered.  That is why I spoke earlier about extenuating circumstances when there is so much money at stake.  Mr. Daly stated NAMA would address the matter in future, which would be helpful because it would eradicate that possibility.</p></speech>

The issue there is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which controls the freedom of information legislation, issued guidance that organisations should have records management policies.  There are certain types of record which should be kept forever, certain types of records that should be kept for a certain period of time in terms of the Statute of Limitations and then there are other records, which are transitory records, which should not be kept.  That is the guidance from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and NAMA is following that guidance.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly is saying that everything of substance was recorded but he made a big issue of the 10% being a major part of the board's discussions and how the board arrived at that figure.  If he is saying that everything of substance was recorded and there is no reference to the 10% in the recorded minutes, it leads me to conclude that the board's discussion on using the 10% figure Mr. Daly says was discussed at its meetings was not a very substantial issue.  If it had been a substantial issue, reference would have been made to the 10% figure.</p></speech>
