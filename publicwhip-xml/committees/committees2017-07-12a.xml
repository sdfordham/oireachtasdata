I am delighted to be selected as chairwoman or chairperson, and I look forward to working with all of the members.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, this committee was established in 2016 to consider national issues affecting public expenditure policy, Exchequer revenue receipts and the overall fiscal position.  The aim of this committee is to engage in a meaningful way with the budget process, to offer more transparency on how budgetary decisions are made, and to hold the Government to account for its decisions and, more importantly, how taxpayers' money is spent.  I look forward to working with the committee members to develop a focused work programme, especially when it comes to carrying out the scrutiny of budget proposals in advance of the budget.</p> <p>  I now propose to move to the business of the committee and to deal with a number of housekeeping issues.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I now invite Ms Logan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Logan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017071200002#C00200"><p>I thank the Chair and members for hosting us today.  It has been almost a year since we came before the committee and I note the significant crossover in membership that has occurred in the interim.  During our engagement with the committee last year, we emphasised the importance of matching equality and human rights governance principles with economic policy.  Human rights principles reinforce the focus on good budget governance including a strong evidence base, and in terms of key principles, mechanisms to guarantee participation, transparency and non-discrimination.  Our engagement with the committee today is about respecting our public accountability and accountability to the Oireachtas and providing with an update on the commission&rsquo;s work in this area in recent months.<br/><br/>The commission is Ireland's national human rights and equality body and its 15 members are all appointed by the President Michael D. Higgins.  We account directly to the Oireachtas in respect of our statutory functions.  Our founding legislation gives us a range of powers, from promotion and awareness-raising activities to significant legal powers to take proceedings, to act as <i>amicus curiae</i>, or friend of the court, and initiate statutory inquiries.  In our engagement with the committee last year, we emphasised the role the commission could play in assisting and encouraging the development of gender and equality-proofing practices within the relevant institutional spaces.  Much of the commission&rsquo;s work over the past year has been on building relationships with key actors in order to facilitate this.<br/><br/>An important aspect of our work has been exploring how best to embed human rights and equality-proofing mechanisms into current budget planning systems rather than creating parallel structures.  In this spirit, over the past year the commission has actively engaged with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is in the process of developing its own approach to incorporating equality budgeting into Ireland&rsquo;s medium-term expenditure framework.  The commission has provided its input and feedback on the Department&rsquo;s ongoing work in this area.  The commission has also worked with the Department to facilitate a workshop on equality budgeting for officials across Departments with particular roles in the budgetary process.  The workshop was held in mid-June and was run by my colleagues, Dr. Mary Murphy and Mr. Laurence Bond, our director.  This was the first of what we hope will be regular cross-departmental engagements to contribute to the development of equality budget proofing.  We see our recent engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this area as extremely positive and would hope to see similar engagements.  In particular, we would identify the Departments of Finance and Social Protection as priority Departments in the context of this work.<br/><br/>The committee will also be aware of the public sector duty that applies to all public bodies under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  We have a mandate in assisting public bodies in meeting this duty to have regard to human rights and equality by providing guidance.  In the past year we have rolled out a programme of capacity building, involving a number of pilot projects and information provision for public bodies around Ireland, from local authorities to Departments.  We view this work as intimately connected with the question of equality and human rights proofing.  Indeed, we view effective budget proofing as a central means by which public bodies can meet their legal obligations under the public sector duty.<br/><br/>The commission is also working to build a knowledge base on equality and human rights proofing.  We have published a number of fact sheets on proofing and have been working in co-operation with specialists to produce content for a special edition of the academic journal <i>Administration </i>focusing on human rights and equality proofing.  This special edition will bring together the latest policy developments and best practices in budget proofing, taking a cross-Border and international perspective.  This special issue will be published in August and we hope it will make a contribution to Departments&rsquo; efforts to incorporate equality and human rights budgeting into their current practices.<br/><br/>The programme for Government commitment to budget proofing is a very positive development.  However, as members will be well aware, achieving effective and meaningful proofing practices across relevant institutions of the State is a very long-term process, requiring a long-term commitment to increased capacity, change methodologies and shift cultures and practices.  The commission has called for the creation of a national proofing advisory committee to assist this process.<br/><br/>The Oireachtas and its committees have a crucial role to play in maintaining a focus on proofing and scrutinising the efforts of Departments in the preparation of the forthcoming budget and into the future.  This applies to the work of the sectoral committees and it also applies of course to this committee's broader oversight role and the great potential that exists for collaboration with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in the broader budgetary planning process.  Connected to this, of course, is the essential role that the planned independent parliamentary budget office will play, and we note and welcome the fact that recruitment for this new office is currently under way.  I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>

There was a growing understanding of where the current budget processes, for example, spending reviews, would be proofed.  It was not concerned with identifying extra dimensions of mechanisms that would be proofing but rather looking at the evolving budget practice and where proofing could be added in.</p><p>Some good common understanding about the usefulness of that approach and how that would work was developing.  There was also a common understanding that there would be an equality statement in the budget on budget day and some discussion as to how that could be made meaningful.  Again, this built up expectations that this would happen.  One of the most useful parts of it was the realisation that individual line Departments needed to understand the elements in their established policy goals that were most relevant to equality and human rights, draw out from their established policy goals some key priority goals that were relevant to equality and human rights and put them forward for specific proofing exercises.  That could mean existing expenditures that needed to be reviewed to maximise the impact of that expenditure for equality and human rights or it could mean new budget lines as they were evolving.</p><p> One example might be Rebuilding Ireland which is now open to review and which is likely to have existing budget lines and some new budget lines added, but has not been fully exposed to an equality and human rights proofing exercise.  Lots of other ones included national strategies that were already in existence such as the youth strategy - Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - or the new Traveller or Roma strategy or the new national women's strategy.  All of those strategies have a bearing on individual line Departments and all of them are ways of advancing equality so it involved getting a better understanding of where these national strategies fitted into the business of line Departments and where they needed to proof to make sure they were maximising the budget potential to realise the outcomes in those strategies.  Much was done in the training to help people have a common understanding of how this would advance and it was quite useful in that sense.  People gave us feedback that they had a much better sense of what the language meant and that there was agreement across Departments that this was a sensible way to move forward.  Mr. Bond might want to add something.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Laurence Bond" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017071200002#D00200"><p>The workshop was hosted by us and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We made some of the inputs.  The key thing to note is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform called officials from Departments together to address these issues, which is a very positive development.  This arises out of work we have been doing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform over the past period.  The Department recognises that there is a programme for Government commitment to proofing and so, therefore, it has a responsibility to address that aspect.  It has been trying to engage with that and, as Dr. Murphy pointed out, to identify ways in which it can be meaningfully advanced through the existing processes, for example, in respect of the spending review, the social impact assessment and the performance budgeting framework that is in place in the Estimates.  Having said that, the Department has not overstated expectations in terms of what might happen this year, but it does seem important that there would be some specific equality statement in this year's budget as a concrete embodiment of the commitment in the programme for Government and that this is meaningful in a certain way.  The workshop arose out of that understanding of work being done in the Department and work we have done with the Department.  It was then part of bringing that out to budget officials in the line Departments to ensure that there was that common understanding referred to by Dr. Murphy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017071200002#D00300"><p>I want to address the workshop, which sounds like an excellent idea.  I propose that the Chairman invite the Working Group of Committee Chairmen to undertake such a workshop because there is no sense in this committee promoting equality budgeting and gender-proofed budgeting unless each line committee takes them on.  It might be worth the Chief Commissioner's while writing to the chairman of each parliamentary party and each group to tell them that this workshop is available.  We are here in our little committee room talking about this but if every committee put it on its agenda, its effectiveness could be far stronger.</p></speech>

I suspect that the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government probably never thinks of gender proofing housing programmes.  It just wants to get houses built.  There are so many areas where people do not think this is relevant when it is relevant.  If we put it on everyone's agenda, these people could not claim ignorance.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett and I attended a meeting recently with a Member of the Scottish Parliament who outlined some of the methodologies used in Scotland.  It has a block grant because it only has a devolved government and does not have the kind of fiscal independence we still have.  Are there other jurisdictions where there is a more meaningful process?  We have been talking about equality proofing for all of my time in this D&aacute;il going back to the mid-1990s, yet there are so many issues.</p> <p>  Age Action Ireland appeared before the committee a few months ago.  A number of us also raised issues relating to gender inequality, for example, the changes made to the PRSI stamps records in 2012.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have resolutely refused to embark on any restoration.  As Professor Alan Barrett of ESRI said, we changed the rules in the middle of the game.  In particular, older women and the cohort of women from the 1950s and early 1960s were grossly discriminated against.  In respect of the process the witnesses have evolved, are we talking about relentlessly coming forward with the kind of funding that would be necessary to make that restoration to help people might now be losing &euro;30, &euro;40 or &euro;50 per week or more for the rest of their lives and who worked very hard for 25 or 30 years in the economy and who also worked very hard in the home?  A similar example is the exclusion of women who do not have a recent stamps record from community employment and easy pathways back into the workforce.  There are so many examples.  For example, in the disability area, we have been looking for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to be passed, particularly with regard to assessments for children with disabilities where families are waiting for a long time.  As part of the process, would we have definitive mechanisms where, for example, we could say that discrimination with regard to insurance for the older cohort of mostly female workers, although there are some men among it, would be phased out?  Do other jurisdictions have these mechanisms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017071200002#D00800"><p>The Deputy mentioned a meeting with a delegation from Scotland and asked whether there are other countries where best practice might be looked at.  In respect of the event hosted by us and the Department, we drew particularly on Austria, Iceland and Andalusia in Spain as the three examples where it was felt that best practice in proofing was emerging.  It is because they embed their proofing exercises in the budget process in the way we spoke about earlier.  They use slightly different models to do it.  Austria looks at some of the key priorities in each government department and gets each department to nominate five different priorities it wants to proof.  Andalusia takes a whole-of-budget approach.  These are just different ways of doing the same thing.</p> <p>  It would be seen that one of the advantages of these models is that they are quite well institutionally embedded in the budget process.  They are difficult to move once they are in place and they are often buttressed by legislative requirements so that they stay there.  They are independent of whichever government is in power at the time.  They are seen to quite useful from that perspective.  All of them involve a marriage of the types of expertise that are available in the civil service to do budgets and the kind of expertise that is available from consultation with expert groups on the outside around gender, age and disability so that those type of issues - the very discrete issues mentioned by the Deputy - can be spotted early in a policy development stage and ironed out in terms of taking out anomalies that would have disadvantages for certain groups.  Consultation in alignment with different types of expertise in the process is very important.</p> <p>  The human rights principles are quite useful there because they are clear that what is required is progressive realisation so it is not that one must attain all the standards in one go but one must be seen to be making reasonable progress towards them so that what is expected is realistic.  The principle of retrogression also applies.  This argues that if one reaches a certain stage of human rights standards, for example, in respect of pensions, one should not initiate policies that would retrogress those standards.</p><p>In the case Deputy Broughan gave, human rights standards suggest that having inadvertently discriminated against a particular group, in this case women, one should take steps to restore the standard of rights that group had previously.  The human rights principles give a good, effective guidance for Government decisions in those areas, once the impact of the policies is known.</p></speech>

I agree with everything the IHREC representatives said.  I thank them for coming in and for their continuing work and I also welcome the IHREC's statement on family hubs.  They are right in saying that we cannot allow them to become some sort of permanent solution to the housing emergency, particularly following the report that we have the highest proportion of women in homelessness in Europe.  That prompts a question.  Where does scrutinising and proofing the budget proposals from an equality perspective begin and end in the context of wider policy?  I refer to things that might not be in the budget itself but which have equality or inequality implications.  This is one that must be looked at.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that in recent years women and children have suffered disproportionately from policy decisions in the area of housing, social housing and social housing supports.  How does one navigate the line between politics proposals, where something needs to be addressed, and scrutinising what is being proposed by the Government in the budget or at budgetary committees?  Recently, I have worked on another area of discrimination, namely, motor insurance premiums, which hit certain categories of people in particular.  Discrimination is rampant against older and younger people, and other categories of driver.  Could the witnesses comment on that?</p> <p>  We are just getting this budget scrutiny process up and running.  We have had a shorter run-in this year and it will not be finished, with a comprehensive last word completed, for the forthcoming budget.  There are practical constraints for the 2018 budget.  Is it the case that the main task of the IHREC is to ensure that would be an equality statement in the budget and that this issue would be brought to the attention of the line committees?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Laurence Bond" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017071200002#E00300"><p>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s broader question of whether it was just about budget proofing, clearly it is not.  That is what we are discussing specifically in this context, along with actioning the commitments in the programme for Government.  For instance, there is the public sector duty commitment in the legislation which requires all public bodies, including Departments, to take account of equality and human rights and the impact they have, and the need to assess the impact of their policies on service users and others.  We argue that there is a broader requirement for Departments and public bodies more generally to develop policy which takes account of equality and human rights.  One way to bring that about is through budget proofing but that is not to the exclusion of taking other reviews into account.</p> <p>  On the issue of budget proofing, the model laid out in the budget scrutiny report last year was the idea that this oversight committee would have a broad oversight role, especially regarding how the process was being developed by some of the lead Departments, primarily Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Much of the finer scrutiny of how Departments address this issue would have to be through sectoral committees.  As we outlined last year, rather than all responsibility for scrutiny lying on the Oireachtas, the onus should be on the Departments to carry out the proofing and it is then for the Oireachtas to scrutinise that to ensure they deliver.  Departments themselves would have to come to committees and show where they had addressed the requirement to equality proof.  Deputy Calleary made the point that people on the housing committee might not necessarily think of gender but that is something that needs to be addressed and taken into account when we consider policies.  That is what budget proofing in equality and human rights means.  </p> <p>  A key issue underpinning that is the role of the independent parliamentary budget office which has not progressed as quickly as it might have.  We think it should be a key part of the institutional architecture into the future and we want to see it move ahead quickly.  Among the things we want to see is a clear statement in the budget regarding the commitment for budget proofing in the programme for Government, and to ensure that it is meaningful.  We recognise it is a long-term process but we need to see steps taken each year, which would be a sign that progress was being made on this commitment.  If, prior to the budget, this committee and the line committees could take this into account in questioning their Departments, it would be an important part of the architecture.  We feel the independent budget office must be brought about sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

Ms Annette Connolly has been appointed to the position and a press release was issued this morning.  It is a positive development.

Last year, we made a suggestion that was based on the Scottish example where there is a budgetary advisory group.  The idea was to assemble the key actors from the parliamentary and public service sides with oversight bodies such as ourselves, ESRI and NESC.  That would have facilitated keeping the show on the road and major questions such as data, its availability and the role of oversight could happen in a way that there was strategic thinking propelling it.  When the parliamentary budget office is up and running, one thing it could do would be to pull these key actors together, perhaps a couple of times a year, in order that a strategic understanding could evolve, based on their perspectives, on how this might run.</p></speech>

Does the IHREC have an opinion on pay equality and the pay inequality among public service workers and if this falls foul of the standard of equality one would expect in employment?</p><p>It is now illegal to pay people differently for doing the same job based on their sex, yet we have institutionalised inequality in having three different pay scales in the public sector.  It is the legacy of the financial emergency legislation and austerity but if some might claim justification for this at one point, for two people to work side-by-side on different rates now is an equality issue.  That discrimination is not based on sex, although it probably hits women workers worse.  While it is not gender-based discrimination <i>per se</i>, it is an arbitrary form of discrimination based on when a person happened to commence employment.</p><p>However, it is an arbitrary form of discrimination.  Based on when a person happened to commence employment, that person will be on a different payscale for the rest of her life.  With all the talk of pay restoration, there is still no commitment to eliminate that pay discrimination.  Is that covered by equality legislation?</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Camille Loftus, who is a researcher and social policy analyst.  She has been commissioned by the council to carry out an important piece of research on gender budgeting and how to apply it to the Irish budgetary process.  As many members will know, the NWCI is the leading representative women's organisation in this country.  We have just over 180 member organisations.  Our mission is to achieve full equality between women and men.  I thank the committee and the Chairman, in particular, for facilitating our presence this afternoon to give this presentation at what we believe is a critical juncture to progress the work of gender budgeting in this country.</p> <p>  Earlier the committee heard from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  It has provided funding to NWCI to carry out the research that Ms Loftus is working on.  The project involves bringing together key practitioners and experts from Ireland and internationally to set out a roadmap to progress the implementation of the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to gender and equality proof the budgetary process in this country.  The research will develop of model of gender budgeting for Ireland.  We will learn from best practice in other jurisdictions with comparative budgetary and policy decision-making processes.  We will publish the results in September.  Ms Loftus will talk about this matter latter in the presentation.  We will also publish a suite of materials that will outline in straightforward language the why, what and how of gender budgeting and how it can be applied here.   This programme of work will place the NWCI in a unique position in terms of offering guidance, advice and support to key institutions, including this committee, in how best to drive progress on this front.</p> <p>  Before we move on to the what and how of gender budgeting it is worth giving a brief reminder of the why.  Members will be familiar with some of the statistics but it is worthwhile reminding ourselves that it has been well established that the recent period of austerity impacted disproportionately borne on the shoulders of women, in particular certain groups of women such as lone parents and older women.  The gender pay gap has widened from 12.6% in 2006 to 14.4% in 2012 and the gender pension gap has widened from 35% in 2010 to 37% in 2012.</p> <p>   The Department of Social Protection's social impact assessment of the main welfare and direct tax measures in budget 2015 found that the smallest gain was in the bottom quintile.  In the 2011 TASC produced a report entitled Winners and Losers?, which set out equality findings in respect of budget 2012.  It confirmed that women are concentrated in the lower income groups and it found that changes to taxes and social welfare issues that disproportionately impact on low-income groups can also be expected to disproportionately impact on women.  The Central Statistics Office produces research entitled the Survey on Income and Living Conditions.  The SILC figures continue to find that lone parents, the vast majority of whom are women, experience disproportionate levels of deprivation.</p> <p>  The NWCI believes that a more equal society is not an aspirational idea that might eventually be achieved through the overspill of a trickle down economy, rather it is the core foundation upon which a sustainable economy must be built.  In order to achieve equality we must act purposefully.  It requires weighing the benefits and costs of policies that would or could promote women's equality and then, very importantly, taking action in response to that evaluation.  Two types of action are required.  First, the dedication of public expenditure to explicit gender equality objectives and women&rsquo;s advancement.  For example, establishing child care provision as a form of capital and social infrastructure.  Second, expenditure that can be seen as contributing to gender equality more broadly such as gender sensitive pension reform, changes to taxation, some forms of social transfers and  investments in labour market activation initiatives.</p> <p>  Ireland's budgetary process has long been criticised for its opaque and complex nature.  Recent reform aimed at providing for greater parliamentary participation and transparency is welcome.  The emphasis on evidence-based expenditure policies and performance-based budget approaches, adopted by Ireland in 2012, lend themselves to a more rigorous process.  The adoption and implementation of gender and equality budgeting processes aligns neatly with these developments.  Gender budgeting involves two key elements.  First, changes to fiscal policy or the structure of fiscal policies and, second, administrative changes to expenditure tracking and monitoring systems.  Dr. Janet Stotsky is the leading international expert in this area and according to her the most successful efforts encompass both of these elements.</p><p>Gender budgeting does not bind the Government to any particular budget decision, but rather makes it easier for Parliament and its many institutions, including this committee, and indeed for the public to evaluate the budget and its impact.  I will give a quick example of the affordable child care scheme, which in many ways marks a radical change in policy.  If retained and resourced appropriately, this scheme will have long-term positive effects on women's economic equality, both for mothers and for child care professionals, the majority of whom are women.  It is a clear example of a fiscal policy change that should stand up well to gender impact assessment processes.  With the appropriate administrative changes to tracking and monitoring, those assessing and making the budget can establish whether women&rsquo;s effective equality has been improved and decide whether to invest, and in which direction.  Other jurisdictions, like Austria, for instance, have moved to adopt results-based budgeting, focusing on outputs and outcomes and not just on the inputs.  This surely sits comfortably with the reform objectives of Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Equally, the medium-term framework provides a more conducive environment to the results-based gender budgeting model, as a multi-annual approach is required if we are to look at the achievement of equality-oriented goals.</p><p> The unit of assessment is integral to this work.  The traditional notion of the household unit as only having one set of interests is very much outdated.  Gender impact assessments must recognise a diversity of interests, reflecting that women and men respond differently to fiscal policies and other features of the economic environment and that economic policies may have different effects on different members of the same household.</p><p> I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Camille Loftus.  She will give an overview of what she has found through her research to be the appropriate steps this committee could take to progress this work in the coming months.</p></speech>

I will take detailed note of any questions members might have here today and we are more than happy to follow up today's meeting with more detail, should that be useful.</p> <p>  When we look at the statistics from the past few years that Ms Allen has just outlined for us, one thing that becomes very clear is how issues of inequality intersect.  When we look at issues of gender inequality, we are also looking at issues on how to effectively tackle poverty.  Recognising how these issues intersect with one other, the different impact on married and single women as opposed to married and single men, for example, is an important dynamic in putting together a successful approach in this regard.  Ms Allen also mentioned that gender and equality budgeting is a good way to go because it is the right thing to do to ensure that everybody gets to participate to the best extent they can.  What we can now see, however, is that international institutions are very much rolling in behind gender and equality budgeting as a key component of growth strategies.  The IMF and the World Bank, for example, have both rolled in behind this as a way of amplifying countries' growth.  In 2015, the McKinsey Global Institute produced a study in which it was estimated that were one to look at this on a regional basis and ask every country to match the performance of the best in that region, $12 trillion could be added to annual GDP, that is, about the same as the current GDP of Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom combined.  Gender budgeting is not only the right thing to do; it also feeds economic growth.  These are mutually reinforcing rather than mutually exclusive objectives.  </p> <p>  There is no doubt but that fully implementing a comprehensive model of gender and equality budgeting is a complex and difficult thing to do and it will take us a few years to bring it to full expression.  Austria provides us with a useful example in this regard and number of aspects to the Austrian approach are worth highlighting.  One is the fact that Austria introduced gender and equality budgeting within the context of a broader suite of reforms to the budgetary process.  This is exactly our aspiration here.  Reviews of gender budgeting over the past 15 years have identified that integration is an important aspect to success.  Austria moved to a performance-managed system of budgeting, just as we are doing now, and named gender equality as one of its five chapters within that.  It has been given an explicit role and function within the budget process and is one of two constitutionally-mandated principles embedded in core budget legislation in Austria.  One example to emerge from the implementation of a gender budgeting process in Austria was the reduction of the effective tax rate for second earners in a household.  We have known for a long time that second earners are very responsive to financial incentives, that they are the people facing some of the highest financial incentives in Ireland and that they are predominantly women.  A measure like this helps women who want to get back into the labour market to do so.  This, in turn, fuels growth.</p> <p>  Looking at the broader suite of gender budgeting approaches implemented in Europe, a number of things could help this committee make an impact and advance the process.  One approach applied in Austria and in many other countries with successful gender budgeting processes is the use of an equality budget statement as a core element in the overall suite of budget documentation.  Such a statement brings together the equality priorities of each Department into one comprehensive document.  This would be of considerable value to the committee itself in its carrying out of its oversight role.  I understand the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has already written to all of the line Departments to request that they provide such priorities.  This committee might like to engage with the other sectoral committees on a matter like this, focusing on particular policy areas so as to draw out the key gender equality priorities for the forthcoming budget.  Such a statement would also provide a good metric against which we can assess progress or otherwise.  It would be a clear statement of what it is that we are trying to do, an allocation of a range of resources around that and a better metric for assessing success or lack thereof.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, I understand that the Oireachtas budget office has not yet been established and is thus unlikely to have an input into the budget process this year.  </p></speech>

Looking at what has worked elsewhere, however, it is important that institutions like parliamentary budgetary offices take on responsibility for ensuring that equality and gender proofing is put in place in a comprehensive fashion.  This should form part of such an institution's overall costing and impact assessment exercises with regard to any policy measure.  It is important that this new Oireachtas budget office have the capacity to analyse on both the basis of gender and on other grounds of inequality in order that we can capture the intersectional dynamics.</p> <p>  It is surprising that we are still struggling with data this far on in the evolution of gender budgeting.  There are many areas in which data remain an issue.  Speaking as something of a nerd, I am very impressed with the data bank that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has produced.  There is a volume of data available on that database now that was never there before.  It is not, however, presented on a gender-disaggregated basis, which is something we should now be doing as a matter of routine.  The data are all there but they are just not being produced.  This committee's job in providing oversight for the budgetary process and in making an assessment as to whether it has been effectively proofed in respect of gender and equality will be much easier with access to data and much harder without.  This is an important priority.</p> <p>  For quite some time now, we have had at our disposal modelling programmes such as SWITCH that can tell us where the costs and benefits of a particular measure are distributed.  We also now have modelling capacities to look forward to project the kind of impact that a measure might have on growth in the future.</p><p>We can look at the dynamic impacts of a policy rather than just the static, first round effects.  I cited the McKinsey work because that is what they are doing.  They can say that if we did certain things we would add a certain amount to growth.  They are beginning to have this capacity within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the committee could certainly have a role in ensuring this type of analysis is done in order that we will know exactly what kind of impact we could expect to see.</p><p> It is critically important to engage with people who will be affected by the measures.  It is very challenging for a parliamentary committee to manage this but gender and equality budgeting works when there is a facility for people who will be directly affected by the measures to make some feedback into the process.  We will specify this in more detail in our model when the work is completed.  It is important as there is a realm of expertise that is not generally available within the bureaucratic system but which would be of great impact to the committee in assessing the impact of gender inequality budgeting.</p></speech>

People are working and thinking hard about how to do it.  It is so important now because we are only at the beginning of rolling out the process of reform of the budgetary process.  If we can build capacity into the system from the very beginning, we will have done it efficiently and maximised the gains to be got from the reform process.  If decisions are made now which mean the capacity to deliver equality budgeting is not there, it will take a long time to undo this and build the capacity back in.</p></speech>

I have a question about the relationship between the micro and macro in assessing budgets, making recommendations or scrutinising and proofing things.  It is one thing to look at a particular measure and ask if it impacts negatively, positively or not at all on the level of gender equality or some other index, but a more comprehensive proofing might look at the macro consequence of making particular choices.  If there is &euro;350 million of fiscal space and the Government decides, following the intersectionality argument, to give a big chunk of it to tax breaks for women CEOs in multinational companies, as against spending it on employing people in the health service which would be more likely to impact on employment opportunities for women workers, would the National Women's Council see it is part of its equality-proofing role to assess the relative impact of one choice over the other in those terms?</p></speech>

The name of the computer modelling system in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform escapes me but it is exactly the type of thing it can do.  It can assess the immediate first round micro impact for women of reducing the effective tax rate by 2% but it can also project forward and take account of the dynamic effects as the policy filters out and changes patterns of behaviour, etc.  We will then be in a position to say that not only will it contribute to greater gender equality, but it will also increase the size of our fiscal space.  These are mutually reinforcing objectives.  It is very important for this committee to get a really good equality statement because it is very difficult for the committee to have complete gender oversight on all areas, such as transport, communications, social protection, etc.  The committee needs some lens that will allow it to ask the Departments all the right questions.  The equality statement will allow the committee to determine the first round effects, the second round effects and the bigger picture to enable it to make a recommendation.</p></speech>

This is a new exercise for all of us.  Are married women who work in the home being represented in submissions or in people's thoughts?  This is an issue for many people, a silent group which does not really have any spokespeople.  The marriage unit, a husband and wife or two partners, deserve some attention.  In 1981, Dr. Garret FitzGerald decided he wanted to introduce an allowance for a married woman in the home, which amounted to &pound;9.50 per week.  It fell by the wayside but it was an attempt to recognise the role of people in different types of work.  We need to be conscious of everyone - the doctor, the salesperson behind a counter and those minding children in the home.  It is our responsibility as politicians to do that and I recognise that the witnesses also represent certain people.</p><p>However, it is important that we look at this because it is a new exercise.  Previously, one went to the Department of Finance, made one's case, went off and waited for budget day and there was nothing one could do about it.  However, if this new exercise is to become really meaningful and not a waste of the time of the National Women's Council of Ireland and everyone else, there should be some feedback.  What is most important is that we consider where we are after, as well as before, the budget.</p></speech>

In other words, we should ask what our aims are in, say, the area of equality, whether we have moved at all in that direction and whether we have left out some groups.  That is the exercise I would like to see take place, with the involvement of the likes of the delegates and the committee.  The work and role of the committee should be ongoing, not necessarily for just one budget, after which we all sit back and wait another six months before starting to talk about the next budget.  I would like to hear the views of the delegates on this suggestion.  We can put on paper what we would really like to see in a budget, which is grand, but it should be part of a process which should not only involve politicians.  Very few politicians are involved in it because it is the Government, the Cabinet, that ultimately makes the decisions.  If we are genuinely to take views on board, it is important that we have this two-way process before and after the budget.</p></speech>

I can follow up with a little more detail.  Apart from the Scandinavian countries which are the obvious examples, Andalucia is another particularly strong example, but its budgetary process is slightly different from ours and it has taken a slightly different approach.  Our aim in the research project is to pick the best elements from each example and fit them into our own process as closely as we can.</p></speech>

We have built very strong relationships with key people in the Scottish Parliament and civil society organisations in Scotland.  I know Emma Ritch of Engender, an equality organisation, which has been heavily involved in embedding this process into the Scottish budgetary process.  She was here recently to speak to the women's caucus about Engender's work on gender budgeting and will be back again quite soon.  There is, therefore, always the possibility of bringing an expert from Scotland, Austria or Andalucia before the committee.</p></speech>

Nonetheless, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett raises a very important question in that regard because, obviously, women, no more than men, are not a homogenous group.  This speaks to the importance of being able to examine how these issues cross-cut and affect people in different ways.  A fully developed equality analysis would take account of these factors.</p> <p>  The Deputy hit on a very big issue, namely, the provision of unpaid care.  Personally, I do not think any developed country has yet mastered this dynamic, but it is probably one of the most important questions we must answer into the future.  We are all living longer, but we are likely to need support and care for longer periods throughout our lives.  In fact, I was just reviewing research on low-income families and care.  One of the things that comes thorugh very strongly is that it is not a question of either-or.  People are sometimes invested in providing very high levels of full-time care to the exclusion of any other activity.  For some, it may be less: they may be combining care with other part-time work.  There may be a period in which care is not needed, but a parent may then become infirm and one may have to step back into that space.  Therefore, when we think about care, I always caution that it is not about two boxes, that it is not a question of one and the other.  As people move between providing these levels of care all the time, we must be very live to these dynamics.  A good gender analysis should show this and give answers to these questions or at least allow for their consideration in some regard.</p> <p>  The second point I make is that this is the real value of having an equality statement.  Post the budget, members all want to be able to ask what progress was made, what the budget did and what was accomplished in it.  A good review across government should be ensured from an equality perspective to the effect that each Department or sector should be able to state what it sees as a priority.  It struck me that the sectoral committees of the Oireachtas might want to state what they thought the equality priorities should be in the areas of children and youth affairs, health, education and housing.  That would be a good metric because they are the ones involved in dealing with these issues day in, day out.  One of the most challenging aspects of gender budgeting is the need to bring together two sets of expertise.  This goes to the heart of the Chairman's point about why this is important.  We need to find ways to integrate the two sets of expertise early in the process.  There are people with expertise who understand gender and the equality dynamics and there are a bunch of others who engage in budgeting.  These two elements need to be knitted well together.  That is where the equality statement will be of assistance to the committee in integrating the expertise of, say, sectoral committees and line Departments in the specific policy areas with the equality priorities that should come from the process.</p></speech>

Perhaps the delgates might expand on their thoughts in this area.  I have five children and my wife worked in the home.  We are now looking after grandchildren.  It is a new and very important cycle.  People's roles in this regard are totally undervalued and under-appreciated.  Just because someone does not put on his or her coat and go to an office or wherever else to work does not mean that his or her work should not be appreciated.  There is movement and very valuable and responsible work being done by people who are maintaining the image of working in the home.  Of course, if women wish to pursue a career, I do not have a problem with that, but there are others who prefer to work in the home and they are a tremendous asset that could be used far better and encouraged by us as politicians.</p></speech>

It is one thing to make a choice to stay at home rather than engage in a career, but it is another to find oneself paying for that choice again at pension time.  It is a double penalty.  One thing that is being considered is meshing together or integrating the USC and PRSI systems.  That presents an opportunity within the broader social insurance system, in which care work has been seen as an exception that is tagged on rather than as something built that is into it from the very beginning.  It would be an opportunity, particularly for people of the Deputy's wife's generation, for whom full-time work in the home was a much more prominent experience, but these women do pay for it at pension time.</p></speech>

I am slightly concerned that we all talk here about what the IMF, McKinsey and economic interests want and that we measure everything based on economic growth, as if that was the key measure of progress.  There are other measures such as the nature of and other values in society.  I have a terrible fear that everything we have done in recent years has perhaps accentuated the economic growth model rather than looking at other assessments.  In addition, looking at the statistics, it does not seem that they necessarily match what people do.  It is not a tiny minority who sometimes decide to work in the home but the very large bulk of Irish women and their connected parties.</p><p>We are all connected and a large bulk of Irish women and their partners seem to have been ignored and discriminated against in recent years.  I would love to have heard the National Women's Council of Ireland representing their interests when, for example, in last year's budget they were pretty much ignored and given absolutely nothing, as if they did not count.  It is on the back of previous years, where through individualisation and other measures, we have effectively stated to people, "Thou shalt get out to work, no matter what".</p><p> I have a fear that the witnesses cite Austria as an example.  I had an interesting experience recently related to where this is coming from.  Why is it that the European Union, the OECD, the International Monetary Fund and McKinsey and Company are espousing work all the time?  It comes from central European countries where populations were declining and they were worried about migration.  They had all sorts of different pressures and were worried their economy might sink as they got to full employment.  Their answer was to get everyone working.  It was official EU and OECD policy based on what was happening in Sweden, Germany and Austria because they had a falling population.  All economic, labour and other market policies, coupled with a lack of support for caring, came from that driver.  I must admit I am slightly disappointed or nervous to hear the women's council citing McKinsey, the &euro;12 trillion value of economic growth and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, as the great signal of what we might want to do.</p><p> We must look after every woman in every circumstance and I am absolutely 100% in favour of equality in budgeting and ensuring we live in a truly equal society.  We are leaving behind that massive cadre and restricting choice.  We are having children older and later because everything is constrained by a person getting a job because the rent must be paid, or a house should be bought or the career must be maintained.  It is all about economic growth.  US Senator Elizabeth Warren brilliantly wrote about the two income trap, with people ending up in a really precarious position where they cannot afford not to work or get on the economic wheel.  I am afraid that is what I heard today.</p></speech>

With regard to the approach of the National Women's Council of Ireland to these issues, I know the Deputy probably referred to the introduction of the affordable child care scheme last year and the disappointment in us being so welcoming of that piece while people working in the home did not get the same recognition.  I can understand that.  The National Women's Council of Ireland represents women in all their diversity and it always has.  It has a very long track record of advocating for women in unpaid caring roles.  We continue to do that.  We welcomed the affordable child care scheme last year as it is another piece of the jigsaw for which we have been advocating for a very long time.  We have done it for a number of decades and it was very encouraging to see progress being made on that front.  We absolutely recognise the value of women working in the home and in caring roles.  I just wanted to state for the record that it is an incredibly important piece of work for the National Women's Council of Ireland and we will continue to do it in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.96" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Camille Loftus" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017071200002#L00400"><p>One of the reasons I raised the matter of the contribution that greater gender equality can make to growth is because it increases the fiscal space and the kind of investments we can choose how to spend.  Do we want to invest more in education or health?  It gives us more room for that.  Coming from a perspective that is the opposite of the Deputy's, sometimes we get from the business side of the House that this does not have anything to do with important issues.  I just wanted to make the point that these are not mutually exclusive or contradictory to one another and they can be mutually reinforcing.</p> <p>  There are two big challenges that we face in social policy in all developed countries.  Labour markets are changing very rapidly and they do not provide the kind of security or jobs they used to and on which most welfare states and tax systems are based.  The kind of job my dad did - he was the male breadwinner in our household - was a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. secure job that he worked at from when he left school until he retired.  That does not exist any more, and I have had to explain that to the man on numerous occasions when he wonders why I do not have one of them.  That is changing but we have systems designed around a labour market that does not exist any more.</p> <p>  The other dynamic that is changing is care.  It is done by everybody in society and one of the very welcome developments we can see now is that when we look at the gender balance among those providing unpaid care for older people, it is less gender marked than would certainly have been the case in the past.  It is less gender marked than is evident in the care of children.  Everybody knows somebody in this position; they know a man providing care for an elderly mother, father or whatever.  Care is an integral part of every social policy decision we need to make; it does not need to be done by women.  What we really need to consider is how to integrate those elements into all our lives in a way that we are happy about.</p></speech>

As I stated, the individualised tax system very much discriminates against it.  There are no two ways about that and in recent budgets we have not done anything about it.  What would the council suggest for the 2018 budget that might support that choice for the people who are caring?</p></speech>

If two people are working but earning a low wage, tax individualisation does not have an impact.  There was a relationship between the home carer's credit and what used to be called the PAYE credit.  It is one of the dynamics that tends to take account of these matters.  It is a credit and not affected by when the band kicks in so it gives a little extra help to lower income households than higher income households.  It is certainly an element I would look to in order to manage out that sort of fiscal balance.</p> <p>  We must also remember that the child benefit is the highest in the EU, or certainly in terms of cash transfers.  It is called child benefit but part of its evolution has been around the recognition of the work of rearing children in the home.  It is not means-tested.</p></speech>

The first petition for consideration is No. P000024/16 from Mr. Thomas Mackey.  The petitioner is of the view that the criteria for qualification for a primary medical certification is outdated and does not provide a criteria for upper limb amputees to qualify for the service.  It is proposed that we write to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform expressing our concerns as to the rigid eligibility criteria of the scheme and highlighting to him the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman on this issue and the recommendation of the 2002 report.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition is No. P00001/17 from Ois&iacute;n Turakhia relating to the responsible service of alcohol.  It is proposed that we correspond with the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next petition is No. P00002/17 from Mr. Thomas Geraghty on behalf of the Public Service Executive Union, entitled civil rights for civil servants.  It is proposed to correspond once again with the Minister acknowledging his detailed response, outlining that the committee welcomes his intentions to introduce a public sector standards commissioner under the proposed public sector standards Bill, requesting that he keeps the committee informed on progress on this matter and outlining that the petition will remain open with the committee, which intends to working closely with a public sector standards commissioner on addressing any gaps in the current circular and codes on this matter, and to forward a copy of the response from the Minister to the petitioner and advise of the above steps being taken.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition is No. P00007/17 on the eradication of homework for children in primary school.  The petitioner seeks to amend the policy of the Department of Education and Skills and eradicate homework for children in primary school.  The petitioner is of the opinion that there is little educational benefit to homework and that homework can be a cause of stress and frustration for children.  Having discussed this, it is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Education and Skills to the petitioner, seek her views on the response from the Department of Education and Skills, leave the petition open and see what the response is.</p><p>Is that agreed?

Education does not simply exist within the constraints of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. but continues after that.  At a time when young children are exposed more than ever to iPads, iPhones and all of the social media, the one thing we should be doing is reading to children at night.  I say that as a parent and it is what I try to do when I am home from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Fostering a love of language, whether through Irish or English, and developing children's communication skills are things all parents in Ireland could do.  What is on a curriculum should not restrain parents from doing that and fostering the love of reading and writing.  It costs nothing.  At a time when iPhones and iPads are, in a significant way, reversing young children's abilities, we should be fostering reading and writing.  I encourage that in the context of the debate.</p></speech>

They spend long hours in school and there needs to be good value from the homework they undertake.  It is important to have balance in children's lives.  While they must, of course, learn, they must also play because they are children.</p></speech>

I do not agree with the word "eradicate" in the context of homework.  We have to take into account what Senator Kelleher and Deputy Cassells said which is that this is really changing the goalposts.  The error I see is that children spend six or seven hours in a classroom doing a great deal of what is in essence homework.  They sit at a desk writing and reading.  They come home, have a break, eat dinner and are then back into it for up to two hours.  The amount of homework given by teachers in primary schools in particular is over the top.  I referred to changing the goalposts and Deputy Cassells mentioned getting children away from mobile phones and computers.  Perhaps they could do something about the environment and controlling litter.  It could be on the seasons and focus on different things.  That should be part of their homework.  Some very good comments were made by my colleagues.</p></speech>

We are all agreeable to that, so I will move on.  The next item is petition No. P000010/17 from Ms Pauline Bleach on public consultation in the planning process.  There are two aspects to the petition which seeks to make public consultation a legal requirement and to account for 20% of outcomes in planning decisions and to create an independent arbiter of facts and process with power to order revisions or reruns using correct processes and facts.  It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to the petitioner and to close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The last petition for consideration is petition No. P00023/17 from Ms Judith Dunphy and Mr. Shane Clarke seeking the opening of an autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, unit in all primary and secondary schools.  The petition outlines that parents often have to bring their children to other counties, towns or locations which are miles away from their homes to access schools with ASD classes.  We propose to correspond once again with the Department asking it to outline the criteria required for a school to quality for an ASD class, the steps it takes to ensure there are ASD places for eligible primary schools and statistics on the geographical locations of all new ASD units in the past five years.  We propose to correspond with Autism Ireland and other autism advocacy groups to ascertain their views as to whether there is a need for ASD classes in all mainstream schools and if they have evidence of same.  We will forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioners, advise them of the further steps being taken by the committee and outline that the petition will remain open.</p></speech>

Children with autism are, in essence, being denied their right to a good education.  There is a particular issue in the transition between primary and secondary school and it would be useful to get good information on that.  I refer, for example, to the Cork autism education gap where the difference between the number of places at primary school level and secondary school is 234.  The National Council for Special Education has been seeking additional powers to prevent schools having an effective veto to rule out an autism class without due regard to the demand in a particular geographic area.  It would be helpful to get information on that.</p></speech>

We should also take account of the fact that educational facilities in the locations have changed over the last decade because of changing demographics and settlement patterns, which is only going to continue over the next ten to 20 years.  That has impacts on special education provision and the demand for autism units.  This definitely requires further examination.</p></speech>

I come to this as someone with a little grand-niece and a nephew-in-law with autism.  While I pay tribute to the system for the good work it does, parents are unbelievable in these situations.  Great work is going on at primary school level.  It has come on in leaps and bounds but the Senator is right that there is a gap in what is available at secondary level.  We must be aware of rural parts of the country where people may lose out because they are a long way from a school with autism provision.  This definitely deserves further discussion which I support.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and her officials to the meeting, the purpose of which is to discuss the affordable child care scheme.  I thank them for coming.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones and ensure they are no where near the microphones when they are switched on as this disrupts the broadcasting of the committee's proceedings.</p><p>If the Minister would be so kind as to bear with me, in advance of inviting her to make her contribution, I want to make some opening remarks, having been recently selected and appointed by the D&aacute;il to chair this committee.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to chair such a significant committee in terms of the work programme and the operation of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I am aware of the very significant contribution the Department and this committee makes in Irish life on the basis that primarily I hail from Fingal, which has the youngest population in the State, and, therefore, I fully understand the pressure that child care costs cause for families and the needs of child care providers in terms of resources and support.  Child welfare, fostering and adoption are some of the most important matters facing our country.  There can be no more important matter than to ensure adequate protections are in place to protect every child and young person.</p><p>The issues debated by this committee are above party politics.  The former Chairman, now Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, was very quick to point out that this has been the manner in which this committee has operated during the past 12 months.  As Chairman, I very much hope to continue in that vein.  I am committed to prioritising the needs of our children and our young people, and their welfare.  I know members are as committed and as passionate about these matters as I.</p><p>The committee is particularly centred on workings of the Oireachtas, our democracy and our State given that fact that it is wholly focused on the protection and welfare of our future generations, ensuring that they are in a position to make the most of every opportunity which life affords them.  I am of the view that by working together we can make a real impact upon the lives of children and young people right across this State.  I am grateful to have the opportunity to chair this committee and to work with all members on matters which come before us.  I embrace the challenge of chairing this committee in the best interests of every person with and for whom we work and for the betterment of our society in general.  I thank the members for bearing with me.</p><p>I wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements from the Minister and the witnesses will be published in the committee's website after this hearing.  I understand that the Minister may wish to make a short presentation.  Her opening statement has been circulated in advance.  Prior to asking the Minister to speak, a matter arose during our private session initiated by Senator Joan Freeman.  Unfortunately, the Senator was not able to stay with us due to other commitments but she recommended, in the context of section 13, that Dr. Geoffrey Shannon conduct the investigation into the relevant matters.  That is her recommendation, as agreed by the committee.  Her request is that the Minister would consider that matter in her deliberations on section 13.  I ask the Minister to commence her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017071200002#G00300"><p>I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment.  I look forward to working with him again following our previous work together on the justice committee.  I welcome his opening remarks, particularly his emphasis on that what we do being is above party politics.  That has been my experience when I have appeared before the committee.  I hope some of the demonstration of that will be seen in my opening remarks in responding to the various issues that he raised concerning the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and our efforts to consider those very seriously, as well as coming back to make some decisions in that regard ultimately.  I thank the Chairman and it is great to be working with him.</p><p>I want to be clear in opening my remarks that despite what the members may have read in some media publications this morning, up to 70,000 children will get extra child care benefits this September, as announced in budget 2017.  There is no delay, no jeopardy or need for parents to be shocked.  People should go to the website, <i>affordablechildcare.ie</i>, to find out details of the big changes that will start in eight weeks time.</p><p>I am very pleased to be here again.  In particular, as I indicated, I would like to update members on some of the issues that were raised at the committee in terms of pre-legislative scrutiny.  They are aware that on 11 April I announced a range of measures that will make child care more affordable for families from September.  Members will be aware that these measures include: universal subsidies of up to &euro;1,040 per annum per child, which will be available for all children aged between six and 36 months; and targeted subsidies of up to &euro;7,500 per annum per child, which will be delivered to those families and children who need it most.  It is these targeted subsidies that will open up jobs, training and education for parents who want to lift their families out of poverty.  As a result of these measures, up to 70,000 children will benefit from extra child care support this September &ndash; this will be an important moment.  By addressing the affordability issue, we will ease the burden on many parents for whom child care costs have become a second rent or mortgage.  It is the first big step to changing Irish child care for ever and it is just eight weeks away.</p><p>To ensure uptake by families and child care providers, a public information campaign has been under way since mid-May.  Information packs were sent to all 4,400 registered child care providers.  Information events that were attended by more than 1,000 child care providers were held at eight locations throughout the country.  A dedicated website was launched receiving over 170,000 page views to date.  A digital campaign on social media and on websites popular with parents - many of the members will know what those are - has been shared tens of thousands of times.  Also, a national and local radio advertising campaign took place in June.</p><p>I also secured a budget of &euro;3.5 million to support child care providers who sign up to the scheme and, in particular, to recognise their non-contact time responsibilities.  The value of this payment will be equivalent to seven days of the total value of registrations under community child care subvention, CCS, and training and employment child care, TEC, schemes.  This is in addition to the &euro;14.5 million non-contact payment secured in budget 2017.  I have been listening to the child care providers and, in terms of their concerns, I wish to advise that contracting with child care providers is now under way and that registration of children for these subsidies will go live from 21 August.</p><p>I want to update the committee on the affordable child care scheme to update the committee.  Significant progress continues to be made on its development.  A project board, chaired by my Department, meets every three weeks to oversee this development..  As already stated, issues raised by the committee during pre-legislative scrutiny are receiving further consideration.  For example, we are re-examining how the affordable child care scheme budget cap can be implemented and, following legal advice, we are in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.</p><p>We are also engaging with Tusla to reach agreement on the threshold that will be applied to Tusla referrals to the affordable child care scheme.</p><p> We have given much consideration to the range of issues raised by the committee on the income assessment model, such as the treatment of family income supplement, FIS, rental income and housing costs.  We have also sought the views of officials with significant experience of means-testing from Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection and the Health Services Executive who have reviewed the income assessment model. </p><p> I can assure the committee that I will continue to give these matters careful consideration and I will revert to the committee with our conclusions.  At the request of my Department, the Department of Social Protection is carrying out analysis of potential disincentive effects created by the interaction of the affordable child care scheme and the family income supplement, and will make recommendations to my Department shortly on whether FIS should be made deductible from the child care scheme&rsquo;s income assessment.  We will await the advice of the Department of Social Protection before making any decision on the issue.</p><p> Just as with centre-based care, quality assurance of child minders must be an absolute prerequisite for participation in the scheme.  The committee will be aware that my Department has commenced talks with Childminding Ireland in recent months to explore a number of options around how quality can be assured within the child minding sector.  If sufficient alternative standards are not in place, it will remain the case that only Tusla-registered child minders will be able to participate in the affordable child care scheme.  It is anticipated that a draft Bill will be brought to Government by the end of the third quarter, with a view to enactment in the autumn.</p><p> The architectural design for the ICT platform to support the affordable child care scheme has been completed.  A request to commence development of this infrastructure to support the child care scheme was recently approved by the office of the Government chief information office, OGCIO.  This represents a first milestone in the technical development of the ICT system.  The development of this infrastructure will commence in early August. </p><p> The main development of the affordable child care scheme project is subject to the OGCIO peer review process.  The peer review group, which was established in early May 2017, is currently reviewing the business case for the scheme.  The next stage of this process is the presentation of the request for tender, RFT, for the procurement of the ICT development.  To inform the request for tender, the business requirements for the scheme have already been agreed as has the procurement approach. </p><p> Work is now underway to finalise the functional requirements specification.  It is anticipated to the request for tender will be presented to the peer review group by end of the third quarter.  These are the steps being undertaken for the tender for the information technology platform itself.  </p><p> Other preparatory work underway includes the development of a communications strategy; the development of a governance and compliance framework; the development of standard operating procedures; and the development of a data protection strategy.  A recently completed privacy impact assessment on the scheme will be a key input to this strategy.  My officials have also held a constructive meeting with the deputy data protection commissioner to advance this work.</p><p> Data sharing arrangements with the office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection have also been finalised and plans for data hosting are being agreed with the Department of Social Protection.  We are already considering the launch.  Major consideration is also being given for the phase when the scheme is developed and tested and ready for launch.  It is important to note that the operational launch of the scheme will require a time period for applications to be submitted, and processed, before opening up to registrations with child care providers and parents receiving their subsidies.  This is due to the fact that the launch is expected to bring in over 100,000 applications, some of which may be ineligible for an affordable child care scheme subsidy, that require to be processed equitably before parents can begin to register their children with child care providers.  While it is hoped a large proportion of applications will go through the automated system, some will require some level of case management due to family circumstances, and quality assurance.  Planning for the launch is underway and initial indications suggest that a period of 12 to 16 weeks will be required for the application period before registrations can begin, and subsidies provided.  Once the initial launch period is completed, applications will be processed on a rolling basis.</p><p> With these factors in mind, the project board has advised me that it is not in a position, at this point, to guarantee a timeline for delivery of the affordable child care scheme.  The request for tender stage of the peer review process represents, to some extent, the  biggest milestone with the ICT development, and as such drives the beginning of the timeline for the full project delivery.  The project board will continue to meet every three weeks to progress the affordable child care scheme development as efficiently and effectively as possible.  I will be very happy to answer questions.  I am happy to be joined by my Department officials who will join me in outlining more of the detail about the preparation for the launch of the affordable child care scheme.  The committee will understand the complexities and the detail and how, although significant time is required to get this right, as a Minister, I am committed to two things, first, that it is better to get it right and second, that I will do everything in my power to drive the process as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I look forward to working with him.  I welcome the Minister and her officials, and thank her for her presentation.  These are the first steps in moving towards a new child care programme.  We are looking at &euro;466 million in spending in the child care which is represents an increase of approximately 80% on the 2015 spending.  That is some achievement in only 24 months.  There is more to be done but I want to recognise that.  We are looking at a significant implementation project.  We are looking at universal benefit for children under three years, and also a second support based on income.</p> <p>  On ICT and procurement and tendering, in a previous life I worked in IT.  The Minister said that the gap analysis has been done and she is working on the functional requirements with a view to tendering in the third quarter of this year.  When it comes to tendering in the third quarter, the Department will have made significant progress on the functional analysis.  Can the Minister estimate how long the implementation phase will take?  How long will the tendering process take?  I assume that the portal will be a web portal that will be open for the public to make their applications on the IT system.</p> <p>  There is one thing I ask the Department to consider when it is undertaking its functional analysis.  There is a problem I have seen many times in the public service.  The language used in the applications process on the website and the calls for action must be as simplified as possible.  Even a younger person whose linguistic skills are not fully developed should be able to understand it.  It needs to be made as simple as possible for the public to understand it.  Please be careful.  We often use quite legalistic language in the Oireachtas and are used to it but the public is not.  It is a failure in both the private and public sectors that the standard of language on web portals can be pitched too high for the consumers.  The process and the calls to action should be simplified as much as is possible.</p><p>Sometimes genuine people apply for programmes and drop out halfway through if they find the application process too strenuous.  It is a matter of being mindful of this.  I seek an answer as to how long the implementation and tendering phases will take.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Deputy's positive comments.  It is a huge step forward and, therefore, again, it is important to get it right and be as careful as we can.  In this regard, the committee will be aware that we are in a peer review process with the OGCIO.  The Deputy asked questions about the simplification of language.  It is important we take this on board and it will be fed into the process.  As we move through the peer review process, each of these issues, particularly those the Deputy raises, will be considered carefully.  I will turn to my officials to answer the question about the implementation phase, as well as the question as to how long the tendering will take.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marion Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017071200002#J00700"><p>It is estimated the tendering process will take eight to ten weeks.  As we will work through a mini-competition under an ICT framework, it will be a shortened tendering process from that perspective.  Once we get the go-ahead from the OGCIO, the tendering process will carry through.</p> <p>  Regarding the development timeframe, from our analysis of all the requirements, it is estimated the development will probably take approximately five months.  This is dependent on the vendors that tender for the development and the number of developers they can provide for the project.  There will be parallel development going on and then an integration process within that.  We anticipate that we would probably need six to eight weeks of testing and bug-fixing once the full integration has happened.  Then, as the Minister has already mentioned, approximately 12 to 16 weeks are envisaged for the launch implementation in which applications are made.</p> <p>  Regarding the public online portal, we are working with a consultation group with stakeholders on business and systems and are working through the requirements and the system functionalities with that stakeholder group to get its views and its processes from parents through to service providers who will use each part of the system.  We are taking that into account.  In addition, as part of the final technical designs, a user experience expert will make the public-facing element as easy and applicable as possible.</p></speech>

Ms Martin mentioned the number of developers and vendors.  Obviously, the functional requirements will come from the functional documents anyway, so we will understand how many developers are required for the system once those functional documents are completed.</p></speech>

While we have an estimation at present, our initial analysis is the optimum number of developers to use on this is probably about eight.  One could use more, but there are more risks associated with that.  Then it is a matter of whether the tenderers themselves would be able to provide that optimum number.</p></speech>

Ms Martin spoke about a stakeholder group in the context of the online portal.  I advise getting people from the ground, the normal person, to use the system and see what it is like and they will flag where it will fall down.  This is what is done in the private sector.

I wish to ask a question about the ICT system and then go back to this year's system, following on from Deputy Neville's questions.  I am a little concerned about the timescale that has just been delineated.  It sounds to me that it is approximately 12 months if one adds the eight to ten weeks for the tendering, the five months of development, the six to eight weeks for testing and the 12 to 14 weeks for the launch.  Will it be ready for September 2018?  That is my main question and the most pertinent one because there is certainly an expectation that it will be rolled out by then.  Originally, the intention was to roll it out this year.</p> <p>  My second question concerns this year's plans.  The Minister has said that up to 70,000 children will get support and that there is online information, an information campaign etc.  That is all very welcome but there is still confusion.  The providers are concerned that there is a short timeframe, that they must do much of this themselves manually and that parents are asking questions to which they do not necessarily know the answers.  Will the Minister therefore monitor constantly the actual availability for children who qualify around the country?  Some providers would say to us that they might not partake in the scheme at all because it is too cumbersome or will take too much time.  My second question therefore concerns monitoring the current system.  When will we know if family income supplement, FIS, is deductible?  That is a consideration as to whether people will qualify and it seems to me that FIS should be deductible because it is a support system for low-income families and there is no point in giving it to them on the one hand and taking it away from them on the other.</p></speech>

I am trying to outline the various numerous steps, much of which are technical and are in the context of the peer review process.  We have no control over the steps we must go through.  To be a part of this process is to ensure that mistakes of the past such as PPARS are not repeated.  As members may be aware, a peer review is an independent structured review of a programme or project which is carried out at key decision points in the project.  It must approve each phase of the development before it will grant approval to move on.  There are seven stages to this.  I have also indicated that we must do quite a bit of robust testing and piloting of the systems because we are expecting more than 100,000 applications.  I do not have any intention of repeating PPARS.  Having said all that, it is not possible to say now exactly when it will be delivered.  We are delineating the pieces of the process to ensure its delivery as soon as possible.  What I can say, though, is that I am absolutely committed to driving this as quickly as I can.  As the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer comes under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I will be in conversation with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about ensuring to the best of our ability that this can go ahead as quickly as possible while making sure everything is done right.  It will be later that we will have a deeper sense of when we can say it will be delivered.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy O'Sullivan's second set of questions about what we are doing this September, I will deliver in September.  We have put in place a number of pieces to ensure that a very high percentage of families we intended to benefit in September 2017 will benefit.  I emphasise that it is very important that, as members go back to their constituencies, the message that goes out is that the support for families is available and we have estimated, as I have indicated, that up to 70,000 children will benefit.  However, this is an estimate, and some families may not be captured in what we had originally intended.</p><p>That may be the case but we are not absolutely sure.</p><p> In response to the Deputy's questions on the providers and the families being concerned I am aware of that and it is very important to emphasise it.  The officials are also aware of it and we will increase our communication capacity over the next couple of weeks and into August when they begin to sign up.  I have indicated we have been around the country engaging with the providers.  They come back to us with questions.  We have established a very strong infrastructure within the systems and the officials are working to answer those questions in many different ways.  The Deputy's question on monitoring is a good one.  I understand that there are systems in place for monitoring to see how it is as we move closer to September.  If the officials want to add more technical details I am happy that they do so. </p></speech>

Providers will be very familiar with registering children under the ECCE scheme and will follow a similar process for the universal subsidy.  For other children we have not made changes to the schemes <i>per se</i>but have increased the subvention rates.  Many of the providers are very familiar with the way the schemes operate.</p></speech>

If that is the case, will the one that is being rolled out this September continue?  This is the first time I have been made aware it will take so long before it will be implemented.  It is also important for people to know what the contingency plans are if it is not ready for 2019.</p></speech>

I am not saying now because I do not know for sure.  We are, however, being as clear as we can be about what is involved.  When we know for sure I will tell the committee.  The Deputy is right we have to be honest and upfront.</p> <p>  The measures we are putting in place for this September, which we are communicating to providers and which we will continue to support, will be in place until we move to the new system.  We are taking the first major step towards that full affordable child care scheme and there will be difficulties we will have to sort out with providers or families.  We are talking about the ICT system to make it easier for families to understand their subsidies and for providers to administer the new system, which is not available yet.  However, what will be available in September, and will continue to be available until that ICT system is fully fleshed out, is a way and set of systems for families to benefit from what we promised.  I anticipate that whatever the difficulties, they will have been sorted and we will not have to go through that again. </p> <p>  Some families who we intended should benefit may not benefit with this full system because when we do have the ICT system there is a way to determine the income, deductions, subsidies that is clear to the families meets the thresholds we had identified.  We have put out possibly up to 9,000 children not all aged less than three.  Everybody can benefit from the universal subsidy.  That does not depend on the ICT system.  The estimated difference is partly accounted for by children aged three and older whose family incomes are above the threshold for a general practitioner, GP, visit card but below the threshold for the affordable child care scheme.  It is also partly accounted for by children aged three or older whose parents may be eligible for a GP visit card or meet other eligibility criteria but who have not taken it up.  The information campaign has begun.  There may be some families who are eligible for a GP visit card who could take it up and become more available for what we are putting out in September. </p></speech>

It came, however, from a very low level of investment in child care, still one of the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD.  While it is welcome that we are taking steps in the right direction we have a long road to travel.  The Minister asked recently for our support in the D&aacute;il to expand that in the budget.  She certainly has my support and that of my party in that investment.  I hope she has the support of her colleagues in Government and of Fine Gael when it comes to the budget.</p> <p>  How confident are the Minister and Department that in September there will not be substantial numbers of children and families, particularly in urban areas, who will not be able to locate a place and that certain child care providers will not find themselves swamped?  I am slightly concerned that the contracting for registrations goes live from 21 August.  That seems a very tight timescale for providers to deal with the documentation involved in contracting for September.  We all hope that everything goes according to plan and that providers are able to provide as intended but the concern is that there might be chaos in September, when children and families look for this new subsidy and their needs may not be met.  I share the concern of other Deputies that the Minister is not in a position to guarantee the time line for the full delivery of the affordable child care scheme for the following September as envisioned in the last budget.  It is vitally important that it is possible to deliver the full scheme in September.  I note that the Minister has taken account of our last discussion here in respect of family income supplement and rent supplement.</p><p>Let me re-emphasise that a great deal of discussion in support of the affordable child care scheme is related to its ability to assist with labour activation.  If that is to be the case, FIS in particular and also rent supplement should be deductible and non-reckonable.  It would go against the grain of what it is intended to achieve if it was to be reckonable.</p><p> I have made a point on sustainability previously but I might make it from a slightly different perspective in respect of the ongoing need for capital investment to ensure that capacity continues to exist.  I have raised my serious concerns about sustainability in the community sector.  The only way that these providers can make their offering "more sustainable" is either through reducing services or increasing fees for other schemes.  These services are primarily provided in disadvantaged area.  I have raised issues about the delay in the provision from the sustainability fund.  The fund needs to be substantially enhanced.  A scheme similar to DEIS has been explored, and it should be explored further.  In the interim, sustainability needs to be built into the service.  In my view, the Department needs to be outlining its vision for the journey to a publicly provided system.  I do not think we should be repeating the mistakes of the past in terms of primary and secondary education.  The State needs to be a substantial player in the offering for child care.  We need to begin to outline how we get to that destination.  Community providers will be a big part of the offering.  In the short term, we need to make the service sustainable but in the longer run I believe we need to expand them.  The Department need to look at this.</p></speech>

Of the 41% of child care services that have completed the recontracting process, two in every three of the child care services that have signed up so far have opted to deliver the subsidies to make the child care more affordable for families in September.  The contracting process has already started with the child care providers.  As I understand it, it is on target and it is at the same place that it is normally is in terms of contracting.  Registration for children starts in August.  </p> <p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, we are monitoring and paying attention to ensuring that we will have the capacity in September and one of my officials will deal with the provision of the scheme in rural areas.  One of the key ways to ensure consistently that we will have capacity is through the information campaign that we have already initiated.  I have indicated that we will move towards a more intense level information campaign relatively soon so that people understand and have the information.  For example, one aspect of the scheme is the extra moneys for non-contact time for providers who are willing to sign up to the new measures in September.</p> <p>  I take on board Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point on family income supplement, FIS.  We are continuing to explore that and I am happy to consider the Deputy's additional concerns about it.  </p> <p>  On the Deputy's final point on sustainability, we have these exchanges regularly on sustainability and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire understands my commitment to it.  I am continuing to ask the Department to examine any additional measures to support sustainability in terms of where we are now.  I understand the Deputy has identified the need to outline a vision for a publicly provided service and system.  Effectively, as the Deputy will be aware, one of the major breakthroughs in the past number of years, which happened before I took office, was the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, the free preschool places.  This effectively is a vision of the provision of a service by different providers, private as well as not for profit, paid from the public purse.  It took public investment to do that.  As we move forward, in terms of targeted subsidies and also universal provision, there is public investment in order to develop the infrastructure of child care.  That is what I continue to be committed to and in the different ways we deliver it.</p> <p>My official Ms Brooks will address the capacity issue.</p></speech>

Some 33,000 children who will receive the universal subsidies are currently availing of child care, as are 30,000 children who are currently in receipt of the targeted programmes.  We estimate an additional 7,000 children will avail of targeted supports, some of whom are already availing of child care.  We do not expect there to be a capacity issue.</p> <p>  We are aware also from Pobal annual early years sector profile questionnaire that there are a number of vacancies across services.  We will monitor uptake and demand for spaces but at present we do not envisage there will be any difficulty with that.</p></speech>

I accept the State is funding the service, but direct public provision would allow us to deal with issues of wages and strategic planning for new child care providers in areas where they are required.  It can help us in terms of quality, and it is a much better model. We should be moving strongly towards it.  Public funding is welcome and an improvement on the situation that went before but I think we need towards public provision.</p></speech>

It is important to start with the positives and to welcome what happened in last year's budget.  It was a welcome announcement and it was step in the right direction.  The recent announcement of &euro;3.5 million support for the child care providers was another welcome provision.</p> <p>  I will not rehash the questions that have been asked because I am blue in the face asking questions about the ICT platform for the ACS.  My only question in respect of ICT is whether the Minister has secured enough funding from the Department, because what we are about to set into seems to be a mammoth task.  Does the Minister have the budget to see it through all the way?</p> <p>  In her opening statement, the Minister stated that the Department is re-examining how the ACS budget cap can be implemented and is in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and that this follows legal advice on the issue.  Could she explain exactly what that statement means?  </p> <p>  In relation to other preparatory paperwork or work that needs to be done on the scheme, is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs also looking at the legislation for the sharing of information between Departments?  I understand legislation will be needed to share information with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  Do we need to amend the legislation to include that area?</p> <p>  The Minister said the affordable child care scheme is aimed primarily at parents and guardians in a way to lift families out of poverty.  Does the Minister think the affordable child care scheme goes far enough to ease the financial burden of middle income families or is there a progression in the next budget as one of the Deputies already mentioned?</p> <p>  As an aside to the departmental officials, we talked about FIS earlier.  Let us look at SUSI.  The wheels for the affordable child care scheme have already been developed in the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI model, as FIS is excluded in the measure of income under that scheme.</p><p>We talked earlier about family income supplement.  The wheels for the affordable child care scheme have already been developed in the SUSI model which excludes family income supplement.  SUSI is working well for the cohort of people who engage with it in the terms of reference as to who is in, who is out, what qualifies and what does not.  A great deal of the groundwork and heavy lifting has already been done with the implementation of SUSI.  Could we short circuit some of the questions and issues by looking at the existing SUSI model?</p></speech>

I presume that is right.  If more detail is required, my officials can provide it.  It is costly but that is built in.  We sought legal advice on the permissibility of the budget cap as proposed in the heads of the Bill.  We received advice that a budget cap which involved closing the scheme to applicants for a period of time would be open to legal challenge.  We are looking at that and examining its meaning as we move forward.  I was asked about the sharing of information with different Departments.  My understanding is that it would be incorporated within the Bill.</p></speech>

I was asked about the significant investment set out in my opening remarks to support families to lift their children out of poverty.  That relates specifically to the targeted measures, although in terms of the thresholds for those measures, it depends ultimately on how one defines a middle income.  I know there are variations in how we define that.  Even now, however, my view about the thresholds is that they should reach some of those middle income earners in terms of the ways income is calculated.  Obviously, the universal measures are there for everyone, including the middle tier and those lower income earners.</p></speech>

We are taking on a lot of the learnings from SUSI.  In relation to the income assessment, the Deputy was referring moreso to means assessments.  We have worked through the means assessment model for the affordable child care scheme and engaged in a peer-review process with SUSI, the Department of Social Protection and the HSE's medical card unit to get their experiences and learnings on the assessment models they use and the difficulties they encounter in making the process as efficient as possible.</p></speech>

I start by agreeing with Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and Rabbitte.  In fairness, the Minister has done a great deal of work in the area and she is very genuine and sincere about what she wants to achieve.  It is not an easy task.  On the issue around the danger of 21 August, it is somewhat ironic that it is the date chosen given that so many child care workers are still signing on for social welfare payments at that time.  Are they expected to return to work without being paid?  What way will that date work?  Will it be up to each provider?  Obviously, somebody will have to be there to do the administration work.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister is meeting with Childminding Ireland.  A number of years ago, there was a child minding advisory service provided through county and city child care committees.  It had a relatively small budget but provided a great deal of information and, probably, encouraged child minders to register.  The fear for a lot of child minders now is that if they come forward, the reality that most are being paid in cash may have a tax implication.  While I do not stand over that, if we want to encourage child minders to register and upskill, given the number of people who cannot use cr&egrave;ches and must rely on them, we should reintroduce the advisory service.  It would be a way to encourage people to come forward, engage more with the system and earn further qualifications.  That would be a positive step.  While there may be an information campaign to encourage people to register with Tusla, if it were done through the county and city child care committees, which are more local and approachable, it would be a more personal and better approach.  It might be a good way to encourage child minders to register.</p></speech>

The point she raises about the deadline of 21 August is a good one.  What about people who are on the dole and need to come back?  Perhaps my officials can answer that more specifically.</p> <p>  In general, I note that my awareness of the issue is one of the reasons I have sought additional funding to provide some money to support the administration of the child care scheme which is coming in September.  It will be up to providers to determine how to use the extra money.  As such, it may be possible to bring people forward sooner.  Deputy Funchion put down a great motion in the D&aacute;il last week to look at this issue.  She offered some solutions and I suggested it might be helpful to move down the road of sectoral employment orders to which employers and child care providers might sign up in the context of negotiation with their unions.  That might be a systematic way to get clarity about what would constitute adequate wages and conditions for child care providers.  My Department would co-operate with that.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's suggestion around child minders, I agree about how they could be registered.  Certainly, city and county child care committees continue that involvement.  It is at a more regional and local level which is perhaps more helpful.  As Minister, however, I note that we need child minders to be registered.  I hope we can move to that place as soon as possible.  It is in the context of the heads of the Bill that I have the powers to identify groups of people like child minders who could come within the scheme as we begin to role it out with the caveat that alternative standards of quality have been developed.  I await the report from the working group to see what suggestions come forward on standards with which we could be satisfied to ensure children receive the quality care which can attract a public subsidy.  Let it be clear that we need child minders to register and I hope the process is completed as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

As such, it is not a deadline.  It will be up to providers to register the children when they wish to do so.  The PIP system allows children to be registered seven days in advance of actually attending a service.  It is about their enrolment once the programme year opens up, which is in line with the reopening of the ECCE programme year.</p></speech>

I pay close attention to the committee's work, which is relevant to the work of my Department.  The committee has recently heard from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, , Empowering Young People in Care, EPIC, and the Irish Foster Care Association, IFCA on the issue and I have also received a very timely report on foster care from the Irish Association of Social Workers.  The challenges in providing high-quality foster care services in a complex environment have been discussed at length in this committee.  I am aware the committee recently had a presentation from Dr. Geoffrey Shannon on the audit he carried out on the application by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The audit report raised important issues about emergency child protection services both for the Garda and Tusla.  I am fully committed to addressing the issues raised in a timely way and have worked with Tusla and Dr. Shannon to develop an implementation plan for Tusla services.</p> <p>  Foster care is the preferred placement for children who cannot, for whatever reason, live at home with their families.  We have made a lot of progress in the foster care service provided here.  Of all the children in care in Ireland, 92% are in foster care, compared with 74% in the UK.  In Ireland, the 8% of children who are not placed in foster care are placed in children&rsquo;s residential placements or in specialist disability centres.  This compares very well with other countries in the western world and we should acknowledge this.  Sadly, as a country, we were known for poor institutionalised care for children.  This is no longer the case.  We are now to the fore in placing children in family care.  We cannot and will not be complacent.</p> <p>  Twenty years ago foster care was, in the main, for younger children or older children who presented with few challenges or intensive needs.  Children who needed additional care were usually placed in residential care or they simply left care in their mid-teens.  Tusla now aims to place and keep these children in foster care.  Tusla has been doing well in providing family care for separated children seeking asylum.  This is also the case for children who have suffered severe abuse or trauma.  The reach of the service has been pushed out to accommodate more children in a greater variety of circumstances.  This is the greatest evidence of our break with the past in terms of how we look after children in the care of the State.  As we bring more children into family placements rather than institutional care, we expose weaknesses in the system.  I will be the first to acknowledge these weaknesses.  It would be foolish in the extreme to do otherwise.  HIQA does a very professional job as regulator.  We need it to point out when our system is not working and we need it to confirm when it is working.  That is its job.  It serves our children and our country very well.  We need more social workers to recruit and support foster carers.  Some progress is being made on this.  There was a lengthy exchange on the subject when the CEO of Tusla appeared before the committee recently.  We need better ways to make sure all the proper checks are in place for safe and proper placements for children that need them.  The experience children have in foster care in Ireland is generally positive.  We know this from the detailed HIQA inspections of all areas in the past three years.  Inspectors found that the vast majority of children were safe, happy, attending school and in stable placements.  This is reassuring for me, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and for the public who need to know the standards set for foster care in Ireland are generally being applied.</p> <p>  HIQA is now revisiting all Tusla foster care services and focusing on the problems it identified in its first round of inspections.  These are mainly concerned that the necessary checks and balances are in place and monitored by the Tusla foster care committees.  This is critical to ensuring that problems are identified and addressed at an early stage.  Constant and effective monitoring should be a matter of routine in our foster care services.  Follow-up is necessary to ensure remedial action has been taken.  I wrote to HIQA regarding the concerns and received a response yesterday.  I welcome HIQA&rsquo;s timely response but I need time to study its reply properly before responding.</p> <p>  During its inspections to date this year, HIQA has identified ongoing issues of planning and service governance as needing improvement.  This includes having enough of the right type of placements in the right locations to meet the wide range of children&rsquo;s needs.  It also includes ensuring that foster carers receive the support and supervision needed out of hours, as well as during office hours, to assist them to continue to provide good-quality care.  The foster care system does a very good job but it is not perfect.  There are serious challenges to be met, but I hope that the members of the committee are reassured to know that the vast majority of children in foster care are receiving safe bespoke care.  This is evidenced by education attendance and stability of their placements.</p> <p>  Our foster carers are the backbone of the foster care system.  They take children into their homes and also, I believe, into their hearts.  They provide what children need, namely, sanctuary in a crisis situation and loving care and stability on a day-to-day basis.  This might last for a short while until a family situation is resolved or it may evolve into a long-term placement lasting until a child becomes an adult at 18.  Finding foster carers who are interested and able to meet the particular needs of individual children or sibling groups, which is called matching, is a vital foundation for a successful placement.  Foster carers need support and this is especially true with more complex placements.  Tusla plans to offer 24-hour support to foster carers and is currently engaged in negotiations with staff unions on the matter.</p> <p>  I will turn to the recent report by Dr. Shannon on section 12 of the Child Care Act.  The report on the application by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 is very useful in highlighting the experiences of children where the Garda has been obliged to intervene.  These can be in situations of alcohol and substance abuse, domestic violence and the impact of serious parental mental health problems.</p><p>The report also highlights the different challenges faced by garda&iacute; when they are dealing with older teenagers in dispute with their families who are asked to leave the family home.</p><p> The report has identified issues for Tusla to act on.  To this end I have put in place a clear plan to move forward on addressing the recommendations for Tusla from the report.  My action plan, agreed with Dr. Shannon, highlights the importance of greater inter-agency work between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report points to serious gaps in mutual understanding and practical co-operation at local level.  We must address this.  A strategic liaison committee co-chaired by the CEO of Tusla and the Garda assistant commissioner responsible for child protection is in place.  This committee has an important role in addressing the recommendations on co-ordination made in Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report.  My Department has been in contact with the co-chairs seeking implementation of the relevant recommendations.</p><p> I understand from Tusla that the extended service put in place in late 2015, where the Garda has access to a national social work out-of-hours telephone service, has led to improved communication between it and the Garda.  Garda&iacute; ring this telephone line for advice and guidance.  If they decide to invoke section 12 in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork, social workers, on duty 24-7, meet directly with the garda&iacute; and bring the children to the appropriate placement.  In other areas of the country garda&iacute; are provided with information about suitable foster care or residential placement for the child.</p><p> Having enhanced the out-of-hours service, Tusla gathered performance information for 2016 that showed the out-of-hours demand by area, the reason for contacting the service and by the age of child.  The data showed that, across the country, just over 40% of children who were the subject of referrals to out-of-hours services were received into care, either foster care, relative foster care or residential care.  In other situations, following the garda&iacute; discussing the referral with the social worker, the child may have gone to a relative or neighbour or, indeed, back to his or her own home if the threat to his or her safety left.  For example, in a situation of domestic violence if the aggressive partner left the home, the child could remain with his or her other parent, with a follow-up by Tusla in office hours.</p><p> There was a variation in the ages of the children referred to Tusla emergency out-of-hours services across the country.  In 2016 in the greater Dublin area, half of the 856 children referred by the Garda were under 12 years of age.  In the rest of the country more older children were involved, with 32% or 174 under 12 years of age and 43% or 240 children aged 16 and 17 years.  In some instances a child, especially older children, could be referred more than once.</p><p> Tusla continues to engage with staff unions to bring about an improved service.  Further improvements are planned for this year.  These include: extending the on-call social work service in order that a social worker will attend, in person, with the garda&iacute;, in cases across all areas of the country where section 12 is invoked by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; making the out-of-hours telephone support available to all foster carers; consolidating the existing three co-ordinated out-of-hours services into a single national service; this will be accessed by a single Tusla out-of-hours contact number, with additional staff allocated to underpin the improvements.  It is planned to roll out these improvements in the late autumn.  I am examining what further improvements are necessary to ensure we have a responsive, child-friendly out-of-hours service.</p><p> My Department and Tusla are examining the legal and policy position relating to the use of public and private providers of emergency accommodation for children who are removed from their families under section 12.  I am in contact with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on a number of the drug and alcohol related issues raised in Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report.  Alcohol and drugs are detrimental to family life.  I agree with Dr. Shannon that as a country we must wake up to this reality.  I requested that Tusla commission independent research about what happens when a child is placed into the custody of Tusla by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This will examine the decision making process, for example, why a decision is made to place a child in care or why it is decided to return a child to the family home.  It will also examine the child&rsquo;s experience.  For me, this is the logical next step to Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report, and I look forward to this independent research, which I believe will be very helpful.</p><p> Tusla children&rsquo;s services need a significant staff injection.  I am fully supportive of Tusla in funding the range of improvements it has identified as necessary.  The most important of these is allocating social workers to children who need them.  Employing and retaining the numbers needed will take time as our graduate numbers do not appear to be sufficient to meet current demand.  My officials are working on a range of options with Tusla managers on this important matter.</p><p> To conclude, I am ambitious for our foster care services.  We have committed foster carers who have stepped up to the plate for our children who cannot remain in their own homes.  I recognise that and I will support them as we continue to expand and continually improve our foster care service.</p></speech>

I have a few questions before inviting Deputy Rabbitte to contribute.  The striking features of your opening remarks are, first, the need for budgetary values to be put on these and for the Cabinet to agree and, second, the issue of negotiations with public sector unions.  Can you advise on what stage they are at and whether any issues have been identified so far?  While clear benefits and tremendous supports have been mentioned, they are entirely dependent on the buy-in by members of the public sector unions.  We need their support to provide support to foster families and children.  What is the position in that regard?</p></speech>

If I understand correctly, your first question was whether we have the budget to put in place the reform Tusla has identified and the numbers of social workers and other workers within Tusla that are required to ensure that we are able to implement the ambition of that reform programme.  The answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  It is not a question of the budget <i>per se</i>.  As we approach the budget for 2018, I expect and hope that I will get a commitment in my negotiations that we will have the money required.  One of the primary issues is the numbers we are able to recruit as distinct from the money in place to pay them.</p></speech>

Tusla wants to negotiate carefully with the public sector unions but it does not anticipate any major problem because it is not coercive.  It is not changing the conditions of social workers unless social workers opt into it.  In the on-call situation, thus far it has had a waiting list of social workers who are happy to do it.  It is anticipating that to be the situation, but obviously we will have to wait and see as matters proceed.  That is the information that has been provided to us.</p></speech>

The Minister said, "We cannot and will not be complacent".  I endorse everything she said in that respect and everything in page 4 of her presentation.  I will start with Dr. Shannon's report and some questions I asked in the House last week during Priority Questions.  With regard to the statement that we cannot and will not be complacent, I believe we are as a committee and a Department because we have half the work done.  We must finish the other half.  The report is a live document.  We are not talking about something that happened ten or 15 years ago but in 2016.  I will refer to page 50.  In 2015, there were 718 children under section 12.  In 2015, Tusla told us the out-of-hours call service was in four areas - Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork.  In the month of December 2015, there were 40 children under section 12 and in November of that year there were 45 children under that section.  The data are available.  One cannot beat the information.  It is world recognised and we all agree that this is a good piece of work.</p><p>It is real.  It references children who have been removed repeatedly under section 12 and repeatedly placed back in the family home with no follow-up and no connection between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  The Minister should forget about asking Tusla to do an independent review.  We know it does not have the staff.  I ask the Minister to ask Dr. Shannon to finish his work.  I want to know about chapter 2.  What happened to these children?  There is no point in saying it will be investigated.  I want to know if the system is working.  I want to know that the systems and supports are in place.  I endorse Tusla.  I am one of the few Deputies who believes it is a young organisation that needs support, but the only way it will get the support it needs is if it knows the areas where it is falling down.  Dr. Shannon refers to 91 cases.  I want to know that that audit is complete.  Let us find the recommendations for Tusla as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that we can move forward.  Is the Minister committed to a ministerial order giving a direction for the piece of work to be completed?  That is my only question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017071200002#P00200"><p>By way of answering this question, and some other members may have a similar question, I would remind the committee that I had the opportunity to choose the special rapporteur in my term, and I made the decision to reappoint Dr. Shannon.  It had a significant amount to do with his expertise, his international reputation, his commitment and his passion, but also the sterling way in which he conducts his research.  As he has told the committee, as well as stating publicly, he had the audit on section 12 peer reviewed by other international experts in terms of doing research and he was assured that, both methodologically as well as in substance, it was a top class piece of work.  That is my view also.  That is my first point.</p> <p>  My second point is that, as I believe the committee is aware, I have requested Tusla to put out a request for tender for an independent piece of research to be done in regard to reviewing section 13, which the Deputy stated in her opening remarks is the second piece of the work.  Section 12 was the first part.  Section 13 is the second part.  In the process of our conversations with Tusla in making that request to commission an independent piece of research in that regard, we have been informed by and have had discussions with Dr. Shannon on the ways in which that should be conducted.  All of that has been part of the past.  He has already fed into that, and I am deeply grateful for that.  It is appropriate to request Tusla to request an independent piece of research to be done.  In terms of the audit aspect, at the heart of section 13 is focusing on the decision making of social workers and their practice in the context of what happens after the garda&iacute; move in and help the child.  Tusla then has to step in and begin to assess where they are placed etc.  It is important to point that out.  Regarding the piece of work, I believe we need some expertise from a social work practice perspective that informs it.</p> <p>  Third, it is open to anyone to respond to that request and put forward a tender to do the piece of work for the audit of section 12.</p></speech>

Why would the Minister have gone down that route?  I know it is public procurement and so on but in the best interest of the children, why would we not have finished what we know An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na started?  Why would we not have continued the piece of work that was live?  Why are we going down the route of putting it out to tender?  I am sorry if I am being pointed on this, but I believe passionately in it.  The dots are not being joined.  The children are getting older and I need to know they have been looked after.  I do not believe one needs to be a social care worker to conduct this piece of work.  It is factual.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017071200002#P01600"><p>There is a great deal in this because we have had several hearings on it.  My initial question comes from what was our first discussion, which related to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  It pointed out that the lack of regulation it saw in the foster care area made it difficult for it to escalate cases, concerns and weaknesses.  I invite the Minister to comment on that and indicate whether it is an issue she tends to pursue.</p> <p>  Either EPIC or the Irish Foster Care Association stated that there was a defined break at age 18 for many children in foster care.  That makes it difficult for the foster carers and for the young people leaving care.  There was a general sense that more needs to be done to allow young people to leave a care setting gradually.  A welcome suggestion was made in terms of provision being made for adaptations in houses.  That makes sense.  We are dealing with the area of foster care, but aftercare is an issue that I, Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy O'Sullivan and several others have raised with the Minister as requiring further investment and work.  Obviously, they are closely connected.  That is a suggestion worth considering.</p> <p>  To a large extent this is a resource issue, but the issue of inspections is a clear weakness.  It comes back to some of the Tusla references, to which I will return, but on the issue of inspections, 84% of foster carers in south Dublin and Wicklow had not been inspected in three years.  Apparently, some of those were not aware that they were obliged to be inspected.  I recognise there are resource issues and while the vast majority of those are likely to be healthy, positive placements, it is the risks and the weaknesses about which we should be concerned.  Individual cases come to media attention, but it is the risks and the weaknesses structurally that I believe tell the real story about our child protection services.</p> <p>  The Minister's document makes a number of references to the Shannon report.  I am somewhat encouraged by the Minister's commentary about the 24 hours service.  If I am interpreting it correctly, and I hope I am, that seems to be step beyond what was previously stated as being the case, namely, that a social worker would be on site for all section 12 applications.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Is it the case that they will have full access to the social work file while present?  That is important also.</p> <p>  Many issues came under the Shannon report, but I re-emphasise my concern about the reliance on private placement including the Five Rivers agency.</p><p>Five Rivers wrote a good letter to the committee outlining the service it provides.  I wish to emphasise that my criticism is not necessarily of the organisation, but it underlines the point made by Dr. Shannon.  These organisations can refuse children who present with difficult behaviours and obviously they are entitled to do so.  However, this exposes our reliance on private providers.  The under-provision of State intervention and residential care options in these circumstances means children end up in Garda stations and I do not believe that is appropriate.  We need to reduce our reliance on these private providers.</p><p> The last point relates to the audit issue.  I raised the issue of the need for a far broader audit during the Topical Issue debate the week after the report was published.  I believe this is still the case, whatever about section 13.  Issues are coming up with Tusla regularly.  I accept that it is a new organisation and that resource issues have arisen, but structural and cultural issues must be tackled as well.  We need a full overall view of our child protection services in the State to provide us with a roadmap to get to the child protection service we need.  I still absolutely believe that it will back up what Tusla needs.  It will back up what the social workers are telling us they need in terms of support.  I still believe it is required.</p><p> My next question relates to the section 13 work that has been commissioned.  I am uncertain about why Tusla commissioned the work.  If the Minister initially saw the need for it, why did she ask Tusla to commission it rather than commissioning it herself?  The Minister has designated a person as the State's child protection rapporteur.  I am not referring to a particular individual but to a particular office.  The office was deemed suitable by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out this further work.  Why did we not identify this office as a suitable place from which to carry out this follow-up work?  Notwithstanding the need for a wider tranche of work, that office would have been entirely suitable to carry out this work.</p><p> When the report is returned and when the investigation or audit or research is carried out, will the board or the chief executive of Tusla have a veto over its recommendations?  Will the report return directly to the Minister?  Will the recommendations be published in full?</p></speech>

The Act included provisions dealing with registered designated centres, that is, residential centres for children, older people and for those with disability.  Other powers of HIQA under the Health Act 2007 include powers relating to monitoring and inspecting standards in health and social care.  These are the powers HIQA currently has in respect of inspecting foster care and child protection services.  HIQA is seeking additional powers in respect of foster care.  HIQA has written to the Minister in this regard and this will be considered.  However, it could have implications for the entire Health Act 2007 in terms of all services in the community.  That is to be considered.</p></speech>

The order provides that Tusla has an obligation to provide an aftercare plan for all children leaving care.

However, the national child care information system is well under way at this stage.  When that comes fully on stream nationally, social workers will have access to it.  Currently, they have access to the child protection notification system.  That is available through the national office.  Any child who is registered on that system would be known to the social worker when they get the name.</p></speech>

I understand this is the case.  I have reviewed what Dr. Shannon has raised.  We are reviewing the legal and policy perspective in that regard.  That is under review.</p> <p>  The final question was on the audit for section 13.  I believe I have answered those questions already except the last couple of aspects of the question.  It is absolutely not the case that Tusla will have a veto over the recommendations.  Moreover, I will receive the report.</p></speech>

All of this started with the body of work that this committee has undertaken.  Significant failings emerged in the report into the foster care system in Dublin South-Central, which is where I am from, and I am rather concerned about this.</p> <p>  I welcome that we only have 8% residential placements.  That is good for our children.  Some of them are outside the State as well.  I have raised this before in the context of the risk to children outside the State.  Overwhelmingly, these children are in loving caring environments.  They are in normal environments and family homes.  The care given is great.  Obviously, foster carers need to be supported and applauded for what they do as well &ndash; it is tough.</p> <p>  Dr. Shannon's report indicated the majority of cases of children at risk appear to be because of the abuse of alcohol and the misuse of substances, including medication, whether prescribed or otherwise.  What are we doing about this?  The last time I heard public discussion or debate on this was during the production of the national hidden harm project.  Then we went to the strategic statement, Seeing Through Hidden Harm to Brighter Futures.  That was the last report in 2015.  How are we going to address this issue, which represents the majority of cases where children are being put at risk in their own homes?</p> <p>  Reference was made to the definition of childhood and aftercare.  I welcome that from 1 September, it will be mandatory for an aftercare plan for all children reaching the age of 18 years.  This discussion has come up again and again with particular reference to mental health services.  The cut-off point seems to be rather absolute and cruel in some instances.  Parents are asking why it cannot be based on individual needs assessment.  The definition of the end of childhood needs to be a little more flexible.  It should be pushed out to the early 20s.  We will all work on that at some stage.</p> <p>  Can the Minister not advise Tusla?  Would it not be better or more prudent, in the context of the hundreds of new social workers that Tusla intends to employ or is trying to attract, to advise the agency that with industrial relations negotiations, the roster should be part of the terms and conditions?  Should the roster be set up as part of the process of the new social workers to be appointed?  Should it be in their terms and conditions of employment in the contract?  That would give certainty rather than allow it on a voluntary basis.  That would give a certainty to the cover of out-of-hours for children at risk.</p> <p>  I note that following discussions with committee members, the Chair has put on record a request that a review of section 13 be carried out.  I am unsure and unclear why it has gone to Tusla.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to this as well.  I am unsure why it has gone via that route.  It would be in the interests of children perhaps if the Minister herself appointed someone.</p></speech>

I am attentive to that and I agree.  As committee members may be aware, we will be bringing forward the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in the fall in light of the most recent discussions in terms of our strategy for reducing harm caused by drugs and alcohol.</p><p>In some of the questions that I raised to the Minister for Health in that regard, I felt there could have been more of an emphasis on the alcohol aspect of it.  In light of those discussions, the Minister indicated to me that he would be instructing a review of our alcohol policies subsequent to our moving through the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  I am deeply concerned in regard to that.</p><p> I note the Senator's point in regard to the aftercare plan.  In terms of advising Tusla about the roster on social care workers, Ms Clarke may want to answer.</p></speech>

One of the issues that Tusla has in that regard is having experienced social workers providing the out-of-hours service.  That would be important because they are giving key advice.  If there was a shortage of social workers volunteering, Tusla would obviously have to look at other methods.</p> <p>  If I may say something about aftercare, the figures show us that between 40% and 50% of young people in foster care remain living with their foster carers over time and they do not experience an abrupt change.  Many come and go.  When we look at residential care we have two figures.  One is the figure for children in residential care and the other is the number of residential care places that are paid for.  There are approximately an additional 100 cases paid for and that is because they are over 18.  There is an attentiveness that on his or her 18th birthday, a young person does not leave, particularly if he or she is in education.</p></speech>

There is an action plan, that is produced by the area, that HIQA monitors.  That information comes into the Department.  We monitor that.  We, in the Department, have monthly performance meetings with Tusla and issues such as this are brought to our attention.  We look to see what improvements are being made on an ongoing basis.  The Dublin-mid-Leinster area, in particular, would have difficulties across a number of issues in terms of staffing and link workers.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned some areas of the country, such as Dublin and Cork.  If I remember correctly, she stated that this may be rolled out a bit further.  I seek clarification on where it will be rolled out, what timelines are involved and what parts of the country may be covered.</p></speech>

Where they come across a child in an urgent situation they can contact the national social worker number.  They will speak to a team leader or a social worker.  It is a service that is provided from Tusla national head office in Dublin and then the Garda can outline the nature of the situation and be provided with advice.  If the garda&iacute; are in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow or Cork city, and decide to use section 12, a Tusla social worker will come in person to the garda and child and bring the child to his or her placement.  If the garda is elsewhere in the country, the national phone social work service will contact the foster care provider, arrange the placement and then contact the garda&iacute; with the details.  Outside of the four areas I mentioned, the Garda would transport the child.  Tusla has also divided the country into seven regions for the purpose of having a social worker on-call within one hour out of hours in particular circumstances, that is, in more serious circumstances.  As I indicated in my remarks this morning, that is what is currently going on.</p> <p>  We hope that in September or autumn, this will change.  As I indicated, the crucial aspect that will change is the plans for Tusla to put in place and make available a social worker in every county to work with the garda&iacute; in the invocation of section 12, and second, that the out-of-hours phone line will be available to the foster carers as well as the Garda.</p></speech>

It is a real tribute to foster parents that the 18 year olds in so many cases stay with the family despite probably very little support.  The point Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire was making that there should be possibilities of working with local authorities, in terms of such matters as housing extensions, is something we should recommend.  It is more of a cross-departmental issue.</p> <p>  I welcome the evidence of progress that we have seen on these issues this morning.  The fact the Minister reappointed Dr. Geoffrey Shannon as the rapporteur for child protection was a positive decision because of his outstanding contribution.  We all saw that here last week when he gave evidence to the committee.  I share the issue that was raised by everybody around whether he can tender for this job and I note the Minister indicating that he can.  That maybe clarifies something.  I hope we will not be considered to have prejudiced the situation.</p> <p>  I particularly welcome what I think is progress on the out of hours and 24 hour services.  The ISPCC, in particular, has a strong concern about that.</p></speech>

It should be a wrap-around service because it is at the weekends and at night time that so many of these issues arise.  It is important as well that whoever responds is as knowledgeable as possible about the needs of the child.</p><p>My particular issue, I suppose, is the one that Dr. Shannon raised significantly last week around the inter-agency co-operation and the feedback to the Garda.  They told us they have these kind of arrangements at national level, but it is clear from Dr. Shannon's evidence:</p><blockquote>There is no evidence of formal routine follow-up from Tusla regarding the progress of a particular case after a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has handed over responsibility.  Moreover, there is no evidence of effective and robust systems for inter-agency information-sharing...</blockquote> <p>Dr. Shannon goes on to say, &quot;notification is not communication&quot;.  This is crucial in terms of the welfare of the children involved.  In ongoing implementation of the report and ongoing interaction with Tusla, it is vital that the Minister insists that that happens at all levels, and particularly at the level of the individual cases.  It is a big failing that was pointed out by Dr. Shannon.  That would be the main issue I wanted to raise with the Minister.</p><p>Also, I have raised with everyone that there is a new system being proposed by Tusla called Signs of Safety and Tusla is starting to train its staff in it.  As I understand Signs of Safety, it involves the wider community.  It involves the garda&iacute; being trained.  It involves other community and even family members understanding what it is about.  My fear is that children who are genuinely at risk will end up back with their family or back in situations where there is significant risk to them.  It might be a good system in terms of children who are at lesser risk - maybe there is always a risk.  I want to ensure that the Minister is aware that this is happening and that she is kept informed as to how it is being implemented, and particularly that there is appropriate and proper training for anybody who is involved in the system.  My concern is this it is not about saving resources, that it is actually about the welfare of children.</p></speech>

I am aware of the concerns of the ISPCC, and also the ISPCC's hearing of some of the changes that Tusla is bringing in place here over the next number of months in terms of the out-of-hours services and that it sees them as a step in the right direction as well.</p> <p>  In terms of the inter-agency co-operation that Deputy O'Sullivan is speaking about, as Dr. Shannon pointed out, there is clearly room for significant improvement in that regard.  My understanding is that it has a lot to do with where he has talked about and his call for a cultural change in the context of the child protection system.</p><p>It has a great deal to do with inter-agency co-operation, central to which we need to continue to ensure there is an ongoing development of trust between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  There are a number of ways in which that must happen.  As we move past the first audit of the use of section 12 of the legislation and the work of the strategic liaison committee, I have indicated to that committee my concerns and intent that ongoing inter-agency co-operation continues, and that the cultural change aspect of the implementation plan must be clearly reflected in the way in which it oversees the work of the implementation plan.  It is important that the committee is overseeing and trying to ensure that inter-agency co-operation.  If we really drill down, what does that mean?  It needs to be happening at every level but particularly at the level of the individual child in a case and on the ground.</p><p> I want professionals, wherever they work, to put child protection at the top of their agenda and not to think that it is a matter for someone else to do or that filling out a form relieves them of their obligations.  I want professionals on the ground, whether they be garda&iacute;, social workers, public health nurses or teachers, to co-operate with each other.  That means going to meetings, picking up the phone, getting to know their opposite number, explaining to each other what their role is, listening to their concerns and worries, challenging each other, and not laying the blame when there are difficult decisions to be made.  Those are the nitty gritty aspects of the cultural change that Dr. Shannon referred to and that needs to happen.  High level committees need to be attentive too, but we need to respond to the call for a change in the way that they will ultimately work better together, involving a large number of officials and practitioners in various disciplines.  That is what it means and that is ultimately when we will get better forms of inter-agency and individual co-operation.</p></speech>

While that committee is co-chaired by the chief executive officer of Tusla and the assistant commissioner of the Garda who is responsible for child protection, it has to cascade downwards.  From a practical point of view, the assignment of a Tusla person to the Garda national child protection unit has been agreed by Tusla.  The process in regard to that assignment is in train as we speak.  The Garda national child protection unit is not currently in a position to take that person because it is fully engaged with training its own staff on mandatory reporting and the full commencement of the Children First Act.  That person will be appointed within a matter of weeks.  The date we have been given is the end of September.  The process has to be gone through from the point view of job specification, what we expect of this person, how they will work and so on.  Clarity is needed around that but even more so from the point of view of what the member said about the practical impact of people working together, follow-up and the facilitation of that.</p> <p>  The Garda is in the process of establishing specialist protective service units in each of the 28 Garda divisions.  It has a vanguard of those units set up in four areas, two in Dublin and two in the rest of the country and it is proposing to roll those out further.  Once they are rolled out and the effectiveness of them from the Garda point of view has been established, and there is a foundation in place, there is a view that there needs to be some discussion about how that needs to link properly and practically with Tusla.  One option is whether a designated social worker needs to be embedded in the unit, but whether that is the right option and the right use of resources by Tusla is a question to be considered.  It has not been precluded or totally decided at this stage, but from the point of view of the working of those units, the Garda is quite anxious to get them embedded and then to see how best to work together.  That will clearly provide a facility for the follow-up that the member asked about.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues - Professor Michael Barry is clinical director of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, Mr. Shaun Flanagan, who is on my left, is the chief pharmacist in the HSE corporate pharmaceutical unit, Dr. Lesley Tilson is from the NCPE and Mr. Ray Mitchell is from the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE.</p> <p>  The HSE is responsible for the reimbursement of medicines under a number of statutory schemes, such as the GMS, general medical services scheme or the medical card scheme, the long-term illness scheme and the drugs payment scheme.  With the inclusion of medicines purchased for hospital care, the expenditure on drugs and medicines by the HSE comes to approximately &euro;2 billion per annum.  That is approximately 13% to 14% of the total health budget.</p> <p>  The legislation which deals with applications for the reimbursement of new medicines is the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This Act requires the HSE to consider detailed criteria when making decisions around reimbursement and pricing.  Specifically, section 19(4) of the Act states: "The Executive shall not make a relevant decision except in accordance with the criteria specified in Schedule 3".  Schedule 3 goes on to list the criteria as follows: first, the health needs of the public; second, the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services; third, the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; fourth, the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks; fifth, the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item also has to be considered; sixth, the clinical needs for the item; seventh, the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety; eighth, the efficacy or performance in trial, the effectiveness or performance in real situations, and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment, that is, how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies; and ninth, the resources available to the HSE to afford the application.</p> <p>  My colleague, Professor Barry, will go through the application process in more detail.  The process for dealing with applications for a new medicine typically involves the following stages.  The HSE corporate pharmaceutical unit receives the application from the pharmaceutical company, as per section 18(1) of the Act.  The corporate pharmaceutical unit commissions the NCPE to conduct a health technology review of the new medicine.  The medicine is subjected to a preliminary rapid review.  High-cost products and those with significant budget impact are subjected to formal pharmacoeconomic assessment.  Similarly, products where concerns arise in relation to value for money are selected for formal pharmacoeconomic assessment.  All such assessments are carried out in compliance with published HIQA guidelines.  Companies submit a dossier for consideration, that is, the company gets the opportunity to put forward its best case for consideration by the NCPE.  Following assessment, a full appraisal report outlining the NCPE conclusions and recommendations is sent to the corporate pharmaceutical unit.  The appraisal report sets out detailed information on the clinical evidence for the benefits associated with or claimed for the new medicine and the robustness of that evidence.</p> <p>  Information is provided on cost-effectiveness and the probability of cost effectiveness at a range of thresholds.  Some examples are provided in the note.  For example, &euro;20,000 per quality adjusted life year QALY; &euro;45,000 per QALY; and &euro;100,000 per QALY.  Occasionally even higher thresholds are also provided.  Perhaps one of my colleagues will explain the concept of a quality adjusted life year as members may not be familiar with the terminology.  In the case of oncology drugs a report is also sent to the national cancer control programme, NCCP, for consideration under the NCCP therapeutic review process.  The corporate pharmaceutical unit leads on any commercial negotiation with the individual pharmaceutical company.</p> <p>  The full assessment report, the outputs of any commercial negotiations and any other relevant information is then considered by the HSE drugs group, which is the expert body in place to make recommendations to the HSE leadership team on applications for new medicines.  The HSE leadership team or directorate is the final decision-making body on applications.  Following that process the Act requires that the HSE provides a formal notice of any proposed decision to the applicant company and requires that the HSE considers any representations received from an applicant company in advance of making a formal final decision on pricing and reimbursement.</p> <p>  The legislation passed by the Oireachtas in 2013 does not make separate provision for orphan drugs.  Consequently, the processes and procedures do not make separate provision for distinct criteria on the assessment of orphan drugs.  However, the HSE has in the past been an early adopter of new medicines, including in this category, and especially where clear evidence of clinical benefits to patients can be demonstrated and value for money assured.  The HSE is committed to providing access to as many medicines and other services as possible from within the resources available.</p> <p>  Internationally, there appears to be a growing trend towards providing market authorisations on the basis of evidence which previously might have been insufficient to support authorisation.  In parallel, greater responsibilities are also being placed on health services to ensure that cost effectiveness is clearly considered as part of the assessment process.  The criteria include reference to that.  The challenge for reimbursement agencies such as the HSE is that the evidence on efficacy, cost and budget impact is often less than sufficient to determine such cost effectiveness.</p> <p>  In addition, the pricing strategy adopted by some pharmaceutical companies adds to the challenges, with prices demanded often running to hundreds of thousands of euro per patient per annum.  On occasion, these prices can be demanded for medicines for which there may only be preliminary clinical information available to support the benefits claimed.  That is leading to serious affordability problems for health services in Ireland and internationally.</p> <p>  My colleague, Professor Michael Barry, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics will outline further details of the health technology assessment, HTA, process, after which we will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

We also then try to assess whether the price requested by the manufacturer is justified.  The NCPE will then advise the HSE on the cost effectiveness or value for money and the budget impact associated with the specific product.</p><p> A medicinal product is designated as an orphan medicinal product if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life threatening conditions affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union at the time of submission of the designation application.  The NCPE has a standardised process and criteria for the evaluation of pharmaceutical products, including orphan drugs.  All assessments are conducted in accordance with published health technology assessment, HTA, guidelines issued by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  These guidelines were first developed in 2010 and updated in 2014.  They are available on the HIQA website.</p><p> The NCPE HTA process is well established and usually commences when the relevant pharmaceutical company receives notification from the HSE corporate pharmaceutical unit, HSE-CPU, of the requirement for a rapid review.  A rapid review is a quick look see, as it were, looking at the benefits and otherwise of the medication, to assess if we must examine it in more detail.  The manufacturer submits the rapid review document, and the template is available on our website.  That will include a range of information, for example, the regulatory status, the clinical condition, the proposed licensed indication, anticipated place in therapy, comparators, clinical evidence, safety, efficacy in addition to economic considerations.  It is a wide range of information.  The NCPE reviews this document within four weeks, and we usually are on time with that, to determine whether a full pharmaco-economic assessment  is required.  If it is not required the medication is usually reimbursed.  The data from 2010 to 2015, which was published recently, shows that approximately 50% of products do not require a full assessment and therefore go straight through to reimbursement.  That means 50% will have to be looked at in detail.</p><p> If a full pharmaco-economic assessment is required the manufacturer is asked to submit a full dossier to the NCPE.  The application forms are on the website.  A full HTA investigates in detail the value for money proposition associated with medications.  Orphan drugs are assessed in the same way as other medications.  The assessment includes a description of the relevant condition, its management and a detailed outline of the intervention under assessment.  The clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of the product is reviewed.  The manufacturer is required to outline in detail the health economics relating to the product and provide an estimate of the incremental cost effectiveness of the drug, in other words, what the added benefit is for the increased cost associated with that product.   A budget impact analysis is also required in respect of the cost effectiveness analysis.</p><p> The HTA submission process also facilitates submissions by patient groups who wish to have their views taken into consideration.  The patient group submission template is also available on the NCPE website.  Having reviewed all the available documentation the NCPE submits its report to the HSE corporate pharmaceutical unit following a check for factual accuracy by the manufacturer.  The manufacturer gets our report before we send it to the HSE to ensure that we are factually correct.</p><p> Examples of orphan drugs that have been considered by the NCPE include: agalsidase alpha, Replagal, and agalsidase beta, Fabrazyme, for Fabry disease; eculizumab, Soliris, for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and haemolytic uremic syndrome; ivacaftor and Orkambi for cystic fibrosis; elosulfase alpha, Vimizim, for Morquio A syndrome; human alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor, Respreeza, for emphysema in adults with documented alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor deficiency; and more recently migalastat, Galafold, for Fabry disease.</p><p> The HSE-CPU will forward the NCPE report and any other relevant information to the HSE drugs group.  The final decision on reimbursement of any drug, including orphan drugs, is made by the HSE, not the NCPE.</p></speech>

Six members of the committee have already indicated they wish to put questions.  We will take them in batches of three.  That is not an ideal system so I ask the witnesses to take a note so they can reply to everybody.  This is a detailed subject and we can take our time and get the answers.  However, when the questioners are in batches sometimes the first questioner does not get their replies, so I ask the witnesses to take a detailed note of the questions.  I call Senator Colm Burke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting and giving us the detailed presentation.  This is a complex area.  My opening question relates to the population of Ireland and the overall cost of medications compared to other jurisdictions.  Is there any comparison for what pharmaceuticals are costing us per head of population?  The witness referred to a budget of approximately &euro;2 billion per annum.  How are we doing per head of population compared to other juridictions?</p> <p>  Second, I understand that there are approximately 158 different orphan drugs and that in Germany 133 of them are in use, whereas in Ireland only approximately 50 of them are in use or have been sanctioned for reimbursement.  Why is there such a gap between what has been approved for use in Germany and what has been approved for use here?</p> <p>  The third issue relates to legislation we passed in 2013 on the use of generic drugs, which Mr. Hennessy mentioned.  What savings have been made as a result of that legislation?  What progress have we made in that regard?  If we can save in one area obviously there is more funding available to deal with an issue such as orphan drugs.</p> <p>  My final question is on working with other countries.  I made a comparison with Germany.  The advantage Germany has is its population.  An orphan drug might only be of benefit to 20 people in Ireland but it might be of benefit to 2,000 people in Germany, therefore Germany is in a far better negotiating position.  Has there been thought about tying in with other jurisdictions with regard to carrying out a negotiation and getting a far fairer deal in that process?</p> <p>  Again, I thank the witnesses for their presentation and the work they are doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#E00400"><p>I, too, thank the witnesses for their contributions.  I wish to follow up on Senator Colm Burke's remarks.  It appears that there is evidence of some type of scandal, moral or otherwise, here.  We have the ironic situation that drugs that are sometimes manufactured here are available to people in other EU countries, and reimbursed by their governments, but they are not available to patients in Ireland.  Can the witnesses explain what is at the root of the differentials?  Ireland ranks extremely low compared with Germany, as Senator Colm Burke mentioned, France, England, Italy and Spain when one compares the access to orphan medical products.  The figures show that 53 of the 148 licensed products are routinely available in Ireland.  That is approximately one third.  Vastly more of such treatments are available in Germany.  Noting the irony that some of these drugs might well be manufactured in Ireland, what is the fundamental reason for that?</p> <p>  To move on from that, there is an EU regulation on orphan medicinal products.  Is there a need to move to a European standard or a harmonisation where we accept drugs that are accepted, made available and funded in one member state for people who are in the very disadvantageous situation of having a rare disease?  It is therefore much more difficult to do the types of tests for cost effectiveness involving these people.</p><p>Should we be moving towards a kind of harmonisation and an acknowledgement that if a medicine is available in other states, it ought to be available here?  Through the State-funded National Treatment Purchase Fund, people are able to access treatments unavailable in Ireland.  It should follow that if licensed, proven medical products are available to people in other European countries, they should be available here.</p><p> The failure to progress aspects of the national rare disease plan is at the root of this issue.  The plan dates back to 2014 and envisages a pathway for the assessment of the orphan medicinal products.  What is the reason for the delay?  Could the witnesses give a timeline for the activation of relevant sections of the plan in order that this problem can be tackled?</p><p> It is not just a matter of fewer products being approved.  There is also a much greater delay for people to access new orphan therapies.  It takes 50% longer than for traditional medicines.  That adds to the unfairness faced by those suffering from rare diseases who, in many cases, will have a very short lifespan.</p></speech>

The first issue about which I am concerned is the profitability of orphan drugs.  While I do not have it to hand, a recent article in the <i>Financial Times</i>showed a surge in profitability for investors in orphan drugs.  Although the ratio of orphan drugs to mainstream drugs is approximately five to 10,0000, there may be a risk that investors will move to invest in orphan drugs and that general drugs for the bulk of the population will be somewhat neglected and progress in treatment of common diseases will be halted.  Have the witnesses any comment on that possibility?</p><p>Senator Colm Burke mentioned savings in regard to generic versions of drugs.  I am a pharmacist by profession.  When I qualified 13 or 14 years ago and returned to Ireland from the UK, there were practically no generic drugs available here and pharmacists were precluded from substituting.  That has since changed.  At the time I qualified, a box of Lipitor cost approximately &euro;110 whereas a generic version of it now costs approximately &euro;10.  However, when one compares the saving achieved there to the cost incurred through funding an orphan drug for one person, there is no overall saving.  Savings achieved through the use of generic drugs will never compensate for the cost of orphan drugs.</p><p>There are huge global variations in the price for hepatitis treatments.  How does a company that has produced a drug, trialled it, done all the work on it and spent all the money on it justify the price differences?  How can we ask to these companies why it costs one fiftieth of the Irish price in Ethiopia?  How can that be managed to the benefit of the Irish people?</p><p>I am delighted that people have received Orkambi.  Ireland has a unique relationship with cystic fibrosis and a unique solution therefore had to be found.  However, the annual cost of Orkambi is approximately &euro;300 million, which is equivalent to the cost of building the new maternity hospital.  I may be wrong, but I understand the annual cost of treating patients receiving Orkambi is the same as building a new maternity hospital every year.  I am concerned------</p></speech>

Would it be possible for drug purchasing to be completely separated from HSE budgets in order that there is not a constant pull and it could be isolated in order to track spending in that regard?</p> <p>  Is there any role for extended patents?  Nine years was the period for patents.  Is that period still being extended in order to allow companies recoup their costs in order that the effect on the Exchequer can be spread over a longer period of time?  There should be little need for a generic version of an orphan drug because the population base is not big enough.  Is there any sense in giving companies an extended patent because there will not be a generic version of the drug and therefore spreading the cost over a few decades rather than one?</p> <p>  Could any of the witnesses address the savings and workings of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, framework agreement on the supply of medicines to the public health services and the effect it is having in regard to hospital budgets?</p></speech>

I will rely on my colleagues to provide some finer details.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke asked about the population issue and whether our prescribing levels and costs are comparatively high.  That has traditionally been the case and our average costs and expenditure on medicines per head of population have been comparatively high.  Whether that is currently the case is less certain.  The situation may be changing.  The previous Joint Committee on Health published a good report in 2015 that analysed this issue in detail.  The changes that have occurred since then are mainly related to the switch to generic medicines, as mentioned by members, which has had an effect on average costs.  Some of my colleagues may be able to provide further detail on that issue.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Flanagan to address the issue of the difference in how Germany deals with applications for new drugs compared to other jurisdictions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#F00700"><p>The cost of orphan drugs is automatically reimbursed in Germany.  There is no assessment or review and the drug is just paid for.  That is how Germany is different in that regard.  Ireland has a different legislative framework which requires that the criteria that Mr. Hennessy has previously set out be considered.  The Germans automatically pay for orphan drugs.</p> <p>  I am not familiar with the figure of 158 orphan drugs that Senator Colm Burke asked about.  I recently downloaded information from the European Medicines Agency and thought it mentioned a figure of less than 100 orphan drugs but I am open to correction on that.  It is not a very recent work.  I am happy to deal with any query in that regard when I have had a chance to examine the issue further following the meeting.</p> <p>  In regard to savings from generic drugs, &euro;250 million has been saved since 2013 under the reference pricing generic substitution programme in the Health Act.</p> <p>  In terms of international negotiation, my colleagues in the Department of Health are not in attendance but they made efforts to engage with international colleagues in relation to negotiation during the year-long process in regard to Orkambi.  It was difficult to get countries to align on the same criteria for all to agree on the decision point.  The Department is continuing to engage internationally on that issue to try to get involved in international co-operations.  That is actively being worked on.  I should not speak for the Department but I am aware it is progressing that issue.</p> <p>  In terms of international comparisons, as Mr. Hennessy said, the OECD publishes data sets regarding purchasing price parities and the cost of medicines reimbursed per patient on an annual basis.  As the purpose of today's meeting is mainly to deal with rare diseases, I did not research this particular issue beforehand.  I think the most recent data is from 2013 or 2014 and Ireland was at the top in terms of spending per patient.</p><p>Those figures did not capture the impact of the Health Act.  They also did not capture the fact that prior to 2005 and the setting up of the HSE, the State never challenged pharmaceutical companies on new drugs.  At one level, one could argue that prior to the introduction of these processes we were price takers.  We are no longer price takers.  We seek to aggressively negotiate with pharmaceutical companies when they bring a new drug to market because we know we have a limited budget.  The only way we can spread the budget as far as possible is to get the best price we possibly can for every new drug.  I assume that is the reason why the Oireachtas requires us to consider cost-effectiveness and budget impacts. </p><p> Senator Mullen raised the issue of harmonisation and negotiations.  One of the big challenges for harmonisation of decision-making is that not every country may be able to afford the same levels of investment.  If a country is signing up to German levels of involvement, it must sign up to German levels of investment.  Whether Ireland has those resources available to it as a State is a question I cannot clearly answer.  It is a political question rather than a HSE one.  </p><p> On the national disease plan, in terms of moving and changing the assessment processes around new drugs, as a public servant I would say the Health Act is clear.  It has not made any changes that allow the HSE in any way to treat orphan drugs any differently to other drugs.  If the view of the Oireachtas is strongly that there should be a separate process, there will be a requirement for legislative change.  It is something we have to say.  In terms of the 50% longer than ordinary delay in time on orphan drugs, there is no doubt orphan drugs are more challenging for an assessment body to consider.  As the levels of evidence are on occasion less robust than they are for other medicines, they present challenges for decision-making bodies but they also come with significant budget impacts.  Orkambi was for a rare disease but it came with a budget impact worth hundreds of millions over five years.  Decisions to fund such drugs have implications for the rest of the service.  Those are decisions that have to be made carefully after robust engagement from pharmaceutical companies on the price and offering they have made.  </p><p> I will keep going down through the list of questions.   </p></speech>

I might ask Professor Barry to elaborate a bit more on the rare disease plan as well.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke and Deputy O'Connell raised issues about savings and what has been achieved under the 2013 legislation.  I will give the committee a flavour of that.  The big change in the 2013 legislation was the enabling of reference pricing.  To date, more than 40 products have been reference priced in Ireland with price reductions of up to 90% achieved on many of the commonly prescribed items.  The overall savings achieved under reference pricing to date since the Act was commenced are in excess of &euro;120 million.  Generic prescribing, where it is appropriate and empowered, is in excess of 70% compared with approximately 30% as recently as five years ago.  </p> <p>  On the various price agreements with the pharmaceutical industry, which have been involved since 2006, our calculation of cost reduction and cost saved in the period from 2006 to date is &euro;1.5 billion.  The current agreement, which is scheduled to run to 2020, is expected to produce savings in excess of &euro;600 million by our calculations.  While IPHA companies will assess it as being slightly higher than that, we assess it at about &euro;600 million.  </p></speech>

The HSE looks at the reimbursed market; I am guessing the IPHA looks at the entire market.  The HSE does not pay for every medicine in the State.  I am assuming the IPHA estimates take account of the fact that their companies are taking a hit of that amount in the private market.  That may contribute to some of the difference.  There are two savings that are arrived at independently.  IPHA did its bit and the HSE did its bit.  Clearly, the HSE would always have to be conservative and absolutely certain that it will deliver what it says it delivers because it has implications for health pricing.  It might very well be in another party's interest to be conservative the other way.  Both parties will always be conservative within their own constraints and decision-making.  There is a public market and there is a private prescription market as well and IPHA companies will take a hit there from price reductions.  There is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

It is &euro;2 billion per annum and if we take &euro;120 million out, is that &euro;120 million over three years or &euro;120 million per annum?  If it is &euro;120 million per annum then it is a minute saving of around 8% out of &euro;2 billion.</p></speech>

There are two good points at which we can impact on the cost of medicines.  The first is on introduction, because we control when we put it on and ultimately control the price in a negotiation.  The learning historically is if one does not challenge companies when one introduces medicine, one pays for that over a decade or longer while the company has patent control.  Within our medicine containment policies, an essential part is we must challenge companies when they are applying for reimbursement.  We must do our best to attack unreasonable and unfair pricing.  If we do not do that, we will be left in a scenario in which we are overpaying for medicines for a decade.</p> <p>  The second point is when a medicine goes off patent.  There is then an opportunity because suddenly competitors come in.  The competitors can be leveraged in and within that the reference pricing and generic substitution can impact.  Within the agreement, as we moved from 2006 to 2016, we moved from a scenario where we had a five-country basket to one where there is an average of 14 countries, which is very close to what the previous committee recommended.  That basket now includes countries such as Portugal, Italy and Greece, which are low price countries.  That impacts on the price of the medicines that are coming to us and has a long-term life cycle impact on the price of medicines.  We have made very good efforts to reduce the cost of medicines both at the start and at all the trigger points where we have leverage.  There can always be improvements.  </p></speech>

When one goes back to the German situation, the Germans are not paying out the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for because they can strike a very good bargain because they are dealing with a bigger population.  We seem to be coming out of the wrong end when we are negotiating for orphan drugs because we have far fewer numbers who can benefit from the medication so the drug companies are very much in the driving seat.  It is a huge problem.  It is a case of trying to find a solution.</p></speech>

It is constrained as Mr. Shaun Flanagan mentioned.  Products have to be declared interchangeable in order for generic substitution to apply.  Anybody who regularly purchases some commonly prescribed drugs and medicines will have seen the vast change that has occurred in the cost over the past three years.</p> <p>  On the point about the international dimension, which was mentioned by Senators Colm Burke and Mullen, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Department of Health have been making considerable progress on this with colleagues within the European Union.  The size of the Irish population and the jurisdiction are factors and perhaps opportunities of scale can be achieved by collaborating with other smaller States.  It is at preliminary stages.</p><p>Progress is being made and this clearly represents an opportunity for smaller states with smaller populations.  This is probably still in its early stages, however.  Part of that agenda would presumably facilitate the adaption of certain European standards.  There might also be possible economies of scale with regard to assessments, as these could be carried out on a collaborative rather than an individual basis with each member state.</p><p> I will ask Professor Barry to come in at this point to talk about some of issues around rare diseases and the rare disease plan, with particular regard to the time involved in assessing and processing applications for new drugs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michael Barry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#H00200"><p>Our assessment process has been in operation for approximately 19 years now.  There is no doubt, however, that things have changed significantly in recent years.  In 2012, we looked at about 20 products between rapid reviews and full HTAs.  This year that figure will amount to 70 or more, which has been the case for the past three years.  We are seeing an avalanche of newer, high-cost medicines.  We are about to assess our first product to cost &euro;1 million per patient per year.  That gives the committee an idea of the challenges we face.</p> <p>  It is important to consider that, because of the NCPE process and the subsequent follow-up with the HSE, we are regularly able to achieve price reductions on products of between 20% and 50%.  That is money that is now available to go into other areas in the health service.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell spoke about the cost of orphan drugs.  As I mentioned, we are now facing our first drug to cost &euro;1 million per patient per year.  I do not know where these costs arise from so I cannot say if they are justified.  That is what we are dealing with.</p> <p>  Orphan diseases are, by definition, rare but taken together they are not so rare.  More than 50% of our current assessments are for orphan drugs, while a total of 80% are for orphan and cancer drugs.  That should point to where the major areas lie.  Matters are growing more complex because these are new biological medicines rather than the simple molecules we used to deal with before.  Getting back to rare diseases, I am aware of the rare diseases plan and of recommendation No. 30 in particular, which highlights whether we can carry out the assessment process for orphan drugs in a better way.  The answer to that is yes, we can always improve our processes.  With that in mind, we are establishing a rare diseases technology review committee.  I was asked to chair this and I agreed to do so in June of this year.  The idea is that this committee would look not only at the methodologies for assessing orphan drugs but also at the views of patients, caregivers and at the wider societal issues that go into health technology assessment.  We are only just in the process of establishing this committee but it is a welcome development.</p></speech>

I will digress here slightly.  There are media reports out today about the drug Entresto.  The issues around this particular drug have been talked about for some time now.  Seeing as they are here with us today, perhaps the witnesses will clarify the situation because we need to get to the bottom of this and this is a life-changing drug.  On what date did the NCPE pass Entresto?  When did the HSE receive that recommendation?  When did the HSE pass that recommendation on to the Minister?  Is it true that it took ten months, and if so, why?  Is it true that the HSE claims it cannot afford Entresto?  If that is the case, that is fine, but it means the Minister must make a decision on this.  A total of nine drugs were passed together and the Minister said that they would cost approximately &euro;120 million, although I do not want to misquote him here.  Of those nine drugs, is it true that this drug is cost-effective?  If it is, that differentiates it from everything else.</p> <p>  The figures I have gone through indicate the cost of the drug amounts to less than &euro;5 a day, adding up to approximately &euro;1,700 a year per patient.  We are looking at approximately 20,000 patients.  The real issue for me is that the average cost for someone who has to go into hospital with cardiac problems amounts to approximately &euro;8,700 a year.  We get figures all the time at this committee.  The differential here amounts to more than &euro;6,000, meaning that the new drug is cost-effective.  It has been passed across a whole range of other European countries and has also been passed at rapid speed across all states in the US, which is in itself quite unusual.  Not alone will this drug help approximately 20,000 patients in Ireland change their lives, it will also save the taxpayer money.  I ask the witnesses to tell me please if I am wrong on any of this.  We need to get to the bottom of what is going on here, so we need the dates of when this was passed, why the HSE took ten months if this is in fact true, whether it has been referred on to the Minister, whether the witnesses have any awareness of where the matter stands, and whether it is cost-effective and life-changing compared with other drugs.</p> <p>  When the HSE says it cannot afford certain drugs, it can pass the matter on to the Minister to make a decision.  I understand the Minister's situation and the difficulty around having to fund a range of different drugs.  A package of nine drugs has supposedly been referred on to him.  If there a serious cost attached to these drugs, that has to be taken into consideration.  What I want to tease out, however, is if the differential involved makes the drug cost-effective and it will help 20,000 people, why did it take so long, from July of last year to May of this year, for the HSE to pass this on to the Minister on the grounds that it could not afford it?  Why did this take ten months?  How many people in this country have been affected by this, and possibly even have died, while this vacuum has been in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#H01100"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for attending the meeting.  I have some general questions. We have heard that approximately 14% of the health budget is spent on drugs.  Could we get a breakdown of how much of that 14% is spent on high-tech or orphan drugs in order that we can make comparisons?</p><p>Could Professor Barry tell us where we lie in comparison with other EU countries on drug spend and high-tech drug spend?  The German model has been mentioned.  Once a drug has been approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, it is available and the price is negotiated.  A drug would often be paid for at a specific rate and between ten and 18 months later a price would be agreed and the company would reimburse the state any overpayment.  German people and governments are known for their efficiency.  A model based on that one would be well worth considering, even if we need legislation to introduce it.  We need to do something about orphan drugs.  There are many patients with different conditions who are as deserving of care as any other citizen and we have a responsibility to provide that. </p><p> How many people work in Professor Barry's office full time to back him up in the important work he does?  How often do they meet to decide on specific drugs?  Deputy Kelly referred to delays and the feedback we get is that it takes a long time to get a decision over the line.  If that has to be reviewed the process takes an inordinate length of time.  When Professor Barry started out he was considering 20 proposals a year, now he is considering 70.  Have his resources increased in the same proportion?  If not they should.  Those issues are interlinked.</p><p> A compelling case has been made to me about Respreeza-Alpha 1.  One of my constituents has the condition and I have met others who are on the drug and those who are not.  Even speaking to people a doctor could tell automatically if a person was taking it.  The difference in their quality of life is huge.  I cannot stress enough the importance of getting that drug over the line.  When will the decision be made on that? </p><p> Does Professor Barry interact with, and refer back to, the many patient advocacy groups?  They do a great deal of valuable hard work and I sometimes get the impression that when a decision is made, the drug company is informed and they are left out of the loop.  That needs to be corrected.  All advocacy groups need to be kept informed as fully as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1373" speakername="Keith Swanick" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#J00200"><p>I concur with many of the points my colleague mentioned, particularly in respect of Respreeza.  It is bad enough to have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, COPD, condition due to smoking but it is a terrible condition to have as a result of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.  I would also like a timeline for when that product may be available.</p> <p>  I know there was some discrepancy about the savings mentioned.  Approximately &euro;150 million in savings was mentioned since the agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA in August 2016.  Since then only 11 medications have been approved for reimbursement.  That seems a low figure.  Can we do better?  I take on board what Professor Barry said about dealing with 20 drugs in 2012 compared with 70 now.  Does the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCP, need more resources?  </p> <p>  The important point to remember about rare diseases is that they have very high mortality rates.  Up to 30% of the kids with these diseases die before they reach the age of five.  Treatment exists for only 5% of these patients.  I understand that it can take up to 50% longer for orphan drugs to go through the process of reimbursement, even up to two years.  The national rare disease plan identified the current process as disadvantaging orphan drugs.  Are the HSE and the NCP tracking the time taken to reimburse medicines, orphan or traditional, from the initial application to the final decision and do they know the orphan status of the drug and the clinical data implications associated with such small patient populations when assessing the applications?</p></speech>

That ties in with many of the questions being asked this morning.  People who watch this process closely do not do it for fun.  They do it because they have a vested interest in it because it affects a loved one.  The questions about the nine drugs are similar.  There are hurdles in place but when one thinks they are cleared the drug ends up on the Minister's desk or the HSE list which is approved but not reimbursed.  Can the witnesses tell us, for the sake of those watching, particularly in respect of Respreeza, that when the hurdles have been cleared there will not be another hurdle or that the approval will not simply sit on another person's desk while people are in desperate circumstances.</p></speech>

We are very conscious of this and have huge sympathy for the patients caught in the middle of a dreadful situation.  These patients and their families are desperate for solutions.</p> <p>  At the same time we have to strike a balance in that we must comply with legislation which obliges us to proceed or pursue a particular process.  Unfortunately, that process takes time.  There are some extremely difficult tests to be passed to determine clinical effectiveness and affordability, which is a hard reality.  The legislation sets out the rules we must follow.</p><p>We have to follow it.  The majority of applications get through and get approval, but we have to have regard to the resourcing and the availability of funding.  Some previous speakers mentioned drug approvals this year.  Six or seven new drugs have been approved already this year and are in reimbursement schemes.  Approximately nine from the first half of the year will require additional resourcing to bring them into a reimbursement scheme.</p></speech>

When he says that we will require additional resourcing, is he saying that, as we sit here, the money is not available to fund these, so those people who are waiting for those nine drugs may as well forget waiting, because there is no point and that is not going to happen?  Is it going to happen?  Saying that there is a funding issue is not what people want to hear.  They want to hear an answer in a fairly definitive way.</p></speech>

Ultimately, is the scenario that these are on the Minister's desk, and it is up to him, working with his officials, to make difficult decisions with regard to funding some of these?

It is for heart failure.  We started the assessment on 7 March and we finished it on 8 July.  That took us four months, which is reasonably quick.  That is our component of the delay.  It was cost effective and I guess, as Mr. Shaun Flanagan was saying there, having taken everything into account, it was value for money.  However, it requires additional expenditure and that is where the affordability issue comes in.  The real issue here is that there are 40,000 people with heart failure.  Some 20,000 would be eligible and 20,000 would not be.  The issue then is to ensure that the appropriate patients get the drug and for it not to seep into the remainder of the 40,000.  That is where the budget issue comes around, but it is right-----</p></speech>

I will also refer to him the issue of the resourcing of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, in which he probably has a personal interest.</p> <p>  Before I do that, I will make a point so that people do not get a different impression.  Where possible, there is no attempt to hold back or slow down products.  If it is possible to get a new product that will benefit patients into the system and into patients, we do everything we can to ensure that happens.  This is particularly the case where new products substitute for existing ones where there is no affordability question.  Our track record on that speaks for itself.  Where it is clear that there is cost effectiveness and clinical benefits, but a substantial bill attaches, it represents a challenge to secure resources.  Most people would understand that.  The sums of money under discussion are enormous, running to hundreds of millions of euro, and investment is substantial.  Sometimes, it takes a bit of time to secure the approvals and necessary resourcing.</p></speech>

One goes in with the price that one nominates and, as Deputy Brassil rightly said, that price lasts for a certain period, in this instance at least 12 months.  There is a negotiation around the pricing.  From our point of view, it is not a model to be followed.  This is due to the significant budgetary issue with which it would leave us.  For example, if we did not assess any medication in 2016, it would have added &euro;1 billion over five years to the drugs budget.  There are implications in following those patterns.  There is heterogeneity throughout Europe in respect of assessments.</p> <p>  Regarding the NCPE, our rapid reviews are always done in under four weeks.  We consider a drug, assess it and determine whether we are happy to recommend that it go through.  No one could do it faster than that when one is examining upwards of 70 products.</p> <p>  As to full assessments, Entresto was done in four months, for example.  The full assessment is a complicated procedure when large dossiers that are complex to analyse are received from the industry.  Full assessments are usually done within six months.  That is the approximate average.  The process from market authorisation to the patient getting the drug slows down, and we take approximately six months out of that.</p> <p>  Regarding resources, we have three additional staff members compared with when I joined 19 years ago.  A recent review suggests that we need nine additional staff members, particularly in technical areas because this work has grown quite scientific, with a great deal of mathematical modelling, statistical analysis and data analysis.  These are the types of people that we want and we need more of them.</p></speech>

One can achieve price reductions of between 20% and 50%, but not in all cases.  As my colleague beside me who handles these negotiations will tell the committee, not all drug companies are prepared to negotiate in a meaningful way.

It is an accepted fact that the applications are increasing at a phenomenal rate and that we must resource that process.  We are in considerable dialogue with the pharmaceutical industry on this front, and the committee will appreciate that the industry is concerned that the system is not able to cope with the demand and volume.  The HSE has made a clear commitment to resource the process well so that delays do not occur for the want of resourcing at that level.  I appreciate that not too many of the type of personnel needed for this work are walking around looking for employment.  They are not easy to secure.</p></speech>

I said that ultimately the decision-making process is formulated on the basis of the legislative process.  On the issue of rare diseases process - which may be where the confusion relates to - there is a plan to change the rare disease process.  Ultimately, however, the decision making around all drugs, including orphan drugs, is set by the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The HSE cannot make different decisions for orphan drugs.  It must be considered under the same criteria.  That is by way of clarification.</p></speech>

A lot of other extraneous issues have been brought up here.  I am dealing with the issue of orphan medicinal products.  I asked the witnesses if there is undone work in terms of the 2014 national rare disease plan and if this is the case, why?  I also want to know if Ireland were to provide the drugs on the same basis as is done in Germany, so that the same number of drugs of the orphan medicine would be available, what would be the extra costs? I imagine it is some percentage of &euro;1 billion, but would the witnesses know what the figure is?</p></speech>

I can tell the Senator that on the basis of the products we have in front of us to consider, if we had &euro;200 million we probably would not have enough money over the next five years to say "Yes" to everything.  That is pretty clear.</p> <p>  On the question of undone work, Professor Barry has outlined the main finding.  I am responsible for the application process for all new drugs.  I am not responsible for the implementation of the rare diseases programme.  I am not part of the rare diseases programme.  I am operating outside of my comfort zone here; I am here to discuss the processes and criteria used when evaluating orphan drugs.  It is my understanding that in respect of drugs the outstanding action in the plan is a separate process that would involve a rare disease committee.  Professor Barry has already described that and he has been asked to chair it.</p></speech>

When we do our assessments, for example, not only do we send our report to the HSE, we also send it to the national cancer control programme technology review group.  That allows other stakeholders, especially clinicians with expertise in the area, to comment and to highlight unmet need or other areas that may not come out on a technology assessment.  It is envisaged that the rare diseases technology review group or committee would behave in a similar manner.  That would allow various stakeholders such as patients, patient groups, carers and clinicians to have a say in the process.  We accept that ideally this would be done for everything.</p></speech>

Patience is what it is all about today, in respect of patients waiting too long and the terrible situations they are in.  Professor Barry stole a line from me when he said there is nothing rare about rare diseases.  In round terms, how many people across their lives will have, or are likely to have, a rare disease?  With scientific, technical and medical advances are there likely to be more people diagnosed with rare diseases over time?</p> <p>  I want to discuss timelines.  Because of my own background with the disability movement, I know a lot of the people, patients groups and organisations.  The representatives from the Alpha One Foundation and Muscular Dystrophy Ireland are coming in to the committee soon.   The days, weeks and months matter in giving relief and in keeping and arresting the decline in quality of life for people.  In other words, let us be clear and blunt about it; delays have economic and social consequences in the impact on families and family attrition.  What can be done? Are there some ways to actually improve the timeliness? I am not long a member of this committee.  I have been here for one year and I am struck by the timelines.  Is it going to be drug by drug, patient group by patient group, year by year coming back in to the committee trying to sort it out case by case? A way has to be found.  We would all be annoyed by that timeline but that is nothing to the impact it has on the people affected.  There must be some better way.  I am struck by the idea that there must be rare conditions across the cancer family but I am not hearing those issues getting raised in the same way I hear about these other conditions.  Am I right or is there some aspect of how we deal with the cancer family that we are not bringing into play here? Maybe it is not as simple as that.</p> <p>  My final point is about the small numbers.  It seems to be an issue.  Consider the community rating.  Rather than saying there are only so many with a condition would it be a fairer and more reasonable way to look at the issue by taking the burden off the two dozen or 200 people who have a condition in their families and say that the genetic cards could drop differently and this is something that could happen to anybody?  Should we look at the basket and say that rare conditions are not so rare and could possibly become less uncommon in the future so we must take the burden of the costs off the shoulders of named people?</p></speech>

I will do my best to keep up to that standard.</p> <p>  My first dealing with this particular subject was about 25 years ago, and it has not changed since.  Then there were two aspects to it.  One was the degree to which Ireland paid, above and beyond every other European country, for our drugs in general.  We have added to that the orphan drugs and the high-tech drugs and I cannot understand it.  We are playing around with the edges and we are not going anywhere fast.  I do not accept the notion that we should have a quantum of 14 or 15 countries within which we should operate.  We are within the European Union and the Single Market and that is the place we have to go.  That is the place we have to be.  That is the market that can negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies.  Nobody else can do it to the same effect that the EU can.</p> <p>  I shall now turn to the issue of people who are dependent on high-tech drugs.  What is actually happening is that the pharmaceutical companies create the drugs, create and feed the markets and then blackmail the governments in order to get what they want in return.  Sadly, the patients are the jam in the sandwich.  That situation cannot continue because it is unacceptable.  I cannot understand why we are assessing these drugs ourselves.  Why are these drugs not being assessed at EU level? Why not make one game of it all over and finish with it?  The drugs are either acceptable and safe or they are not safe, in which case the European Union, with a market of 500 million people, is in a very good position to negotiate with anybody.  There is no possibility that a countries the size of Ireland, Cyprus or the smaller countries of the EU are going to get any kind of fair play in dealing with that market situation.  The only way it can be done is by simply invoking the Single Market and the power of the 500 million people.  Is Ireland duplicating assessments that are taking place across the EU?  I presume we are, we must be.  Why is Ireland doing something ridiculous like that? Why does Ireland not engage with a central agency?  There are many of them right across the EU.</p><p> Reference was made to Germany, which has a population of over 80 million.  That is what the Germans are at.  It is a bulk market that involves bulk buying.  Why have we not invited ourselves into that circle?  I know the Minister is very anxious to do that because I spoke with him about it and he is pursuing the matter.  However, there are so many things to be pursued simultaneously and time is not on our side.  Time is not on the side of the patients and those who rely on rare drugs to make life bearable.  That is the issue.  On leaving here today, will the witnesses engage with the pharmaceutical companies,  through the medium of the EU, and cut out the nonsense about which we have been talking, namely, going round in circles and having this deal for one year and another deal for the next or putting in place an arrangement in respect of a particular drug for six months or a year.  This is all nonsense and it is making us a laughing stock.  When we are seen to be operating like that, we are noted for our weakness.  When we are weak, we will not create waves anywhere.  It is a simple and straightforward question.  How soon can the witnesses do that to which I refer or are they in a position to do it?  Can the HSE do it?  Can the process be started now?  In the context of all of this, is it possible to quantify the benefit of the entire drug market to our economy?  Would it also be possible to quantify the benefit to be obtained for that group of patients who must rely on rare drugs in order to have a reasonable quality of life?</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity and thank the witnesses for being here.  For years, I have been dealing with patients who rely on the drug Respreeza.  I thank the Alpha One Foundation for great work it does.  Unfortunately, patients have had to come to the D&aacute;il to highlight their plight.  The witnesses are well aware of patients, families and, as has already been said, real people who are literally living on borrowed time and who do not know whether they will have the drug for next month.  It is an awful way to live one's life.  I appreciate that the witnesses are very respectable people doing a job and living within the constraints that are there but, as I asked a while ago, what price can one put on a human life?  One cannot put a price on it.  I agree 100% that the companies must be made accountable for the money they charge and must be made aware that they cannot charge outrageous prices.  Those companies have a social responsibility to ensure that people can live their lives.  All these people want is the bare minimum as regards quality of life in order that they will know that when they go to bed at night, they will be able to get up in the morning, that the drug will be available for them and that they will be able to continue to live with their families.  That is all we want.  I have pleaded with the Minister and I am aware that he understands the situation 100%.  I have asked how we could say to people that we cannot afford to provide the drug for them.  There is a social responsibility.  I am not putting this all back on the witnesses or the Department.  I am saying that it relates to the companies.</p> <p>  There is a thing called respectability.  The message should go out from here, on an cross-party basis, that we are outraged by the way companies are holding people's lives to ransom.  To those people who put such a high charge on the drug, I would say that I respect the fact that they must make money and be profitable but there is such a thing as extortion.  Just because a company can charge an extraordinary amount of money does not mean it should do so.  I would like this message to go out from the committee.  I appreciate the work the committee is doing here.  I do not want to put anybody above anybody else but the work being done by this committee is more important than anything else.  We want to tell citizens of this State that when they require a drug, they will get it regardless of cost.  At the same time, we do not want to the Government to be fleeced.</p></speech>

Again, I will be relying on colleagues to come in on aspects of the questions.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Dolan, my sense is that it is not necessarily the case that more rare diseases or rare conditions are being diagnosed but that perhaps more products are being developed to deal with rare conditions than would have been the case in the past.  Obviously, that is good news and something we are all delighted about.  The less attractive element of it is the extremely high prices that tend to accompany those products.  The fact that new products are being developed for conditions that might not have been treated in the past is positive.  My colleagues may have something more to say about that.</p> <p>  On the issue of delays, I repeat that the investment outlay required in respect of some of these conditions is quite considerable.  It is for precisely this reason that the strict assessment criteria that are now in place were introduced.  Professor Barry outlined earlier that we hope to refine this process as much as possible.  He alluded to the arrangements for cancer care where some very high-priced products and drugs are coming on stream.  That refinement aims to capture, in a more comprehensive way, the input of patients and the clinicians dealing directly with those patients, bring it into the heart of the process and ensure that these perspectives are taken into account when the product comes to the drugs committee and the leadership team.  That approach has benefited cancer care here and, hopefully, we will see a similar benefit for rare diseases with which we are dealing this morning.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned a few concerns that I will address.  I will also rely on colleagues.  The concern that we are paying too much is always there.  It is for this reason that the 2013 legislation, controls and structures were introduced.  Is there duplication?  I suspect there is duplication across the EU on this.  It does stand out as a really attractive opportunity to rationalise that.  Colleagues may have views on this but I suspect the reason it has not happened up to now is because larger jurisdictions may be able to secure better discounts on behalf of their populations and may be less interested in doing this than smaller jurisdictions.  The Deputy is right.  The Minister has been pursuing this matter with colleagues from smaller states.  It does look like an opportunity.  I suspect that the HSE cannot proceed with that unilaterally in so far as it would need the agreement of health services across the EU to secure it.  Again, it would be difficult for one small health service to determine that but I know the Minister is working on that approach and I hope it will progress.</p><p>I absolutely concur with Deputy Murphy O'Mahony that there are real patients and real families involved in every element of this and they are at the centre of it.  With regard to the Respreeza clinical trials, I am pretty sure the hospitalisation dimension, or the avoidance of hospitalisation, was factored into the assessment, but I will ask Professor Barry to comment on this.</p></speech>

The Deputy raised the issue of putting a price on life, or appearing to put a price on life.  That is not what we do and Professor Barry may have thoughts on this.  I concur with Deputy Healy-Rae on the responsibility that lies with pharmaceutical companies to behave in an ethical manner on these issues, because patients and families are directly involved.  I refer in particular to the occasional practice of putting patients on clinical trials, providing access for the duration of the clinical trials and then threatening to withdraw the drug.  In fairness, most pharmaceutical companies do not engage in this practice but some obviously do, and this would not be regarded as ethical behaviour by the HSE.  Professor Barry will deal with the price on life issue.</p></speech>

We are not actually putting a price on life, but what we are putting a price and a money value on is the benefit the drug will give.  If we think about it, we have to value in some way to get some idea of whether we should invest in it.  It is putting a price on the benefit the drug gives and not a price on a person's life.  The other important issue concerns my belief that all drugs should be assessed on the basis that simply because it is an orphan drug or a cancer drug it does not mean to say it works very well.  This is the simple issue.  Many of them do not work very well and this is why we assess them.  There is an old saying in this game that if it is not clinically effective it certainly cannot be cost effective.  For many of the drugs to which we say "No", money is a factor, but clinical effectiveness is a major factor.  In fact, some of the clinical trials show very poor evidence the drug actually works.  The point about it is if we invest millions of euro into a drug that does not work very well somebody else will lose out.  This is called opportunity cost and this is the reality.  Will we see this again and again?  Yes we will.  This is what we will see.  There is a conveyor belt of high-cost medicines.  Yesterday, I got one for &euro;500 million per patient per year.  This is now a common occurrence.</p></speech>

I know this is correct.  I am not asking the question because I know it is true.  Could the witnesses use the strength of their professional bodies at European level to bypass some of the obstacles we have spoken about?  With regard to constant assessing, I would have presumed Ireland could refer the results of our assessments to our European colleagues and let us have one assessment.  We do not have to reassess again and again and go through the same process all over again.</p></speech>

In any walk of life, organisation or process review a decision is reached based on best knowledge and information, which is very much respected.  Is there a review mechanism with regard to the final decision of the witnesses, whereby somebody else can take a clean look at it?  Two outcomes can differ.  I am not saying the witnesses' analysis would be wrong, but somebody could look at it, see it from a different point of view and come up with different outcome.</p></speech>

This involves the HSE drugs group, a committee of which 50% to 60% are actually clinicians.  It reviews and assesses the assessment and evidence synthesis Professor Barry has done.  It also challenges my unit, which is responsible for the commercial negotiations, on whether we have done a good enough job.  There are steps within the process.  The HSE drugs group makes a recommendation to the HSE leadership team, which looks at everything <i>de novo</i>and challenges all of the assessments and judgments made throughout the process and comes to an ultimate decision.  There are steps in the process where all of us are challenged internally in the HSE.  Obviously we also have a significant amount of external challenge and viewpoints on which we must reflect.  All the way through the steps no single person is responsible for the decision.  Everyone is answerable, everyone's recommendations are challenged and my work on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies is challenged by the drugs group.  I am frequently sent back to try harder and do better.  This is part of the process.<br/><br/>Deputy Brassil asked an earlier question on the frequency of meetings.  The HSE drugs group is scheduled, and when it was incorporated it was scheduled to meet four times a year.  It has already met six times this year, so it meets monthly to try to get through as many products as it possibly can.</p></speech>

In the assessment process in Europe various agencies often examine and compare them.

We have EUnetHTA, the European Union network of health technology assessment.

I have been a member of the European affairs committee all my life, so I know where standards are laid down and I know what they are supposed to do.

We have been talking about small countries having individuals deals with pharmaceutical companies and such nonsense.  We are wasting our time.  We are playing around at the edges, and while we are doing so people are suffering or worried or may not have access to new medicines and may have to pay more for any medicine they use.  It was mentioned earlier that some medicines have dropped dramatically in price.  The reason for that is because of the type of discussion that we are having here now, but I can assure the witnesses that I do not accept the notion that we are not entitled to the same as every other person living in any other part of Europe.</p></speech>

There are no agencies in some eastern European countries.  Germany will not accept the parameters that we would accept in an assessment.  We are closer to the UK and Holland.

It does involve the areas of information and knowledge sharing.  The complexity of that should never be underestimated.

On the potential for developing our own drugs, we have a thriving third level sector and a huge amount of money is being invested into skilling-up our scientists and fitting out our universities.  Is there a reason why we are not developing more of our own drugs, and with the involvement of the State in the provision of those services can we not then expect a dividend?  Unlike Deputy Healy-Rae I am never shocked when big business behaves slightly less than ethically, but if we have made a contribution to the development of these drugs - and I genuinely believe that we have - is it not in order that we should expect a dividend?</p> <p>  There was a huge amount of discussion around the 2013 Act and the protocols and the necessary procedures laid down.  Is it the view of the witnesses that for orphan drugs we would need an entirely separate process, be it legislatively underpinned or otherwise?  Would we need to revise the legislation or somehow find a way around that?  </p></speech>

Where they are physically made is not that important.  Our universities are working in tandem and in partnership with these multinationals and yet we do not seem to get any benefit.  We are still building the labs and staffing them, and yet we are not getting any benefit back.  From the witness's reaction I can see that that is not happening, but it strikes me as a bit of a wasted opportunity if the Department of Education and Skills is putting large amounts of money into the universities to ensure that they have scientific labs and we are not extracting any benefit from that.</p></speech>

The reality is that the model we have at the moment is what we have, and it is based on commercial entities producing medicines under the blanket of patent protection afforded to them by states.  The question then arises as to whether the state, on behalf of its patients, get value for money for those products.  At the moment the answer is yes in some cases and in other cases no.  To change the model would require significant investment, and the affordability of replacing the current system would be a big question.  The system that is there is protected by that patent blanket of protection, and it is a good question whether that produces good value.  In the long term that question is most likely one for the political domain.</p> <p> The question as to whether an entirely separate process is now needed for rare diseases on foot of the 2013 Act is a big question that can probably only be settled in the political domain.  The measures that we have been taking to try and refine the current system, as laid out in the 2013 Act, have been on the back of the rare diseases report, in order to get a better appreciation for the differences that apply to rare conditions.  Arguably the legislation could be amended, and of course we would implement whatever legislation is determined as necessary for that.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Geraldine Kelly and Professor Gerry McElvaney of the Alpha One Foundation and Ms Clair Kelly and Mr. Richard Lodge of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland.</p><p>I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise them that any submission or opening statement they have made to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>The witnesses are all very welcome.  I am sure they will have listened to the proceedings of the previous session with interest, as we all did.  I thank them for being here with us.  I ask Ms Kelly of the Alpha One Foundation to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.450" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#Q00200"><p>Professor Gerry McElvaney and I thank members for having invited the Alpha One Foundation before the committee.  The foundation is here to represent approximately 60 alpha-1 patients, some of whom are present today, who are affected by the preliminary decision of the NCPE and the HSE not to approve reimbursement of Respreeza.  I acknowledge and thank these patients for attending today's meeting.<br/><br/>By way of background, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, liver and, in rare cases, the skin.  Lung disease is the most common presentation, whereby people with alpha-1 may develop emphysema in their 40s and 50s, with or without a history of smoking.  They experience frequent and severe chest infections that may require hospitalisation.  They will often require the use of oxygen and may ultimately require a lung transplant as a result of irreversible deterioration in lung health.<br/><br/>Respreeza is a new, life-changing drug developed by CSL Behring which treats the underlying cause of emphysema, rather than the symptoms, in specific alpha-1 patients.  Clinical trial results published in <i>The Lancet</i>in 2015 and <i>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine</i>in 2016 conclusively demonstrated a slowing down in the progression of emphysema by 34% in patients with alpha-1.  Respreeza was approved by the European Medicines Agency in July 2015 and is now reimbursed in 12 European countries.  A survey conducted by the Alpha One Foundation of patients receiving Respreeza found that chest infections dropped by 68% and hospitalisations by 69% per year and reported improvements in patients' ability to work and lead active lives.<br/><br/>The decision to approve or not to approve Respreeza will have a hugely significant impact on the lives of approximately 60 patients in Ireland who fit the prescribing criteria.  An estimated 40 people with alpha-1 have never had access to Respreeza but would benefit from the therapy.  Meanwhile, their health continues to decline, so it is imperative that this situation be resolved.  Another 21 patients were involved in CSL Behring's clinical trial of the drug here and have been given continued access to the therapy by the company following the trial's conclusion in 2014.  However, over the past year, these 21 patients have received repeated deadlines from the company advising them that the therapy will cease unless approved for reimbursement.  The latest deadline of 31 July is fast approaching.  These deadlines are causing huge distress and anxiety to patients, are totally unacceptable and should be withdrawn.  The &quot;Vision &amp;amp; Values&quot; section of CSL Behring's website states: &quot;We listen to and address the needs of people with life-threatening disorders and the professionals who serve them.&quot;  We ask CSL Behring to fulfil this vision and listen to patients, listen to the Alpha One Foundation and listen to all committee members as this country's public representatives.  We ask CSL Behring to stop issuing deadlines to patients who have given so much in their research endeavours.<br/><br/>Of course, this does not remove obligations on the NCPE, the HSE and the Department of Health to acknowledge the evidence that this therapy does work, as clearly understood and appreciated by the European Medicines Agency and our European neighbours.  I ask the committee to remember that this is about not just the 21 patients already on the therapy but also approximately 40 others who continue to be deprived of its benefits.  The NCPE, in making its original determination, did not consider a second study which further demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of the therapy nor did it take into account the results of the Alpha One Foundation patient survey.  It is a cause of further distress for patients that there is a complete lack of transparency and communication with the approvals process.  Since the first determination was made by the NCPE, patients have continued to fret and worry, with no formal notification from the HSE as to the current status.  It was only when patients grew increasingly and publicly frustrated and upset that a meeting was quickly arranged with the HSE in February of this year.  However, since then, little information has been forthcoming, only occasional updates gleaned from media statements.<br/><br/>Patients have pointed out to us how bizarre it is that the Government funds a national screening programme for alpha-1 but then fails to fund a new treatment that tackles it.  Patients also highlight that there are savings to be made in keeping them healthy for longer, keeping them out of expensive hospitals and enabling them to contribute to our economy and our society.</p><p>These are important considerations. </p><p> It is obvious from our experience that the current approvals system is not fit for purpose and there is a clear need for appropriate patient engagement structures.  We urge the implementation of the technical review group for orphan drugs as recommended in the national rare disease plan. </p><p> Finally, it is important to state that the Alpha One Foundation and the patients we represent have no interest in supporting "big pharma" but we do support big therapies - therapies that make life-changing differences to people's lives. </p><p> We urge all parties to put patients first and to agree a deal.  Yes, taxpayers should get maximum value for money but our patients are entitled to a maximum quality of life too.  Would the members here not agree? </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Lodge" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#R00300"><p>My name is Richard Lodge and I am the chief executive officer of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland and I am here with our information specialist Ms Clair Kelly.  I thank the committee for taking the time to hear our representations today.  I speak on behalf of the 800 members of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland and the five children currently known to us who could benefit from the drug Translarna.  I especially speak on behalf of the two children aged five and seven years who are currently losing valuable treatment time, children of parents who are forced to watch as a narrow window of opportunity closes permanently.  </p> <p>  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a debilitating condition resulting in the progressive weakening and wasting of the muscles.  A child with Duchenne can expect to lose the ability to walk by the age of ten years, to develop cardiac and respiratory problems in their teens and will have an average life expectancy of 27 years.  Translarna is the first ever treatment for Duchenne to receive European Medicines Agency, EMA, approval.  European specialists believe it has the potential to change the course of the disease and improve the overall life expectancy of patients.  Since 2014, more than 400 children in 22 European countries have been receiving this medication.  This leaves Ireland as one of the last remaining countries yet to facilitate treatment.  It appears as though our decision not to reimburse for Translarna is at odds with experts across Europe.  Would this imply that the European Medicines Agency and the 22 other European countries have all got it wrong or it is the case that we are behind the curve?  </p> <p>  Muscular Dystrophy Ireland has made several observations regarding the assessment of Translarna including an excessively long process, little apparent understanding of the progressive nature of the condition, no meaningful engagement with patient groups and no evidence of expert clinical input despite the clear unmet clinical need.  There is also the decision not to include into the equation the compelling evidence from a phase 3 clinical study.  Delays to date have included the failure to discuss Translarna at the most recent drugs group meeting despite it being an item on the agenda.  It is now almost a year since the HSE leadership team stated it was eager to review Translarna again.  One requirement of treatment is the ability to walk at least ten steps unaided.  These delays in access will directly result in some of these children missing the opportunity for treatment as their condition deteriorates and they lose ambulation.  This drug may not be cheap but it may be cheaper than the cost of caring for a non-ambulatory child for a year.  Evidence indicates that the earlier the drug is prescribed, the more muscular integrity is retained.  Under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, children have an explicit right to achieve their developmental potential and sustain the highest possible standards of health.  Is there a danger that we are jeopardising that right?  For the first time ever, we have treatments in development for Duchenne, spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, alpha-1, cystic fibrosis, cystinosis and a number of other rare diseases.  Ireland does not appear to be ready for this and Irish patients are falling behind their European Counterparts.  In the case of access to Translarna, Ireland is now three years behind France and Germany and a full year behind England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>  Our current system of assessment for rare diseases is not fit for purpose and we are concerned about the lack of development of strategies for the provision of high technology and orphan therapies.  As it stands, no orphan drugs will get through the current health technology assessment, HTA, process and therefore no people with a rare disease will be treated until a solution is put in place.  One such solution is the implementation of the recommendations of the national rare disease plan, approved by the Government in 2014.  The HSE has committed to the development of a working group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies.  The promised technical review committee for orphan drugs, while in progress, was without a chair until this morning.  It may be that this meeting has prompted that appointment.  It remains unresourced and has yet to meet. </p> <p>  We also need to consider other avenues for accessing orphan drugs, including fast track, managed access and managed risk programmes.  We need an immediate fix for the current situation while the oil tanker that is the present process alters course.  Our request as a patient organisation is for a timely conclusion of the review of Translarna and a fair and transparent process that will not leave rare diseases behind.  We also ask for our children with muscular dystrophy to attain the same opportunities for health as their European counterparts, especially those in adjoining jurisdictions, without the need to move there.  Currently, we are failing these children. </p></speech>

The drugs require Government, ministerial and HSE approval and so on.  On the drugs which were referred to, what do the witnesses envisage as the shortest, quickest route that would short-circuit that process for drugs in the future?  Each time the question arises, we go through the same process we discussed earlier.  Having direct knowledge, the witnesses are in a good position to tell us what we can do to short-circuit the delays and as a consequence, the patients' concerns.  I will not refer to the drugs, but the witnesses will know them.</p></speech>

Had I known that people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were being represented here this morning, I would have pursued the same line of questioning as I had done with Respreeza for alpha-1.  I am a substitute on this committee for Deputy Kelleher and I had not seen that but I will try to follow up by email on the questioning on their behalf when the decision is being made.</p> <p>  It probably has been interesting for Professor McElvaney, Ms Geraldine Kelly, Ms Clair Kelly and Mr. Lodge to have been present and to have heard the discussion earlier.  Those are the answers that we have been given.  We asked thorough questions and received fairly comprehensive answers but I would be interested to hear from the witnesses, as representatives of advocacy groups, whether what members have been told is factual or partly factual and we might return to challenge some of the answers given to us.  The issue of understaffing of the NCPE is highly significant.  Its representative gave us the impression that the timeframe was quite tight but that does not seem to be the experience that I have had in dealing with groups such as those represented here.  I have campaigned on the Respreeza issue since my election and hopefully we will have the answer we have sought in three or four weeks, and I hope for the same with Translarna.  </p> <p>  Having worked with the groups here from the start, I am familiar with the issues.  There can be no argument about the need to sanction these drugs as their clinical efficacy has been proven beyond doubt.  The question is how do we get to the final step and have the costs reimbursed.  A number of people with alpha-1 are on clinical trials.  Are sufferers of muscular dystrophy on such trials or are they relying on data from other jurisdictions?</p><p> On companies' responsibility, it is welcome in one respect that companies opt for clinical trials and put patients on them.  However, I am concerned that having proven the efficacy of a drug at a subsequent stage, a company could threaten its withdrawal.  Either the companies should not start at all or if they start and the drug is proving to be effective, there is a moral responsibility on them to continue.  Are there any examples of companies that have started clinical trials, proven efficacy and then stopped giving the drug to the patients because of not being reimbursed or is it just a stick they use to beat us with?</p></speech>

Ms Kelly spoke about deadlines.  Could she provide an insight on behalf of the people she is here to represent of the kind of impacts those deadlines have on families and the individuals themselves?  It must be horrendous for them.  I have met people in my constituency who were affected and the manner in which some of the process is conducted is nothing short of cruel.</p> <p>  If the witnesses were to score the national rare disease plan in terms of strategy could they say it is good?  Could they also score it on implementation?  I would be interested in seeing if the scores are different.  Reference was made to savings and the cost to the taxpayer of a non-ambulatory child versus the cost of the drug.  When we questioned the HSE and the NCPE earlier, they were very clear that they took absolutely everything into account in terms of any potential savings.  Could the witnesses give us their perspective on whether absolutely every saving is in fact taken into account?</p> <p>  Mr. Lodge spoke about the process and the need for fairness and transparency.  If we were to redesign the process we would design a process whereby the people who needed the drugs got the drugs but life is not that simple.  In terms of the current process and the constraints under which we are operating, do the witnesses have any suggestions about how that can be improved specifically to inject some fairness and transparency?</p> <p>  My final question is also for Mr. Lodge.  He spoke about the drugs group meeting recently and that Translarna was on the agenda but was not discussed.  Could he give us his view as to why that happened?  I will leave it there.  We will take the questions in a batch.  I ask the witnesses to respond and we will come back then to the other members who are indicating.</p></speech>

Deputy Durkan asked if there is a better way.  We heard this morning that there has to be a better way and there has to be a better process.</p> <p>  One of the issues is the recommendations in 2014 for the promised technical review committee for orphan drugs.  That touches on the questions from the Vice Chairman also.  I think it is three years since that was proposed and nothing has yet happened.  That is not strictly true because a chair has been appointed.  To address what we could do better, we could implement the recommendations.  It is as simple as that.  To answer the question from the Vice Chairman about how I would score the strategy, it would score quite highly.  It is definitely the way to go.  It is definitely what needs to happen.  Scoring it on implementation is easy.  It is zero, because three years later we are not aware of anything that happened.  We were not aware until this morning that a chair had been appointed.</p> <p>  I have some experience with the process for oncology.  There is a lot that can be learnt and borrowed from the oncology systems.  My biggest concern about the current process relates to the delays.  I will ask Ms Kelly to update the committee on some of the delays regarding Translarna in a moment but I must say that communication is a serious concern.  There is a simple reason for that.  At present, the drug companies put in applications to have their drugs licensed.  Therefore, the communication is between those committees and back to the drug companies.  We are not aware of the mechanisms by means of which patient input or expert clinical opinion is fed into that process.  Unfortunately, we are in a situation whereby patients are aware of the trials.  They are aware of the drugs that the companies are seeking to be licensed, so they approach the drug companies directly.  The information the patients receive comes via the drug companies, from the HSE, which is not ideal because they will have a completely different agenda and the information we receive as patient representatives comes then from the patients who met with the drug companies.  There has got to be a way of short-circuiting that route and going direct.</p></speech>

The HSE seemed to be indicating that it does listen to patients and that patients and advocacy groups have a mechanism for input.</p></speech>

One of the things I really appreciate in being here today is to hear from people.  I echo what Deputy Brassil said.  It was an education for us to see democracy in action.  Bureaucracy is being held accountable by our public representatives.  It is obvious that things are being said here today that we had not been told.  It was out of the blue for us to hear about a decision on Respreeza taking three to four weeks.  We have been asking for a timeline for the past three to four months.  The Vice Chairman's about getting a house renovated hit the nail on the head.</p></speech>

We were asking for a long time.  Our patients are on a one month by one month timeline.  We were asking a very simple question, namely, when will we know and we did not get a single answer to that but we have got it today.  If we accomplish nothing else today, at least we have accomplished that.</p> <p>  I will turn to Deputy Durkan's question about short-circuiting the route.  The drugs have been approved by the EMA and the US Food and Drug Administration, FDA.  Why are we seeking to approve them again?  That does not make any sense whatsoever.  Our role should be to find out if we can get a good price for drugs that work.  That is the only question.  The way to get a good price is to go in with a European group and use our strength in numbers.  We should not go in as a country of 4.5 million, but as a big bloc of 500 million and tell them this is what we need.  It is almost intuitive that that is what we should do but we are not doing it.  I do not think we got the answers on that today.  We got a lot of obfuscation but no real answers to the questions.  To summarise, we should not be reinventing the wheel.  The drugs have been shown to act well.  The next question is whether they are worth the price and if we can get the price down.  That is where we should focus.</p></speech>

In the context of the NCPE seeking additional resources, there is talk about an increase of nine staff.  Those nine people will do work that is already being done elsewhere so it does not make sense.  We should put the funding somewhere else, into something that is going to help the patients that are suffering from muscular dystrophy or alpha-1.  There is a total lack of transparency on where their money is being spent by both the NCPE and the HSE.  It is not obvious to any of us where the money is going.  I think that is critical in all of this.  Transparency is not there and that must be looked at across this whole process.</p></speech>

We heard much today about Europe and what we can do there.  Ironically, 80% of children in Europe are receiving this treatment, so we are one of the last to facilitate it.  I can give an example of some of the mechanisms and programmes that are out there around Europe.  In England and Scotland, they have individual funding requests for treatment and these can be applied for while the assessment process is ongoing.  In Italy, they have fast-track mechanisms and in France they have authorised temporary use in the case of a condition that is life threatening or where there is no therapeutic alternative.  That is the case for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  In Sweden, county councils can individually reimburse a treatment cost, which is quite different from what we do here.  In Germany, there is automatic reimbursement.  There are many examples of the different ways and as Professor McElvaney has stated, we do not need to reinvent the wheel.  These programmes are out there already and we need to look at what fits for us.</p></speech>

Being faced continuously with a deadline on a drug that is allowing a person to live - what we around the table appreciate as normal daily living - is heartbreaking for these patients.  It affects their family lives and it affects them financially.  There is the continuous threat of ending up in hospital with a chest infection or the possibility of a lung transplant.  It is not something any of us want to face.  The threat over the alpha-1 patients is obvious, as it is with other patients suffering from rare diseases who require orphan drugs to help them maintain their lives.</p> <p>  The Health Service Executive or the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, are looking at the effectiveness of a drug and they are concentrating on the cost effectiveness of a drug than whether it is effective for patients.  That has already been proven;12 countries in Europe have approved this and are readily handing it out to patients, and we have already proven that it works in Ireland for 21 patients.  We have got 40 more and probably ten on top of that waiting.  It is a given that this needs to change.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming here today.  As I said to the previous groups, it is very important to note that behind every funding application, there is a life and families, etc., connected to that life.  The witnesses know this more than most people.  I am very glad the delegations are here this morning to see what happens and perhaps it is something we should do in future.  Rather than us telling them what happened, it was great they could witness it.</p></speech>

I know they are extremely committed and dedicated to the projects in which they are involved and helping patients who have these difficult medical conditions.  For the record, I will correct a comment from earlier this morning.  My figures were correct.  My understanding is that of the 148 orphan drugs, 133 have been approved in Germany, 68 have been approved in England and only 53 are currently reimbursed in Ireland.  The HSE indicated my figures were exaggerated but they are not.  These are the actual figures from a report I got.  There are 53 reimbursed in Ireland, compared with 116 in France, 133 in Germany, 84 in Italy and 75 in Spain.  Those are the figures.  The other matter is the timescale.  My understanding of orphan medication is that from the date of the initial application to the final HSE decision, it is an average of 23.6 months.  They are the figures I got from a report I sourced.  In the period 2012 to 2017, some 15 of the 45 applications made have been successful.</p></speech>

From our studies we know that when a person gets emphysema and loses lung tissue, he or she never gets it back.  We have done the studies over two years.  If a person is waiting two years to see if a drug is to be approved, he or she will have irretrievably lost lung tissue.</p></speech>

I presume there are equivalent organisations supporting patients with the same medical conditions at a European level so has there been any contact with them about how they feel about joined-up thinking between countries to expedite the process?  I go back to the German example.  We are talking about being tied with smaller countries in trying to do deals with pharmaceutical companies.  My view is we should be tied to bigger countries as we would be in a far better position to negotiate.  That is the big concern I have.  As I stated earlier, if there is a drug to help 20 people here, in a country the size of the UK or Germany, a far bigger number would be involved.  The pharmaceutical companies cannot afford not to do a deal over there.  Have the witnesses spoken with comparable organisations in other countries?  There is also the medical connection and there is much contact between medical people involved in these areas.  That happens in Ireland, the UK and Germany, for example.  Has there been a sharing of information or working together to try to bring about the change being sought?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry McElvaney" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#T01200"><p>Absolutely.  We can look at it in two ways, both in the US and the EU.  The United States is different from Europe but there the patient organisation has a major role in acting as an intermediary between drug companies and patients.  The drug is distributed by the patient organisation, which ensures a good price for the patient.  It is a really good example of how patient organisations can take control.</p> <p>  In a European context, it is sad for us that the pivotal study that other European countries used to get the drug approved was done mainly in this country.  We had the largest number of patients of any country in Europe on that trial.  Our patients ended up not getting the drug but organisations in other countries used the trial to get drugs for their patients.  We are perceived as being a very strong alpha-1 community in a European context.  We have spoken with colleagues but the problem is 12 of them have already bolted the cage as they have the drug.  That includes Greece and similar countries that we might see as being in a worse economic position than ourselves.  They have the drug and we do not.</p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right and we should make common cause with European neighbours.  We would be doing so at a remove and as a poor relation for the moment.  They have the drug and we do not.  It is a major cause of concern for us.</p></speech>

The witnesses were here when we questioned the HSE and I did so myself.  We asked about European standards and they just do not seem to exist.  It strikes me that it is an area on which we should put a heavy focus.</p></speech>

From a diagnostic perspective, Ireland is perceived as one of the European leaders and we teach other European countries how to diagnose the issue.  We are working closely with European colleagues but our colleagues in the HSE do not seem to see this as an option.  I would see it as a suitable option.</p></speech>

The NCPE process was probably one of the most transparent elements as it was published.  There is a 90-day timeline, albeit with a stop-the-clock element as well.</p><p>They have that period within which they have to report back.  The problem arises for us when the recommendation leaves the NCPE.  There are then no timeframes and there is very little transparency.  There is also no direct communication with the HSE.  That is the stage at which we come up against most of the problems.  In the case of the NCPE, we do not know what actual studies were reviewed.  While the NICE in the United Kingdom has a list of every document it has received, the NCPE does not.  There is no record of an entire study and it is the same with Respreeza.  We do not know where the study went or if and when it was assessed.</p><p> As regards the children and clinical trials, we did not have a clinical trial site in Ireland for this treatment.  The children have been at a double disadvantage in that they have not had an opportunity to take part in a clinical trial and, when trials do come through, they have to waiting longer.  It is 22 months since the beginning of the NCPE process and three years since the EMA approved the drug.  That is a long time in anybody's life but particularly so in the case of a five year-old child.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.482" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Lodge" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#U00200"><p>Let me pick up on another question.  We were asked what drugs we were aware of coming through the system.  Ms Kelly has just touched on one of the problems in treating rare diseases, namely, that Ireland is small and that as a result the numbers are very small.  Until recently we did not have a clinical trial site, although we do now.  Our very real concern is that unless we can change the current system to make it easier for the drug companies to operate trials in Ireland and have their drugs passed and licensed and because we are dealing with such small numbers of orphan drugs and rare diseases, we may get to a stage at which a drug company may simply not bother with Ireland or may not be inclined to invest in research here to the same level.  Many of the drugs trials about which we are talking simply do not happen Ireland.  There may be a raft of reasons behind this.</p> <p>  The other point the Vice Chairman made was about the cost of caring for patients.  A study in 2014 put the cost of caring 24/7 for a non-ambulatory patient at around $130,000 per year.  The question was how confident were we that they had taken all costs into account.  We have never been told that Translarna failed on a cost basis.  However, we have no idea what costs were included.  We would like to think and have to assume all costs were included.  However, because there are such gaps in the communication process, we can only assume that they were.</p></speech>

When we put a straight-up question to the HSE such as does it consider everything, it answers yes.  I have met numerous advocacy groups, as we all have, and the point keeps being made that if it did actually look at the real savings involved, the conclusion could not be anything other than that the drug is cost effective.  There is obviously some slippage and if we have done nothing else today, we have managed to isolate the fact that a lot of work needs to be done on the process of communication between patients, their advocates, the HSE and the NCPE.  The impression was created - I will say no more than that - that there was massive communication, but there does not seem to have been that much.  The committee will certainly take on board the idea that more needs to be done in increasing patient involvement and communication.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry McElvaney" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#U00400"><p>I did not answer one question about companies discontinuing drugs.  It does happen.  When conducting Alpha-1 trials in Ireland, we insist on a patient continuing on the drug until a decision is made on reimbursement.  That is the very least companies should do.  The problem for us is that the issue of reimbursement drags on so long.</p></speech>

If we were to reduce the overall cost - I am talking about straightforward medication - we would obviously have a lot more money available for the purchase of orphan drugs.  However, we seem to be purchasing a lot more drugs per head of population.  Does Professor McElvaney think we need to do some work on that issue to get a message out to the general public?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-12a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry McElvaney" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017071200002#U00600"><p>I do not think so.  There are ways to get around it.  Purchasing for bigger numbers leads to decreased costs.  We have to control who prescribes drugs.  We have to make sure those who prescribe know what they are doing and that it is being kept within a well demarcated area.  There also has to be a review of a drug further down the line to see if it does what has been said it does.  If not, we need to be prepared to pull it.  There are a few things we have to do.  We have to stake a claim that, while we want such drugs, we want them to be effective and that we will take all measures necessary to show that they are effective.</p></speech>

I will assume the role of chairperson following the expiration of the term of appointment of the current chairperson, Ms Sasha Gayer, SC, on 30 July.</p> <p>  The chairperson of the tribunal must have a good knowledge of areas of law beyond property valuation.  In particular, it is important to be familiar with the principles of statutory interpretation; natural and constitutional justice, including the requirements of fairness, judicial review of administrative decisions and also the usual practice and procedure issues which arise in appeal hearings before the tribunal.  In that regard, I have the appropriate legal expertise.  I have been practising at the Bar since 1990 and I am a well regarded barrister with a wealth of experience in administrative law.  I practise mainly in local government law, with specialist experience in the areas of housing, planning and waste management, as well as property and landlord and tenant law.  I regularly act for local authorities in an advisory capacity and have a good track record in successfully resisting challenges by way of judicial review to the decisions of local authorities on the grounds of illegality, irrationality or failure to observe procedural rules or rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  Throughout my career I have successfully applied sound judgment, offered strategic and practical advice and given valuable guidance to clients to assist them in understanding the law and their legal obligations.</p> <p>  I was appointed as an ordinary member of the tribunal in June 2013 and it has been a great privilege to serve on it for the past four years.  During that time I have sat in a variety of hearings of approximately 60 appeals, both quantum and legal.  I have sat in hearings related to cost applications and dealt with orders for discovery.  I have drafted many of the judgments on these appeals.  I have also been involved in the hearing of global appeals.  The Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides for utilities to be valued on a global basis, with the resulting valuations apportioned across rating authorities.  I am familiar with the role of chairperson of the tribunal and have worked closely with the current chairperson in recent years.  The chairperson recently invited me to participate in a sub-committee tasked with drafting new appeal rules for the tribunal on foot of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.  </p> <p>  By way of background, the tribunal is an independent statutory body initially established under the Valuation Act 1988 and continued by the Valuation Act 2001 to hear appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation on the valuation and revaluation of commercial properties for rating purposes.  The tribunal also hears appeals made by owners of derelict sites against the determination by local authorities of the market value of these sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990.  Subject to a right of appeal to the High Court by way of a case stated on a point of law, the decision of the tribunal is final.  The tribunal is a separate body independent of the Commissioner of Valuation and the Valuation Office. </p> <p>  The tribunal comprises a chairperson, eight deputy chairpersons and 15 ordinary members, including me.  Members are appointed for a term of up to five years by the Minister for Justice and Equality and drawn mainly from the legal and property valuation professions.  Members of the tribunal receive administrative support from the registrar and a small team of staff at the tribunal offices in Holbrook House.</p> <p>  The principal challenge for the tribunal in 2017 and beyond is the anticipated large influx of revaluation appeals on foot of the Valuation Office revaluation programme for 2017.  That project is a major undertaking by the Valuation Office and proceeding apace.  It involves a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in ten rating authority areas, including south County Dublin, and will give rise to a greater number of appeals to the tribunal from September 2017 onwards.  Since the passing of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 there is no longer a right of appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation and all appeals will, therefore, be made directly to the tribunal.</p><p>This influx of revaluation appeals will be in addition to revision and derelict site appeals, which are a constant feature in terms of their continual receipt by the tribunal and which have to be processed and prepared for hearing in the same way as revaluation appeals.  Furthermore, the Valuation Office is establishing a dedicated revision unit to support the revision of valuations for certain commercial properties in local authority areas.  The commissioner intends to deploy more resources to address the backlog of cases which the Valuation Office has on hand.  The establishment of the revision unit will undoubtedly lead to a further increase in the workload of the tribunal.</p><p> In light of these developments the tribunal has recently secured the appointment of one new deputy chairperson and three new members to ensure that it can deal efficiently and effectively with the increased number of appeals.  The tribunal is also making improvements to its website and working towards implementing an online appeals process and the electronic payment of appeal fees, which will improve our procedures and increase efficiencies.</p><p> As the committee is undoubtedly aware, as part of a programme of rationalisation of State bodies, the Government is proceeding with a merger of Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Property Registration Authority and the Valuation Office.  It is proposed that the new organisation arising from the merger, Tailte &Eacute;ireann, will be responsible for ensuring that the tribunal carries out its functions.  To that end, the tribunal will ensure it keeps itself informed of all developments arising from the merger. </p><p> I look forward to the opportunities and challenges that will arise for the tribunal in ensuring that we deliver a high-quality and impartial service to all parties in the tribunal appeals process.

She stated in her opening remarks that she believes she is a well regarded barrister.  I want to confirm that I know she is.  I wish her well in the office.</p> <p>  Ms O'Farrell mentioned there being a potential increase in derelict site appeals.  What is the nature of the derelict site appeals that come before the Valuation Tribunal?  Is there anything we as legislators could learn for the purpose of trying to solve the housing crisis?  I know that is outside her remit but is there anything she sees within her work in the Valuation Tribunal that would give rise to comments that she considers might be useful to us?</p></speech>

Beyond that, we are an appellate body established by statute and, therefore, we are bound by the provisions of the Act and we cannot enlarge or add to our jurisdiction.</p></speech>

However, in terms of appeals to the tribunal, we are limited to ensuring that whatever determination the local authority has made in respect of the market value of a particular property, that it is a correct valuation in law.</p></speech>

I was interested in Deputy O'Callaghan's question about the number of derelict site appeals.  I know from Fingal County Council that there was no site on the derelict sites register.  It is an under-utilised legislative option.  Many of the Dublin local authorities do not utilise that option.  Have there been many appeals outside Dublin or could Ms O'Farrell give us an indication of the number of appeals that have gone through because as far as I know it is a completely under-utilised option?</p></speech>

I am not asking Ms O'Farrell to give them that assurance, but at what stage is the programatising of revaluation?  Are there a number of years already designated for different parts of the country?</p></speech>

To date revaluations have only been completed in the four Dublin authority areas, the Waterford areas and Limerick.  A mammoth task was set for the Commissioner of Valuation this year, in that his main strategy was to achieve the revaluation of ten rating authority areas this year.  That process is now almost complete.  The proposed certificates have issued, the representation stage is complete and I understand the valuation lists for those ten rating authority areas will be published in September.  It will be from the publication of the valuation lists that the 28-day period will run for the appeals to the tribunal.</p> <p>  It is important for this revaluation programme to continue apace because that is the only way that we will be able to achieve equity, uniformity and correctness of value, namely, if we base the valuations on modern rental property values.  The Chairman will be aware that South Dublin County Council area has been revalued.  It was revalued in 2007 and it has been revalued again.  The Act envisages that there will be a sequential revaluation of all local authority areas and that once a revaluation is complete that the next one will take place in not fewer than five years and not more than ten years.  It is important because the revaluations of the other Dublin local authorities will be due again.  It is important for the Commissioner of Valuation to finish revaluing the remaining parts of the country in order to get all rating authority areas on this sequential five to ten-year cycle of revaluation.</p></speech>

Prior to the passing of the Valuation (Amendment) Act of 2015, persons essentially had three opportunities to contest a valuation.  First, they could make representations to the Commissioner of Valuation once a proposed valuation certificate issued.  If they were unhappy with the outcome of their representation, there was a right of appeal.  It was called the first appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation and if the person was still aggrieved following that right of appeal, then they could appeal it to the Valuation Tribunal.  Given that the pace of the revaluation programme had slowed down so much, the 2015 Act was passed and one of the key objectives was to accelerate that programme.  New measures were introduced in the new legislation and one of those was to streamline the appeal process.  Essentially, the right of appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation has been abolished.  The time period for making representations has been extended to a period of 40 days.  That is a much more robust process now with the Commissioner of Valuation.</p><p>If someone is still aggrieved, having made representations, the only right of appeal is directly to the Valuation Tribunal.</p></speech>

I found the system to be very strong and was very impressed by the workings of the office, although it lacked flexibility.  While I found that properties were being valued fairly in good commercial areas, I felt we were treated harshly in others in which most business people would not dream of locating a wine bar.  The staff gave me a breakdown of how they had arrived at a valuation.  The footprint of a property is designated in terms of being in category A, B, C or D.  The street frontage has the highest rateable value, whereas the area at the back has a lower rating.  Traditionally, kitchens were hidden away at the back, but nowadays businesses should be encouraged to have open kitchens at the front in order that people would be able to see how food was being prepared.  In the layout of my wine bars and restaurants we have the kitchen at the front in order that customers can see it in operation, but we are penalised for doing so.  The Valuation Office has not moved on from the traditional way in which the different aspects of the building were rated and does not take into account the new location of kitchens at the front of a building.  We were slaughtered by the rates payable on some of our businesses.  If I were to appeal the rateable valuation of a business to the Valuation Tribunal, how much flexibility would it have in terms of the fixed rules that apply in arriving at the valuation of a property?</p></speech>

Essentially, the basis for a determination of value is set out in section 48 of the Act.  That section requires that the value be determined by estimating the net annual value.  The net annual value is the rent a tenant would be willing to pay on the property, with the tenant bearing all of the expenses such as insurance and maintenance costs.  The test is set out in statue and the function of the tribunal is to apply it.  In the context of the valuation list for a particular rating authority area, the test is to ensure the value determined for a property is relative to that of comparable properties at that location.</p></speech>

People are struggling to pay rates.  I do not know how the levels of rates payable here compare with those in other European countries, but I get the impression that we are being hit harder than the average small business elsewhere in Europe.  Perhaps I am wrong, but that is my feeling.  Let me give an example.  In Inchicore and the streets around Croke Park we had restaurants and wine bars.  One sees shops in these areas being closed all the time and it is very hard to stay in business and to attract shop owners into them.  One of the reasons for this is that it is difficult for those in business to pay the rates charged.  Is there a concept in the Valuation Office that in certain areas there is a need for leniency to allow existing business to survive and attract further businesses?</p></speech>

I am a former member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at garda rank.  I am making this presentation on behalf of a group of former garda&iacute; who left the Garda force for various reasons before 1 October 1976, having had the required five years of service or more, and who are being denied a Garda pension.  I thank the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for affording us this opportunity to present our case on our entitlement to receive a Garda pension.</p><p>With me are ex-garda&iacute; Mr. Anthony Morris and Mr. Pat Hynes.</p><p> In 1978 the Garda representative body reached an agreement with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance that members of garda rank who had resigned from the force on or after 1 October 1976 would have their pensions preserved from the age of 60 years.  I refer to agreed report 218 of the Garda Conciliation Council which has been circulated.  It was followed by agreed report 530 in 1997 and agreed report 543 in 1999 which provided for the preservation of pension entitlements for members of garda rank who had left the force for any reason after 1 October 1976.  The details of the aforementioned agreements only came to light when members of our pre-1 October 1976 group of ex-garda&iacute; of garda rank were approaching the age of 60 years and began to make inquiries with the Department of Justice and Equality about their entitlement to their Garda pension.  They were informed by letter by the Department of Justice and Equality that, on foot of agreed reports 218, 530 and 543, they were not entitled to their Garda pensions as they had left the force before 1 October 1976.</p><p> I emphasise that the members of our group knew absolutely nothing about the agreements made between the Garda representative body and the Departments of Justice and Equality and Finance which excluded us without our knowledge from the Garda superannuation scheme and attempted to deprive us of our constitutional right to a Garda pension, despite the fact that we had the required five years service or more.  Following these disclosures by the Department of Justice and Equality, we engaged in correspondence with it on whether agreed reports 218, 530 and 543 were underpinned by a statutory instrument.  The Department replied that the agreed reports operated on an administrative basis only and were not incorporated into a statutory instrument but that it was intended that they would be in the future.</p><p> The Garda superannuation scheme was introduced by way of Statutory Instrument 63/1925.  The Police Force Amalgamation Act 1925, section 13, is the primary legislation on which it is based.  The statutory instrument was amended by several subsequent statutory instruments but agreed reports 218, 530 and 543 operate, as stated, on an administrative basis only.  We sought legal opinions and were advised that we had a justified grievance, according to the Cox and Lovett case law cited and the Michael Woods case, and had been wrongfully deprived of our Garda pension, which is a property right under the Constitution.  The legal advice also stated our right to sue in respect of this injustice was beyond the capacity of the legal system to redress owing to the lapse of time and could only be resolved by the Oireachtas by means of legislation.</p><p> If our group had known about the negotiations conducted between the Garda representative body and the Departments of Justice and Equality and Finance, we would have endeavoured to be included in the negotiations at the time.

On a human level, what they are saying is understandable.  On that basis, I see the validity of their case.  Legally, though, there are problems.  The refunding of payment at the time of departure is a major obstacle to what the witnesses are requesting.  On a decency basis, I would support them.  The State needs to examine their case.  The current way that schemes operate, including the new one, works on a similar basis, in that one contributes up to two years in certain cases and if one is even a day short of that, one is refunded the contribution, told "Thank you" and no longer has an entitlement to a pension.  One day over two years and the same person becomes entitled to a pension based on what he or she contributes.  As such, a number of legal aspects of this issue could be problematic.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, something happens constantly in this country.  I do not mean to have a go at anyone, only to make an observation.  Representative bodies, particularly trade unions, represent the interests of their current members, as was rightly stated.  That is good, but some of the victims of that are often former or retired members or, as in this instance, members who might be due a pension after it has been deferred for a certain period.  In the Garda and several other places in recent years, deferred pensioners and former union members have been poorly represented by their unions when reaching a final agreement with an employer.</p> <p>  The committee should examine this matter on the witnesses' behalf.  Were they an exclusive group that could be dealt with in an isolated way, the situation would probably have been resolved by now.  Having regard to the Chairman's comments, I do not doubt that, if we decide to pursue the matter, the 1973 cut-off date in the general public sector and the implications of that on the State's finances will be raised with us.  There is still a road to travel but, in terms of the principle of an entitlement for people who served, particularly if it can be shown that what would happen to their pension entitlements was not made clear by the actions of the State when they were leaving, they will have a strong case.</p> <p>  This is sad on a human level.  People who served in the Garda are in a different category from other people regardless of whether they served for a day or a lifetime, as they put their lives at risk for the State.  The State has a special duty of care to people who served in the Garda and Defence Forces.  I hope that the committee can do something for them.</p></speech>

I got a letter referring to the option of taking the money or having it held on to.  I was never advised to seek legal advice on that.  It was left to me.  At that stage, I had five children.  I left a job and was seeking another.  I was apprenticed, which meant that I got little pay.

Absolutely none.  The Deputy made a good point.  The money was refunded and - I am repeating myself - there was no letter stating that this would be the position in the future.  The first time that we became aware of our current predicament was, as Mr. Shanley said, when we commenced inquiries with the Department of Justice and Equality as regards our pension entitlements and Garda service.  To our dismay, when we received the reply from the Department, it stated that we were not entitled to Garda pensions, the reason being that we had left the force before 1 October 1976.</p> <p>  We made further inquiries by way of correspondence with the Department.  What emerged were the agreed reports Nos. 218, 530 and 543.  We wondered what these agreed reports were all about.  We probed the matter, made further inquiries and made a discovery.  We were approaching 60 years of age.  The first agreed report was made in 1978 between the then Department of Justice and the Department of Finance.  The next report - No. 530 - was agreed in 1997 and No. 545 was agreed in 1999.</p> <p>  Under the agreed reports, our Garda representative body - it was not ours, as we had left the force by then - entered into negotiations and reached an agreement without our knowledge - that must be said, as it is important - to the effect that, because we had left for various reasons before 1 October 1976, we had no pension entitlements.</p><p>A number of legal opinions were sought as regards the legality of the agreements between the Department of Justice and the Garda representative body and the general opinion of the legal profession was that we had been done a wrong and had a justified grievance.  They understood that because of the remove in time we were out of time for a High Court challenge.  As has been said in the presentation, had we known when those negotiations were being engaged in between the Garda representative body and the Departments of Justice and Finance, we would have gone to the table straight away and argued our case, but we did not know.  Ten to 15 years had lapsed and that put us in another difficulty.  We were too late to mount a legal challenge.</p><p> We are here today after all the letters, the representations and the parliamentary questions over the years.  I have to say we got great support from Members of the Oireachtas over the years.  We have put our case before the committee.  We are convinced of our right to get our pensions.  I have no pension.  I am just managing like every other individual.  We have made our case.  It is valid.  It is just.  The legal opinion is that with the lapse of time, only the Oireachtas can rectify the wrong against our property rights, which are constitutional rights.  This is a wonderful day for us in the sense that we are here putting our case before the committee.  We will leave it with the members.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

The first thing I want to establish for the committee because I will not be here when the members go into private session is that pensions are an established property right going back to 1992 when, in Cox <i>v.</i>Ireland, Mr. Justice Finlay underwrote the property right of a pension.  Again, in Lovett<i>v.</i>the Minister for Education, a case dealing with matters dating back to 1977, Mr. Justice Kelly held that the right to a statutory pension was a property right protected by the Constitution.  During the collapse of the economy, when the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, was asked about pensions that were being paid to senior politicians and various other members of the public service, he stated that under the Constitution, pensions are preserved property rights.  He further stated that he can no more take someone's pension than he can arbitrarily decide to take their house.  He said that on 24 July 2015.</p><p>On the issue before the committee today, and I have huge sympathy for these people, the Garda representative body, with the Department of Justice, negotiated a deal which dated back to 1 October 1976.  I would argue before the committee that the Garda representative body did not represent this group and, as such, it did not enter into any deal on behalf of these people.  There is no deal between the Department of Justice and anybody else with respect to people who served in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to 1 October 1976.  The agreed reports referred to serving garda&iacute; at the time or those who were represented by the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and these people had left the GRA, as Senator Conway has already established.</p><p>With respect to legal opinions, they all say this is a matter that could go before the courts.  Realistically, what individual could afford to mount a High Court case in order to establish what is a property right, yet the Houses of the Oireachtas found it necessary to write special legislation to defend the property right of a retired Minister?  That is a matter of public record.  If we are prepared to do that for a retired Member of the Oireachtas, we should be walking over hot coals for members of the public service who were entitled to pensions but who had them arbitrarily argued away.</p><p>With respect to the return of superannuation contributions, my superannuation contributions were returned to me in 1980 when I left the Defence Forces.  I got a cheque and just as Mr. Hynes and Mr. Shanley have pointed out, there was no covering letter other than a note to say, &quot;Please find enclosed your superannuation contributions&quot;.  However, 40 years later I was able to purchase back my pension entitlement from my time in the Defence Forces for the amount of money I had refunded to me in 1980.  It was for the exact amount of money plus interest that I had refunded to me.  I was able to re-acquire my five years of Defence Forces pension entitlement.  The issue as to whether these men got their superannuation refunded to them is irrelevant.  The only question the State can ask is that they would repay any refund they got with interest if that applies.</p><p>Ordinarily, I would come to question witnesses.  I have questioned these men at length.  I have brought the matter to the Department and to the Minister.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we are the custodians of the Constitution and the Constitution has been used to protect the property rights of those who robbed this country blind.  It has been used to protect the property rights of those who have served in the Oireachtas and walked out of here with massive pensions.  What we are talking about for these men and any other member of the public service who had their pension property right negotiated away behind their backs, or perceived to be negotiated - I do not believe these men were included in the 1976 deal - is that nobody has the right to negotiate a property right in this country other than the owner of that property right.  I ask that the committee examine that.  The members should not be blinded by the cost to the State for the State has an obligation to defend the property rights of its citizens, regardless of what it costs.  I ask that when the members go into private session they do not examine the issue from the point of view of what it will cost the State or the fact that there was an agreement for there was no agreement with these men.  There is no agreement with anyone who had their rights negotiated unless they were balloted at the time by the trade union making that agreement.  These men were not balloted.  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute.</p></speech>

Deputy Jack Chambers and I have had an opportunity to speak to them previously and it was very beneficial.  Looking at this from a first principles aspect, Mr. Morris worked in the Garda for 11 years, Mr. Shanley worked for ten years and Mr. Hynes worked for 14 years.  It is very unfair that people who worked in the public sector for those periods of time end up with no pension whatsoever.  There is a history to this dating back to negotiations that took place very many years ago, but we need to ask what we can practically do for the witnesses.  I am not making a party political point but the reality is that it is impossible for us, as Oireachtas Members, to change the law on this issue without Government support because there will be a money Bill and we need the support of Government in order to do that.</p> <p>  What we need to do, and I have said this to the gentlemen previously, is identify the number of people who are affected by this at present.  Unfortunately, because of the length of time this has gone on for, the numbers must be quite low.  I note what Senator Craughwell said about the cost being irrelevant.</p><p>However, there is still a benefit in trying to identify what would be the cost, even for the three witnesses present, if their pension entitlements were returned to them.  It may be the case that we do not achieve a change in the law - we can discuss afterwards what approach we wish to take - but it seems as though the State has previously operated <i>ex gratia</i>payment schemes for individuals deserving of having money refunded to them by the State.  The State might consider the option that a payment should be made to the small number of individuals who, through no agreement on their own part, ended up having their pensions taken away from them.<br/><br/>I do not have questions because we spoke previously.  I got thorough answers from the witnesses previously.<br/><br/>I commend them on their attendance.  I thank them for their years of service to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are conscious that other members who are not before us here are in a similar position.  If we could identify the numbers and the cost and then seek an <i>ex gratia</i>payment scheme from the State, I would have thought this would be a unanswerable cause.</p></speech>

I commend them on coming before the committee.</p> <p>  To update the witnesses, as I said I would last week, I contacted the Department of Justice and Equality, which has referred the matter to the Garda Commissioner to get the detailed information to which Deputy O'Callaghan is referring in order that we get the cost and the numbers and hopefully, present a case that delivers something for them.  The principle of a social contract that underpins the model in the State is that when one pays into something, there should be reciprocity in return.  The State is failing to honour its side, as Senator Craughwell mentioned, and it is important that we try to vindicate their situation.  I will continue to represent the witnesses' concern and will work with them over the summer to get the detailed information and hopefully will forward and progress their case in order that they see some return in the future.</p> <p>  It is unfair that they have been failed by all, by the body that previously was meant to represent them and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Given they are being wrangled by statute and the property rights, as seen in precedent, and they have been limited in a legal context, it is important that the Oireachtas and politics should respond in a fair manner.  This committee will do so.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming before us.  We will try to continue to help them.</p></speech>

The principle of nothing about us without us is one that rings clear here.  Unfortunately, it is not isolated to this group of former garda&iacute;.  Obviously, the rights of many retired citizens have been given away without their knowledge or without their agreement by an organisation, albeit the GRA.  In this instance, it was very much behind closed doors but we had recent examples of thousands of workers, for example, airport workers, seeing their current pensions or deferred pensioners' rights eroded by others who sat around the table.  It is utterly scandalous.  It shows there must be a right of representation for retired members in any situation that affects their livelihood.  This example brings it forward clearly.</p> <p>  I have two points.  It is not for the first time that what Senator Conway called a cosy agreement was made by the GRA against its own members behind closed doors.  It seems to be pretty good at that but it is unfortunate that these witnesses are paying the price of it.</p> <p>  The only aspect I want to bring out, which is important, is it seems the refund is a bit of a red herring.  Are they basically saying that had one retired on 2 October 1976, for example, and had one got one's superannuation back, one still would have no problem in applying for and getting a pension, albeit that a refund of any contribution there might have been needed?  In that sense, it is neither here nor there.  If that is what is blocking it, then presumably that can be organised.  The main point is the disgracefulness of any people paying in and meeting all of the requirements of a scheme to which they were parties only for that to change years later without their knowledge and for them to find out subsequently.</p> <p>  What I do not understand - maybe it is a legal question - is whether the Statute of Limitation kicks in when one gets knowledge of something.  It is a live problem the airport workers are looking at.  Does the clock of the Statute of Limitations kick in when one becomes aware of something?  I am not saying one should have to go through litigation but I am curious about it.</p></speech>

It must be so frustrating for them to have had no choice in what they would have liked to have happen.  I can imagine that must be the most difficult part of this issue.

In their service of 11, ten and 14 years, respectively, they have combined service of 35 years.  It is a sad reflection on the State that men who put their lives on the line to defend and secure the State and its citizens are now here publicly having to make a case for what should be a legitimate expectation to have some benefits of pension.</p> <p>  Clearly, the members of the committee in private session will make decisions.  I am mindful of what Deputy O'Callaghan said.  It is important that out of all this there are solutions.  One can continue discussing this issue but this is about fairness.  This is the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and this is about fairness and justice.  I met each of the three individuals in the past few weeks.  The witnesses have clearly and ably demonstrated in their presentations before the committee there has been an injustice and an unfairness.  It is clear they have been obliged to come here and unburden and share their personal financial situation and experiences to drive this case forward.  They have had a denial of their pension rights.  I believe they had a legitimate expectation to the benefits of that.</p> <p>  I appeal to the committee - it is ultimately a matter for members - but there is a real need for redress here.  This is clearly statute-barred but if there is good will in the State in terms of its support for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, past, present or retired, it should be acknowledged.  I will raise two or three questions.  Deputy O'Callaghan made the point on quantifying issues.  My understanding is there are fewer than 80 persons involved and we are not talking about a large amount of people.  The witnesses might confirm that.</p> <p>  Second, Mr. Shanley refers in his submission to Dr. Michael Woods, I presume, the former Minister for Education and Science, who inadvertently missed applying for a pension entitlement by the due date and had his pension rights retrospectively restored under section 16 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007.  Clearly, if one had read that, as I read it today, one would have been encouraged at the idea that one could have some sort of retrospection.  The witnesses might just confirm that.</p> <p>  It might be helpful for the committee at some stage were the witnesses to share their legal opinion.  It is my understanding, I am open to correction by them, that they sought a legal opinion from then senior counsel, Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan, now of the Court of Appeal.</p><p>He stated that because of the lapse of time, the Members of the Oireachtas ought in justice to rectify this wrong by means of enactment of legislation to cater for the very discrete category of pre-1976 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I ask the witnesses to confirm this is correct.  It might be helpful for their case if the witnesses shared as much legal advice as possible.<br/><br/>This is important because it is about fairness and justice.  I appeal to the committee to make a case for an <i>ex gratia</i>payment, and perhaps an interim payment if this will be a long drawn out process.  These are men in their retired years.  They need to put this case to bed.  They have made a very good case, and I appeal to the committee to give it consideration and make a recommendation for a redress scheme because it has to be short.  If the Minister for Justice and Equality needs a little more time to take advice I would go so far as to call on the committee to ask that he would consider an interim payment to these men and other people involved in the campaign.  I thank the Chairman, and I particularly thank the three former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for sharing their personal stories and experiences with the Oireachtas today.</p></speech>

There is no doubt they have not been treated fairly, and if they were looking for a whole lot more money, they might have got more fairness by now.  It is all very well to speak about fairness and justice, and the witnesses have been denied both, but they can be assured they are not alone in this.  Many people have been denied fairness and justice in this country over the years.  The truth is the amount does matter to the State and the Government of the day.  Before any legislation can come to a committee for amendment, a money message, which is a financial resolution, must be delivered, which states more or less the Government is okay with the fact it will cost a certain amount of money and it has an estimate of what this would be.  Do the witnesses have the potential to be able to tell the State how much it could cost as a minimum and maximum?  Can they put a figure on it, because the State will want to know?  To say this should not be the case is true, and I agree.  The witnesses should not have to do it, but to get it past the Government of the day it would be helpful if a maximum figure could be put on it as to how much it would cost the State, because it wants to know.  We can ask ourselves whether a price can be put on a drug that will give someone an opportunity who has problems to live with dignity.  The State will only pay so much, and there will be a figure above which it will not go, and this is the sad reality of life.  Do witnesses have the wherewithal to be able to tell the State it will not cost any more than a particular amount?</p></speech>

If a member has passed away, are there any entitlements for his or her spouse with regard to access to that pension?</p></speech>

I can advise that we will address what steps we can take.  I have to underscore for the witnesses that we only have the power of recommendation.  We do not have the power of deciding what will or will not happen.  That ultimately rests with the Minister of the day.  The power of recommendation is within our gift and we will consider the case that the witnesses have presented here today when we go into private session.</p> <p>  I thank all three witnesses.

I also thank everyone for the amendments they have tabled.  Whether I agree with them or not, I appreciate the thought and care they have put into their amendments.</p><p>I do not have an opening statement as such.  I have spoken extensively in the D&aacute;il about my Bill so all of the Members are aware of the purpose of my legislation.  The purpose, in my view, is simply to reduce the timeframe for when somebody can apply for a divorce to two years out of the preceding three years instead of four years out of the preceding five years.  I advocate that we leave the other conditions of divorce, such as proper provision and no reasonable prospect of reconciliation, in the Constitution.</p><p>Last year I was elected a Deputy after having worked for 20 years in family law.  In fact, I qualified in 1997, which is the year that divorce was put on the Statute Book.  The legislation and I have been on a journey together.  When I first arrived here I thought about what I could bring to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in terms of the knowledge and experience that I had gleaned in the area of family law, and specifically separation and divorce.  It is important for me to say that.</p><p>I have endeavoured to strike a balance in my Private Members' Bill between what is a fair and reasonable proposal and what can be achieved by referendum.  We can lose sight of our goals when we are overly ambitious.  I appreciate that amendments may be tabled that propose to take this provision out of the Constitution.  I am not sure about that but I am open to listening to discussions on the matter.  I know that the Minister of State will have his own views and views from the Government's perspective in terms of Report Stage.</p><p>I have looked at all of the research that is available in all of the other jurisdictions.  I went into great detail in the D&aacute;il about the time limit of two years that exists in other jurisdictions.  I am not sure that the Irish people are completely ready for this provision to be taken out of the Constitution.  We are Irish and the institution of marriage is ingrained in our society.  Over three decades ago Garret FitzGerald tried to introduce divorce in 1986 but the referendum was not passed.  John Bruton introduced divorce legislation 20 years ago and the legislation passed but only by a whisker.  I have passed around my editorial from the <i>Irish Journal of Family Law</i>, which goes into this matter in more detail.</p><p>Thousands of people have gone through separation or divorce.  I am not separated myself.  As I said in my speech in the D&aacute;il,  I believe I have been happily married for 15 years but I have first-hand experience from dealing with clients who have gone through the process.  The one thing that I have heard in the Oireachtas is that there is a wish to get this legislation over the line by referendum.  If I succeed then I will feel that I have helped many thousands of people.</p><p>Divorce affects families and children, in particular.  My Private Members' Bill strikes the correct balance to gain cross-party support and the support of the general public.  The Iona Institute, for example, holds certain views about divorce but it agrees with my Bill.  I am happy to answer questions and I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State and other contributors have to say.  Again, I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to attend. </p></speech>

As this is a constitutional Bill we must take the Schedule first.  I must read the following into the record before inviting contributions on the amendments, and then I shall invite the Minister of State to address the Bill.  Is that in order, Minister of State?  Yes.</p> <p>  Before Committee Stage commences, I would like to deal with a procedural matter relating to Bills to amend the Constitution.   The substance of the debate on Committee Stage relates to the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment, which is contained in the Schedule to the Bill.  The sections of the Bill are merely technical.  Therefore, in accordance with long-standing practice, the sections are postponed until consideration of the Schedule has been completed.  Postponement only means that the sequence changes.  We normally take the sections first and the Schedule at the end but the procedure is reversed in this case.  </p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State to formally move, in accordance with precedence in Standing Order 151, that consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill be postponed until the Schedule shall have been disposed of.  </p></speech>

I welcome the Bill but, unfortunately, I do not have a lot of time to speak about it.  Reducing the time from four to two years is a welcome step forward.  These amendments will facilitate a discussion on the matter and other requirements.</p> <p>  Most people when they have reached the stage of seeking a divorce have been separated or their marriage has been falling apart for a long time.  The stipulation of two years is still too onerous a requirement and prevents people from moving on emotionally, financially and in many other ways.  The amendment proposes that the State "shall not require a period of time for the spouses to have lived apart from one another in excess of two years".  The reason we stipulated a time was because the Government could, potentially, add a more onerous time in the future. </p> <p>  We also do not think that a judge should have the power to say that a marriage is not over and there is still potential for a reconciliation.  We believe that provision should be removed from the Constitution.  We can legislate for issues like ensuring that children are looked after and cover the other stipulations as well.  </p></speech>

I thank Opposition members for the work and thought that they have put into this legislation.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that under Article 41.3.2<sup>o</sup>of the Constitution, as amended by the 15th amendment, a court may grant a divorce only where specific conditions have been met.  The first condition is that on the date of the institution of the divorce proceedings, the spouses have lived apart from one another for a total of at least four years during the previous five.  The second is that there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses.  The third is that proper provision exists and will be made for the spouses of either or both of them.  The final condition is that any further conditions prescribed by law are complied with.<br/><br/>We must remember that we were moving at that time to a situation where the Constitution provided unequivocally that no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage to a situation in which divorce was to become possible in Ireland for the first time but subject to very specific conditions which were set out in the new article inserted in the 15th amendment.  The purpose of the mandatory period of living apart was to ensure that divorce would not be available on an easy or casual basis, to address fears that what was termed a &ldquo;divorce culture&rdquo; would develop in Ireland.<br/><br/>Deputies will recall that the Government supported Deputy Madigan&rsquo;s Bill on Second Stage.  It believes that shortening the living apart period required by article  41.3.2<sup>o</sup>of the Constitution would enable couples whose marriages had broken down to regularise their affairs sooner and reduce the legal costs involved.  Couples would be less likely to need to apply for a judicial separation while waiting to become eligible to apply for divorce.  The implementing legislation required to reduce the living apart period from four to two years would be a straightforward amendment to section 5(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996, which sets out the living apart required to obtain a divorce.<br/><br/>However, now that more than 20 years have passed since the introduction of divorce in Ireland the Government believes it would be appropriate to re-examine all the provisions of Article  41.3.2<sup>o</sup>of the Constitution.  As I explained to the House on Second Stage, the Government is of the view that it should be open to proposing the removal of the specific conditions set out in Article  41.3.2<sup>o</sup>that must be satisfied before a court can grant divorce.  This would not be intended to take away the regulation of divorce and matters associated with it.  It would mean that the conditions for granting of divorce will be prescribed by Act of the Oireachtas and not in the Constitution.  The Government has agreed to bring forward amendments to this Bill to propose such a constitutional amendment.  The Department of Justice and Equality is working with the Office of the Attorney General to formulate an appropriate working for the amendments.  Unfortunately, it was not possible for the drafting of ministerial amendments to be completed and the Government approval secured in advance of last week&rsquo;s deadline for submission of amendments for Committee Stage of this Bill.  I therefore propose at this stage to outline the Government&rsquo;s current intentions regarding the Bill with a view to bringing forward amendments on Report Stage.<br/><br/>As Deputies will appreciate, given the importance of the issue and as a proposed amendment to the Constitution is involved, the utmost care must be taken in the drafting of amendments to this Bill.  This debate today in the select committee today that which took place on Second Stage will inform and assist the process of drafting suitable wording for amendments to the Bill and the contributions of Deputies in this regard are greatly appreciated.  As work on the drafting of amendments is ongoing, I am not yet in a position to put the Government&rsquo;s proposed wording before the House.  It is intended that the proposed wording will be published in advance of Report Stage when the drafting has been finalised and the proposed wording has been approved by Government.  If the conditions for divorce specified in Article  41.3.2<sup>o</sup>of the Constitution are removed, then the Oireachtas will be free to determine and set out in legislation the conditions which must be met before a court can grant a divorce.  Of course, in exercising its power to legislate in this area, the Oireachtas must have regard to, and legislate in accordance with, the other provisions of the Constitution, in particular the fundamental rights provisions and Articles 40 and 44.  Of central importance will be the constitutional obligation under Article  41.3.2<sup>o</sup>to protect the family in its constitution and authority and, under article 41.3.1<sup>o</sup>, to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded and protect it against attack.  For example, in the unlikely event of the Oireachtas enacting legislation which allowed a spouse to end a marriage by unilateral decision without any adjudicative process, that provision might well be successfully challenged by reason of failure to protect the institution of marriage against attack.  <br/><br/>I will now comment on the amendments tabled by Deputies.  The effect of the amendments tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly would be that Article  41.3.2<sup>o</sup>would no longer provide for the minimum living apart period.  The Oireachtas could legislate for any minimum period it saw fit or could decide that no minimum period should be required.  The other constitutional requirements, that only a court may grant a divorce where there is no prospect of reconciliation and that there will be a proper provision for the spouses and children, would continue in force.  The intention and effect of this amendment is very clear and my Department would have regard to the proposed head put forward by Deputies Daly and Wallace in its work on amendments for Report Stage.  <br/><br/>The amendments put forward by Deputies Ruth Coppinger, Mick Barry and Paul Murphy are much more far-reaching in that they would not only remove all the conditions currently specified in Article  41.3.2<sup>o</sup>but would also take away the constitutional requirement that the divorce can only be granted by a court.  The amendments also propose that the maximum living apart period that could be specified in legislation would be two years.  At present, Article  41.3.2<sup>o</sup>makes clear that only a court designated by law may grant the dissolution of marriage.  This requirement protects the institution of marriage by ensuring that marriage can only be dissolved following a due and proper judicial process.  For that reason it would be desirable to retain that requirement in Article  41.3.2<sup>o</sup>.  On that basis the Government will not favour the wording of Deputy Coppinger&rsquo;s proposed amendment.</p></speech>

It is very laudable and I appreciate that it comes from her own experiences of dealing with family law and the emotional and financial strain that accompanies the process.  It is very positive that we have a chance to do something to change that situation.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s points would indicate that the Government will substantially change what Deputy Madigan had put forward.  It is unfortunate that we are not able to deal with that in detail on Committee Stage because our preferred option would be to see this pass all Stages so that we could put it to the people.  I am not sure if there is a timescale for that.</p> <p>  I note the Minister of State's comments but our point is that there should be no restriction on time in the Constitution.  It is that simple.  Even a two year wait means that couples will still have to resort to a judicial separation in order to bring legal clarity to many different matters.  By putting it at two years, there could be a situation where people have to go through two separate legal processes to achieve the same outcome.  By putting the other stipulations, and we did leave them in, the other conditions are still there and we felt that they gave the safety valve that the Minister of State referred to, where people agree and want to part and they meet those conditions.  No one will be forced into a situation where they would be divorced against their will or that there would be overnight divorces or anything like that.  There are enough safeguards in the Bill already by keeping those conditions, although I was interested to hear the Minister of State refer to eliminating those conditions in their entirety, which would be even better.  We would also be open to that but then the Oireachtas would have to legislate around that.</p> <p>  There is no reason for a waiting time in the Constitution itself.  It is not a proper arena in which to micromanage social issues.  Keeping a two-year waiting period will prevent any amendment to the divorce legislation that would alter that situation.  It would tie the hands of the Oireachtas in that regard.  Take the example of where there was a no waiting period in cases where one partner was abusive or violent.  That is a common feature of divorce law elsewhere, including Europe and Canada, and our amendment would provide for that.  We could have a six month or a one year waiting period in legislation if there is a danger that a no-wait time could lead to abuse, for instance in a case where there is a wealthier spouse who knows his or her partner cannot afford to go through expensive litigation, or something similar where one spouse would be able to ride roughshod over the other in legal proceedings.  That would not require a no-wait period in the Constitution.  Why would we put an obligation on people who are unhappy if they both agree that they want to sever?  Why would we force them to be shackled together any longer than they need to be to have all the protections put in place?  There will never be a provision for overnight divorces.  One still has to go through serving papers, await a court date, have the court sanction that divorce and so on.  A number of states across Europe, by mutual consent or otherwise, have no waiting time or much shorter times.</p></speech>

There are, however, a number of issues with it.  The main issue is that the Bill proposes to change the time period during which people must live apart from each other.  The current situation, which goes back to 1996, is that people have to live apart from each other for four out of the previous five years.  That was introduced for a particular reason at that time and was put in the amendment in order to assist it being passed.  When we consider how close the vote was at that point, the amendment probably would not have passed otherwise.  However, it was done for a particular purpose.  We are now of the view, however, that it is cruel to force people to wait for four years or so before they can get on with their lives on a more formal basis.  Life is short.  People should be entitled to move on from previous relationships and enter into new marriages quickly.</p> <p>  That said, there is a benefit to having a time period in the Constitution.  People will not, of course, seek to get divorced overnight.  The situation in England is that people have to be apart for two years before a divorce can be granted.  There is a benefit to that and it protects the institution of marriage.  One could argue that it should perhaps be one year.  A complete absence of any time period in the Constitution would, if not undermine, certainly diminish the value of marriage, which Irish people have shown they value and believe is an institution that should be supported.</p> <p>  In terms of the detail of the text, the proposed change, as I said, is the change from four to two years.  As well as that, Deputy Madigan has introduced new words into the Schedule.  At present, it states that the spouses have lived apart from one another for the required time period but Deputy Madigan's proposal states that the spouses have lived separate and apart from one another for a period of two years.  I would be interested to hear from her the reason for the inclusion of the word "separate".  Words in the Constitution mean something.  A court looking at this will conclude that the Oireachtas and the people carefully decided to include this particular word and will thus give it meaning.  We might be better off leaving the word "separate" out of this Bill but it may have a special purpose.  In the Irish version, which is always given pre-eminence, the reference is to "ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; ar leith".  This is a new meaning to "ar leith", which usually means special.  We need clarity on the reason for the inclusion of the word "separate".</p> <p>  In terms of the amendments, on balance, when we are considering a constitutional amendment Bill, we cannot only consider what it is we want.  We also have to consider whether it will get through the people.  I think Deputy Madigan's proposal would succeed in a referendum.  I would be concerned, however, that the removal of any time period from the Bill would jeopardise that.  It would generate a big campaign against it.  I think people would be able to state it completely undermines marriage because it gives no protection given that people must live apart from each other for a period of time.  On balance, and notwithstanding the issue with the word "separate", I like how the Bill is drafted at present and I will probably not be supporting the amendments.</p></speech>

In my experience, applicants for a divorce - the Deputy will know this - have to give evidence to a judge in either the Circuit Court or the High Court to prove whether or not they have been living separate and apart for a period of four out of the proceeding five years.  This can be when they are living under the same roof.  I included the word so as to try to ensure some clarity around this.  The applicants generally have to give evidence to the judge that they have lived completely separate lives.  During the recession, as we know, many separated people were forced to continue living together.  Even now, many cannot afford to rent, take out mortgages on or furnish two separate houses.  Applicants have to give evidence that they have not been acting as man and wife and do not have normal marital relations.  They might have to prove, for example, that they do not wash each other's clothes or eat or socialise together.  They may co-parent their children but this does necessarily mean acting as a married couple.  In my experience over a number of years, there is a question mark over that.  Couples can sometimes collude in living separate lives so as to shorten the time period, claiming that they were living separate and apart when they were not.  The inclusion of the word is intended to clarify this matter because judges sometimes find it tricky.</p></speech>

I fully support it, having been involved in the two original divorce referenda, in particular the successful second one.  Irish people have a particular way of looking at issues.  Referenda, in particular, can be very divisive.  Issues which may not have even entered the minds of those drafting a constitutional referendum can become major issues during the course of a referendum campaign.  In particular, I welcome the almost surgical approach in Deputy Madigan's Bill.  Everybody in the Oireachtas and most people in Irish society would agree that the current time provision is both onerous and completely out of keeping with modern thinking.  Shortening that provision would be very welcome.  In as much as I might support an even shorter period of time, in order to prevent what I mentioned earlier, namely, the possibility that this proposal become bogged down in unforeseen circumstances, the inclusion of time period is the best way to go.</p> <p>  I do not support the amendments proposed.  I support what Deputy Madigan has proposed, in particular on the basis of the work she has obviously put in to ensure the support of a cross-section of groups.  Even if it is my own view that a set time period should never have been included in the Constitution to begin with, the complete removal of such a period at this point will result in a delay for the people who will be most aided by this particular change.  This is something I would like to see implemented as soon as possible, so I support the Bill.</p></speech>

As we can see from the current constitutional context, the required period is indeed too long.  It is unfair that we are putting so many families through this constitutional threshold.  As Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned, people's lives are short and we should not impose this on them.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  My first is for the Minister of State.  What would be the timeline for a referendum on this?  When does he envisage this happening?  My next question picks up on Deputy O'Callaghan's point.  The wording has now been extended to say "separate and apart".  Are we really increasing the already difficult constitutional threshold of proof around the word "apart" by adding "separate"?  Would it be better to put "separate or apart" in the proposed provision?  We might be making judicial interpretations of the amendment even more difficult if this is passed.  Not only would applicants have to prove that they are apart, they would also have to prove that they are separate.  As Deputy Brophy mentioned, we need to be very careful that we do not increase the difficulties facing people and to ensure this is workable in a court of law.</p></speech>

No time limit in the Constitution would prevent a time limit being put into legislation.  Regardless of the time limit, the Constitution would still provide that a divorce could only be granted if there was no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation, such provisions as made by the court having regard to the children, so we were keeping all that.  That would negate any sort of idea that this would be a free for all with everybody carrying on.  It relates to the point that there are a number of people who collude with each other to shorten the timeframe.  What does that tell us?  It tells us that having a time limit is completely arbitrary and it depends on the circumstances.  We want to ensure that nobody is ridden roughshod over or does not have his or her rights protected.  I have colluded with people in that as well.  They want to move on with their lives.  They are paying in respect of two separate legal processes.  They are going through a judicial separation and are then going through the same thing in a divorce later on when they could do it in one go.  Attitudes in Ireland have moved on and people are more responsible.  In a debate around that, we could make those points rationally and say that the time limit is gone, but that does not mean it cannot be prescribed in legislation, and that all these other safeguards are there and that they are the most important things.</p><p> The Minister of State complicated it because we were doing it like that.  That is the point we want to make in regard to whatever completely new Bill comes back on Report Stage.  I am bit confused about that.</p></speech>

One question Deputy Chambers raised earlier concerns the timing of a referendum.  Section 10 of the Referendum Act requires that a polling day order be made by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government as soon as the Bill is passed by the Houses.  Polling must not be earlier than 30 days and not later than 90 days after the date of the order.  The Government must also establish a referendum commission.  As soon as the Bill is passed, this kicks in straightaway.  That is why it is important we make sure what we do is correct and that the question posed is well discussed and teased out.  There are always unforeseen circumstances involving any legislation or referendum, as we all know.</p> <p>  I am bit concerned that Second Stage of this Bill was taken on 6 April and we are now on Committee Stage less than three months later.  We have not had time to examine the Attorney General's advice carefully, or for the Attorney General to examine it.  It has been very fast.</p></speech>

That is why I am suggesting that we listen to what everyone has to say today, and I am doing that very carefully, and see what we will do with this on Report Stage, that is, whether we let it go through as proposed or bring forward the amendment we suggested.  The question is whether this issue needs to be dealt with in the Constitution at all or whether legislation could deal with it and make it easier to make changes as time goes on.  I take the points made by Deputies O'Callaghan, Jack Chambers, Madigan and Brophy about whether it would pass.  This is the other issue.  Would it pass in a referendum?  None of us knows that at this stage.  As with many of these issues, it would be good if there was a public consultation or discussion about this so that people could reflect on it.  I would be concerned about moving too quickly without having that public debate about this.</p> <p>  In any event, the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 makes detailed provision for the exercise by the courts of their jurisdiction to grant divorce so the only change necessary would be to reduce the time period specified in that Act.  If a referendum is held and passed, it would still require legislation to follow it.  There would be no change until a change was made in legislation.</p> <p>  The wording of the proposed text will be carefully examined in consultation with the Attorney General but the discussion today is extremely useful.  I am not proposing to accept any of the amendments but the discussion is extremely informative, useful and important.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has a concern that this could pass very quickly through the Oireachtas and the Government would then find itself holding a referendum.  That is a legitimate political concern but I am sure Deputy Madigan, members of this committee and others in the House can time it such that it is not dropped on the Government's plate.  I suppose we are in a difficult position.  Nobody is certain when the next general election will be.  If it must be within 30 or 90 days, we will not be able to do in time for a general election because the general election will be 28 days from a dissolution.</p> <p>  There will be general support for this.  I do not know the reason behind the Government saying that it must revamp the whole thing.  This is no criticism of the Minister of State but I suspect that it might be just a means of delaying this.  I am not saying the Minister of State would ever contemplate doing something like that but it just may be a means of getting it off the Government's plate for the time being.  I think the Government is better off liaising with us.  We should put it through committee.  I am sure Deputy Madigan will be considerate as to when it comes back on Report Stage.  We could try to agree a date.  There will probably be another referendum happening, so that raises the prospect of two of them on the one day.  I do not know if that would appeal to people.</p></speech>

I would not like us to be counterproductive regarding the premise of this Bill.  I would not like to see it lost somewhere in the ether and I would like to see it progress.  I take on board everybody's comments.  Obviously, it is not all my say anyway.  Clearly, we have the Government and the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il.</p> <p>  In case my words came across wrongly, I am not saying people collude in divorces but one of the reasons applicants must give evidence in court is to avoid collusion.  Again, this goes back to "separate and apart" so living apart and living separate are different things in the eyes of the judge.  We are talking about a couple being separated for a period of time rather just living apart because a couple could live apart under the same roof but it involves specifying that distinction between separate and apart.  That is why I think it should be left in.</p></speech>

We can talk about it again but we do not have to get into the minutiae of it.  It places a greater onus, which it must, because going back to the issue of collusion, we do not want people living under the same roof saying that they are separated when they are not.  If they have to give evidence, they will be perjuring themselves if they give the wrong evidence to the judge, so it is more about preventing that.</p></speech>

Obviously, I am not a guru on this either.  I have my own experience and I have colleagues who work in this area.  When I looked at the research, I saw that most countries have a period of around two years.  Given that the end of a marriage is like bereavement for people, and I dealt with that in my speech, those involved are like rabbits caught in a headlight.  It is too soon for them to make a decision about property, children and pensions, so that is why the time period is there.  After about a year, they come out of the fog.</p><p>They would then be in a good place to deal with financial or more difficult aspects.  That is the rationale.</p></speech>

I expect this Bill and the discussion we had today will lead to further comment in the public domain, and it is important to hear what other actors have to say about this.  That is why pre-legislative scrutiny is sometimes useful for topics like this.  There may be other unforeseen consequences that we may not pick up.  I am not sure if the committee is in a position to do something like that at any stage.</p> <p>  This is a very important piece of legislation and it is important we reflect on it.  We on the Government side intend to do that.  I have put forward one scenario.  As I stated, we are very keen to hear what everyone else has to say on this.  That is why today's discussion has been so useful.  The question is whether it should be in the Constitution at all at this stage and whether the Legislature could be trusted to legislate.  The Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 is on the Statute Book and it flowed from the earlier referendum and changes to family law.  It is all there.  That law can be amended at any time by the Oireachtas, provided it is in sync with the constitutional requirements.  That is what we are looking at.</p> <p>  I take the points raised by people as to whether the electorate would be of a mind to allow the Oireachtas to legislate without having any constitutional controls.  We must consider if that would be desirable or the right thing to do.  It is something on which to reflect.  There are serious issues and I know there is agreement in the committee that the Bill, as such, is not opposed.  Some are proposing further examination or going a little further.  We will bring the decisions to the House on Report Stage.</p></speech>

This committee was very anxious to facilitate its earliest address and the Deputy's colleagues will be able to confirm that it is exactly what we have done.  I do not sense a difference in view in terms of the objective she has set out, including the pathway and methodology.  I would personally be sympathetic to divorce being dealt with in legislation rather than in the Constitution.  It is a valid question.  There was a reference that this was raising the bar, making the subject separate and apart, and this must be explored a little bit.  I favour the reduction in the period from four to two years but at the same time I would not like to see greater difficulty being put in place.  That is something for members to tease out in the period from here to Report Stage.  As it stands, I welcome and support the passage of the Deputy's Bill through Committee Stage and I wish it fair wind for the rest of its journey.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 4 refers to the Schedule but it cannot be moved.  The amendment was from Deputies Coppinger, Barry and Paul Murphy.  If she could not remain, another member of the grouping would have to make the proposition but they are not represented on the committee.  She will be able to raise that on Report Stage and pursue it in the normal course.  I note the Schedule is opposed by Deputies Daly and Wallace.  We have discussed the grouping and the Deputies will be able to record that opposition.</p></speech>

The Bill passed all Stages in the House last night and enjoyed cross-party support, which is welcome.  There is an urgency to the legislation, as communicated to us by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>The legislation had to be passed by a specific date so pre-legislative scrutiny did not take place, by consent.

I look forward to working with him and the committee in the months and, hopefully, years ahead.  I thank the committee for handing me on a Minister of State who has been in a very good training ground here for the past year.</p> <p>  As the Chairman said, the Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad last night.  I am grateful to the committee for allowing it to pass without pre-legislative scrutiny and, therefore, enabling it to reach the President on time for an early signature.  I also thank the committee for the all-party nature of the support the Bill has had throughout its passage.  This does not mean it has not had a great degree of examination and, indeed, criticism in quarters, which is very welcome.  Generally the enthusiasm for the project has been cross-party and is very welcome.</p> <p>  As the committee knows, Ireland is bidding to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023, and has so far completed two of three phases, the applicant phase and the candidate phase, and is now in the evaluation phase.  The Rugby World Cup is one of the largest global sporting events after the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup.  It is held every four years, with the next tournament to be played in Japan in 2019.  It has grown substantially since its inauguration in 1987, and is expected to continue to grow in the future.</p> <p>  A successful bid for the Rugby World Cup would be a wonderful opportunity to promote tourism.  There would be very considerable tourism potential as it would take place during Ireland's shoulder season for overseas tourism, between mid-September and late October.  It is estimated that the tournament would draw approximately 450,000 visitors, who would spend approximately &euro;760 million.  Based on F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates, this would provide a return to the Exchequer of &euro;138 million.</p> <p>  There would be many other benefits to the country, not least the profile received through television coverage of the tournament across the world and the exposure the country would get through the thousands of visiting media.  In terms of community involvement, the event has the potential to involve thousands of volunteers, building volunteering capacity for future events.  A parallel programme of festivals and cultural events would make the most of the opportunity to extend visits and enhance the image of Ireland.  There would also be extensive business networking and other business opportunities.  In addition, hosting a Rugby World Cup on the island of Ireland would provide a great cultural experience for communities all over the country, with the opportunity to host teams from places as diverse as Tonga, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand and Argentina.</p> <p>  The tournament would also be a great platform for the promotion of sport and physical activity, vital to the physical and mental health of the nation.  Of its nature, a successful joint tournament would depend upon mutual co-operation between North and South, between now and 2023, to deliver this major project.  Hosting the Rugby World Cup in 2023 has the potential to send a powerful message of co-operation across the island to a global audience.</p> <p>  As part of the bidding process, Rugby World Cup Limited is seeking the support of the Government to stage the tournament in 2023, including a number of guarantees and underwrites, which have to be submitted in final signed form by 31 July.  These are guarantee of the payment of the tournament fee, underwriting the tournament budget and an undertaking in regard to the support of public services for the tournament.  Templates of these draft guarantees were issued by Rugby World Cup Limited on 7 April this year.  The State, with the support of NewERA, is discussing these drafts with Rugby World Cup Limited and final versions are due to be agreed and signed by 31 July.  Separately the Government has decided to underwrite any bid for commercial rights.</p> <p>  As committee members know, the Bill went through the D&aacute;il last Thursday and was in the Seanad last night, where it passed all Stages.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to provide the guarantees and undertakings as part of the bid and, if the bid is successful, to enable the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to support the staging of the tournament.</p> <p>  I regret that the legislation came to the Oireachtas so late.  At an earlier stage of planning for Rugby World Cup 2023, the preliminary legal advice was that legislation was not likely to be required in respect of the State's contribution to a company that might be established in relation to hosting Rugby World Cup 2023.  However, after further examination, the Office of the Attorney General advised in early May that express statutory authority through the passing of primary legislation is necessary for a Minister to provide capital support to a tournament company and to provide the necessary guarantees and underwrites to Rugby World Cup Limited.  This is based on the judgment of the Attorney General that there is no specific statutory power for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to expend money or give guarantees directly on a unique major sporting event such as the Rugby World Cup 2023.  Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, the advice is that express statutory authority is required.  This authority must be in place before the Minister signs the guarantees.  This means the Bill has to become law before 31 July.</p> <p>  As the members of the committee know, we are in an international bidding competition with France and South Africa.  All bids submitted are confidential, including the budgets proposed.  Given that we are in this position I am, unfortunately, not able to share every detail of the bid with the committee.  That said, I want to outline the key asks of Government.  Payment of the tournament fee, which is &pound;120 million, with 5% on award and the remainder after the tournament, would be shared with Northern Ireland, and the total cost would be net of receipt of the projected surplus from the tournament company.  Separately, the operational side of the tournament, including the projected investment in stadia, would be funded by ticket revenue.  This would start to come onstream in 2022, and in the preceding years the tournament company would be funded by commercial loan.  In the event there are cashflow challenges that cannot be met from this arrangement, the Minister could loan funds to the company.  As I said, this is for cashflow purposes and does not change the financial outcome of the company.  These funds would be repaid to Government.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, the Governments of the bidding countries have been asked to underwrite the proposed tournament operational budget.  This underwrite would only be called upon if the ticket revenue did not cover the tournament costs, and then only for that element not covered by the ticket revenue.  The entire cost would only be become liable if the tournament went ahead with zero revenue.  The current projection is that the tournament will make a substantial surplus.  The exact budget figure Ireland has submitted is commercially sensitive, but I can tell the committee that Rugby World Cup Limited has provided bidders with an indicative budget of &pound;200 million and the Irish bid is in the region of that figure.  This budget includes the cost of operating the tournament and stadia upgrades.</p> <p>  The Government's proposed underwrite would also be supported by Northern Ireland and is capped at the level of the bid budget.  The committee may also be interested to know that cancellation insurance is also taken out by the tournament company.  Rugby World Cup Limited, like all international sporting bodies, also needs to know that the wider environment, such as infrastructure, legal context and security provision, will be sufficient to host the tournament on the island of Ireland.  Accordingly, it has sought undertakings from the Governments that the island has the necessary requirements in place.</p> <p>  Separately, Rugby World Cup Limited has made a number of tournament commercial rights on offer to bidders, which are travel and hospitality, licensing and selected sponsorship categories.  Broadcasting rights are not on offer.  It is open to the bidders to submit a bid to acquire the rights they believe would provide the best return.  A bidding process is taking place and Ireland may acquire some of these rights.  </p> <p>  Working closely with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive, the Government has been examining the case for hosting for over four years now.</p><p>The initial feasibility study was carried out by Deloitte in 2013 and was examined by Departments and agencies, North and South.  A cross-Border working group spent six months in 2014 considering that study and the experience of recent world cups in France and New Zealand, identifying additional costs and risks, and conducting sensitivity analyses.  That report produced a revised and more conservative estimate of the impact of hosting but, taking all factors into account, it found it would still be a very positive experience for this island.  After consideration of that report, the Government decided to support the bid in December 2014.</p><p> After work by the Irish Rugby Football Union IRFU, external expertise and Government Departments and agencies, the Government again reviewed the project and approved the submission of the applicant phase bid in August 2016.  All figures had been re-examined and updated, including a re-assessment of stadia investment requirements, and also took into account the evaluation of the impact of the Rugby World Cup in England in 2015.  Since November of last year, the candidate phase bid has been put together.  The formal bid to host the Rugby World Cup was submitted on 1 June 2017.  The candidate phase itself was very intensive and, again, all aspects of the bid were re-examined and the financial model updated.  These figures were submitted to and considered by Government in May and it approved the bid.  This examination has involved internal and external expertise, taking into account the impact of Rugby World Cups in other countries and has been considered by Government on three separate occasions.</p><p> Hosting the Rugby World Cup in 2023 is a unique opportunity for Ireland.  It would be of great benefit to the country, from profile, tourism, sporting, and community perspectives and this Bill enables the Government to fully support it.  It is because the bid has been examined now for an extended time period that we are confident of the case for hosting and of the strength of the bid.  I am happy to take any questions members of the committee might have.  I hope the committee is aware that I amended the Bill in the D&aacute;il to ensure that any subsequent Ministers and I, while I am here, would report to this committee every six months.  That was in response to an amendment proposed by Deputy Imelda Munster.  I will, as long as I am here, be reporting to the committee on progress every six months, particularly on the financial situation.</p></speech>

I will clarify one issue initially, if I may.  I understood that the Minister would be here until 11 a.m., but he informed me that he may have to go at 10 a.m.  Notwithstanding the normal process that we have here, if we go to the full 15 minutes or the group times, the Minister will not be able to answer questions.  If it is possible to do it this way - and this is in the committee's hands - every member could take five minutes, and be taken in groups of three.  If we are not finished, I ask the Minister to wait until everybody has spoken.  It would split his time and he would leave at 10 a.m., but everybody would get an equal opportunity.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment as Minister of State.</p> <p>  This is huge for the island of Ireland.  I was chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  At our plenary in Dublin two years ago, we visited the Garden of Remembrance and Croke Park.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly comprises members of the House of Commons, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and many other jurisdictions along with our own Seanad and D&aacute;il.  We proposed ourselves that the Rugby World Cup would be located on the island of Ireland.  It was agreed unanimously by all members.  We wrote to the Taoiseach at the time.  I like to believe that was very powerful, and everything helps.  I congratulate the Minister on moving this forward.  I do not think people fully realise how significant this is, not just for the Republic, but for the island of Ireland.  2023 will be an amazing feat and an incredible amount of work has to be done.</p> <p>  I have a question on one issue which I have been closely involved with.  We talked about having the Olympics in this country as well.  There is an opportunity, as far as I am aware.  The Commonwealth Games were supposed to be in Durban in South Africa in 2022.  That has been cancelled and I believe there is a golden opportunity now for the island of Ireland, with the Northern Ireland Executive, to locate the Commonwealth Games in Belfast.  As an island, on an all-Ireland basis, we could use all our facilities to accommodate that.  I understand that, in the next few months, a decision will be made in the United Kingdom.  Maybe the Commonwealth Games will be located in Manchester or Liverpool or such, but I believe this is a wonderful opportunity for the Northern Ireland Executive or Ms Arlene Foster and others to try to locate the games in Belfast.  The island of Ireland could work together to locate the Commonwealth Games.  I say this because that is in 2022.  I think it would be a wonderful opportunity, and the Commonwealth Games are probably bigger than the Rugby World Cup.  I ask the Minister to use his offices to liaise with the Northern Ireland Executive to try to locate the Commonwealth Games on the island of Ireland in 2022.  We are a strong Republic, but that would be a great way, especially with what is happening today in Northern Ireland, to unite the island of Ireland, which the Rugby World Cup will absolutely do.  I think there is another opportunity in 2022.  We have facilities here in Croke Park, we have Loch Rynn in Leitrim where there is rowing, and I think it would be a wonderful opportunity.</p></speech>

I wish him well.  I think he has all the angles covered.  As has been stated so many times, it is a huge opportunity, and I think that it is vital that we win this and that we showcase Ireland to the rest of the world.  Money could not buy the exposure that we would get during the tournament.  I have another question on another matter.  Is the decision being made in September of this year?</p></speech>

We all very much await that and hope that the news will be good then.</p> <p>  We have a note here about a serious matter, the inquiry that the Minister set up after the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games last year and the Moran report.  I accept the explanation here that the Minister cannot publish it yet or that he has not read it, as has been said here, and that he has got legal advice from Brazil, which is with the Attorney General at present.  Will the Minister give an indication of the status of that?  This is something that I brought up at this committee back when this was set up initially.  I felt that this was going to run into the sand because of all the legal impediments that had been put up.  I fully understand that has to be done.  I understand from the notes here that the Minister is meeting with the Attorney General this week about that report and the possible publication of it.  Will the Minister give us an update on that?</p></speech>

One respects the competence of the IRFU in making this bid and we wish it every success.  We are here to ask a few questions and I thank the Minister for coming before us at short notice.</p><p>Even this bidding process is creating a feelgood factor for the country and the economy and one or two media pundits are speculating on how it got through so quickly.  How much assistance did the Cabinet receive?  When was the former Attorney General first requested to brief the Department on the need for the legislation which was passed last night?  I am not questioning the process, but there is a perception in the media as to why the Bill was left so late when the process was ongoing for four years.  It is nearly 12 months since the Government gave a letter of comfort in support of the bid.  Why, therefore, was the former Attorney General so slow in coming back with a second opinion? I will put up my hand.  I was probably one of the first to attack the Minister for rushing the legislation, but he told us in good faith last Wednesday that the former Attorney General had come back to telll him that he needed legislation.  Why did she change her mind which required this legislation to be brought before us?  That is what is causing mayhem among the public.  If it was any other legislation required to hold some other event, it would be making the headlines in of all the newspapers, but the fact is that it is creating a feel good factor in the country, which is welcome.  </p><p> The Minister has mentioned that the broadcasting rights would be outside his control.  I thought he gave an indication last Wednesday in the D&aacute;il that some matches would be broadcast free-to-air.  Will he clarify the matter?</p></speech>

It would be a perfect and wonderful opportunity to host them in Belfast, given that we are talking about cross-Border and all-island relations.  Ireland would not rejoin the Commonwealth, but it would involve an association with the Commonwealth.  Let us remember that Ireland was an active member of the Commonwealth until 1949 when it was a Fine Gael Taoiseach, John A. Costello, who took us out of it.</p></speech>

The report which I have not seen is with the Attorney General.  It was delivered to my office and without seeing it I decided to send it to the Attorney General.  Therefore, I have not read it.  I sent it to the Attorney General asking how it could be published.  In other words, its content has legal implications for various parties.  I have asked the Attorney General to come back with the best advice on how it can be published and out in the open.  That is where the matter stands.  I think my officials were briefed on it yesterday or the day before.  I have not yet spoken to them about it.  I was going to speak to them last night, but I had to take this Bill in the Seanad.  I will, therefore, speak to them today about it.  It is imminent.  It involves some tooing and frowing with the Office of the Attorney General, but it has reached the stage where it is advising on what the implications in Brazil will be in respect of certain things, about which I do not really want to talk, but we are looking at the report with a view to its publication, which is the objective.  I will probably have more news on the matter either today or tomorrow.</p></speech>

I hope not, but if we have any news, I will be quite happy to come and talk to the committee about it and outline what the implications are.</p> <p>  Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe's question concerned the legal advice and why it was received so late.  We received preliminary legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on 1 February that it was likely that legislation would not be required to allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to contribute to a new company limited by guarantee, subject to policy considerations in terms of corporate governance that would merit the introduction of legislation to govern this unique transaction.  On 3 April, as the bidding documents and draft agreements were being developed, further clarification was sought from the Attorney General and on 7 April the draft guarantees required by World Rugby were received.  We had no control over that deadline, but as soon as they were received, further advice was sought.  On 4 May legal advice was received from the Office of the Attorney General that express statutory authority was necessary.  That was the first time we had received that advice.  At no stage prior to the receipt of that advice could it have been assumed that legislation would be required.  Although there were indications as to the likely form the guarantees required would take, the actual drafts were not received from Rugby World Cup until 7 April.  The legislation has since been prepared and thoroughly examined by the Office of the Attorney General and departmental officials.  </p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about broadcasting rights.  I said in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad that they were owned by World Rugby but that under the Act all of Ireland's matches would be available free-to-air.</p></speech>

While it is a welcome opportunity, we discussed the matter at length for four hours last week in the D&aacute;il.  I do not know, therefore, whether the Minister can bring anything new to the debate.  It is worth noting that the opportunity to host one of the world's major sports events and showcase Ireland on the world stage as an all-island nation to a potential viewership of in excess of 800 million would be hugely positive.  Who would be responsible for providing the budget for running the tournament, including for stadia upgrades, security and the provision of broadband, to ensure everything would be up to speed?  On my way here this morning I saw a poster according to which the Minister with responsibility for sport was calling a public meeting to have a swimming pool reopened in his constituency.  I would certainly have concerns-----</p></speech>

When pushed on ticket pricing by several Members, he said that they will be significantly lower than was the case for the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England.  Tickets in 2015 were priced at up to &pound;300 and the average price over the full tournament was quite high.  What confirmation has the Minister had that prices will be significantly lower and what will prices be?  How can he be sure of ticket prices six years in advance of a tournament to take place in 2023?</p><p> I support what Senator O'Mahony said in relation to the Rio ticketing fiasco.  If we are to wait until September to debate that issue, it will have been 12 months from the incident occurring.  The inquiry was set up to report within 12 weeks.  It will have been 12 months.  What is the difference between now and when it was set up?  An investigation was ongoing in Rio when it was set up.  This committee was assured that every party was going to participate fully, openly and transparently with the committee and there was, therefore, no need for a statutory inquiry.  Who is now preventing the publication of the inquiry report?  Some of those the Department felt were going to participate openly and transparently are now preventing its publication and preventing Members, as elected representatives, from debating its conclusions.</p></speech>

He has given the reasons for the rushed legislation.  I again put it on the record that the last-minute approach taken is not an acceptable way to legislate, in particular for an event of this magnitude.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions regarding issues on which I am not 100% clear.  Although the Minister is very welcome to the committee, a request was made for the IRFU to attend, not the Minister, to see if any more information could be prised from it.</p></speech>

Will &euro;200 million be sufficient to do so?  Are other potential hosts asked to put forward the same amount?</p> <p>  During the D&aacute;il debate on this issue, the Minister said he will purchase and dispose of commercial rights in whatever manner he sees fit.  Could he give some clarity on what that means and will entail?</p> <p>  In terms of the Rio inquiry, he consistently argued for a non-statutory inquiry as it would be a 12-week inquiry and thus less time would be needed and all witnesses were willing to be forthright in their statements.  As other members have said, it is now almost 12 months on.  What is the hold up in that regard?</p></speech>

That is not the focus of today's discussion.  The purpose of this meeting is to drill down into the questions and answers that were perhaps skimmed over when the emergency legislation was rushed through the House.  According to the Minister's statement, Rugby World Cup Limited has provided bidders with an indicative budget of &euro;200 million and the Irish bid is in the region of that figure.  That budget includes the cost of operating the tournament and providing for stadia upgrades.  Stadia upgrades implies that the taxpayer and the State will be improving facilities that are not owned by the State.  Is it the Minister's intention to gift that money or to get it back in full or in part?  Will organisations other than the State potentially financially benefit from upgrades of a different character?</p> <p>  I welcome that all Irish matches will be broadcast free to air, as should be the case for all matches.  During the D&aacute;il debate on this issue I said that no lover of rugby or person who wants to bring his or her son or daughter to the games should be excluded because he or she does not have big wads of money in his or her pocket and that ticket prices must be fair, affordable, reasonable and inclusive.  I understand that the Minister cannot give fine detail of ticket prices at this stage because they are tied up with the bid but how does he square the circle when there is surely a perverse incentive for high ticket prices?  If the &euro;200 million outlay is to be recouped chiefly through ticket sales, it could point in the direction of higher ticket prices in order for that to be done.  How does the Minister square that circle?  Can he be more specific in relation to approximate prices?  He said in the D&aacute;il that prices will be more reasonable than for Rugby World Cup 2015 but all members know that ticket prices for that event were very much on the high side and, in some cases, astronomical.</p><p>The Minister's statement that he will pitch ticket prices lower than they were at Rugby World Cup 2015 is not much of a guarantee.  Will he be more specific and indicative?<br/><br/>This initiative must have a long-term legacy benefit to the State and rugby, which should be visible in public transport, broadband and, in particular, the clubs which nourish the grassroots of the game.  Apart from the buzz, the feel-good factor and the level of interest, will the Minister indicate how the clubs will receive concrete benefits from the Rugby World Cup should Ireland win the competition to stage it as opposed to winning the competition <i>per se</i>, although I hope we will do that also?</p></speech>

The tournament company will pay that cost, which will be part of the budget.  That cost covers all the infrastructure the Deputy indicated will be necessary.</p> <p>  I will leave the question on a swimming pool in my constituency as that is a local authority matter.  The ratio of games it is proposed to hold here versus Northern Ireland is 88:12.  A question was asked concerning responsibility in the absence of the Northern Ireland Executive.  As the Executive is not in place, power has been transferred to senior civil servants who will be able to act in place of the Executive.  A letter was received from all the main political parties pledging their support for this in the event of the Executive returning.  In the event that it does not return, I do not foresee a difficulty with this matter as the top civil servants in Northern Ireland can sign off on the deal.  We will take the primary role if the problem in Northern Ireland is not resolved.  We would then do a side deal with Northern Ireland, which would act as secondary guarantor.  We would give the full guarantee in such a scenario. </p> <p>  All members asked questions on ticket prices.  Let us be straight on this issue.  This is market-led and is meant to make a profit.  It is not intended that it will operate at a loss for anybody.  The ticket prices will be market-led but competitively priced.  Many projections have been done on this issue.  On the basis that the tickets will be competitively priced, all the projections that have been done show we should make a profit when prices are lower than at previous Rugby World Cup tournaments. </p></speech>

However, many projections have been done and, as I stated in the Seanad last night, some of them were done on the basis that some tickets would cost as little as &euro;20.</p> <p>  I was asked who is preventing publication of the report on the Rio Olympics.  It would be irresponsible to publish the report without advice from lawyers for reasons with which we are all familiar.  We do not want to prejudice matters that will take place in other jurisdictions.  I will not say any more than that on the issue. </p> <p>  Deputy Munster is quite right that it is not acceptable to legislate in such a hurry.  We would prefer not to legislate this way but I have explained the sequence of events.  We were only alerted to the need to produce legislation on, I believe, 7 April last.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also asked whether &euro;200 million would be sufficient for infrastructure for the event.  The figure is indicative and we have never claimed it was precise.  However, the final figure should not be much more or less than &euro;200 million.  It must be remembered that this money will not be spent without an expectation that it will be refunded.  I hope a flood of tickets will be bought and the &euro;200 million cost will come to naught.  We anticipate a surplus.  This figure will cover the upgrades of the stadiums, which have been thoroughly examined by a large number of experts.  </p> <p>  I reiterate the point I made regarding the inquiry into events at the Rio Olympics.  Members are incorrect in claiming it is 12 months since it started.  It is probably ten or 11 months but everyone loves to make the leap to a full year.  </p></speech>

It is then up to us to decide what we do with the rights.  We would have an option to sell them on if we so wished.  It is a commercial decision.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry asked about upgrades to stadiums.  The upgrades would be temporary to allow the stadiums in question to host games, in other words, they would involve upgrading facilities.  This will have legacy benefits.  The tournament budget provides for investment in approximately 40 training facilities nationwide for visiting teams.  Many of these facilities will be in existing clubs, both rugby and other sports, which will leave a legacy of improved facilities for the clubs in question.  The tournament budget will also provide for a legacy programme for the development of the sport.  Although some temporary facilities will be developed in host stadiums, the permanent facilities, for example, floodlights, will leave a positive legacy for the stadiums.  There will also be a legacy of long-term benefit for tourism from the profile and prospect of repeat visits.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry also asked a question on ticket prices, an issue I addressed in the most specific manner possible.  We hope to benefit in the long term in many of the ways to which I referred.  We will provide permanent facilities such as broadband and other infrastructure which will be necessary for the Rugby World Cup.  </p></speech>

We can all be critical, but this is the first time that all the parties came together to support an issue.  One of the things I am sick and tired of in this place is people objecting for the sake of objecting.  For the first time all the parties are putting the people into the centre, and I hope this is the first of many such Bills.  I congratulate the Minister and thank him for his feedback on the Attorney General's advice.  I was concerned about that as well.</p><p> Does the Department have a ten or 15-year strategy to get major, world-class sporting events to Ireland?  I believe this is critical.  I was on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in 2005 and 2006 at the time it applied for and got the Ryder Cup.  That was the first major international world event.  Since then we have had the Solheim Cup, the Special Olympics, the Volvo Ocean Race in my home town of Galway on two occasions, and now we are bidding for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.  I would like to see a 15-year strategy brought back before this committee which plans to get world-class events to Ireland.  We can and we do punch way above our weight.  The Minister may not be in a position to answer this question based on the replies he gave earlier, but I would like us to put the taxpayer right in the middle.  I can see some of the cost-benefit analysis of this.  The real benefit here is the &euro;760 million from tourism that is going to go straight into the industry, with &euro;138 million to &euro;140 million coming straight back to the Exchequer.  In other words, for the &euro;200 million investment to be recouped we will have to sell in the region of &euro;60 million worth of tickets.  Will the Minister provide a break-even analysis for this committee?</p><p> It is fantastic that the GAA is involved in this.  It is a voluntary body, contrary to what Deputy Barry seemed to suggest.  Almost 1.5 million people are involved in the GAA, and they are very active in supporting the World Cup bid.  It is not just the IRFU, but right across the whole spectrum of community.  That has to be highlighted.</p><p> Is there a 15 to 20-year plan?  If not, will the Department look at putting together such a plan?  In terms of a cost-benefit analysis, what is the worst-case scenario and what is the best-case scenario?  We need to know to ensure taxpayers are getting the best return on investment they can.</p></speech>

I echo some of the criticisms of the way it was legislated for.  We need to look at the risks.  We can certainly see where the benefits are, not least that it is an all-Ireland bid.  There are many intangibles, and the key area is risk.  Financial risk is one aspect but there are all sorts of other things that have to be considered, such as increased costs of security.  Something that comes to mind immediately is that there are some areas where we are deficient.  Stadia and sporting facilities can be improved.  There is certainly a deficiency in terms of public transport and hotel accommodation and there is no way we are going to play catch-up in the time available.  Having said that, when I looked at the bid that France made for the soccer World Cup I noted that while they had great public transport, it was not available when the tournament was on because of industrial disputes.  Risk is the issue, and the range of risks that are being considered are the things that we need to be satisfied on.  That is the job we are asked to do here.</p> <p>  On ticket pricing there is a parallel between the Rio de Janeiro Olympics and how we conduct our business.  It may be possible for us to bid directly.  What will be put in place to make sure the risk of selling on tickets at exorbitant prices is avoided?  That is something that authorities tried to crack down on during those Olympics.  I believe we are being made fools of by this inquiry.  There was a three-month deadline, and the Minister would have taken legal advice in advance of that.  Names would have always been a part of an inquiry, whether it was statutory or non-statutory.  It is completely unsatisfactory that we were given timelines and assurances of all descriptions, but we are still now no nearer to having this published.  I am sure the Minster got legal advice in advance.  Did that legal advice flag this particular risk, and if that was the case why is there this delay?</p> <p>  The Minister made an announcement yesterday.  We were all out in Abbotstown and were hugely impressed with the facilities there.  One of the things that impressed us was that it was cross sports and that there was a consolidation rather than the fragmentation that we often see.  What was not clear from the Minister's announcement yesterday was that the IRFU, which is going to be hugely supported now by the State and by the public, had said that it would not commence building outdoor pitches until there was clarity on phase two.  Is that one of the issues that will be looked at in the context of this bid?  It would seem more than unfortunate if the support was coming from one side and then the IRFU decided not to collaborate on the outdoor pitches.  That is a really important piece of this campus.</p></speech>

I believe that everyone in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and across Ireland supports it.  I know the Minister may not be able to give certain details.  He expects to make money from this, but is there a top figure we are willing to spend in order that we are not completely exposed to an open chequebook?</p> <p>  It is great to see P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh with a new facility, as well as Semple Stadium, Thomond Park, the Aviva and Croke Park.  Is the Minister open to the idea of spreading the tournament throughout the country and that the west of Ireland would be supported in having a main stadium for all sports?  It is in the spirit of the bid that we spread the prosperity and tourism side of the World Cup to all parts of Ireland.</p></speech>

Fortunately, Ireland has a strategy for attracting events in the years to come and hosting the Rugby World Cup would obviously be a base for that.  I do not know whether that strategy is for ten or 15 years but I do know that there is a long-term strategy in place.  If we get the Rugby World Cup, our ambitions can then extend even further.  We have the Women's Rugby World Cup coming up this year, which is a highly prestigious event even if it has not attracted the kind of commercial intake we had hoped.  Nevertheless, it will put us on the map and help us with our bid.</p> <p>  I am very energised by the idea of sports tourism, though I am not sure that it has necessarily caught on in the circles in which I would like it to.  It has not yet caught fire as an idea because some people persist in looking at tourism in a very conventional way.  Sports tourism may, in fact , be the way of the future for Ireland and it is something to which we have to give serious consideration.  Senator Feighan's suggestion about the Commonwealth Games is very much in line with that.</p></speech>

Let us think about the Olympics.  Why not?  I remember Gay Mitchell suggesting this a few years ago and he was laughed to scorn and told that it was not possible.  It is now a real and realistic prospect.  If we build up our stadiums and present ourselves as a credible bidder - which we obviously are, especially if win this rugby bid - then the sky is the limit.  I think the Senator is right and F&aacute;ilte Ireland is certainly promoting this.  New Zealand, for example, followed up its hosting of the Rugby World Cup with both the Cricket World Cup and the FIFA U-17 World Cup.  This current bid holds the prospect of opening new channels for us and we should certainly be thinking in those terms.</p> <p>  There are two political features of this project that I consider to be particularly exciting.  One is the North-South aspect.  It is fantastic that there do not seem to be any political difficulties involved in this at all.  There is enthusiasm from all communities, be they those without a rugby tradition or those in Northern Ireland who might have difficulties in doing anything in the context of a united Ireland.  It is fantastic that both have joined together in this without any difficulty or acrimony.  The fact that the GAA has been so incredibly willing to help the IRFU with this project is really encouraging.  That is the direction in which we are moving.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked where the risks lie.  As the Deputy knows, people have mentioned figures like &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million.  These kinds of figures will never materialise.  We are absolutely sure of that.  That would be in scenario where no tickets whatsoever were sold, whereas we, in fact, expect to go into surplus.  What is important to note in the context of risk is the fact that we have taken out cancellation insurance.  That is very important.  The cancellation insurance does not cover eventualities like a big team being knocked out very early and that kind of thing is certainly a risk.  What it covers is things like terrorist offences, acts of God, etc., leading to cancellation.  Further risks are covered in the budget.  Of course, there are certain things that we cannot guard against.  The danger of the figures not being as good as in past Rugby World Cup competitions is always there but it is very small.  In comparison with the Rugby World Cup hosted in the United Kingdom, for example, we expect to get a huge number of British visitors.  That obviously did not apply in the British case because they were already there.  The British fans are the best travellers of the lot.  There certainly are risks, then, but we have taken every precaution, both in terms of the insurance I mentioned but also the thorough the forensic risk examination that we have been carrying out for the past four years.  This has looked at all the risks and we think that it is a risk worth taking.</p> <p>  I now come to the issue of hotels, accommodation shortages and pricing.  This remains something of an unknown because we do not know where we are going to be in 2023.  We have looked at this crisis, which is a difficulty at present, particularly in Dublin.  The tournament will take place in Ireland's shoulder season of September and October.  This is really good time to host it, not just for tourism and sports tourism, but also because there will not be the same critical pressure on hotel beds that there would be in mid-summer.  We estimate that we will need 2.7 million bed nights for tourism and we have 12.2 million beds over this period.  An agreement has already been reached with the Irish Hotels Federation and the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation on availability and pricing for the tournament.  Regarding capacity in Dublin, 6,000 additional beds are anticipated by 2020.  This will have improved further by 2023.  Much of the tournament, of course, will take place outside Dublin so I do not anticipate this being the problem in 2023 that it is today.</p> <p>  In response to the question about ticket reselling, we have been asked by World Rugby and UEFA to look at measures to counter unauthorised ticket sales.  We are doing so, and there is an ongoing consultation process on this by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We will continue to look at possible legislation in this regard.  This is certainly something that of which we have to be conscious because ticket touting on a massive scale would damage the State's reputation.</p></speech>

I do not know the answer.  Sorry.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice talked about exposure.  I cannot tell the Deputy what the level of exposure is, but it is capped and is not an alarming figure.  The Deputy's second question concerned spreading the wealth.  Did he mean this in a concrete way in respect of the Rugby World Cup itself or did he mean it generally?</p></speech>

P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, for example, is now a great facility.  We also have the Aviva Stadium and Thomond Park, so we have great facilities in some parts of the country.  With this bid now coming, would the Minister be open to the idea of rugby, GAA and soccer getting together - with some help - to develop a really good stadium in the west of Ireland?  This would be a focal point for the people of the west but if we were to get this World Cup, it would also serve to bring people to all parts of the country.  There has been talk of Pearse Stadium, but it is a nightmare.</p></speech>

Some excellent suggestions have been made that I hope the Department will take on board.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to confirm that as soon as the Moran inquiry is finalised, and it is agreed legally by the Attorney General that it can be published, he will attend a meeting here or as soon as possible thereafter to discuss its contents.</p></speech>

I have a question on the democratic process of accountability and the Minister's commitment to update the committee and answer questions in the D&aacute;il on a six-monthly basis.  When the report is completed, and whether we get it or not, is there any part of the documentation that will not be subject to freedom of information, FOI, provisions?  Will there be total transparency in terms of democratic accountability when the process is finished, particularly in view of the issues that arise in other jurisdictions over major events like this one?  We can come back to the matter later.</p></speech>
