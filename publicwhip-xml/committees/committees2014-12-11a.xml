    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121100002#A00700"><p>Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes?  No.  We will now deal with correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence dated 3 December from Mr. Tom Moran, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is a follow-up to the committee's meeting on 16 October 2014, to be noted and published.  I will ask the clerk to prepare a report to the D&aacute;il on the evidence taken in respect of the fishery harbours.</p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence dated 1 December from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Health, which is a follow-up to our meeting on 23 October 2014, to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3A.3 is correspondence dated 5 December from Mr. Noel Waters, acting Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, which is a follow-up to our meeting on 20 November 2014, to be noted and published.  The committee at its meeting with the Courts Service had already agreed to make a number of recommendations on the ward of courts issue and we will proceed to draft a report on this.</p><p>  No. 3A.4 is correspondence dated 5 December from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, regarding a follow-up from a meeting on 4 December 2014, to be noted and published.  This issue relates to the dossier of information supplied to individual members and there is related correspondence on this from Arthur Cox.  We had asked the Minister to refer the dossier to Revenue, but the position is that the Minister does not have this dossier.  There has been a bit of a mix-up in terms of the information members received for their private papers and what was received by the Minister.  This matter has been cleared up with the Minister and we have written back accordingly.  There are legal impediments to him handing over the papers, or not having them in fact.</p><p>  No. 3A.5 is correspondence dated 8 December from Arthur Cox solicitors in respect of a dossier regarding an Ansbacher account, to be noted.  The position as outlined last week is that the dossier of information is not a committee document and therefore we cannot accede to the request from the solicitors acting for Mr. MacSharry.  A draft letter, which is now on screen, will issue to Arthur Cox solicitors today.  It is the same as the reply we agreed with regard to Mrs. Ann Lenihan.  We do not have the papers and they are not committee papers.  They are the personal papers of the individual members of the D&aacute;il.  Therefore it is not a matter for us.  Other references in the correspondence have to do with a Member raising the names in the House.  This is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle and the Member and not for us.</p> <p>We need to be a bit clearer on what happened afterwards, perhaps a paragraph of explanation of the committee's role in the matter.</p></speech>

The Department has pointed to next year's forthcoming Bill, but the problem there is that its provisions will not be retrospective.</p></speech>

Rather, it will be a matter for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In that context, I can refer the letter to the Department and ask it to consider the matter.</p></speech>

The number and the amounts of money involved might be reasonably small.  Retrospective legislation is not something that the Oireachtas embraces.</p></speech>

I am sorry if I missed it.  I suggest that the correspondence is inadequate and does not fully provide the information that was requested.  The information that has come to us has come from the Department itself, but we also requested that the board send some information.  While this correspondence relates to certain matters that were discussed, information on other issues was required in respect of the previous board and planning applications for the original hospital on the Mater site, but there is no reference whatsoever to those.  This correspondence was received by the secretariat on 1 December.  Without going into detail, I suggest that we refer to the request and ask for fuller information.  There are gaping holes in what was sent.</p></speech>

To clarify, where does all of that sit and what do we propose to do next?</p></speech>

Deputy Connaughton referred to the response from Bord na gCon.  We should put both bodies on notice to the effect that, if we do not receive a reply by the end of this session, we will have a special meeting in January and ask them to return.</p><p>  Horse Sport Ireland appeared before us.  This morning, I received correspondence from an individual who read the transcript and raised serious issues with the evidence given at that meeting.  I have not had a chance to circulate the correspondence, but I will give it to the clerk this morning.  Arising from it, we should seek clarification from the Irish Sports Council about the issues that have been raised.  A commitment was given to the effect that the chairman would make an intervention in a matter that was raised during our meeting.</p> <p>We should put the organisation on notice that if we do not get the responses required, there will have to be a special sitting to deal with those three matters in the new year; otherwise, we would not be completing our work and Departments or agencies coming before us would simply be putting the replies on the long finger, which is not acceptable.<br/>Again on the work programme, next week NAMA will be before us.  It was reported in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>and raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday that a lady has asked me to appear before the committee to explain her case.  I will circulate the information on this to members.  We are opening the chapter on NAMA next week and I honestly think it would be worthwhile to hear from this woman after that meeting.  The matter relates to the business of NAMA and to how it is conducting its business.  What I heard from the woman is compelling and I believe we have to hear it.</p></speech>

One can hear the case before or after that.  I am not recommending to the members someone who is not credible.  The woman and the family have a very credible story to tell and it gives an insight into how NAMA conducts its business.  It is important for the country and people dealing with NAMA that they understand how this is happening.  If we can hear the story before the meeting, with the agreement of members, that is fine.  However, I believe there is a need to hear this case.</p></speech>

I have spoken to the woman at length and I would not suggest the meeting to the committee if it were the wrong thing to do.  If the lady wants to represent her family and put her case to the committee, she should be asked to do so.  She is not making any direct allegations or naming people; she simply wants to explain the impact on her family, her farm and her life.  Her husband took his own life because of this.  The case is so compelling that I feel we should not let it go.  I suggest that we hear the lady, perhaps in private session, next week and perhaps before the meeting with NAMA.</p></speech>

It was unanimously agreed.  We took a step in the direction of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and it was uncharted territory.  We would not have had the information given to us as clearly if we had taken any other route or if we had not intervened.  The story that this lady has to tell is shocking.  It is shocking that an arm of the State would treat a family or individual like this.  We should hear the story.  Yes, it does open the gate but we have already set a precedent for this.  I cannot understand another side of a story unless I hear it.  If I am constantly going to be fed with one side of the argument, I am only going to take up that side of the argument.</p></speech>

My only concern is that this will probably be a highly emotionally charged presentation because of the circumstances, which, as the Chairman suggested, are obviously very tragic.  From that point of view, it might not be best to hear it immediately before NAMA.  Would it be possible to hear it on the Tuesday rather than the Thursday so there would be a gap?  It is an individual case and I am sure there may well be many others but, nevertheless, we are bringing in NAMA in relation to a variety of issues, including the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Therefore, I suggest that we separate the two.</p></speech>

I have been continually raising the issue of the special investigation unit in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the fallout and cost to the State in relation to its work.  It is difficult to get explanations about the cost because, in spite of the fact that cases have been lost and people have been threatened, or allegedly threatened, there is a serious cost to the State.  When one proceeds to investigate with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, one is referred to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.  There is evidence in relation to all of these cases coming forward directly to the members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I want to put members on notice that this information will be arriving to them in the future.  However, we will see what transpires from our contact with Annette De Vere Hunt.</p><p>  Since there are no other matters arising, we can move on to the business of today.  We have agreed to hear from NAMA next week.</p></speech>

All three accounts for the period ending 31 December 2013 received clear audit opinions.</p><p>  The Credit Institutions Resolution Fund was established in October 2011 to hold funds for use in resolving situations where a licensed credit institution becomes financially unstable, or where there is an imminent serious threat to its financial stability.  The general statutory framework for dealing with such situations is set out in the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, as amended.  The fund is managed and accounted for by the Central Bank.</p><p>  The primary source of funding for the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund was an advance of &euro;250 million from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, made by the Minister for Finance in December 2011.  The liability for repayment of this advance, and the related interest, is recognised on the fund&rsquo;s balance sheet.</p><p>  Under the terms of the 2011 Act, the Minister also made regulations in September 2012 requiring authorised credit institutions to make periodic contributions to the fund.  The income from such levies in 2013 amounted to &euro;9.6 million.  The total levied to the end of 2013 amounted to just over &euro;12 million.</p><p>  Up to the end of 2013, the fund had financially supported resolution action in relation to just one credit institution.  This involved the transfer, following High Court approval in November 2013, of assets and liabilities of Newbridge Credit Union to Permanent TSB PLC.  The credit union&rsquo;s premises in Newbridge were not included in the transfer, and remained with the liquidator of the credit union.  Net proceeds from the disposal of the premises are payable to the fund.</p><p>  As part of the formal agreement for the transfer, a cash incentive of &euro;23 million was paid out of the fund to Permanent TSB.  Together with other expenses, the total costs charged to the fund in relation to resolution of the financial difficulties in that credit union amounted to &euro;25.57 million as at the end of 2013.  However, Note 8 to the financial statements records that there are potential additional costs amounting to &euro;28.3 million arising from the Newbridge agreement.  The officials from the Central Bank will be able to provide the committee with an update on the costs of that and other resolution activities.</p><p>  The credit union fund was established under the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, to provide a source of funding for activities related to the restructuring of credit unions.  This includes provision of financial support for the stabilisation of credit unions, at the request of the Central Bank, and funding to meet the expenses of the Credit Union Restructuring Board.</p><p>  Under the establishing legislation, the fund is administered and managed by the Minister for Finance.  His Department prepares the account of the fund, which is in the form of a cash receipts and payments account, with a closing balance.  The account before the committee today relates to the period from the establishment of the fund on 21 December 2012 to 31 December 2013.</p><p>  Following its establishment, the fund received an initial contribution of &euro;250 million from the Central Fund of the Exchequer in December 2012.  The only payment made out of the fund in 2013 was an advance of &euro;750,000 to the Credit Union Restructuring Board, to fund its activities.</p><p>  The board was established on 1 January 2013 under section 42 of the 2012 Act, which also set up the credit union fund.  The primary function of the board is to facilitate and oversee the voluntary restructuring of credit unions.  The Act envisages that the board will be wound up when its functions have been completed &mdash; there is a &lsquo;sunset&rsquo; provision in the Act, which requires the Minister to carry out a review by 1 January 2016 to determine whether or not the board has completed its functions.</p><p>  The board&rsquo;s first set of financial statements cover the 2013 financial year.  Its main source of income was the draw-down from the credit union fund.  In 2013, the board used around &euro;693,000 of the &euro;750,000 drawn down from the fund.</p><p>  In accordance with section 47 of the 2012 Act, the board is required to make regulations for an annual levy payable by credit unions.  The proceeds of the levy are intended to equal half of the cost of the board&rsquo;s activities, and must be paid over to the credit union fund.  No levy regulation has been made for 2013, and no levy income for the year is recognised.  Note 2 indicates that the board intends to make levy regulations before the end of this year.</p><p>  Approximately 65% of the board&rsquo;s expenditure in 2013 related to staff costs.  A further 17% was incurred in relation to board costs.  The remaining 18% covered administration, IT and communications costs, legal and professional fees and bank-related charges.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Doyle" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121100005#D01300"><p>A core recommendation of the report of the Commission on Credit Unions was that credit unions should be restructured on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis with the guiding aims of protecting members&rsquo; savings, securing the stability and viability of the sector at large and preserving the credit union identity and ethos. Further to this ReBo was established under Part 3 of the Credit Union and Co-Operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 on 1 January 2013.</p> <p> ReBo seeks to engage with credit unions on a voluntary basis in order to facilitate and assist the restructuring process.  Under section 44 of the Act ReBo&rsquo;s function is broadly defined as engaging with credit unions in the development, preparation, assessment and approval of restructuring proposals.  We do this by providing advice, assistance and support to enable credit unions to identify and undertake suitable and sustainable mergers.  Additionally, under section 65 of the Act, ReBo can make recommendations to the Central Bank that stand-alone credit unions not party to a restructuring proposal be considered for stabilisation support. </p><p> Credit unions that engage in the restructuring process typically do so to enhance the services that they can provide their members, improve their governance and organisation structures and better equip themselves to remain in compliance with regulation.  The legislation under which ReBo was formed states that the Minister for Finance shall, no later than 1 January 2016, conduct a review to determine whether or not ReBo has completed the performance of its functions.  ReBo aims to complete its work by December 2015. </p><p> The Government has provided &euro;250 million to the credit union fund for the purposes of restructuring.  The purpose of the fund under section 57 of the Act is primarily to provide a source of financial support for restructuring, to provide for stabilisation support and to provide for the expenses of ReBo in discharging its functions.  During 2013, ReBo drew down &euro;750,000 from the credit union fund for the purpose of discharging its functions.  This was done in accordance with the provisions of the Act and in consultation with the Department of Finance.  Much of 2013 was spent making ReBo operationally ready.  In its initial stages ReBo had an organisation structure made up of temporary staff and staff seconded from Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  A CEO was appointed in June 2013 and a permanent staffing structure was put in place in November 2013.  A process of credit union engagement commenced in May 2013 and by year end, 105 of 392 credit unions had expressed a desire to engage with ReBo.  As at December 31, 2013 ReBo had met with 100 credit unions and 52 of these were actively involved in the restructuring process. </p><p> In the nine months to September 2014 ReBo drew down a further &euro;2.125 million from the credit union fund, with &euro;1.4 million of this being provided to credit unions in direct assistance.  A number of mergers have already taken place or are in the process of being completed.  ReBo has met with 323 credit unions, 20 of which have now taken part in eight completed merger projects.  An additional ten credit unions, in four separate merger projects, are at approval stage and due to complete in the coming weeks.  ReBo is working with a further 121 credit unions that wish to achieve a restructuring solution.  Our briefing paper sets out in more detail the financial and restructuring information relating to 2013 and 2014. </p><p> In conclusion, ReBo has completed a significant body of work in engaging with the entire credit union movement.  Restructuring solutions have been delivered for 30 credit unions and ReBo&rsquo;s focus for 2015 is to deliver solutions for the remaining credit unions it engages with.  The members of all these credit unions will benefit greatly from the mergers they have been party to and the stability and viability of the sector will have been significantly improved.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present details of our remit and work and am happy to answer any questions members may have. </p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Casey to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Casey" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121100006#E00500"><p>The Special Resolution Unit, SRU, in the Central Bank carries out resolution-related activities in accordance with the Governor&rsquo;s instructions covering credit unions, banks and investment firms.  The unit is located in the Central Banking pillar of the Central Bank and for legal reasons it is operationally separate from the financial regulation area, which is responsible for the regulation and supervision of licensed firms.  Given my resolution-related role, I hope to be able to address members' questions on the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund and, in particular, the three resolution cases which have been undertaken to date within the credit union sector.</p><p>  As this committee is aware, the passing of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 by the Oireachtas placed Ireland&rsquo;s domestic resolution regime on a statutory footing.  The purposes of the Act include providing a resolution regime for the management of failed or failing credit institutions that is effective in protecting the Exchequer, ensuring the stability of the financial system and the economy, maintaining public confidence and protecting the interests of depositors.  The Act specifies the powers of the Central Bank in resolution matters, powers which are exercisable by the Governor, subject to High Court approval. </p><p>  The resolution fund was established under the Act and the Central Bank is responsible for the management and administration of the fund.  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act  expressly restricts the utilisation of resolution fund resources to: paying a financial incentive to a transferee under a High Court-approved transfer order; providing capital to a State-controlled bridge bank; and discharging any resolution-related costs incurred by the Central Bank itself.</p><p>  Contributions to the resolution fund comprise fully refundable monies contributed by the Minister for Finance and non-refundable levies raised from the credit institutions industry under regulations issued by the Minister.  On 23 December 2011 the Minister contributed &euro;250 million to the resolution fund.  The Minister has also made regulations to provide for the raising of levies from the credit institutions industry.  To date there have been two levy periods with approximately &euro;19 million collected during those periods, of which credit unions contributed approximately &euro;14 million.  The current balance in the resolution fund is &euro;239 million. </p><p>  In the context of the credit union sector, EU state aid approval for the use of fund resources is only available to support resolution action by means of a transfer order of all asset and liabilities of a failed or failing firm.  When a transfer order is proposed as a means to address a firm&rsquo;s difficulties, specific steps must be undertaken.  In line with EU state aid principles, the Act requires the Central Bank to conduct a competitive bid process concerning the transferring assets and liabilities to ascertain market value.  The Governor, on behalf of the Central Bank, must decide whether the intervention conditions under the Act have been met and whether a transfer order is necessary "in all of the circumstances&rdquo;, representing a very high legal threshold requiring the exhaustion of all other available options.  The Act also stipulates that an immediate winding up of the distressed firm must not be in the public interest, including that it is more cost effective to transfer the distressed firm than to liquidate it.  The Minister for Finance must be formally consulted and must approve the provision of any financial incentive to a transferee under the Act.  Finally, the High Court must approve a transfer order and must be satisfied that the detailed legal tests under the Act have been met in the circumstances of the case. </p><p>  When the Central Bank undertakes a resolution action in accordance with the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act, the resources of the resolution fund can only be used to fund any financial incentive under strictly prescribed circumstances.  While the Central Bank is responsible for undertaking resolution action under the Act, the Minister for Finance must approve all financial incentive payments drawn on the fund and the High Court must grant the transfer order.  While the Central Bank is also responsible for the management and administration of the resolution fund, the Minister for Finance retains the power to raise levies from industry to replenish the fund&rsquo;s resources.  It is also important to note that as a consequence of the three resolution cases undertaken in the credit union sector to date, further details on which are included in the appendix to this statement, no depositors have lost their savings.</p><p>  Given the underlying sensitivities involved, I am precluded from discussing any specific cases that may or may not be with the SRU for resolution.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present details on the resolution fund and our resolution processes and am happy to answer any questions members may have in that regard.</p></speech>

We have met 323 credit unions to date.  In my opening statement I said that many credit unions face significant challenges in terms of trying to deliver products and services to their members.  The credit unions face significant challenges in terms of governance and organisation structures.  We in ReBo see structuring as a potential solution and we try to explain it to smaller credit unions.  It is evident from our interactions with smaller credit unions that from the business model perspective it is increasingly difficult for them and they will be struggling.</p></speech>

They have an income stream from their lending, which is their core business.  Loan-to-asset ratios have shrunk dramatically in the credit union movement in the past four or five years.  They are down to an average of about 30%.  Historically, the rest of their balance sheet is made up of investments.  Investment returns for credit unions have all but disappeared.  Their income model is under serious pressure.  From a cost perspective there is an enhanced compliance regime, which brings additional cost.  All the factors put together make it a very challenging environment for credit unions.  We are actively engaged with 151 credit unions, that is 151 credit unions which have decided they want to play a part in a restructuring process because they see it as a potential vehicle to improve their current circumstances, be it from the perspective of viability, governance and an ability to comply with regulation.</p></speech>

It is time bound and it is incentivised.  We are working with the sector in its entirety, including the League of Credit Unions, who have been supportive of the work of restructuring.  To respond to Deputy Collins's question apropos of how we see the future of credit unions, as Mr. Doyle has outlined, when one looks at the new regulatory compliance measures, it is very difficult for some of these small credit unions to be in compliance when one considers their sources of incomes, that is, income from investments, which at this point in time is nil and the loan interest they will charge.  When 50% of credit unions have assets of less than &euro;20 million, it will be very difficult for them to continue to survive and to have sufficient income to pay operational costs.  That being said, in my opinion the future of the credit unions in Ireland is not a problem.</p><p>  The board of ReBo has support across the sector and is working with the credit unions and I foresee a system that will be much stronger and more viable with additional services that are cost-effective and efficient for the members.</p></speech>

The share of the wallet that the credit unions have now is minor in comparison with what we believe it could be.  A credit union member has to go to the banks for services, but I would like to see that member being able to go to his or her credit union and access any services in the financial sector that he or she would need.  Ultimately, as the movement progresses and becomes what I call a world-class credit union movement for this country, that can happen.  I assure the committee that the board of ReBo, even though it is time bound, works on a voluntary basis with credit unions and I believe the future for the credit union system in Ireland is bright.  The services can be enhanced.  I do not foresee problems doing this going forward.</p></speech>

To this end, when we look at the bigger vision, that is exactly what we want.  There is none of the ReBo committee who does not know what the credit union system has done for Ireland, for individuals, their families and for the communities, and we want to enhance the credit union's ability and make them more competitive with the banks.</p></speech>

In fact, the founders of the movement will say that it is not about profit but what one does with the profit one makes.  The credit union movement is a social concept with community links, and by enhancing the ability of the credit union and its services, the services to its members can be enhanced.  The credit union is not a bank, it is still member owned and member driven.</p></speech>

Many credit unions want to provide what one calls banking services, but they do not want to become banks.  ReBo has a very specific remit, which is entirely around restructuring.  Many credit unions see and recognise the fact that restructuring and putting themselves on a sounder platform on a bigger scale puts them in a far better position to deliver on that.</p></speech>

We are hearing about the process in which they are engaged.  We are hearing about governance and we all know why that has happened.  The members of the credit union boards are volunteers and they seem to be unclear about some of the processes that the Central Bank is putting in place.  I am aware of a credit union that has not had an AGM for three years and has been told by the Central Bank that it cannot hold an AGM.</p></speech>

I am advised by them that the actions taken by the bank are to ensure that credit union members and their savings are protected in the interests of the movement.  Some credit unions remediate their regulatory concerns and they proceed towards an AGM.  In the area I work in, other credit unions have not had an AGM for a period of years.</p> <p>In those circumstances, the Central Bank's preference has been to find a solution for the credit union before it moves towards having an AGM.  The entities are sensitive to the disclosure of their financial positions in such circumstances, particularly to avoid precipitating a destabilising event.  Most credit unions work on their regulatory concerns with a view to holding an AGM.</p></speech>

I appreciate the argument about destabilisation.  When an AGM is not held, it gets around pretty quickly among the members that there is a problem.  It is not open and transparent.  We do not want to go back to where we all were a number of years ago, when people did not know what was going on.  It is a serious issue.  Will the officials look into it?  What is the age profile of credit union members?  Is it an issue that many members are older?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Toole" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014121100008#G00300"><p>It changes with the different kinds of credit unions.   The average age of the members of some public sector credit unions has increased by ten, in effect, as a result of the recruitment embargo of the past ten years.  That has not happened in other areas of the public service, such as teaching, to which the embargo did not apply.  The real issue, as Deputy Collins will know by virtue of her background, is that this began as a sub-prime lending operation which now needs to be governed properly.  At a time when microfinancing is becoming a huge issue - the Deputy spoke about commercial lending - we are trying to get structures together that can reflect modern needs.  I will give an example of one of these issues.  Bank branches are closing throughout the country.  There was another announcement last week.  Many small towns, including some in the Deputy's constituency, might not have an ATM later at night when the local Spar is closed.  Many credit unions have ATMs in their local areas that serve local communities.  If young people are to come in and join, they need to be able to do all their business electronically.  They will not do it any other way.  If the necessary investment to facilitate this is to take place, there must be economies of scale.  We are trying to get to that point.  The current 30% loan ratio is not sustainable in the long term.  A combination of governance, marketing and progress is needed to unblock that part of it.  Electronic banking is certainly part of that.</p></speech>

If the owner of a corner shop is looking for &euro;5,000 to paint and do up his business, a member of the credit committee who attends the monthly meeting might say they gave that guy &euro;5,000 four months ago and they do not see any sign of a paint job on the front of the business.  The advantage of local engagement is that the risk is maintained and the loan is managed in that way.  That is why the governance can work so well.  With increased governance, we would also be looking for increased local discretion.  We would share the Deputy's views about ATMs.</p></speech>

That probably explains why, in terms of our drawdown from the credit union fund, we are finding that much of the restructuring we are doing is being done from within the existing capital structures of the credit unions involved.  One of the primary recommendations in the commission report was that in the first instance, we should try to solve those problems from within the existing capital structures without recourse to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

This issue is not unique to Ireland.  All the countries I have worked in, particularly Canada, are wrestling with the same problem.  Those between the ages of 20 and 35, in particular, tend to be borrowers who need money.  They comprise a target market that needs to be addressed well.  As my colleague has indicated, if one does not provide the services demanded by people in that age group, they will go elsewhere.  As we go forward with the restructuring and the mergers that are taking place, the asset size and the membership will increase and the additional services should become more affordable.  That will enable us to entice this target market to become members.  I want to make it clear that this problem is not unique to Ireland.  It is a major problem, even for very successful credit union movements around the world.</p></speech>

It would be appreciated if we could get things in advance.  I would like to put on record my appreciation of the many volunteers in the credit union movement.  They are part of the glue that holds this country together.  Like other institutions, including the GAA and other sporting organisations, the credit unions are the unsung heroes of this country.</p><p>  My questions are primarily directed at the Central Bank.  I am concerned about the issue of lending in credit unions.  I have had meetings with representatives of credit unions recently.  One of their big concerns is the imposition of lending restrictions.  Will Mr. Casey or Mr. Power outline the sorts of restrictions that have been placed on credit unions?  Why are they there?  Can they be made more flexible?  These questions are particularly pertinent at the moment.  I will give an example.  As the economy is improving, many carpenters and other tradesmen are seeking to buy new vans in order that they can do their jobs better.  I understand that many people in such circumstances are finding it difficult to get money from credit unions.  I would have thought that such lending would be ideal.  It seems to me that these restrictions are imposed from on high.</p></speech>

I understand from my regulatory colleagues that because of the scale of the issues and concerns identified within individual credit unions, some form of lending restriction has been imposed on approximately half of all credit unions.  Such restrictions are subject to ongoing review by the regulatory side of the Central Bank.</p> <p>Each individual credit union is entitled to request the Registry of Credit Unions to review its existing lending restrictions at its own request.  There are broadly two types of lending restriction.  There are monthly lending restrictions where, I understand, less than 10% of all credit unions have a restriction that limits the amount they can lend each month.  This means that 90% of credit unions have no monthly lending restriction.</p></speech>

For those credit unions that have individual loan size restrictions, the vast majority of those can continue to lend significantly more than the average loan for the sector, which is just above &euro;6,000.  Therefore, about a dozen individual credit unions have lending restrictions which limit the amount they can lend to less than &euro;10,000.</p></speech>

When the average sector loan is &euro;6,000, most credit unions that have restrictions can lend above the average loan in the sector so it is not restricting them in that way.

That is as I heard it from her.  It is not something that we come across.  It is something we become aware of only in the course of a merger.</p></speech>

That opens up the possibility for that credit union with the lending restriction that its members will be in a position where they are not subject to those restrictions.  It can be a positive factor in terms of credit unions deciding to become involved in restructuring.</p></speech>

However, when the registrar's department does a complete analysis of the credit union to see if it is in compliance, obviously if there are serious delinquency problems or capital deficiencies, they will lead to some restrictions being put in place.  My colleague, Mr. Joe O'Toole, has said the registrar has told us they are looking at the issue and will review the restrictions.  Over and above that, one of the questions I had in that department some months ago was that it said it does not appear that the restrictions on lending - the caps - are affecting credit unions' ability to service their members in that Mr. Patrick Casey indicated the average loan across the system is about &euro;6,000 and the caps are usually higher than that.  It is a problem imposed by that department.  To be clear, it is not in the purview of ReBo as to exactly why it is there or how it can be lifted.  As Mr. John Doyle has indicated, if a restructuring process involves a credit union that had some caps on its lending, that is basically removed with a larger asset base and a larger membership base.</p></speech>

It is not something in which the Minister is involved specifically.  When the issue was discussed at the Commission on Credit Unions, which produced its landmark report in 2011 and which is the basis on which many of the reforms of recent years have take place, including the establishment of ReBo, one of the changes recommended and which has since been carried through is that the type of regulatory mechanism used for restrictions, which is a regulatory direction, which means it will apply on a credit union's specific basis, should be subject to an appeal.  That was particularly called for by credit unions because balance and proportionality were missing features in the system.  That change has been made.  Where a credit union gets a regulatory direction and where it feels that either the basis for the direction is not correct or is excessive, there is an avenue of appeal.  That avenue of appeal to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal, in addition to the type of reviews that take place within the registrar's office, is entirely independent.  It is independent of the Central Bank and of the Minister.  There is, therefore, a mechanism for credit unions to put their case if they are of the view that the lending restrictions are not being imposed in the way they ought to be.  In general, it is a regulatory decision.  We have an independent regulator for credit unions, and from the Minister's point of view-----</p></speech>

There is a lot of distrust of the sort of intelligence that some of the local people in credit unions have.  This is what I hear from my own credit union in Clondalkin.

Everyone is aware of the recently announced Government strategy on social housing, and that there is a provision in this for funds to be sourced from credit unions.  I understand the president of the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, has welcomed this proposal.  The ICLU reckons the credit union movement could provide between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion for social housing.  I would be interested to know the Central Bank's reaction to this and whether it sees it as a viable proposition.  It would be only one aspect of sorting out the housing problem, but it would be a useful addition in this whole area. </p></speech>

It was a big issue for credit unions in the commission process, and during the debate on the 2012 Act there was a small number of issues on which the credit union movement felt there needed to be amendments to the Act.  One of them was to allow credit unions to get involved in investment in State projects which they felt resonated with their ethos.  Social housing was one of these.  There seems to be an obvious mutual interest in credit unions looking to use their money - their surplus funds - because, as Mr. McVeigh says, they need to get a return on their investments rather than allowing it to sit in a bank account.  Can they put it to use in some way that is socially useful?  It is a complicated space.  There are a lot of different initiatives in social housing.  There are a lot of people putting their attention to it.  There are also a lot of people interested in investing in social housing.  The difficult question is how do they get their money back.  There have been quite constructive discussions.  I have to say, in a fortuitous way, it is quite helpful that the outgoing CEO of the league is going to work in this area.  It helps to keep the good relationship we have had with the league working in a new space.  I cannot give the Deputy anything groundbreaking on this except to say there is an openness to it and that consultations are happening directly with the sector's representatives.  It would be a very positive thing if that hook-up were to happen.</p></speech>

I can reassure the committee that this has not happened in the jurisdictions in which I have worked, particularly in Canada.  On the Deputy's question on social housing, some of the large credit unions in Canada, particularly in Vancouver, Toronto and Manitoba, have specialised in putting a lot of their surplus money into social housing and community endeavours and tying that back into the community from a social point of view.  They have done very well by it, while everyone else has ignored it.  In the future, it has great potential.</p></speech>

Could I ask Mr. Casey for a written response from the Central Bank on this question?</p><p>  There is one other area I wish to ask about, and then I will wind up.  I have been asked to inquire about the situation regarding Newbridge Credit Union.  Perhaps the witnesses could provide some clarity as to where things stand now with the credit union and what the situation is regarding the building, community involvement in the building and the staff.  I may have one or two other questions to come back to when those are answered.  This is Mr. Casey's area.  I appreciate that it is a difficult issue, and it is unfortunate that this has happened because the vast majority of credit unions have behaved with a remarkable degree of sense over the years.  The witnesses probably agree with this.</p></speech>

What I would say is that the former Newbridge premises that Deputy Dowds asked about was not transferred to Permanent TSB as part of our resolution of Newbridge Credit Union.  The premises was retained by Newbridge Credit Union Ltd., which is the former legal entity of the credit union.  We sought the appointment by the High Court of a liquidator to that entity in December 2013, following the transfer to PTSB.  The liquidators are in the process of selling the assets of that entity.  The remaining substantial asset is the building.  Contracts for sale have been signed between the liquidator and the acquirer, which is the Office of Public Works as purchaser of the building.  We understand the sale will go through - completion will occur - sometime over the course of early 2015.  I guess some time before Easter.  In terms of the proceeds of sale, the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned in his opening statement that despite the fact that the incentive for the transfer was provided to PTSB, under the legislation the actual incentive becomes a debt of Newbridge Credit Union Ltd.  For that reason, the proceeds of sale will return to the resolution fund in due course.</p><p>  On the question about local community use of the building, as soon as the building is sold, its use will be a matter for OPW.</p> <p>I am not in a position to answer on its behalf.</p></speech>

The first was the investment of members&rsquo; capital in new premises.  We understand &euro;19 million was spent, principally in the period 2005 to 2006.  The second issue related to lending practices and particularly the provision of property-backed loans.  There was a portfolio of special examination loans provided by Newbridge Credit Union totalling &euro;40 million, approximately 30% of the gross loan balances of the credit union.  They were non-standard bulk repayment loans which were larger than the average credit union loan.  The impact of those loans and the recognition of their losses in that portfolio came to light in a report by the new auditors to Newbridge Credit Union in the latter part of 2011.  That was when the financial distress occurred.</p></speech>

I have been told the fund is to finish by 2015.  I have listened attentively to all the questions asked.  How does the board expect to clear the fund by 2015?  The cumulative operational costs would be approximately &euro;1.3 million on a distribution of &euro;3.5 million, which would mean that the running costs are one-third of the fund given out.  Is it not a contradiction to have &euro;250 million remaining when so many credit unions are in difficulty?</p></speech>

I had expected them sooner.  We came into being in the latter part of 2012, and we became legal on 1 January 2013.  As my colleagues can attest, the board was starting from scratch.  We had no staff, apart from a few seconded staff from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  We had to put everything in place, from policies to procedures and so on.  There was a gap in getting into the restructuring component.</p><p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct about what we have drawn down.  We are incentivised, voluntary and time-bound.  Being voluntary is a curse and a blessing.  It would be nice to say this, this and this, but that is not how it works.  I have already communicated to the Minister that we are now making a complete assessment of what we have in the pipeline for restructuring, what the potential is and what the costs may be.  I have notified him of this and he replied on 9 December and is waiting for us to complete the assessment to deal with it.  I can say without qualification that a large amount of that fund will not be used in restructuring.</p></speech>

We played no part in deciding the amount of money set aside for the fund in the first instance.  We are dealing with 150 credit unions, which have a real desire to play a part in restructuring.  That &euro;150 million represents an asset size of about &euro;6.5 billion across the entire credit union movement, so it actually represents about 50% of this sector.</p> <p>We hope to restructure that 50%, with which we are dealing right now, without availing of the fund.  We consider that a very positive thing, that is, if we can put half of the credit union movement on a more sound platform without recourse to the public Exchequer.</p></speech>

This is going on since 2011.  Many credit unions need assistance.  A fund was set up and the primary focus was to reignite business and reorganise small companies.  There is a very good example in Kilkenny, where businesses are funded.  We have the microfinance fund and the State guarantees up to &euro;25,000 for small companies.  I am amazed there is not a level of co-operation with the State in regard to the draw down of the fund.</p><p>  I am very disappointed.  I am a very straight talker.  We have a fund with &euro;250 million and only &euro;3.5 million has been drawn down.  People are being refused credit by credit unions due to massive restructuring.  We have report after report talking about restructuring but very little is happening.</p></speech>

If one goes back to the commission report, the first draw was supposed to be the capital from the credit unions themselves.  To this end, we have been able to do a fair amount without expending public moneys.  Trust me, I am not saying we should not spend public moneys.  If ReBo had the opportunity to deal with every single credit union and to ensure restructuring could be done, we most certainly would do that but that voluntary component kicks in again.</p></speech>

We fully respect that.  We are paying a huge price for that in terms of inaction.  That is no compensation.  There are 200,000 companies employing 700,000 people.  We have had a total transformation of the banking circle, whether branches being curtailed or credit being restricted.  There is no point saying the State is giving &euro;250 million, that it will be finished by 2015 and it will give money back to the Exchequer.  If the State said it was giving &euro;10 million, parliamentary questions would be tabled in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as to why the fund was so small and why we were not restructuring.  Restructuring means investment and recapitalisation of credit unions which are not doing business and it means a lot more action than what I have seen in the report.</p></speech>

There are our own operational costs, which are relatively small.  There is stabilisation support, which can be given to an individual credit union in very specific circumstances where its regulatory reserve is between 7.5% and 10%.  There are very few credit unions that fall into that space.  Our only other recourse to that fund is for voluntary restructuring proposals.  What we have come across in our interaction with the sector is that there has been one credit union thus far that we have dealt with where we have been unable to help in that regard.  The reason we were unable to help it - I think this is informative - is that in a voluntary restructuring proposal, there has to be another credit union.  We were unable to find another credit union that would merge with the particular credit union in question on the simple basis that the level of funding that would be required and the interest cost that would come with that made it unattractive to find a partner credit union for it, but that has only been one instance.</p></speech>

All of that was well known before this fund was well established.  This does not answer the question because we know only too well that the fund given by Government is very similar to the microfinance fund for small companies.  Ten reasons were given as to why the fund could not be used.  I am finding ten excuses as to why this fund could not be used.  This fund of &euro;250 million was established in 2011 and all that has been drawn down is &euro;3.2 million while at the same time, credit unions are on the floor and they are facing red tape.  It is quite feasible that a credit union in a small village will not merge with a credit union five miles up the road.</p><p>  The Government gave the fund to reignite credit.  I refer to the home improvement grants being announced by the State to get the construction sector going and to create jobs in the economy.  If people go to the credit union, they face red tape and the caveat that it has reached its monthly quota.  This is very disappointing.  I am very disappointed that one third of the fund, which has been given out, has been in expenses.  Regardless of who is doing what, it is voluntary.</p></speech>

The money has to be paid back.  The money has to be approved at European level.  That was one of the things that happened last week.  If we were to talk to Ballymoate credit union and say we were going to put it into a group with another one and make a certain amount of money available, there would have to be a coupon charge to that, which is acceptable to Europe.

What could be drawn from the fund is what we have seen, that is, voluntary restructures under a certain level.

While the Government is anxious that aid under the microfinance fund be dispensed, there is much red tape around draw down from it.  The state aid rules which will apply over the next five years are very liberal and are a signal that the European Investment Fund, EIF, and European Investment Bank, EIB, are determined to reignite economies and to ensure that funds are not returned to source.

The purpose of the restructuring fund is to fill that gap.  Obviously, the credit unions then have to repay the fund, including interest.  We have interacted with every credit union in the country that was willing to meet with us and in that regard have 150 proposals before us.  The credit unions are solving these problems themselves.  In 90% to 95% of cases these issues are being addressed from within the existing capital structures of the credit unions, which, again, we would view as positive.</p></speech>

It was agreed in the commission's report that where funds were available from within the credit union sector, they would be the first draw.  Where funds were not available, there would be additional funds in place that could be used.  Against the backdrop of the commission report, we had a situation where credit unions had arrears of &euro;1 billion and more than 50 credit unions had reserve ratios of less than 10%.  The credit union sector has proven itself to be a lot more resilient and stronger than anticipated at the time.  Also, the Central Bank stress tests indicated that there could be a capital hole of up to &euro;1 billion.  Funds were set aside for the provision of restructuring of &euro;250 million.  What has happened over the past two or three years is that capital within the sector has been available to assist in the restructuring process and so there has not been recourse to the funds provided for by the Exchequer.</p></speech>

In a city like Dublin, the economy of scale is far larger than it is in a small community area.  It is important there is recognition and definition of the urban-rural situation <i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i>the credit unions.<br/>Given that roll-out of the fund will not be until 2016, many credit unions are unable to lend money to people, including the person with a business initiative.  As stated, the credit union in Kilkenny funds business.  Should further derogations not be provided to credit unions in other areas so as to allow them fund SMEs, which are the backbone of the economy?</p></speech>

As stated in response to an earlier question, credit unions that are restructured and do amalgamate tend to be stronger and, therefore, have lending restrictions lifted or lightened as a result.  If restructures do take place, which is a voluntary process, the knock-on effect is ultimately stronger credit unions.</p></speech>

Most of our staff, myself included, professional lives aside, were volunteer directors and supervisors in credit unions.  From November of last year to the middle of this year we engaged individually with the boards of 323 credit unions and discussed with them what we are about and what we are not about.  We are not dictating to credit unions what they should or should not do.  We asked them fundamental questions around what is in their members' interests and whether they can currently provide the products and services their members want and whether they will be able to continue to do into the future.</p><p>  As I said, in the beginning there was a misconception and wariness of the credit union restructuring board.  The credit union movement now understands what we are about and is, I think, very open to what we are about.  They see us for what we are.</p> <p>The voluntary aspect of this touches on everything.  We are simply there to work with those credit unions that wish to avail of our services.</p></speech>

We have no grand plan for the number of credit unions there should be in the country but we are all advocates of restructuring.  We believe in restructuring for the reasons outlined.  It is not that restructuring is the be all and end all solution for credit unions.  My background was in a relatively small credit union.  We understand the issues facing them.  Restructuring in many instances will give them an opportunity to provide better products, services and infrastructure for their members.  That is all we are trying to do, namely, encouraging credit unions that want to move in that direction and working with and facilitating that for them.</p></speech>

Mr. John Doyle came on board in 2013.  If we go back to the beginning, the Deputy's question is very accurate.  When I first came in, at which time we had some seconded staff, I spent probably the first six months dealing with credit unions, the league, CUDA - all the support organisations, ensuring that the purpose of restructuring was to strengthen the credit unions.  There was much concern about what ReBo would do and how it would do it.  Many of the credit unions, whether I was dealing with chapter officers, the administrators' association or whomever, specifically wanted to know about that.  Mr. John Doyle has put it quite succinctly.  I made it clear to every organisation I talked to during those first six to eight months, and I travelled the country doing that, that we were here to ensure that credit unions are successful into the future but that they should remember that this is voluntary and incentivised but that it is time-bound.  That message has been substantively got across.  There are only 64 credit unions in the country that have said they do not want to talk to us.  That is not because we have not gone to them.  We have written to and called them but the majority of the credit unions now realise that this is an opportunity for them to enhance their services, to be cost effective and efficient for their members, and to ensure that each community will have a credit union on a go-forward basis.  The view has changed from one of "stay away from those guys" to one of "let us deal with them".</p></speech>

The small credit unions are now dealing with very strict rules of governance which take a good deal of ability and time.  They are also dealing with the establishment of new services which also take a good deal of time and ability.  They are examining the question of risk management in a way they never had to previously with larger amounts of money.  Many of them, having regard to concern for their members, will ask whether they can they give their members the best possible opportunity here and they will often ask, in discussion with Mr. John Doyle's team, what their options are.  That is the way it begins with a list of things as a top level business plan, followed by a more detailed business plan, due diligence carried out on finance, legalities and human resources and there are related aspects of those.  The smaller credit unions will examine this, talk to their members and ask what is the best option for them.  It is a very difficult decision in a local area for them to  merge but they can tell their members that they will keep the local office, the name will change, it will be run in a more competitive way and they can give them a better service.  That is how it tends to happen.</p></speech>

The message that we were given verbally is now in place in these small communities which is what we are about.</p></speech>

Of the countries I have worked in, be it Poland, Romania, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, this is the only country that the Government saw fit to ensure this sector survived and survived well and put an incentive in place to do that.

I imagine the board's job is to examine how it can strengthen the sector as much as possible.  Their belief is that if the restrictions has not been imposed as severely in the first place, they would still be strong and would not need this.  There has been very much a carrot and stick approach, on the basis that the board is here to help them-----</p></speech>

They come to us for a variety of reasons.  Undoubtedly credit unions engage with us on the basis that they feel overwhelmed.  That is very clear.  Other credit unions will come to us that have no issues in terms of governance and viability but they see restructuring as something that is positive and that if they go down this route they can enhance what they deliver to their members, but the other reasons are also true.</p></speech>

What is the position with regard to that proposal?  Is that something to which the board is giving credence as an alternative in the future, or is that so far away from its remit that it is not a priority now?</p></speech>

On the restructuring component, as I outlined to the Deputy's colleague, a restructured credit union with a large membership, an open or an expanded bond and a large asset base has the ability not only to be compliant with the new regulations but also to enhance its services, and those services in my opinion, and I know I am supported by the board on this on a go-forward basis down the road, can be delivered in a full service financial institution called a credit union which can compete with any bank in the country.  That is part of what restructuring can bring.  It will not happen next year but we can see from some of the restructured credit unions, particularly those located in small communities, that were only able to offer except savings and loans facilities that, through restructuring and becoming part of a bigger entity and without losing the community linkages, they are now able to enhance the services even there.</p></speech>

I will not go into this as An Post is not represented here and I imagine it would have to be consulted on this as well.  From a rural perspective, in terms of ensuring the viability of credit unions and post offices, do the delegates see a possible synergy between those two entities in the future?	</p> <p>I imagine it would need a change in legislation or regulation from the Central Bank.  I accept it is not something that is going to happen overnight but where does the proposal stand at the moment?</p></speech>

It is fair to say the proposal was at an early stage but notwithstanding that, some of the ideas in it were good, both in terms of broadening the product offering and an opportunity to provide synergies between both An Post and the credit union sector.  Certainly, there was merit in the proposal but it will also require a meeting with the Central Bank on the supervisory and regulatory aspect and also further details.  We welcome the proposal.  We are always open to further proposals, but in saying that there is an independent regulator to satisfy as well.</p></speech>

I will outline the backgrounds of the members.  The chairperson, Mr. McVeigh, is a former president of the World Council of Credit Unions.  We have people from the various representative bodies, namely, the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, from the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, and the Credit Union Managers Association, CUMA.  We also have Mr. Joe O&rsquo;Toole and we have a number of independent private sector individuals with expertise in insolvency and accountancy.</p><p>  In terms of the legal fees we incurred in 2013, there is a significant legal cost in the set-up of any organisation.  ReBo was set up on 1 January 2013.  Approximately &euro;60,000 of legal advice was received in the areas of board governance, staffing and advice was also procured on EU state aid.  There was also some legal cost involved in the Newbridge case, as previously discussed.</p></speech>

The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, of which I am a member, has done a lot of work on the future of the An Post network, in particular in rural communities.  There is no doubt the sustainability of the network will come under enormous pressure.  The reality is that for many communities no financial services will be available in huge tracts of the country in the near future.  In recent weeks Ulster Bank announced the closure of branch networks and Allied Irish Banks announced a similar closure of bank networks.  In my part of the world, one of the only financial service areas left is the An Post network, which is coming under severe pressure, in a lot of cases by virtue of the age profile of postmasters and the manner in which post offices can be handed on.  The only other remaining network is the credit union movement.</p><p>  To continue on from the point made by Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins, the age profile of people concerned about credit unions in my constituency is high.  That is a worry because many of them want to hand over to the next generation but in a lot of cases young people are not interested.  There is a gap between the leadership of the credit union movement at the moment in rural areas and the tranche of people who would potentially be interested.</p><p>  From the point of view of Deputies representing rural constituencies, I would like to know that in future a suite of financial services would be available to people in rural areas, regardless of their location.  I would love to see ATM machines available through the credit union movement and Government financial services being transacted in credit unions.  Limerick has been mentioned in the media in terms of such a development happening.  ReBo has a wind-down date and then it will no longer exist, and the situation will be hanging in the ether and change may or may not happen.  In the meantime, An Post is restricted in terms of what it can do with its network.  The credit union membership also has restrictions on it.  People in rural areas are in limbo in terms of whether they will have a financial service available to them.  There is a great opportunity to do more and I would like to see a greater level of urgency attached.</p></speech>

From the very beginning we have insisted with ReBo that one of our key mandates is to ensure that each and every community has access to a credit union service, whether it be a branch or an ATM that is owned by the credit union system.  We believe that the restructuring we are doing will ensure the system can continue and be enhanced.</p><p>  I cannot comment on An Post.  I will hand over to my colleague to answer that question.  The Deputy can rest assured that from a ReBo point of view, our intention is that each and every community will have access to a credit union service.</p></speech>

We would welcome any opportunity for synergies from within the An Post and credit union networks.  It is fair to say the proposal was at an early stage and therefore we did say that when it is further along the line there would be an opportunity to meet with us again to consider progress.  Within the proposal a number of stakeholders was identified and the proposers wanted to discuss the matter with all concerned.  We are keen to get feedback once the discussions have taken place.  One party was the Central Bank.  We referred the proposers to the Central Bank as well because the proposal would require both regulatory and supervisory assistance in that regard.</p></speech>

The banking institutions just went out the back door and put an incredible burden on the country in terms of what everybody has had to sacrifice over that period.  To put this in context, this is modest by comparison. </p><p>  I wish to ask a general question about money that has been given by the Minister for Finance for restructuring which amounts to &euro;250 million.  I am sure that part of this question has been answered already.  How much has already been spent and what is the expenditure estimate to the end of 2015?  If this is out of proportion to what the needs are, it might create unnecessary fears among the membership generally and could therefore affect the public's engagement with credit unions.  </p><p>  Has there been an increase or a decrease in membership over recent years?  Would that indicate whether we have had an appropriate response to the difficulties that were experienced by the credit unions themselves?  My understanding is that Newbridge Credit Union was not a member of the Irish League of Credit Unions at all.  Is that correct?</p><p>  My general question concerns the amount that was provided by the State, how much has been drawn down, and the amount that is expected to be drawn down when the winding up, merger and restructuring proceedings are completed.</p></speech>

We will conclude that exercise over the coming weeks.</p><p>  As regards the public perception of and confidence in that, I see it as something the public should take great comfort from.  The public should be able to appreciate that the sector does not need the full amount.  There are enough resources within the sector to solve the vast majority of whatever small issues are within it.  As regards how the general public view their own local credit union, therefore, they should take great confidence in that. </p></speech>

Our board has discussed this on the occasion of at least the last two board meetings.  We want to err on the side of caution in doing this assessment, knowing exactly what we have in the pipeline for restructuring now, and looking at the possibility of a rapid increase in some activity in the next few months, particularly in the first and second quarters.  That is why we are reluctant to say it will be x number of euro, for example, &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million.  We will have that completed, however, probably by the board meeting in January.  We will inform them, as we have already done, that we are assessing it.  In turn, we will have consultations with them.</p></speech>

That is absolutely no problem.</p><p>  When one looked at the fund that was established and the rationale for establishing it at the time, as we would say down in Cape Breton, the "water on the beans" has changed substantively since the initial amount was determined, based on the sector.  The resilience of the credit union movement in that timeframe has been tremendous.  Full marks must be given to the Credit Union Development Association, the Irish League of Credit Unions, ReBo and the support organisations.</p><p>  I do not have the specific statistics, but I believe that membership is stable and/or increasing in the sector.  They trust the credit unions around this country.</p></speech>

Would Mr. McVeigh agree with me that it is unlikely that more than another &euro;10 million will have to be spent?

We need to get that message clearly out into the ether among the citizenry.</p><p>  Approximately 2.5 million to 3 million people throughout the country are involved in the credit union movement.  They must have confidence in this particular financial institution, which caters for small family savings and loans.  That is my only concern about it.  </p></speech>

In October 2011, the Minister made a statement on the floor of the Seanad at a time of great uncertainty.  There were a lot of international eyes on Ireland at the time, so I would not underestimate the extent to which people outside Ireland still watch what happens with Irish credit unions.  They still see it as part of the financial system and, now that the banking system is starting to normalise, they want to know that there is not some unfinished business - especially given the level of penetration in Ireland.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about membership figures and Ireland has by far the highest penetration of credit union membership anywhere in the world.</p></speech>

People in the Irish League of Credit Unions may have better figures than that.  By comparison, in the UK it is less than 5%.  Credit unions are a big part of the landscape in Ireland in a way they are not in other countries, even where they are popular.</p><p>  In 2011, when the Minister made the statement, he was working on advice and stress tests that said that under certain scenarios - and there was a lot of uncertainty internationally, including existential issues around the euro and Europe - he would put the finance in place to ensure that whatever happened there would be support to let the credit union movement correct itself and move on.  </p><p>  At that stage, a commission on credit unions was sitting which concluded its work about six or eight months later.  That commission's report involved the credit union movement, the regulator, the Department and other independent members, including Mr. O'Toole who has been on this journey over a number of years.  The commission's report had a wide range of recommendations, including everything from the sector's business model to stability supports, resolutions, stabilisation and the work ReBo is doing, as well as the regulatory stuff.</p> <p>The important sequence was that constant remarks were being made to the effect that, having seen the position of the banks, who knows what would be in the credit unions.  The Minister addressed this issue in an up-front manner at the time when he decided the Government would provide funding and that the advice received was that, under certain stressed conditions, the issue could escalate into a bigger problem.  His position was that the Government would put money on the table first to give people assurance that it was committed to addressing the issue.  The commission on credit unions then issued advice on how best to target this money.  Since then, what has emerged in the figures from the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, and more widely is that the credit union movement had previously taken a number of steps.  For example, the level of provisioning for bad debts increased from approximately &euro;200 million in 2006 to &euro;800 million in-----</p></speech>

Members have seen the difficulty we have had in the past hour explaining this good news story.  This is the reason we want to manage the release of this.  When the figures have been finalised and cleared by the Minister and Department, this will clearly be seen as a very good news story in terms of what it is saving.</p></speech>

One is held in the resolution fund, while the other is held in the credit union fund.  In terms of Government funding, these funds remain within government.  The money has not been accounted as an impact on the general government balance.  As such, moving &euro;250 million to the fund does not affect the budget arithmetic or the general deficit procedure.</p><p>  I am guided by the Chairman's opening comments on policy decisions taken by Ministers and so forth.  The Minister has a call to make on how he wants to structure the fund once the advice of ReBo has been received on what it will need.</p></speech>

The resolution fund is a slightly different creature because it is a long-term fund.  ReBo and the credit union fund are related to the time bound process.  On the resolution fund, contributions are made from authorised credit institutions, a term that refers to credit unions, banks and building societies.  We no longer have building societies.</p><p>  On the level of levy, the Comptroller and Auditor General's figure is that it has amounted to approximately &euro;12 million to date.  The overall levy amount on an annual basis is approximately &euro;7 million to the credit union sector and approximately &euro;1 million to the IFSC banks, which will largely pay resolution funds overseas in any case.  The domestic Irish banks were not due to contribute to the fund until the end of this year because they are covered by different legislation, namely, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, which expires at the end of the year.  It is intended that the domestic banks will start to contribute to the resolution fund from next year.  Since then, however, there have been developments at European level.  As a result of the bank recovery and resolution directive and single resolution mechanism, these matters will no longer be resolved nationally and the banks will make much larger contributions at a European level.</p></speech>

The credit union fund has been used to a significantly lesser degree than the other fund.  The Central Bank has pointed out that an extremely small number of credit unions require resolution expenditure.  In those cases, we noted one case in 2013 for which about &euro;25 million had been used already and there was a contingent liability for a further &euro;28 million at that stage.</p></speech>

Connaughton, Gabrielle McFadden and others about the possible amalgamation or merger of the Irish League of Credit Unions and An Post.  An announcement was made last week by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the role credit unions might play in the delivery of social housing.  I read a response carried in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>from Mr. Martin Sisk, president of the Irish League of Credit Unions, indicating that it intended to play a full role in the development of the economy and was prepared to invest in the region of &euro;1 billion in respect of the &euro;3.8 billion social housing strategy announced.  This seems to be quite a departure for credit unions.  Do they have the assets, capital and reserves to do this because this is a relatively short-term development and everything must be concluded before the end of 2018 or 2019?  As mentioned, what legislative changes would be required to allow that investment be made in what is clearly a Government strategy?  I presume the funding is safe, but at the same time, an enormous amount of capital and reserves will be invested in a particular project.</p></speech>

The maximum is &euro;5,000 per month.  I do not know if that is adequate in the case of small and medium enterprises.  There is to be a new expansion when we are still involved in the restructuring process; therefore, is it a viable option?</p></speech>

There is a thicket of agencies, Departments and initiatives in the area.  For some time credit unions have been expressing an interest in using some of the surplus funds they are holding on low yield investments in banks in some form of State-sponsored project consistent with their ethos and community focus.  As far as I am aware, there have been more direct discussions between the credit union movement and some players.  As I do not know the details of the social housing initiative, I will not speculate on how it will play out, except to say it seems to be something that resonates with the credit union ethos.  It could have the potential to allow credit unions to broaden their investments.</p><p>  The Deputy specifically asked about the legislative point.</p> <p>This came up earlier.  One of the concerns the credit union movement raised about the recent reform legislation was that the type of investment restrictions that were allowable under the Central Bank regime, would not permit this type of thing.  The way it happens is that the high-level principles are in the legislation and the Central Bank then goes on to spell it out in its more detailed regulatory requirements.  There was an amendment made at that time to address that point to ensure if there were viable opportunities for credit unions to engage in things such as social housing, there would not be a legislative block.  A change was made to try to accommodate that.  The point I made to Deputy Dowds, who raised this in the early stages of this session, was that there is interest from credit unions and other players in putting money into social housing.  The nut to be cracked is how to get the return - how to get their money back - if it is to be an investment.</p></speech>

It does not need a change of legislation to allow them to keep their reserves in, let us say, a State-guaranteed fund for social housing where they will get a better rate of return than the 1% they are getting at the moment.  There are simpler ways in which it could be done.  I think the decisions would be at Central Bank level because as Mr. Hession has said, the legislation in its general principles allows for an approach in that direction.</p></speech>

Each credit union, because it is autonomous, member-owned and member-driven, will determine the services it should provide to its members.  As I see it, as we look to the future, the members, particularly if we target the younger members in the 20 to 35 age group, are demanding more services.  If one looks at the share of wallet that a credit union now has, it is small in comparison with what it could be because there are services from a financial institution that they cannot get at the credit union.  No matter whether one calls it SACCO in Africa, they are credit unions and they are financial institutions.</p><p>  They should be looking at and determining the needs of the members and attempting to provide those services, but once again, because they are all independent, they in turn have to make that determination.  If they truly are going to expand their membership and particularly serve as a niche for 20 to 35 year olds, then in my opinion they are going to have to expand services.  However, as I say, because it is member-owned and member-driven, it becomes an individual credit union decision.  My experience tells me that as the membership grows and as their bonds become open bonds as opposed to closed bonds, they will be in a better position to add new services, enhance what they have and become more cost-effective and efficient.  That is that component of it.  That is a vision I have for the credit union system in Ireland.</p><p>  As I said, I know what credit unions have done for this country, whether it is individual families, communities or whatever, and the important role they play.  As I think Mr. Hession has suggested, 60% of the population belongs to the credit union movement.  I have been all over this country for 20 or 25 years and I can tell the committee that when I talk to taxi drivers or people running farms or small businesses, everybody has been touched by this credit union system.  From ReBo's larger vision of restructuring, we want to ensure that what we can do from a restructuring point of view is enhance their ability not only to provide additional services but to survive and thrive in this economy.</p></speech>

This has been my experience in the Canadian system.  We have credit unions in Canada, which goes back to the question that if one is big, then one is a bank.  That is not true.  Big does not mean bad.  In fact, their ability to do the social and community links is enhanced because they are bigger and they have more profit to share with their members and the community.  The difference is as simple as this: the philosophy, the principles and the community linkages do not change; they become enhanced.  That is what differentiates the credit union system and credit unions individually from banks.</p></speech>

What is Mr. McVeigh's view arising from those interviews?  Do they buy into this idea of a bank in the way described by Mr. McVeigh and, if they do, has ReBo drawn up a general profile from its interviews?  Is Mr. McVeigh encouraged by that to deliver some form of comment to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank about what is required, even if that goes beyond Mr. McVeigh's remit?  ReBo has done the exercise and has the information.  Mr. McVeigh knows the credit unions' desire to extend into a general range of banking services if each credit union should decide that.  Therefore, arising from that exercise, would it be worthwhile for Mr. McVeigh to make that information known in a general way to the Central Bank and the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

The Chairman has made a suggestion based on what we have seen in the credit unions we have worked with.  One is still getting some credit unions that basically are saying they do not know if they can do all these services or that they do not want to become a bank.  There is still some selling to be done on that component of it, but the ones that have restructured see the benefits.  The communities have not lost their credit unions.  These credit unions have additional services that they did not have the month before the restructuring.  It is a hand-in-glove situation we are in and a step-by-step process.</p><p>  I would envision ReBo at the end of its term being able to provide a report to Government stating that the restructuring has been successful.  The change of bond and enhancing services may require some legislative changes, which should be considered.  There are many examples of legislation in various countries that can be tapped into.</p><p>  I do not want to be accused here.  I will give one example.  I was asked to fly from Cork to Belfast to talk to some legislators about mortgages because some of the credit unions there had surplus funds with which they thought they could provide mortgages, which to me is a good thing, by the way.  When the interview was all done and everything, the headline in the press the next day was: "McVeigh says credit unions are going to provide mortgages."</p> <p>McVeigh did not say that.  However, he did say it would be a good thing if legislation were to permit mortgages to be provided by credit unions that are in a position to do it.</p></speech>

This legislation provides for our credit unions to be full financial service organisations, with strict regulatory compliance and supervision applying.  As a result of the fact that the leagues are regulated federally and the credit unions are regulated provincially, the Government of Canada does not change legislation without consultation with the credit union system.  In my view, this is a good thing.  That consultation could take place and I would be happy to arrange to have some Members of the D&aacute;il consider what is in place in Canada.</p></speech>

Our guests are involved in a process of engagement with all of the credit unions with the exception of the 64 to which reference was made.  That process is due to conclude in 2015 or 2016 and, as Mr. O'Toole is aware, legislation in this country proceeds at a slow pace.  Is there an opinion within either the Central Bank or the Department of Finance in respect of this matter which would feed into any policy the Minister may seek to adopt?  Does either entity have a view on this?  Would either like to see what we are discussing develop?</p></speech>

One of the key aspects of this matter is the fact that banks must provide services to their customers and keep their shareholders happy, whereas in the case of credit unions, the customers are the shareholders and it is they who own the credit unions.  As a result, there is not that division.  The big thinking behind the commission report was to try to evaluate how credit unions could be placed on a stable basis and allowed to grow without changing their fundamental ethos.  That is a very large communication point in the context of credibility.  The commission report was fairly clear in indicating that there is not the scope for credit unions to do new things.  They need to think carefully about the risks that go with this.  There is also an issue of scale because credit unions in jurisdictions such as Canada are very large.  To some degree, the restructuring will see to it that a number of credit unions will reach the level of sophistication in respect of systems, investment and economies of scale that will permit them to do new things.</p><p>  In addition, a tiered regulatory approach is supposed to be followed.  In other words, rather than treating all credit unions on the same basis, there will be a standard level of regulation and this will be somewhat more straightforward for the smaller savings-and-loans credit unions.  The larger and more advanced operations which have the capacity to take it on board may be able to become involved in a wider variety of activities.  The blueprint is there.  If there is legislative change, I am sure that is something the Minister would be open to considering.  We carried out a major review of the legislation - as part of the commission process and under the 2012 Act - to try to capture everything about the commission report which highlighted the need for legislative change and in order that we would not be obliged to adopt a piecemeal approach to trying to fix the position over time.</p><p>  Those from the regulatory unit of the Central Bank are not present at this meeting but I can hear their voices in my head saying it is okay in principle but can it be done safely?</p></speech>

It is a question of assessing whether it is possible for the credit unions to get involved in these things without jeopardising their members' savings.  Do they know what they are doing, do they understand the sectors in which they would become involved and do they have the requisite governance risk systems?  If the concerns in respect of these matters can be put to bed, then credit unions would be able to put a reasonable proposition on the table.</p></speech>

The tiered regulatory approach, which is one of the things suggested by the Commission on Credit Unions, would proceed on the basis of not treating all credit unions in the same way.  Instead, there would be tiered structures in respect of them.  We put out a consultation paper on that matter last year and the majority of respondents indicated they did not want a tiered approach to be introduced at this point because so much change is taking place within the sector.  This matter may arise in the short to medium term but when consultation took place, the credit unions did not want changes either within the movement or in terms of how they are treated.</p></speech>

In terms of what is happening in credit unions currently, with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance to a degree, and possibly the regulator who is not present to answer, if one takes a loan of &euro;6,000 to &euro;10,000, there is an inordinate amount of red tape that one has to go through to get loans.  I have heard that from individuals and families and even small businesses where it applies.  That is not what the credit union is about.  If either the Department of Finance, the Central Bank or the regulator, when someone in that office reads the transcript of the meeting, could do something to lift some of the red tape and allow discretion at branch level, it would help enormously the local economic situation.  Could the witnesses from the Department of Finance or the Central Bank indicate how long it would take to restore the flexibility they once enjoyed and which they did not abuse, now that we are seeing a little bit of blue sky after what happened since 2007, even if it is credit union by credit union?</p></speech>

That would have to be assessed on an individual basis and the regulator would be in a better position to answer the question.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance is everywhere and it knows the situation.  On a credit union by credit union basis, because of the positive effect it can have in local communities trying to recover, is it not time to look at the merit of lifting some of the red tape to allow the flexibility the credit unions once enjoyed, without going too far from the regulations in place?</p></speech>

We have spoken to the credit union movement previously about whether there is potential for a smaller, simpler project.  The average loan size of &euro;6,000 has been creeping up over the years.  A report was done by the Central Bank on the licensed moneylending sector and it showed the average loan in that context is about &euro;500 to &euro;600.  There is a question about whether there is scope for credit unions to package something a bit simpler and smaller to mop up some of that business.  Not everyone needs &euro;6,000.  Not everyone needs to get his or her house repaired or to buy a car.  Often it is a case of borrowing money to get through Christmas, a communion or other small event.  Perhaps there is scope for credit unions to be able to package something that is a bit simpler for people who do not have a need for &euro;6,000 but who want &euro;500 or &euro;600 and they are intimidated by the prospect of having to produce six months&rsquo; worth of bank statements, pay slips and so on.</p></speech>

The only thing that kept them at bay over the years was the credit union.  Now that people cannot access the type of small money they want to get out of trouble, that is causing enormous trouble in communities around the country.  The Central Bank and the Department of Finance or whoever else must examine the situation and take out the time blocks in dealing with the situation.  It could be the case that it is the credit union movement that needs to do it but something needs to be done.  The sum of &euro;6,000 does not get one very far if one is putting on an extension to look after an elderly member of the family or doing other work that is required urgently.  One will just not go through the paperwork required.  Some people do not have the paperwork that is sought.  They rely not so much on discretion, but on the knowledge-based discretion that can be applied.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Toole said, if one got money to paint the front of one&rsquo;s shop, it is quite possible that the credit union staff would see that the shop has been painted.  Loans must be provided in a far tighter timeframe than would usually apply in these cases.  We have gone overboard with regulations.  I am pleased Mr. Hession mentioned moneylenders.  I urge whoever is responsible for taking the initiative to do something in the interests of the people who are affected.</p><p>  A total of 64 credit unions did not volunteer.  What is the view on them?  Is it important that they would be encouraged to volunteer?  Does ReBo or the Central Bank have information on them in terms of why they have not volunteered, be it good or bad?</p></speech>

It is a voluntary component of ReBo.  We also consulted with people in the Central Bank on the matter.  They are now cognisant of the 64.  We have said that if the Central Bank can assist or it thinks we can do something different we are happy to help.  We do not want to just leave 64 credit unions out there who do not want to talk to us.  We want to do everything within our power to talk to them.  The simple question I have asked from day 1 of the manager and chairman of the boards is to go back and have an honest discussion with the board and look at where the credit union will be in three years, five years or eight years&rsquo; time and establish whether it will be viable.  We say to call us if we can help because we believe we can help.  We tell people to be objective and to analyse their operation and to see where they will be in three to five years.  Those 64 may not be involved but we are not just ignoring them.</p></speech>

It imposes the restrictions so it must lift them.

I wish to make an appeal to everyone in both the public Gallery and the witnesses from the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, ReBo and the Irish League of Credit Unions.  My experience of credit unions is that they are a hugely important part of local communities.  Everybody agrees that is the case.  A significant number of individuals and businesses are not getting loans from banks, which do not service the local community in the same way as a local credit union.  The witnesses from the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and ReBo should do what they can.</p> <p>We should do that to allow the credit unions to play the part they actually could play if certain restrictions were lifted, assistance given or whatever.  Along with the witnesses, I would say to the 64 credit unions that they should participate.  This is a good development.  We are into a new regulatory challenge in this country and we have to face up to it, but we must be realistic about that regulatory challenge in that one size does not fit all.  We need to get it right.  I appeal again to those involved because, with regard to licensed and unlicensed moneylenders, the credit unions are the only ones that stand in the gap to assist the person in trouble.  I wish the witnesses well with their work and I would encourage the regulator to act swiftly regarding the relief that is necessary in the movement.</p></speech>

We look forward to working closely with them on all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.<br/>I am pleased to welcome Ms Karen Charnley, programme manager, All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care.  The institute was established in 2010 and has four main programme areas, namely, research, education, policy and practice, and communication.  Ms Charnley is here to inform us about its work on an all-island basis to improve the experience of palliative care for individuals and families.  I had the pleasure of launching its children's and young person's website in late October.  The website is primarily aimed at assisting parents, guardians, carers and the wider public in understanding the nature of palliative care for children by filtering the wide range of information available on the Internet.  This is just one example of the work being done by the institute across the island of Ireland.  Members of the committee are supportive of efforts to utilise resources on an all-Ireland, cross-Border basis in key strategic areas.  Organisations such as the All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care make sense in this regard and I look forward to hearing what Ms Charnley has to say about the cross-Border aspects of her work.<br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I invite Ms Charnley to make her opening presentation.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the institute's director, Mr. Paddie Blaney, cannot be here and has asked me to pass on his apologies.  </p><p>  The institute was established in 2011 as an all-island consortium of partner organisations, including health agencies and universities, with the aim of improving the experience of palliative care on the island of Ireland by developing knowledge, promoting learning, implementing policy and shaping practice.  The institute received the bulk of its funding from Atlantic Philanthropies, with additional funding from a range of sources, including our consortium partners, the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Hospice Foundation.  Our initial funding package runs from 2010 until the end of 2015.  Our work focuses on education, research and policy, and practice, with cross-cutting themes of ensuring the meaningful involvement of users, carers and communities, developing a coherent and collaborative palliative care community, supporting the delivery of innovative and high quality education and research, and using knowledge and learning to influence palliative care policy and improve practice.</p><p>  I will take the opportunity to outline briefly some of our areas of work.  We have established a palliative care research network with the aim of offering all-Ireland palliative care research community opportunities to engage in a collaborative environment which supports the development of high quality, clinically relevant and innovative projects aimed at advancing palliative care.  Current research strands include the pathways towards social justice, understanding equality and inclusion in palliative care project; and the measurement and evaluation of outcomes of palliative care.  These strands are being investigated by academics across both jurisdictions, including researchers in UCD and TCD.  The research network has attracted health funding, most significantly from the Health Research Board in the Republic of Ireland, while other research projects have been funded by the research development office of the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland and the Irish Cancer Society.  The network continues to grow and expand.</p><p>  Our second major initiative is the education network.  We have established a network of approximately 50 organisations, including education providers, funders and commissioners, that come together to ensure palliative care learning opportunities are accessible and of the highest quality.  Through the education network, we have engaged with palliative care educators to develop online learning resources to educate health and social care professionals, people with palliative care needs and their carers.</p><p>  As part of our voices for care initiative, we recruited a panel of people with palliative care needs, their carers and citizens with an interest in palliative care to help oversee and inform our work.  The panel is consulted by means of face to face meetings and electronic communications.  In 2014 we co-ordinated the Let's Talk About survey, an innovative approach to finding out the views and lived experiences of service users and their carers in both jurisdictions.  What we have learned from phase one is being fed into relevant agencies, including those in the statutory sector.  A second stage survey and ensuing report will be developed in 2015.  The palliative care awareness week initiative was developed by the institute and ran from 6 to 11 October 2014.  The campaign aimed to inform people about palliative care and how it could help to improve quality of life for people with serious or progressive conditions.  There was major stakeholder involvement in the campaign which secured extensive national, regional and local media coverage.  Initial results from the evaluation of the campaign suggest it was successful in educating the public about palliative care.</p><p>  The final area of our work is the palliative care hub which aims to be a gateway for palliative care information for the entire community.  The hub has four major components.  The children and young people palliative care hub was launched earlier this year by the Chairman.  I am grateful also to Senator Mary Moran and Deputy Michael P. Kitt for attending the launch.  The children and young people palliative care hub is a website which provides a portal to information on palliative care for children and young people on the island of Ireland.  It is primarily aimed at assisting parents, guardians and carers in understanding children's palliative care and seeks to filter the wide range of information available on the Internet.  The site was developed on foot of the needs identified by health and social care professionals and owing to the difficulties parents faced in finding reliable information at times of great stress.  Its development was overseen by a working group which included children's palliative care organisations from across the island such as Northern Ireland Children's Hospice, the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation and LauraLynn which had come together to steer our work.</p> <p>I will highlight two important areas of the site, each of which has input from professionals who offer their experience and advice on caring for a child and contains links to further relevant information sources.  The first area describes the palliative journey, and breaks into very broad terms the stages a family and child may go through during their time within palliative care services from diagnosis and prognosis onwards.  The second area contains personal stories from parents and families whose children have received or are receiving palliative care.  It is hoped that the shared experience of these stories will give other families in a similar position insight into palliative care.  Initial feedback from parents tells us that the personal stories section is their favourite section of the site.  The site also provides links to condition-specific organisations, support services and Government agencies available in both jurisdictions.  Over time, the site will continue to develop to continue to meet the needs of parents and we will work to market the site with the aim of ensuring parents and families who receive a diagnosis of a life-limiting condition can access the information they need.<br/>The institute has developed the Palliative Hub learning platform with the overarching goal of providing an online learning environment for professionals and the public to learn about palliative care and build on their knowledge.  The platform contains a number of palliative care online education programmes targeted at those groups.  The institute continues to engage with palliative care educators regarding the development of further modules with the aim of ensuring the learning platform is the focal point for palliative care education on the island.<br/>The professional, academic and research site is under development and will provide resources for health and social care professionals and researchers involved in palliative care.  A group of senior nurses from both jurisdictions has developed the first component of the site, <i>nurses-grapevine.com</i>, which provides a virtual network for nurses working in palliative care to come together to share ideas and exchange information.  The adult and public site is also in development and will provide information and resources for people who have palliative care needs, their carers and the wider public.  The site will be similar to the children&rsquo;s site as it will be a portal with links to existing resources and services while providing valuable information.<br/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak about the institute, its work and its efforts to support collaboration across the island.</p></speech>

I was not familiar with her institute.  From where did the initiative to establish the organisation in 2011 come?  What are its sources of income?

The Chairman launched the report and I was honoured to attend the launch, where the emphasis on children came across.  There are issues with regard to funding the services that the institute provides for children on an all-island basis.  I presume this has been asked about.  How do children's services differ from adult services?  The issue of front-line services came across in the presentation.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Kitt, I was at the launch and I congratulate Ms Charnley on her work.  Could she speak about funding?  I ask her also to talk about reaching out into the more rural areas of the country and the support the institute provides there, from Donegal to Cork and in the Border region.  Does she find any barriers along the way?</p></speech>

How many staff does the institute have?  What is the extent of its links with hospice care?  Much of the work is online.  There is a danger that people may self-diagnose online, and I wonder about the extent of person-to-person engagement by the institute, particularly regarding people who have mental health issues.</p></speech>

From his work it was proposed that an institute was needed to bring together organisations interested in palliative care across the island.  Our partners, including the hospice education providers and universities, undertook work to develop the model for the all-island institute.</p><p>  We were fortunate to receive a substantial grant from Atlantic Philanthropies.  We also receive funding from the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Public Health Agency and the Health Research Board, among others.  While we receive funding for specific projects, our main funding came from Atlantic Philanthropies.</p><p>  We have partners from both the North and South of Ireland.  We work with six hospices, Marie Curie Cancer Care and Northern Ireland Hospice in Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, St. Francis Hospice, Our Lady's Hospice, Milford Care Centre and Marymount University Hospital and Hospice.  We work across three main themes, namely, education, policy and practice, and research.  We always work across both jurisdictions and seek to collaborate with organisations.  For example, on the children's and young people's Palliative Hub site, we sought to link in with the active organisations involved and professionals working in the different health systems, such as consultants, nurses and different leads.</p><p>  The children and young people's Palliative Hub is a good example of our North-South work.  Our head of research works part time for us and also works within University of Ulster.  We have leads for the different research areas from University of Ulster, Queen's University, UCD, Trinity College, Maynooth University, NUIG, the University of Limerick and UCC.</p> <p>We are very much linking with the different centres in universities and the researchers in them to take forward the palliative care research agenda.  That is one example of how we are collaborating on a North-South basis.</p><p> Deputy Kitt asked about funding.  As one member rightly said, we are not a front-line service provider but we very much link in with the palliative care sector and those who provide a palliative care approach in hospitals and front-line services and those providing specialist palliative care in hospices, homes and day care centres in hospices.  We aim to support them by giving them resources such as online learning and new research that will impact on their practice.  I outlined our funding models and we support palliative care providers to source additional funding for their services.</p><p> Senator Moran referred to rural areas.  We have recently undertaken a project to identify community learning needs with the Carers Association and Carers Trust Northern Ireland.  The project undertook focus groups and has a working group of carers who have experienced palliative care services.  The project aims to give us a clear steer on how we can meet the community learning needs relating to palliative care both in terms of online resources, for example, videos and paper resources.  We are conscious that everything cannot be delivered online.  The project will give us recommendations, which we will then go forward with to look at ways in which we can engage with, for example, rural communities.  We are also conscious of the barriers in terms of online learning and the provision of online resources and, therefore, it may be that with the children's site, we will produce a paper edition with relevant information that can be handed to people if they do not have access to the website.</p><p> We aim to support our hospice partners in supporting rural communities.  One example is Foyle Hospice.  We have education fellowships which will enable professionals to go on a site visit to learn about best practice.  One of the members of the team in Foyle Hospice visited a Compassionate Communities project, which operates out of Severn Hospice in Bristol.  That project looks at getting the community to support people with palliative care needs.  A similar project operates out of Milford Care Centre.  We supported the professional to do the site visit and the Foyle Hospice is looking at rolling that out as a pilot project in its area.  We are very much trying to facilitate and develop capacity within the sector.</p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan asked about staff numbers.  We are a small team of approximately eight members.  We are small in number but, hopefully, powerful.  We have good links with all the hospices across the island.  Six of the hospices are our partners but we also engage with other hospices that are not direct partners.  For example, we have a senior nurse network, of which nurses from those hospices and hospitals are members and there are representatives from the majority of hospices on the island on the education network and they guide our work in terms of education.  We are conscious of online education.  We want to make the learning platform as easy as possible for people to log on to and access materials.  If people have difficulties, we have telephone numbers and e-mail addresses through which they can contact us to provide them with support</p></speech>

There is more that we could progress if we were a larger organisation but we try to prioritise our efforts.  One example is the Palliative Care Awareness Week.  The institute provided significant funding for that last year and we received good coverage in national, regional and local media. That is something we would like to run again but we are constrained by our limited funding.  That is one example of where additional funding could be required.</p><p>  I work on the palliative hub in the institute.  We want to ensure it is sustainable in the long term and that the resources can continue to be developed and added to make the sites live and keep them interesting.</p></speech>

I am aware from listening to obituaries and so on that Donegal people go to the Derry hospice and <i>vice versa</i>and, therefore, there must be an element of co-operation.  There is also a hospice in Sligo in the north west.  There must be a cross-Border understanding.  The Foyle Hospice was established by a Donegal doctor who has my surname, although he is not a relation.  I am aware of how successful these facilities are where full-time care is provided on an institutional basis and how comforting it is not only for the patients, but for their families as well.  It is a tremendous movement.</p></speech>

There was a significant gap in services for children in need for hospice care and the LauraLynn foundation filled it.  When the institute identifies a need in a particular area, does it become part of lobbying group to secure funding or to bring it to the attention of people who might be in a position to do something?</p></speech>

Is there an outreach service for rural areas?  I refer, in particular, to home care packages, which I acknowledge are expensive, but there has been a great deal of lobbying about them.  Hospices are sometimes more concerned with facilitating visits rather than providing beds.  Does any aspect of the institute's work address that in the context of rural areas?</p></speech>

The institute supports having social care providers who deliver home care or who use a palliative care approach in hospitals in order that all the care is not necessarily delivered by specialist hospice-based services.   We look to support them in the development of their practice and via educating the professionals who do the visits and to use that approach to meet people's physical, social, emotional and spiritual needs as part of the care.</p> <p>We would seek to support them in the development of their practice and, via education of the professionals who are doing the visiting, in using that approach in terms of supporting people's physical, social, emotional and spiritual needs as part of the care.</p></speech>

I refer in particular to the cross-Border element and regional or marginalised Border areas.  Is Ms Charnley aware of a need for enhanced services along the Border region at present?  Is there anything the committee can do to try to advance and lobby for an improvement in service in those areas?  Given her networking and conversations with the hospices across both parts of the island, what is required?  Is there a specific gap for adults or children in any of the Border regions?</p></speech>

It is specifically about my area of Dundalk and the work with the North Louth Hospice, which provides an excellent service.  There is also a service in Newry, which I have visited on many occasions.

Senator Moran referred to the North Louth Hospice in Dundalk and the area hospice in Newry.  I will refer back to the committee on the gaps across the services.  In Northern Ireland, the Transforming Your Palliative and End of Life Care programme, which is being run from Marie Curie Cancer Care, is looking at that in terms of what the gaps are and specific projects that can be taken forward in Northern Ireland to improve the services.  Obviously, there is work within the Republic, but I will refer back to the members with more detail.</p><p>  Will Senator Moran repeat her question?</p></speech>

I welcome those who are following our proceedings on the Oireachtas channel and online.  The subject of this meeting is health services for the Irish communities in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.  This is our first meeting with the new Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, whom I welcome before the committee.  The Minister of State is accompanied by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Madden from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The committee is also pleased to welcome a number of advocates for Irish emigrants in Britain and America.  Dr. Mary Tilki is chair and Ms Jennie McShannon is CEO of Irish in Britain.  Dr. Tilki is a recognised advocate on health issues among the Irish community in Britain and Ms McShannon has more than 20 years of experience in a range of projects supporting vulnerable members of the Irish community in Britain.  Mr. Brian O'Dwyer is a distinguished New York lawyer and highly influential activist on behalf of the Irish community in the USA, continuing the great tradition of his late father.  I also welcome a good friend of mine, Mr. Mike Carroll, who is a member of the Irish-American Bar Association of Attorneys and the Emerald Isle Immigration Centre in New York, as well as being very involved with an Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  I pay tribute to all of the witnesses for their collective efforts on behalf of the Irish diaspora.  I also welcome the following individuals in the Visitors Gallery: Mr. Cody McCone, who has come from the United States; Ms. Emer Rocke from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Mr. Brian Farren; Mrs. Linda O&rsquo;Shea Farren; Ms. Sara Carroll; and Mr. Liam Byrne.</p><p>  Before I invite the Minister of State to make his opening contribution, I remind witnesses and members about privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  As we are dealing with health issues today, it would be most appreciated if we could confine our remarks to issues pertaining to health.</p></speech>

I am also pleased to be joined by Dr. Mary Tilki and Ms Jennie McShannon from Irish in Britain, and Mr. Brian O'Dwyer and Mr. Mike Carroll from the Emerald Isle Immigration Centre in New York.  I am delighted to be sitting next to Mr. O'Dwyer.  His family have made an extraordinary contribution to public life in New York and the USA, and they have been unstinting in their support for everything Irish, both on the island of Ireland and in America.  His uncle, William O'Dwyer, was mayor of New York between 1945 and 1950.  He was in attendance as mayor on the celebrated day when Cavan beat Kerry in the Polo Grounds in New York.  He was also instrumental, with John "Kerry" O'Donnell, in securing Gaelic Park from city land, an arrangement that continues to exist.  Mr. Brian O'Dwyer's father, Paul O'Dwyer, was president of the New York city council.  All three individuals have made major contributions to Ireland over the years.  I also acknowledge Mr. O'Dwyer's colleagues, Mr. Mike Carroll and Mr. Cody McCone.</p><p>  The primary objective of the emigrant support programme, which is run by the Department of Foreign of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is to address the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable Irish emigrants.  Its areas of work that are most relevant to today's discussion are: supporting equitable access for Irish emigrants and community organisations to statutory and voluntary services; promoting the development of responses from the voluntary sector which reflect the diverse needs of the emigrant Irish community; and supporting the professional development of the Irish abroad voluntary sector and encouraging best practice and capacity building.  Since taking my position as Ireland's first Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs, I have had the opportunity to visit many of our Irish communities in traditional areas of emigration, including London, Luton, New York, Philadelphia, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth.</p> <p>I have also visited some of the newer Irish communities in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Kuala Lumpur.  In all of these locations I have witnessed the emigrant support programme at work.  I pay tribute to Dr. Tilki, Ms McShannon, Mr. O'Dwyer and Mr. Carroll and the many others like them who work day in and day out to help to improve the lives of Irish people all over the world.  Without people like them, the work the Government does and the funding provided by the emigrant support programme, ESP, for organisations that provide vital services for Irish communities would not have the impact that they do.</p><p> The emigrant support programme works in partnership with organisations such as Irish in Britain and the Emerald Isle Centre across the globe.  The main focus of the programme is to support the most vulnerable and marginalised members of the Irish community overseas.  In the main, the funding provided under the programme enhances the lives and well-being of the people it supports through outreach services for the elderly, the lonely and the vulnerable and through the provision of health services such as those provided for individuals suffering with mental health issues.  In general, it does not provide services directly, but it enables people to access the services to which they are entitled locally.</p><p> In the past ten years the emigrant support programme has provided over &euro;114 million for more than 200 organisations in more than 20 countries.  Most of the funding has been spent on welfare services, with 72% of the total budget allocation between 2009 and 2013 going to this area.  In Britain the figure is even higher, with a total of 86% of the moneys granted to Britain going on welfare services.  This funding has had a direct impact on the health and well-being of many thousands of Irish emigrants during the course of the past decade.  Although cultural and heritage projects are not directly related to health, the recent Clinton Institute report on supporting the next generation of the Irish Diaspora highlighted the therapeutic impact of culture on the Irish Diaspora as a whole.  It creates an environment in which people can celebrate and be proud of their Irish identity.</p><p> In order to give a sense of the depth and breadth of the emigrant support programme and the type of work it supports, I will highlight a number of projects which are supported.  While not all of them provide direct health services, these culturally sensitive programmes contribute greatly to both the physical and mental health of some of our most vulnerable country men and women.  Monica's Place in Birmingham specialises in taking care of elderly Irish men with significant alcohol issues in the Birmingham area.  It provides accommodation in three residential houses and also assists this vulnerable group with practical, social and emotional support to meet their physical and mental health needs.</p><p> The emigrant support programme supports a number of housing associations in the United Kingdom, for example, Innisfree Housing Association, in providing homes for vulnerable Irish people.  The programme also provides funding for a significant number of elders groups in the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere that provide outreach services, meals, companionship, education, arts and crafts and music, as well as other practical health initiatives such as keep fit classes and specialist groups for those coping with Alzheimer's disease.  Dr. Tilki has done a lot of work in the area of memory loss and the cuimhne programme run by Irish in Britain is a wonderful example of this.  It was for this and much more of the work done by her that Dr. Tilki received a Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad in 2013.  The primary aim of the elders groups is to ensure the older members of the community do not become isolated or withdrawn and that they remain as active and healthy as possible throughout their later years.</p><p> Welfare centres in Australia provide support for the full range of the Irish community there, from the older emigrants to the young people who travel around Australia as backpackers.  When I was in Australia recently, I had a chance to meet he people who run these centres and hear first-hand the stories of the people, young and old, whom they help.  Also while in Australia, I met a group called Irish Families in Perth.  This group came into being to provide support for families newly arrived or moving to Australia.  With more than 2,000 members, it helps young families to integrate into life in Australia, while at the same time, encouraging them to be part of the vibrant Irish community there.  </p><p> In the United States the emigrant support programme is an important partner in the work of Irish immigration centres across America such as the Emerald Isle Immigration Centre, including its umbrella organisation, the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, CIIC.  These centres, similar to those in Britain and Australia, provide outreach services for those who are vulnerable, including the elderly and those with substance abuse issues.  A key role for the centres is providing support for the undocumented Irish who are rendered vulnerable by their status, which can have a negative impact on their physical and mental well-being.  I am delighted that President Obama recently took executive action on the issue of immigration reform, allowing those who meet the criteria and register to be protected from deportation and given temporary legal status.  Applications for this programme will open in six months.  While this will by no means resolve the issue for all of the undocumented Irish, it will help a considerable number of them.  Those living without documentation have lived with the stress and strain of their situation.  I have spoken recently to Irish people living in the United States who have created employment there, who are paying taxes but who are living in constant fear of a knock on the door from the authorities.  They live in constant fear that their families will be broken up.  They live, too, with the fear of being in an accident or requiring medical treatment they cannot afford.  I hope this action will bring some relief for such families.  I acknowledge the work of people such as Mr. Billy Lawless, Mr. Ciaran Staunton, Ms Celine Kennelly and others in America, as well as Mr. O'Dwyer, in influencing the decision.</p><p> For those who do not qualify under President Obama's action and to ensure a long-term resolution of this issue, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and I will continue to press for comprehensive immigration reform by way of legislative action, as will the embassy and consulates in the United States.  Since the announcement, the immigration centres, in conjunction with the embassy and consulates, have held public information sessions with immigration lawyers to provide people with as much information as possible and avoid any situation where people could be taken advantage of.  I strongly urge people in the United States seeking information on the changes to contact their nearest immigration centres as a first step.  These immigration centres have received &euro;1.3 million in funding from the emigrant support programme in 2014 and over &euro;12 million since 2004, showing the depth of the commitment successive Governments have had to Irish immigrants in the United States.</p><p> I am very concerned about the mental health of Irish emigrants.  This issue has come up during the consultation process for the Diaspora policy review and also in the recent report on the emigrant support programme.  The programme supports a number of mental health projects, primarily in Britain, that provide counselling services for those in distress.  Organisations such as Immigrant Counselling and Psychotherapy, ICAP; Console which has in recent years expanded its services to the United Kingdom; New Horizons, and Mind Yourself provide vital services for the people concerned.  The Coalition of Immigration Centres in the United States has done much work in this area, including the roll-out of suicide prevention training using the QPR &ndash; question, persuade and refer - steps across the immigration centres they represent.  The GAA is also playing a role in raising awareness and providing support for those who need it.  When I was in Perth recently, I launched, with Mr. Liam O'Neill, the GAA's striving and surviving in Australia resource, which is online and has attracted much attention.</p><p> I am delighted to announce that we are, for the first time, providing funding for Pieta House to support its work internationally among emigrants.  Pieta House will this week receive a grant of $90,200, or &euro;72,258, to help to introduce its crisis intervention services in the United States for those considering suicide and self-harm.  It will pilot the project in conjunction with the three main Irish centres in New York, namely, the Aisling Centre, the New York Irish Centre and the Emerald Isle Immigration Centre which Mr. O'Dwyer and Mr. Carroll represent.  I recently visited the three centres and recognise the work of the directors, Ms Siobh&aacute;n Dennehy of the Emerald Isle Centre, Mr. Paul Finnegan of the New York Irish Centre and Ms Orla Kelleher of the Aisling Centre.</p> <p>This pilot project will create a "Pieta Room" in the New York Irish Centre and will be the main point of referral for Irish people in crisis in the New York area.  In addition, Pieta House will work with the GAA to bring the Pieta &ldquo;Mind Your Buddy&rdquo; campaign to GAA clubs in New York.  </p><p> Once again, I am delighted to appear before the committee to discuss how the health and well-being of our emigrants is at the core of the work of the emigrant support programme and the Irish abroad unit in my Department.  It is fundamental to much of what we do and as the first ever Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, it gives me great pleasure to be in a position to highlight the work that is supported by this programme and bring focus to the issues that impact on the lives of our families overseas.</p></speech>

Although there are problems with statistics because of the way in which data about the Irish are collected and aggregated into the overall white ethnicity category, our recent analyses of the 2011 census in the UK shows us continuing evidence of poor health among Irish people in Britain.  Irish people in England have among the highest levels of limiting long-term illness, LLTI, and self-reported poor health and Irish Travellers have even worse patterns of LLTI and self-reported poor health.  The Irish have an older age profile with a median age of 53 compared to 42 for the general British population and this is also significantly older than other minority ethnic groups.  While age explains some health problems, it does not explain all the ill-health and premature mortality.</p><p>  There is excess and sometimes increasing mortality among Irish men and women from heart disease, hypertension and stroke and the Irish have the highest mortality rates from cancer in the population.  Patterns of ill-health improve across generations but some of this ill-health is still transmitted into the second and third generation, which is unusual because migrant groups usually revert to the pattern of the host population within a generation.  We are, therefore, very different in this regard.  There is evidence that material hardship, occupation, lifestyle and age all play a part in poor health but they do not explain the full picture.  There is limited knowledge about uptake of screening, access to GPs, hospital services and treatment outcomes because of the failure of the UK Government to collect or analyse data about the Irish.  A major part of our work is representing this issue to the department of health, the NHS and the government in general.  We have an opportunity because there is a great deal of reorganisation and reform going on in the health service.  That can be a barrier but also an opportunity.  Ms McShannon will outline how we are dealing with that.</p><p>  Irish people have the highest mortality rates from most cancers in England and Wales and unlike patterns in wider society, they are not declining as quickly.  Sadly, there are still some cases of increasing mortality.  There is evidence that even where the incidence is similar to that of the general population, mortality rates are still higher, which suggests there are barriers to treatment.  Recent figures from the London Health Observatory, which are only for London, show high admission rates for most cancers than would be expected for the city's population.  Some of these figures would be replicated in other cities.</p><p>  Smoking rates are declining slowly in the Irish community and there are issues around obesity, nutrition and alcohol, which mainstream health programmes are not addressing.  These programmes get at some sections of the community but not all.  Research and our work with clients demonstrates that fear and beliefs about cancer, and embarrassment, particularly about reproductive and excretory organs, stop people from accessing help and benefiting from early diagnosis and treatment.  We work with community organisations to raise awareness of cancer and to get people talking about it and learning the value of early diagnosis.  I attended a cancer conference on Tuesday and I am pleased that the Secretary of State for Health announced a focus on early diagnosis and one year survival rates from cancer.  We hope to get some benefits from that in the not too distant future.</p><p>  However, apart from people's beliefs and failure to access services, we strongly suspect that because many Irish live in areas of multiple deprivation, they are not getting the timely or effective treatment they deserve.  We hear repeatedly of people fobbed off by doctors or being misdiagnosed, often around alcohol, and of people who do not have the confidence, health or strength to assert their needs and get what they deserve.  Much of our work is with the NHS Clinical Commissioning Board, Public Health England and various cancer charities to get more information about the Irish community and to analyse data.  I had a short conversation with the NHS national clinical director for cancer services.  He is a nice Irishman, Mr. Sean Duffy, and I hope we have him on side to address some of these issues.</p><p>  As the Minister of State mentioned, we have great concerns about mental health and long-term illness relating to depression and anxiety.  There is research evidence that second generation Irish people who grew up in material hardship and who had parents in poor physical health or psychological distress show greater psychological problems than children of non-Irish parents.  Alcohol is always a sensitive issue in our community.  We have high patterns of abstinence but also patterns of binge drinking and alcohol misuse.  There is also evidence that patterns of heavy alcohol use transfer from one generation to the next.  We as organisations must address that and we have had a number of programmes about it.</p><p>  The Count Me in Census, covering inpatient mental health admissions between 2005 and 2010, repeatedly demonstrated high admission rates among Irish people aged over 50 and this is often related to physical disability as well.  We have evidence of poor mental and physical health ill-health in men from approximately 50 onwards, leading to them having to leave the labour market.  Many of them then get into a vicious cycle of inactivity, depression and alcohol use.  Some of our activities are about addressing those.  Ms McShannon will also address this.</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the high levels of suicide and there is good statistical evidence from the UK that the rates are not coming down as they are in the general population.  There is much work to be done in this regard.</p><p>  The Irish have an old age profile and this, along with a number of other factors, predisposes them to dementia.  Irish organisations frequently deal with older people with memory loss or those who care for older people with memory problems.</p> <p>Our Irish organisations are frequently dealing with older people who either have memory loss, think they have memory loss or are caring for people with memory problems.  We do not have great diagnosis rates in the UK but I imagine Irish diagnosis rates are probably even lower.  The figures the Alzheimer's Society uses to calculate prevalence suggest that there might be approximately 10,000 Irish people in England with dementia which is undiagnosed.  I believe this underestimates the impact of the high levels of cardiovascular disease in the community.  Social isolation related to poverty and where older Irish people live enhances the risk and also confounds the ability of older Irish people to get help.  We also know that Irish Travellers, who have very low life expectancy anyway, appear to be suffering disproportionately from young age dementia.</p><p> As Irish people are white and speak English, their need for culturally sensitive care is not widely recognised.  Although older Irish people have spent decades in England, things such as the Troubles and discrimination led many to lead quite insular lives in closed communities.  There is widespread recognition that migrants from the Caribbean, India, Pakistan and other parts of the world need culturally sensitive care in old age, particularly when they have dementia, but there is not the same widespread recognition that Irish people deserve culturally sensitive care.  This can make for a very lonely and frightening experience for somebody who is old, particularly somebody who is old with memory problems, when they are in hospital, a care home or often in their own home with help from external services.</p><p> The staff cannot or cannot be bothered to understand Irish accents or to learn to pronounce Irish names and they have little knowledge of the culture or the background of the people they are looking after, often making stereotypical assumptions about them.  Family carers caring for somebody in their own home have the right to request a care worker who is Irish but are often treated as being racist if they ask for that, whereas it is generally accepted that somebody from India or Pakistan would be entitled to a care worker from that cultural background.  Dementia is obviously frightening for people.  When people cannot speak, their emotions and their sense of what is happening around them becomes even more important.  It is particularly important that people with memory problems are cared for in as familiar an environment as possible and that activities such as reminiscence or cognitive stimulation take account of their culture.  They require volunteers and staff who understand something of their background and that if an older person is agitated or difficult they might be recalling some point in their lives, such as a very difficult childhood, abuse in institutions or things people have suppressed for many years, for example, the unmarried mothers or people who have left Ireland because of their sexual orientation.  We do not wish to be prescriptive about that, but it helps if people understand and generally Irish members of staff do.</p><p> The Minister referred to Cuimhne, the Irish memory loss campaign.  We have already trained approximately 100 volunteers in different parts of England to make them more aware of dementia and how to communicate confidently with Irish people.  We are working with several organisations to help them become more dementia friendly.  Innisfree Housing Association has already been mentioned.  We have been fortunate recently, through Jennie McShannon's good efforts, to be able to attract &pound;68,000 of three year funding for a part-time volunteer co-ordinator to recruit older volunteers as what we will call "Cuimhne champions" to champion the cause, help our organisations become more dementia friendly and help older people in our Irish community.  We are also leading the work with Brent local authority in outer London, the local authority that has the highest population of Irish people and, indeed, other immigrants.  There are three Irish organisations in Brent and we have been working with other minority ethnic communities, groups such as the Alzheimer's Society, Age UK and a very big inter-faith group to try to make that borough more dementia friendly.</p><p> There is a great deal more to be done but time precludes me talking about that.  Jennie McShannon will be able to say more about what we are doing to address some of these issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Dwyer" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014121100006#F00500"><p>I thank the committee for its kind invitation.  I have served for many years as the chairman of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center.  It is located in Queens and the Bronx, New York, from which we provide all forms of legal and social services to our Irish immigrants.  This year we celebrate the 26th anniversary of the centre.  I acknowledge the presence of my colleagues Mr. Mike Carroll and Mr. Cody McCone who have worked with me over the years on behalf of Irish immigrants and Ireland in general.</p><p>  I am delighted that this committee, by this invitation, has signalled to the island of Ireland its concern for the immigrants, both documented and undocumented, living in the United States.  Since the committee's kind invitation, profound events involving many of our immigrants have taken place in Washington, D.C., and I will use a portion of my time to explain the significance of those events.</p><p>  On 20 November, President Obama announced a sweeping executive action of US immigration policy that will have monumental effects on many Irish Immigrants living in the US.  For years the president has urged Congress to enact comprehensive immigration reform and, in fact, the US Senate passed a comprehensive Bill that met with extensive bipartisan support.  Unfortunately, despite that Bill and despite the fact that if presented to the House it would have passed, the leadership in the House of Representatives blocked the Bill from being considered.  As a result, the action the president took was not as far-reaching as we would have liked, but was probably the best he could do legally.</p><p>  President Obama&rsquo;s action will benefit those Irish living in the US for more than five years and who have children who were born in the US.  Those eligible Irish living in the US will have the ability to register for the programme, pay their taxes and pass a criminal background check.  They in turn will be given deferred action for three years, which means that they will be able to work in the US and be free from the fear of deportation.  We believe this action will possibly affect as many as half of the undocumented Irish living in the US.  While current estimates of 50,000 undocumented have been suggested, my experience tells me that there are far more than that currently present in the US and that when we start processing the requests for executive action we will see much greater numbers than have been previously postulated.</p><p>  Of course, President Obama&rsquo;s action is not all for which we would hope.  It does not benefit those who have recently arrived in the United States or those who do not have American born children.  There are many who have been in the US for over five years without children.  It is an executive order, which means that the next president can rescind it, and it is not a pathway to citizenship.  While not yet explicit in the president's action, we believe that the deferred action will allow our immigrants an ability to travel home for humanitarian reasons.  We will be working with the White House along with other immigrant groups to assure the broadest possible permission to travel for those affected by the president&rsquo;s order. </p><p>  All members of this committee are aware of the stress and prolonged heartbreak that have beset our immigrants when they have been unable to travel home to attend to dying or sick parents or siblings.  Probably the most heartbreaking part of my work and the work of the immigration centre is to tell an immigrant that they cannot go home to their mother's funeral.</p> <p>We are confident we will be able to alleviate this stress for many of our undocumented immigrants.  As I stated, we will work diligently with the Executive department - President Obama's office - to ensure travel permissions are as broad as possible and, at a minimum, the 50% of Irish immigrants affected by the order will be able to go home for humanitarian reasons. </p><p> I thank the Taoiseach and Department of Foreign affairs for their tireless and effective advocacy and support for Irish immigrants in the United States.  I also publicly acknowledge and thank the Irish ambassador to the United States, Ms Anne Anderson, for her work on the issue of the undocumented.  Since her arrival to the United States, she has made this issue a core priority.  The consul generals in New York, including the current consul general, Ms Barbara Jones, have been vital partners in our work. </p><p> I am especially grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, the Chairman, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, and the many members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad who have travelled to the United States to champion the cause of the Irish in the US.  Without them, this important step would not have been taken.  I also thank all the political parties in the Oireachtas for their continued support of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center.  I am pleased to note that support for Irish emigrants to the United States has never been the subject of political debate on this island and for that I am also grateful, as are all the Irish immigrants living in the United States. </p><p> We will count on the groundwork we have in place and will seek additional funding from the Government to ensure we are in a position to help as many Irish applicants as possible from the date the scheme opens in May 2015.  We calculate that, between May of next year and the end of the current Administration, we will help thousands of potential applicants in New York city and across the east coast of the United States.  Our vision will include the enhancement of current services to ensure legal resources are available at every level and our social service delivery can be maximised to meet possible further growth.  I will take a moment to explain what this will entail.  It is our belief that when the executive action comes into force, many of our people who have been trapped in cash jobs which are below their skill levels will be able to secure employment or training that correspond to their skill levels.  Once this measure is implemented, our job will be more complex than simply processing immigrants who can take advantage of the executive action and will involve training and finding work that was previously not attainable because of immigrants' undocumented status.</p><p> Unfortunately, the undocumented are not eligible for public assistance, although they may receive benefits necessary for their health and survival.  This means that while they are covered for visits to emergency rooms in the case of catastrophic illness, routine medical procedures are not covered.  As members are aware, the individuals in question tend to postpone or defer completely preventative care and treatment for minor medical issues, thus placing themselves at risk of experiencing even worse health outcomes.  The Emerald Isle Immigration Center has been able to work with the city and State of New York to secure free health care for children.  Many Irish immigrants mistakenly believe their children do not have medical cover because they do not have green cards.  Regardless of status, all children are covered by the State of New York for all types of medical care.  It is important that we get this message out to the community.</p><p> Similarly, the elderly are also eligible for all types of medical care, irrespective of status.  Our job is to ensure they are provided with complete access to medical care, even where they do not have documentation.  Unfortunately, immigrants who do not fall into these two categories - the elderly and children - experience substantial problems in this area. </p><p> The centre's meals on wheels programme has borne great fruit.  Using a large group of volunteers, our centre in The Bronx provides daily hot meals delivered directly to elderly people.  The initiative provides a sense of companionship as someone will look in on the elderly every day, thus allowing them to maintain their dignity while living at home.  We would like to expand the programme in the Bronx and extend it to Queens.  When the electricity supply was cut off in the Bronx during Hurricane Sandy our volunteers climbed 12 flights of stairs every day to look in on the elderly until power was restored.  </p><p> Recently, we were able to help a 64 year old man who had been working as a cook in the Bronx.  He suffered an accident, was unable to work and had no insurance.  We were able to get him admitted to hospital for surgery.  Unfortunately, he did not have access to social services or physiotherapy but we were able to find a way for him to return to Ireland and receive the support of his family to help him recover.  Unfortunately, repatriation is one of the only ways we can help immigrants with certain types of injuries. </p><p> Sadly, the issue of suicide, to which the two previous speakers referred, is ever present in our immigrant population.  Unfortunately, the Irish community in Queens has experienced several suicides and many such deaths are not reported as suicide.  One suicide is one death too many.  The considerable success the centre has achieved in this area has gone unreported.  We take the issue of mental health very seriously and our social workers in the Bronx and Queens have been very successful in intervening at an early stage to provide health supports.  We welcome the initiative taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, in providing additional resources to the community to deal with this serious problem and look forward to collaborating with partner agencies and the wonderful team of consular staff in New York in this regard.</p><p> The Emerald Isle Immigration Center appreciates the interest, assistance and support of the committee.  I urge each and every member to visit one of the centre's offices in the Bronx and Queens.  I believe they would be impressed with the hard work and outreach done by our staff and volunteers.  I hope they will take the opportunity to visit us.  </p><p> The health issues of the community are extensive due in no small part to the lack of health services provided to the undocumented.  However, with the committee's help we, at the centre, are meeting these challenges.  President Obama's action, by providing employment and thus health insurance, will go a long way towards alleviating many of these problems.  The ultimate solution, however, is to regularise the status of each and every Irish immigrant in the United States.  It is time, once and for all, that the sign "Irish need not apply" was ripped down form the borders of the United States.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh. </p></speech>

It is important that the joint committee hear from Ms McShannon.  I invite her to make some brief remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.558" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jennie McShannon" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014121100007#G00300"><p>I thank the joint committee for inviting us to this hearing.  I will make some concluding remarks which will draw on the comments of Dr. Tilki.</p> <p>She referred to the need for us to continually engage the policy makers and people who influence decisions and to our work within the community to address these health concerns.  It is very much a continuous job.  The regular turnover of policy makers in specific health areas makes it a difficult task.  It is also made more difficult by the fact that it is increasingly difficult to secure funding for or generate discussion about the lack of access to services for the Irish and other ethnic groups.</p><p> In response to these health and interlinked social care issues, we need a combined approach.  This entails continual lobbying of the various government departments, such as Public Health England, and of the parliamentary committees, such as the all-party parliamentary groups on dementia, cancer or cardiovascular disease, to press for Irish health concerns and to make the case for the Irish dimension to be included in policy and practice.  We also work closely with the leading not-for-profit organisations in the United Kingdom, such as Bowel Cancer UK and the Alzheimer's Society to enable and pressurise them to make the case for us.  </p><p> We work extensively with the local Irish community press, Irish TV and radio in Britain to raise awareness of health concerns within the community, starting conversations that are usually avoided within the community and paving the way for more open dialogue and action on the more serious health issues.  A large part of our work, especially that funded through the emigrant support programme, is to work directly with the front-line Irish support services to develop their capacity to provide health focused initiatives and to challenge poor access at a local level, working in partnership with local health charities and developing activities which reduce the health risks.  Many of the more professional organisations that make up our membership are dogged in their efforts to engage local health commissioners and commissioning groups and go to them armed with the data, the reports and the health fact sheets we can provide to them.</p><p> I know time is limited, but I would like to re-emphasise how important it is that we harness our culture and that our support is a way of generating better health.  We can harness our culture as an end in itself.  Bringing Irish people together in cultural settings appropriate to their age and interests contributes to their well-being in itself, but it is also a means to an end.  It is a way to get people to together initially, but it is also a way to get them then to avail of the many activities beneficial to their physical and mental health.</p><p> Our organisation, Irish in Britain, works in partnership with the front-line Irish cultural and community support services to create what we believe is a full and comprehensive response to these long-standing and emerging health needs.  We are primarily funded by the Irish Government in the face of a chronic lack of funding alternatives in Britain.  We work together to do our best.  The Irish voluntary and community sector which makes up our membership is extremely grateful to the Government for its sustained support, despite the difficult economic times Ireland has been through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014121100008#H00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the important work they do.  Sometimes the work done for Irish people abroad, particularly in advocating for people who have fallen on hard times, goes unappreciated here.  I refer also to the work in the context of the legal loophole that has caused significant misery for undocumented Irish people in the United States and the continual campaign on that.  Perhaps when Mr. O'Dwyer has finished working on that in the US, he will come to Ireland where we also have issues in regard to how we deal with some of the immigrants to our shores.  Unfortunately, there might be work to keep him busy for a long time.</p><p>  There have been consistent waves of emigration to the United Kingdom and the United States.  In more recent times, we may have applauded ourselves and appeased our consciences somewhat by assuming and telling ourselves that those emigrating now are better educated and can sustain themselves in Britain, Australia or the United States.  However, there is always a cohort that slips through that net.  It happens in Ireland and is bound to happen elsewhere.</p><p>  In regard to the profile of our emigrants, the witnesses have pointed out that the Irish community in the United Kingdom is getting elderly.  Many of those people who emigrated in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s would have gone into the types of occupation where there was little health and safety awareness at the time.  I refer primarily to the construction industry.  I assume our witnesses see many of these emigrants come towards the end of their lives in poor mental and physical health.  Many of them had poor educational standards and many of them may now feel isolated because their peers have moved on or passed away.  In that environment, is there more we can do to support Irish communities and centres abroad?  What can we do to assist those people who are on the verge of falling away from society completely?</p><p>  I have been to New York, London, Liverpool and elsewhere many times and when visiting Irish bars or communities one can sense there is a cohort of people in a desperate situation.  I have noticed, particularly in the past number of years, that more people are dying abroad with no family support.  Sometimes we are contacted, mainly by people in rural areas, such as west Cork or Mayo, asking if we can do something for these people.  It is sad to see that people reach the end of life and have no support or family around for them.  This is not a criticism of the Irish centres abroad, but an observation of the fact that we need to do more on this for people who have fallen on hard times.  These emigrants have removed themselves from society and their own communities and then seem to have dropped out.  How are we to keep in contact with them?  Often they drift from bedsit to bedsit and it is difficult to keep in communication with them.  How are we to do that?</p><p>  Reference was made to the health of the second generation Irish community in the United Kingdom.  I am concerned by what was said.  We all accept that young people go abroad, where they may work and play hard, and that their health outcomes might not be what they should be.  However, second generation family members are falling into that same trap.  What is the reason for this?  What observations would the witnesses make in that regard?  Is it something inherent in the Irish make-up?  Mention was made of the Caribbean, Pakistani and Indian communities, which do not seem to follow the same pattern and whose second generation picks itself up quickly.</p><p>  In regard to mental health, there is no point pretending all is well.  There have been stains on us in terms of how, for example, we dealt with young girls who got pregnant outside of marriage or people of different sexual orientation and the stigmas attached to that which caused these people to leave Ireland.  I assume and hope emigration for these reasons has slowed down and that there is not the same level of these people going abroad or that not as many people are presenting in the United Kingdom with these challenges.  It was not always to better their lives that these people went to the United Kingdom but to avoid bringing shame on their families.  </p><p>  Can the witnesses give us some advice on what we can do? Our record on what we have done to help those abroad is not great.  We have not embraced our emigrant communities as much as we should, other than through nostalgia, in terms of hard core support.</p></speech>

It was a pleasure to hear the presentations from Irish in Britain and the deputation from the United States.  I will address the points in the order they came.  Dr. Tilki was first.  The health profile that Dr. Tilki has shared with us of the Irish in Britain is concerning.  Sadly, it reflects the story at home in many ways.  Dr. Tilki outlined the probable factors in her presentation, but are there any other factors we should consider?  She suggested those outlined were not the only ones.  Are there any other factors that contribute to these statistics?</p><p>  Dr. Tilki's presentation addressed not only what might be seen as the immigrant community, she referred to second generation Irish as well.  This was reflected by Mr. O'Dwyer too.  It is singularly important.  These people feel every bit as Irish as we who have been born on this island do and that needs to be acknowledged.  They are often, although not always, Irish passport holders and very proud of their parental roots.  They identify and empathise with all that we are and it is important that we address their issues and needs in this overall discussion.</p><p>  We have discussed supports from home.  Could Dr. Tilki and Ms McShannon outline the position from a British experience?  What supports does the host central government provide in terms of the critical work that Irish in Britain is doing, given that the organisation deals with people who are resident on the island of Britain?  Obviously that Government has a major responsibility.</p><p>  What is the level of engagement between Irish in Britain and the local authorities?  I notice that Irish in Britain is engaging with Brent Council.  I gather this is in the context of the Cuimhne Champions, a mighty undertaking.  It is inspirational and something we should consider at home.  I am dealing with dementia in my family.  Many of us have this experience, particularly given an ageing population, although the problem presents in younger years for some, all too sadly.  I was greatly taken by the reference to Cuimhne Champions.  Will Dr. Tilki give us a sense of the engagement with local authorities?  Is there funding or support?  Is there an awareness, a realisation and an acceptance of the critical work Irish in Britain does for people who are domiciled in certain areas for which local authorities are responsible?</p><p>  Mr. O'Dwyer referred to the Obama initiative.  It generated great interest at home; there is no question about that.  I accept what Mr. O'Dwyer said about the US President being constrained by virtue of the political reality that he has to work within, but this is subject to a timeframe.  Some 50% of the undocumented will become documented.  Does Mr. O'Dwyer have any concerns for what might be down the road?  It is a major step.  It is not coming in until May but perhaps not everyone who can qualify has made up their mind.  What about parents of US-born children?  What are the consequences for them?  Are there downsides?  Are there fears in terms of Mr. O'Dwyer's knowledge and engagement with people in Washington?  It would be great if he could assuage any such fears for us today.  This is what I want to be addressed above all.  Of course the truth is the most important thing and we must deal with the facts.</p><p>  Mr. O'Dwyer referred to New York and free health care for children.  I was not aware of this.  Up to what age do the authorities there regard children as children?  Here it is up to age 18 years.  Does it apply up to age 18 there too?  Does this apply anywhere else in the United States or is New York unique?  Is this replicated in other major population areas?</p><p>  Mr. O'Dwyer referred to a 64 year old in the Bronx.  I spent a short time working in London many years ago.  While there I met several older Irish people who were at a loss in their lives and in advanced years.  In the decades since, I have always remembered their yearning to return home.  This former chef to whom Mr. O'Dwyer referred sought to be and was successfully repatriated to Ireland.  I wish him every blessing in his agreed settlement at home.  Have there been other cases?  Is this something Mr. O'Dwyer encounters from time to time?  I will put the same question to Dr. Tilki and Ms McShannon.  Is this something that presents at Irish in Britain?  I know of it personally from a period when I worked in London.  I knew people who would have loved to be able to come home but did not have the wherewithal to do so.  Is that part of what Irish in Britain does at a local level?  My thanks to the deputations.</p></speech>

I thank all the people who presented this morning.  I will comment on Irish people who have gone abroad in the past 25 or 30 years.  A vast number of people in the professional area are now working in the United States, the UK and throughout the world.  What level of support are we getting from people who are doing exceptionally well in the UK?  I have in mind in particular people who have gone there in the past 20 years.  A member of my family worked in a hospital in London between 1991 and 1994.  The entire staff in the hospital, including nurses, consultants, junior doctors and the cleaning staff, were Irish.  The Irish in Britain representatives painted a picture here but there is another picture of people who have done extremely well as a result of going abroad.  What level of engagement is there with the people who are doing well, especially those in the upper end of the socio-economic groups?  Could we do more to make them aware that people who went in different times, for example, in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, need support?  They did not have the same educational qualifications and did not get the same opportunities.</p><p>  There is another interesting issue.  We always hear about the person who has died in the United States or the UK and of someone trying to track down relatives in Ireland who will benefit from the estate.  I have come across several cases in my legal office involving people who have left Ireland and who would benefit from Irish estates but I cannot track them down.  We do not seem to have a mechanism for tracking Irish people in the UK or the United States.  It is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  In one case I had to keep money on deposit for seven years because we could not track down the relevant person.  In the end we failed over a seven-year period to track down the person.  It is a two-way process.</p><p>  Another issue is the matter of getting information to Irish immigrants who are in the United States illegally.  What can we do from an Irish point of view?  If we have relatives who are in the US and we know they are there illegally, how can we help to get the relevant information to them, if they are afraid to try to look for information themselves?  What processes can we set up to help in this area and to help the relevant organisations transmit this information?  We have a part to play in the same way as the organisations that are doing major work in this area.  What can we do?  Are we doing enough in this area?  Where can we start making progress to help the organisations in this area?</p></speech>

I have not read Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's notes because it was the first thing I said.  I am delighted to see the Minister of State here.  He was very passionate about his previous job in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and I know the passion he has for people who live abroad, in particular Irish people.  It was obvious during his time as Minister of State in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I wish him every success because he is in the right place.</p><p>  I was saddened to hear some of the contributions, which made me think of my family, in particular my two aunts who left Ireland near the end of the Second World War.  They lived in Coventry all their lives and were part of the local community, as well as the island.  When my last aunt died a number of years ago, I went to her funeral in Coventry.  One regret we have as a family is that we never took her back to Ireland to bury her because at the time there were many complications around doing that.  I always felt that my mother had a better lifestyle during her life at home because she had connections in terms of family and friends, and a shoulder to lean on.  When I visited my mother's grave in Palmerstown, I realised that relatives have constant contact with loved ones by visiting graveyards.  I am sure the same happens all over the country, not just at Christmas or Easter.  The Irish have a great respect for those who have died, in particular family members.  I often feel saddened that I do not visit my aunt's grave.  </p><p>  I had the opportunity of visiting the Oblate Fathers in Inchicore.  I was a member of the youth overseas group to Lourdes.  I visited many Irish centres in Liverpool, Holyhead, Leeds and London and was always struck by the wonderful work done by the Oblate Fathers.  I do not know whether the witnesses' organisations link with religious organisations.  When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin I spent time in San Jose - it was probably the only time I left the country as Lord Mayor because I am not a great traveller - and visited some of the Irish centres there and in San Francisco.  I saw the same problems there as I did in England.  I was struck by the fact that most connections came from GAA clubs or local pubs.  After that, there was only the centres.  I always felt there was a need there.</p><p>  Dr. Tilki mentioned alcohol and addiction.  We have the same addiction here in Ireland, in particular in older people and those who have come from very poor backgrounds and live in poor areas of cities.  It is generational and it is difficult to break the cycle.  Many countries now have major problems with young people binge drinking.  The fear is that the next generation will require many liver donations, something doctors told the committee some time ago.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses for meeting us.  We had a lovely get together and it was nice to be able to talk to people on a one-to-one basis.  I sat beside Mr. Carroll's daughter.</p></speech>

Can that be attributed to the fact that many Irish people who left the country had a Catholic background?  I was struck by the fact that it was said many health problems stemmed from people not wanting to expose their private parts.  That is sad because people are ill.  Is that the psyche of older people who were reared in Catholic families?  In my mother's final weeks, my two brothers had to bring her to the shower because she had Alzheimer's disease.  I was struck by how she would have felt about that, but she did not know what was happening.  We were very privileged to be able to have her at home and assist her.</p><p>  What connections do the new Irish abroad have with the older population abroad?  Mr. O'Dwyer might answer that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014121100010#K00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank all the organisations for the tremendous work they do.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, well in his new role.  I had a lot of engagement with him in his previous role as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and I know he was very passionate about that.  I am delighted he is here before us today and that we have the opportunity to discuss these issues across the diaspora.</p><p>  Many issues have been covered.  I want to touch on one or two health issues.  The presentation stated that smoking rates are declining slowly in the Irish community, which has to be welcomed.  I wonder why that is happening.  There are major issues around obesity, poor nutrition and alcohol, and lifestyle and health are connected to that.  We all know people who come from poor socio-economic backgrounds are generally in poorer health.  </p><p>  Barriers to treatment were mentioned.  What type of screening programmes are available to the Irish community?  There is a very strong link between alcohol and cancer, and we had a briefing session on that in the House last week.  </p><p>  The witnesses discussed some tranches of funding in the presentations.  From where do they get their funding?  The funding mentioned was minute.  </p><p>  With regard to the undocumented Irish, they are covered for emergencies or catastrophic illnesses, but not for routine procedures.  I did not think they were entitled to any health cover.  It was said that children are entitled to receive medical care.  That is news to me because I often wondered what families did if they or their children were sick.  It is interesting to know that they are entitled to medical cover.  I would not have known that.  I understood that was the case in New York; I do know if it applies across the United States.  </p><p>  The case of a 64 year old man who had been working as a cook, and was helped to repatriate and return to his family, was mentioned.  Do the witnesses repatriate people who do not have families to return to?  Where do they go?  A person of 64 years of age does not qualify for a pension.  Some people who return from abroad have difficulties accessing services here because they have been away so long and do not have entitlements.  If they do not have families to return to, do the organisations ensure that they will be assisted financially or will be entitled to benefits and housing in the State?  I am curious about that.</p></speech>

Some of the questions were not asked directly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jennie McShannon" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014121100010#K00600"><p>We will swap between us.  In regard to the work that can be done, the Irish voluntary and community sectors are very proactive in engaging as much as they can in terms of reaching the community.  Deputy Kelleher referred to the older generation becoming more isolated at the end of their lives.  A major issue for us is that there so many local Irish centres.</p> <p>Localism and locality are important to them.  Their ability to travel decreases over time and this is evident in Irish clubs and community centres, particularly those in the north of England where people used to travel across the shires to attend a big Irish community centre.  These centres have seen a decrease in footfall, mainly because people are ageing and less able to travel.  It is important, therefore, that local services adapt.  For example, Cricklewood Homeless Concern, now called Ashford Place, a facility with which many members are familiar, previously heaved with Irish people, but as they have aged, they have become less confident and many are unable to leave their homes.  It is important to consider providing outreach services for such persons.  The London Irish Centre previously conducted all of its services from the centre, but it now runs 17 lunch clubs and provides day care services around the city, while much work is still done in the centre.</p><p> I have spoken to some of the large social care providers and there is an emphasis on working with people on end of life planning and care.  We have just started what we call a little Irish support partnership across infrastructure to help people to consider making wills and legacies.  In part, this scheme is a way for people to feel supported by Irish community organisations; it is about getting people to think about end of life care and burial arrangements.  We try to help them to think about what happens when they become ill.</p><p> On mental health, it was mentioned that some people had left Ireland owing to pregnancy, their sexual orientation and so on, but these issues have diminished in many ways.  Irish society now promotes greater inclusion, which we welcome.  Members ahve noted that the Irish now arriving are better educated and have high expectations of success in Britain.  They are well received as an educated global commodity and do not face the same prejudice and discrimination in Britain that Irish people endured in the past.  Much of this is due to the peace process in Northern Ireland, the positive relationship between Britain and Ireland and the young Irish people who travel to Britain.  We are very proud of these young people, but there is a risk in assuming that they are all thriving.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, referred to services such as the immigrant counselling and psychotherapy service, ICAP, Mind Yourself and Irish Community Care Merseyside in Liverpool, through which we have seen that some young Irish people arriving in Britain are unprepared for the cultural differences they experience.  Many do not realise how isolating it can be to live in a city like London and, while furthering their careers, some feel anxious and depressed.  The research we conducted with the London Irish Centre in 2012, which specifically targeted the group we call the thriving young Irish, as opposed to the old and vulnerable, showed all of this.  It is important that services adapt and are provided in different ways.  It is not always a matter of providing advice and welfare services; it is also about social engagement and inclusion.</p></speech>

If not, is there a way to reach them?  How is the gap bridged?</p></speech>

Places such as the London Irish Centre and the Irish Centre Birmingham aim to engage people culturally and use social media and networks.  Communities used to engage based on from where members had come and to where they had moved - I refer to societies such as the Leeds Mayo society and the London Leitrim society.  Now as people are more likely to meet based on their career choices, it is very important that Irish community support services engage with business and arts networks.  It may sound cheesy, but things like Father Ted events attract people to Irish centres because these centres are often perceived as serving only the vulnerable and the old.  If we get people through the doors, we can find ways for them to engage and feel culturally comfortable in order that they feel at home and do not need to explain themselves.  We want them to know that these services are available in order that they can avail of them if mental health difficulties arise such as anxiety and suicidal ideation.  Mind Yourself has organised a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, group and Irish film and dance classes with a modern twist.</p><p>  A committee member raised the issue of support from the British Government and this is a difficult one for us.  In 2008 there was a change in government policy on funding ethnically-specific services and prior to that year it was easier for Irish organisations and organisations working with ethnic minority groups in Britain to access funding.  The move away from this policy has been quite definite; therefore, we try to encourage our member organisations which are independent of us but work with us to seek local authority funding and grants for specific services.  Members will know that funding is limited; therefore, there is an over-reliance on the emigrant support programme.  A major concern is that when the British authorities consider the issue of immigration, they tend not to see Irish people as immigrants.  We have campaigned, lobbied and raised awareness, in tandem with local groups, to get funding, but Irish groups are often the last to get it and the first to lose it.</p></speech>

The collection of data can relate to health services such as targeting obesity in the Irish community.  Irish people are seen as white and English-speaking and an unintended consequence of the peace process is that they are no longer considered to give cause for concern.  This belies the fact that there are underlying vulnerabilities.  The British authorities no longer believe it is as necessary to engage with the Irish community in Britain.</p></speech>

Some have done phenomenally well in terms of education - even people from very poor backgrounds take pride in education and many have done well.  Others have not thrived and some people in poor and disadvantaged communities were not proud to be Irish because of the discrimination they faced.  Some schools made great efforts to get children to use Irish accents.  In poor and less confident communities racism and discrimination were woven into people's lives and the Troubles had a significant impact in this respect.  Some Irish parents were not confident and did not instil confidence in their children.  Some Irish people in Britain formed bad habits and we can be very judgmental about their smoking and drinking, but the circumstances in which they lived explain a lot.</p><p>  On Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question, discrimination played a big part in people keeping their heads below the parapet and thus not availing of health services.  Those who accessed health and social services often faced discrimination.</p> <p>For example, one might go to a doctor with any kind of health problem only for the first question to be how much does one drink and how much does one smoke and to be told that were one to give those up, one would be fine.  While these are quite legitimate questions for a professional to ask, not as the first question.  Moreover, people's accents were made fun of and people were blamed and judged for their poor health behaviour and poor health and that does not help.  Another point when talking about men is that it was a very macho culture, particularly in the building industry.  One's confidence was about how many of yards of a trench one could dig in a day or how many bricks one could carry on one's hod and if one had a health problem, one would be a weakling to give into it.  There is something about that.  Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about the role of Catholicism and the role of religion.  It played a part that was highly positive for some people but it has played a very negative part.  We are embarrassed about our naughty bits with people saying there is no problem and we are very familiar with this.  However, for the older generation in particular, it often was easier and they had more confidence in praying to St. Anthony, St. Jude or whoever that they would get better.  They would invest rather more in that than in going to a doctor who perhaps was less than sensitive.  The other side of it is that many people got great help and support through their personal faith and through their religious practices.  While it is easy to knock the others, we must recognise that.</p><p> As for what else, Ms Jennie McShannon has a list of things I must say.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-11a.581" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Tilki" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014121100012#M00300"><p>Senator Colm Burke asked what support and what engagement we get from the professional migrants.  In many cases, they could be more aware of what is happening.  Ms McShannon made the point that they do not wish to engage with what they perceive to be an old or traditional Irish culture.  However, once they are aware of the position of those who came before them or indeed the second generation, many of them are willing to help and to give their support.  We have professional networks in different cities, including Manchester, Leeds and London.  Many of our organisations also are recruiting people from professional backgrounds to their boards, that is, from legal, financial and human resources backgrounds because in some cases we have issues with governance in our more traditional organisations and therefore are bringing in people.  Many young lawyers and people with expertise in the field are doing<i>pro bono</i>work - one who comes to mind initially actually works with Birmingham Irish groups and is helping people with industrial injuries, asbestosis, symphysiotomies and things like that -  they are doing a lot of good work.  Moreover, through the Cuimhne Projects, we hope to recruit more people - not just from health backgrounds because they often have negative views about dementia - but from professional backgrounds who would be sufficiently confident and articulate to champion the cause and to present information.  We hope to recruit more of those people as part of this volunteer programme.  As I mentioned, some of the new Irish have very few connections with the older Irish population because they perceive them as being older, more traditional and having nothing to do with them.  Another point that is worth making is that some of the older generation have a fairly negative view of the second generation.  They often are referred to as plastic Paddies although, as Deputy McLellan noted, they were brought up very much in an Irish culture and are proud of their heritage.  They often are highly offended by an older generation who call them plastic Paddies.  We actually use those people a lot more.<br/>In response to the other question on what screening programmes are available, there is a three-year cervical screening programme from about the age of 16 or 17 onwards.  There is mammography from the age of 57 until the age of 73.  I have friends who are GP-practice nurses who tell me that when an Irish woman comes into the practice for whatever reason, they push her down on the table and try to get her through that screening process because Irish women are reluctant to make appointments.  While prostate screening also is available, Irish men are very reluctant in this regard but we are working on that at present.  Bowel cancer screening is available in the United Kingdom where one gets a little packet through the post but again, Irish people throw it in the dustbin and do not wish to have anything to do with it.  The facilities are there, although they are not perfect and are not necessarily very sensitive.  However, we need to do more work about getting people to take them up and use them.  As for the cancer and alcohol links, it is a sensitive issue in our community - I am as sensitive about it as anyone else - because we are labelled drunks and all the nasty things that go with that.  Sometimes, health authorities are frightened to do anything about it, so we must make that link.  The link between alcohol and suicide is recognised quite widely in the majority population but as nobody makes the same link with Irish people, there is much more work to be done in that regard.<br/>Finally, on the question the Cathaoirleach asked about the NHS statistics, data about the Irish are collected for many things.  Information is not available on cancer registries or on GP practice records although it is getting better.  However, what happens to the data that are collected is that the Irish are aggregated into a big amorphous &quot;white&quot; category within which the poor health of the Irish is lost.  The problem is that quite often, ethnicity is perceived as a black thing, a skin colour issue, not about people from other migrant groups and we are working hard to change that.  I always am harping on about it and nagging and pestering people but in all honesty, it is a very big issue for providers to deal with and if they forget about it, it gives them a little bit of scope.  When we have made progress, it can be very good but then one gets a new officer, a new ethos or something so one must start all over again.</p></speech>

On the immigration issues in particular, we have tried hard to broaden the immigration issue to ensure it is not looked at as being merely a Latino issue.  We were very pleased the other day when the President referred to the problems and made his remarks in Chicago that it was not a Latino issue but that there were many undocumented Irish and Polish immigrants.  That really broadened the debate considerably, although it is particularly galling for an Irish-American to be listed as an Anglo.  I have indicated to those who have called me an Anglo that generations of Irish men and women have died and shed blood not to be called that and I was not about to be called an Anglo in the United States.</p><p>  There are a few things I wished to talk about and Deputy Kelleher asked about the best way in which we reach out to the elderly.  There are two things we do that are important for us.  One is the meals on wheels programme I mentioned.  It is a very important programme because the volunteers visit elderly people in their homes.  We know, of course, that it is difficult for people to reach out when they have problems.  That is part of the Irish ethos but if somebody is coming into their homes, they will reach out if something is wrong and that person will be told.</p> <p>In particular, at the Bronx office we have set aside a place for the elderly to drop in.  We have a knitting group and Barry's tea which is the greatest therapy there is.  They come in, have a cup of tea and feel at home with each other.  This has had a major impact on our community in the Bronx.  They would not come in to ask about a problem, but once they are in there, if there is a problem, we will know about it.  If they come in, we can help them.</p><p> I want to talk a little about the immigrants who are coming now.  While we can say many of them are better educated, we can also say many of the people who come are in particular need of social services, whether it be around sexual identity or just a question of not getting along at home and having a difficulty with mental problems.  Unfortunately, as we say, our immigrants do not leave their problems at home when they come to New York.  They come with these problems and it is up to us to try to deal with them through our social services.  Because of the federal nature of the United States, we get no funding from the US Government.  We are very fortunate to be in New York city, as are most of the other centres to be in cities that value and treasure their immigrant populations.  We get about half our funding from New York City Council and the New York city Mayor's office which have been extraordinarily supportive of the work of the association.  The Irish American caucus in the city council has been particularly good, even with the change of administration.</p><p> I note in response to Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that we can get our people covered to age 18 years.  This does not happen in all states, but they include New York, Massachusetts and some other states.  It is because New York is reaching out to immigrants and has a very different view on all levels, including health and education, of the undocumented from that in Texas or South Carolina, for example.  Higher education is available to our people in the City University, to which we have reached out, with in-state tuition.  This has allowed them to go back to school, even without documentation.</p><p> The Deputy has rightly put his finger on what our next problem is going to be.  By nature of being undocumented, our people are very wary of the government.  Even when we had the Morrison visas and amnesties in the past, many of them did not even register for fear of being put on some sort of government list.  Our first job is to ensure anyone who applies for the programme will not be in a worse shape at the end of three years.  We have asked the government for and I am positive we will receive assurances that if a person applies for deferred action, the deferral will be kept confidential and people will not be put on a list for deportation if the next President, no matter who he or she might be - she I hope - comes down and------</p></speech>

Unfortunately, when these programmes come down, there are numbers of people who will seek to take advantage of our immigrant population and advertise, "I can get you a green card" which, of course, they cannot.  They will assert that they can get someone citizenship and that all that person need do is come up with a payment of $5,000 or $10,000.  We have worked very hard with the Attorney General of the State of New York and the prosecutors in the Governor's office to clamp down on this.  There is actually a new law in New York that makes it a felony to misrepresent immigrant services.  What Members of the Oireachtas can do in their constituent services is to tell people to come to the centres.  We are providing free advice and regular educational programmes for our people.  We have had three already as this rolls out which were well attended.</p><p>  We are now on a dual track, one part of which involves advocacy in the Executive branch to ensure that whatever we can get done will be done to the maximum extent possible when the regulations come out.  At the same time, we are engaging in information centres to ensure the full story gets out as to who will be eligible, how they will be eligible and how they can apply.  A lot of this has yet to be determined.  Pub talk can be very destructive in an immigrant population.  I am aware that every Member of the Oireachtas receives regular telephone calls from parents or siblings asking what this means and what they should do.  The important thing to say is that the Irish Government - I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, and the Government - has provided these centres with resources to take care of the population.  It is important that people get the right answers by going to the centres and they should be told to listen to nobody else.  It is when they listen to others that they get into terrible trouble.</p></speech>

It is very important from the point of view of the Diaspora and the Irish nation reaching out and talking to each other.  I hope it will set a precedent for the future that we can have further discussions such as this.  Certainly, I am more informed than when we started.  I thank Dr. Mary Tilki, Ms Jenny McShannon and Mr. Brian O'Dwyer for their well informed contributions.  They hit all of the important subjects and we have all learned from the exercise.  I note also the people involved in the emigrant support programme, including Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Madden, Ms Emer Rocke and my officials, as well as Ms Celine Byrne.  They have all been involved in the programme for a number of years and it has been very effective.</p><p>  To answer a few questions, Deputy Sandra McClellan said the funding did not appear to be too generous.  I have been in the Oireachtas a long time and was not aware that the funding was as generous as it had been, notwithstanding the financial challenges in recent years.  To the end of 2013, the Government had spent &euro;114 million on the emigrant support programme.  At the end of this year, it will have spent &euro;126.1 million.</p> <p>The UK was the main beneficiary because, obviously, more people go to there as it is easier to access.  Up to the end of 2013, the UK received &euro;84.2 million and the US was next with &euro;19.7 million.  Australia received &euro;2.3 million.  The Irish taxpayer through the Irish Government has been generous despite the challenges we face here in various areas.  That should be acknowledged, and I acknowledge previous governments' contributions.  I hope that we are retaining it and I hope to increase it as things get better here.  That is very important.</p><p> I will refer briefly to a few issues.  The first relates to inter-generational connections among Irish communities overseas.  I have noticed that myself, and I have seen some really good connections.  I will certainly be making a greater effort to encourage younger Irish people to get involved in the various organisations and centres.  Our ambassador in London, Dan Mulhall, held a meeting of young Irish groups in the embassy.  Perhaps Ms McShannon might comment on that.  This meeting is a start.  I visited London recently and would like to thank all those people for the very generous and warm welcome they gave me.  It was uplifting and positive and certainly makes one want to do more for the organisations over there because they are so positive and committed.  The next time I visit, I will try to connect with the younger Irish generations over there, in New York and other centres around the world.  There is a really strong commitment from the younger population in Australia.  </p><p> I will mention a few initiatives about Irish people coming back and being supported.  Safe Home, in which a former Member of this House from Mayo, Dr. Jerry Cowley, is very much involved, has been very successful.  The Aisling Project, which brings people back for holidays here, is very positive.  I visited that centre in London.  An issue that has consistently come up is the question of how we communicate with our diaspora.  I am launching a new diaspora strategy shortly.  We will be addressing that issue.  During my visit to London, I launched a very good website called Craic It London by a girl called Catriona Casey.  This has proven to be quite successful in providing information.  I also launched a website for the Aisling Project.  Apart from the centres, the emigrant organisations are responding and providing this information online.  </p><p> In conclusion, I am delighted to be here.  I will be launching the strategy shortly and a number of points raised here will be addressed in it.  I may come back in the future to discuss the strategy with the committee but there will be an emphasis on health and providing information for our diaspora and for people to make better lifestyle decisions in areas like looking after their fitness and ensuring that they avail of services.  One of the prime purposes of the emigrant support programme is to support organisations to ensure that people are aware of the services to which they are entitled, regardless of whether they are in London, New York, Manchester, Liverpool or Melbourne.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State said, it has been the beginning of what I hope is a future conversation where we and the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade can work together with the diaspora strategy and the issue of health and well-being of our emigrant population and our diaspora.  It is important to acknowledge the work of the emigrant support programme and thank it.  As we have all said, there are families that are hugely dependent on, are supportive of and grateful for the work it does.  I will not name individuals but I thank them for the work they do.  We can all provide testimony of families that have issues with people who have gone missing or who cannot come home -  issues that have hugely upset family life.  Hopefully, this committee can continue this discussion and broaden it.</p><p>  I remind members that there will be a photograph at the end of the meeting and that next Tuesday's meeting is divided into two parts.  Part one is the HIQA report on the national ambulance service where we will be joined by the members of the HSE and the second part of the meeting will deal with care home settings and the television programme on &Aacute;ras Attracta on RTE last Tuesday night.  We will hear from Pat Healy, national director of social care at the HSE and, hopefully, other members of the HSE as part of our response to that programme.</p></speech>

The committee has received a total of 124 petitions to date since the launch of the petitions system.  The secretariat has been examining them to establish their admissibility and how best to progress the petitions for consideration by the joint committee.  Some 104 of the petitions received have been brought before the committee on at least one occasion.</p><p>  The first is No. 22 of 2014 and relates to compensation for victims of uninsured aircraft operators, as there is no equivalent to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland.  The petitioner is Mr. John Dunphy.  Following involvement in an aircraft accident where insurance was rescinded, the petitioner is requesting that the Oireachtas legislate in respect of compensation for injured parties.  The EU motor insurance directive requires member states to legislate for victims of uninsured motorists, but there is currently no equivalent of the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland for the aviation industry.</p><p>  We have agreed to refer the petition and correspondence to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, suggesting that it may wish to include it in its work programme and give consideration to the establishment of the aviation insurers bureau and engage at European level on this issue.  We will forward the petition and correspondence to the Department and it may wish to consider changes to address the issue.  We will inform the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The second petition before us is No. 23 of 2014 and requests a plebiscite to allow for a directly elected mayor of Dublin.  It comes from Ms Catherine Heaney and the group Let Dublin Vote.  The petitioners recommend the introduction of a plebiscite and feel the veto in the Local Government Act 2014 is in contradiction to what was promised in the programme for Government.  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provided for the holding of a plebiscite on the possible introduction of an office of directly elected mayor for Dublin.  However, the holding of a plebiscite in conjunction with the 2014 local elections was predicated on agreement by the four local authorities in Dublin, which did not materialise.  The Department has advised that the current legislation needs to be changed to consider any plebiscite or referendum and the Department does not wish to do this based on its heavy legislative work programme.</p></speech>

Agreed.  The third petition is No. 24 of 2214, which concerns tendering for the social inclusion and community activation programme and comes from Ms Deirdre McCarthy and the Dublin Inner City Community Alliance.  The petitioners believe the Government policy of tendering the new social inclusion and community activation programme threatens to undermine community development projects and will result in a deterioration of services for the most disadvantaged.  They cite as the problem the enforcement of the EU procurement directive, 2004/18/EC, and advise it has been superseded by EU directive 2014/24/EU.</p></speech>

It is a sensitive transitional area and there has been much good work done on social inclusion under the community activation programmes.  It would be helpful to hear from individuals involved because it will be replicated around the country.  We can hear the issues for consideration.</p></speech>

Agreed.  The final petition is No. 34 of 2014, the Public Appointments Service panel for a position in the office of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The petitioner is Mr. Paul Hanna.  The petitioner had an issue with the Public Appointments Service and the closing of panels without informing the applicants.  The matter has been resolved in so far as it concerns the petitioner, but as a committee with responsibility for public service oversight, the issue for us is not with the individual case but around the matter of public concern or the need for change in public policy that has arisen.  We have agreed to close the petition and write to the petitioner advising him of this.  We will also write to the Public Appointments Service and advise that, in the interests of openness and transparency, it should indicate at the time of advertising all rules and regulations regarding panels associated with each competition.  We will engage with the Public Appointments Service and await a response.  We will monitor that it addresses the issue that has been resolved in this case.</p></speech>
