Apologies have been received from Deputy Pearse Doherty who is being substituted for by Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  Apologies have been received also from Deputies Se&aacute;n Barrett and Calleary.</p> <p>  I wish to inform members that a work programme will be circulated in the coming days and members are invited to make observations to the secretariat in advance of a draft work programme being produced.  We have written to the Ceann Comhairle on foot of Deputy Donnelly's request last week.  We have already indicated that the area of corporation tax is likely to be the first issue on our work programme, but members may have issues and other items for inclusion on it.  Should Deputy Donnelly's letter of request to the Ceann Comhairle in respect of the finance Bill result in this committee receiving ownership of it, then the finance Bill will be the first big chunk of our work programme.  It is imperative that a decision is made soon on that matter.  </p> <p>  The committee report highlighted some areas that the committee will examine further, such as the CSO and the Central Bank consultative group.  Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned it at the time of the discussion on GDP and Brexit.  We wrote to the Ceann Comhairle requesting that he consider the transfer of the finance Bill to the committee.  </p> <p>  Do members wish to make observations before our meeting with the officials from the Department of Finance?</p><p>Does Deputy Burton wish to comment?</p></speech>

That decision has not yet been made by the Business Committee but we need that decision to be made soon.  Before they leave this week, I would encourage members to forward their observation on the work programme to the secretariat as soon as possible and we can then discuss them.  As there are no other members offering, we will call the witnesses.</p> <p>  I welcome from the Department of Finance Mr. John McCarthy, who is accompanied by colleagues from the macroeconomic forecasting team, including Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Ms Laura Weymes, Dr. Javier Papa and Mr. Ian Power.  They will be dealing with the short-term economic outlook in advance of the budget.  Today's meeting will consist of an opening statement from Mr. McCarthy followed by a PowerPoint presentation.  Members will then have an opportunity to engage in questioning the witnesses.</p> <p>  I draw witnesses' attention to the fact they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person either inside or outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016100400002#C00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to present the short-term economic outlook in advance of the 2017 Budget Statement.  As the Chairman mentioned, I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Ms Laura Weymes, Dr. Javier Papa and Mr. Ian Power from the macroeconomic forecasting team in the Department.</p> <p>  By way of background, since 2013, reforms to economic governance mean that budgetary policies for euro area member states must be based on macroeconomic forecasts that are either independently produced or are endorsed by an independent body.  This is contained in the so-called two-pack.  In Ireland, as in the majority of euro area member states, we have gone down the endorsement route with the endorsement function assigned to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The endorsement process has been under way since mid-September.  We have a memorandum of understanding between the Department and the council and on that basis, we will present our assessment of the short-term outlook to the council this afternoon.</p> <p>  For the budget, the council has a role in assessing the short-term projections, namely, those for this year and for next year.</p><p>We have provided for the committee the exact same presentation that will be provided for the council, although I do not propose to go through every slide, unless members are willing to do so.  We will publish the information on the Department's website this evening.  The economic projections we are presenting are based on the assumption that there will be a budgetary package amounting to &euro;1 billion for 2017, to be split two to one between expenditure increases and taxation reductions, as set out in the Government's summer economic statement which was published in June.<br/><br/>This is our third or fourth time to appear in front of an Oireachtas committee.  As is the norm, we will comment purely on the technical aspects of the forecasts.  We will not discuss policy issues, or the fiscal situation.  We will not discuss either of these issues with the council either.<br/><br/>In high-level terms we are projecting GDP growth of 4.2% this year and 3.5% next year.  We have reduced the forecast for next year by around half a percentage point to take into account the uncertainty associated with Brexit.  These are contingent forecasts.  They are contingent on continued growth in external markets, particularly key external markets, namely, the United Kingdom, the United States and the euro area.  In this context, it is fair to say the current outlook is characterised by considerable uncertainty, with the impact of Brexit still unfolding.  However, there are other issues, including a prolongation of relatively subdued growth in many advanced economies.  This has led some to question whether the world economy has entered a permanently lower growth phase, or so-called &quot;secular stagnation&quot;.<br/><br/>In overall terms, it is our assessment that the balance of risk to our central scenario is tilted firmly towards the downside.  An important issue I shall highlight is that there are, as members are aware, problems in setting trends in the economy at the current juncture, given that the information content in key aggregates such as GDP and GNP is much more limited than elsewhere.  This is most evident in the exceptionally high growth figure published in July, 26%, with which members will be familiar.  Clearly, this figure is misaligned with actual developments in terms of employment, <i>per capita</i>income developments and so forth.<br/><br/>More generally, the highly globalised nature of the economy and the concentration of economic activity mean that confidence bands around any short-term forecast will necessarily be wide.  Therefore, it is fair to say in these circumstances that it is necessary to look beyond simple aggregates such as GDP and GNP in order to gauge properly what is happening in the economy.  By this I mean the consideration of employment and consumption levels and so forth.<br/><br/>Turning to the actual presentation, Mr. Power will outline the latest domestic developments.  Ms Weymes will discuss the labour market, while Dr. Javier Papa will discuss price dynamics.  I will then summarise the key trends and what they mean for the short-term economic outlook.<br/><br/>On the external circumstances, the slide shows some of the key variables that have an input.  Members will be familiar with the decline in inflation in recent times.  This is partly attributable to the very sharp decline in oil prices.  Two years ago the average price of oil was approximately $100 per barrel.  This year it will be about $44 or $45 per barrel.  This is having a big impact in supporting disposable income but in also reducing inflation.<br/><br/>A significant issue to which I wish to point for the committee is evident in the green bar which shows the year-on-year change in the euro&ndash;sterling exchange rate.  One can see that there has been a very sharp appreciation of the euro against sterling over the course of the year.  It is approximately 12% in year-on-year terms.  This obviously negatively affects the exporting sectors of the economy, especially those involved in the indigenous sector which are more regionally based and labour intensive.<br/><br/>It is fair to say, as I have mentioned, that demand in key external markets is relatively subdued.  What we show in the slide is the quarter-on-quarter growth rates in the United Kingdom, the United States and the euro area.</p><p>This shows the quarter-on-quarter growth rate in the UK, the US and the euro area.  The US had fairly modest growth in the opening part of this year.  In the UK things were not too bad in the lead-up to Brexit and certainly since Brexit some of the high-frequency data have held up.  In the euro area the legacies of the crisis - high levels of public and private debt and so forth, and some problems in the banking sector - are restraining growth.</p><p> In terms of key external assumptions, we are projecting for next year growth of about 1% in the UK, about 1.5% in the euro area and about 2.25% in the United States.  All member states fix their euro-dollar and euro-sterling exchange rates at levels at mid-September, implying that &euro;1 would buy 85 pence sterling for next year.  As I mentioned at the outset, a very modest increase in oil prices is assumed for next year.</p><p> I will ask Mr. Power to speak about domestic developments and I will summarise at the end.</p></speech>

Consumer spending has been quite strong in the first half of this year, up by 3.5%.  This has been driven by the very strong performance in goods consumption in particular.  As members will see from the graph on the left hand side the high-frequency indicators, such as retail sales and core retail sales which excludes car sales, all show robust growth.  Consumer sentiment remains solid and well above its long-run average.</p> <p>  The sale of cars has been very strong in the opening months of this year, supported by a pick-up in medium-term consumer credit growth which can be seen in the panel on the right.  This acceleration in credit growth is helping drive the very strong performance we have seen in consumer durables over the past year or so.  Car sales are particularly strong in the first quarter, up 30% year-on-year.  However, as members can see there has been a bit of a deceleration in the second and third quarters.  Overall we expect consumption to remain solid in the latter half of this year and into next year, supported by favourable labour market dynamics and continued increases in personal disposable income.</p> <p>  On investment the most noteworthy development relates to intangibles, with investment in intellectual property assets increasing by almost 20% in the first half of this year.  However, it is important to note that the bulk of investment in intangibles is actually imported so the direct impact on GDP is relatively limited.</p> <p>  Encouragingly, building and construction investment recorded double-digit growth in the first half of this year with strong contributions from both residential and commercial construction investment.  Slide 14 shows that the commercial vacancy rate in Dublin is now at its lowest level on record.  This should also help support commercial construction investment along with the pick-up in public capital expected from 2017 onwards.</p> <p>  On the external side, underlying exports, in other words exports produced in Ireland have remained very strong in the opening half of this year with positive contributions from both goods exports and service exports.  However, on a headline basis, export growth has moderated sharply in the first half of this year.  As members can see, this is due to contract manufacturing, represented by the green bar in the slide.  Contract manufacturing is where a multinational operating in Ireland contracts the production of goods to a third-party firm abroad.  If those goods are sold abroad, it is recorded as an Irish export even though the good may never have actually been physically located in Ireland.  Last year contract manufacturing was one of the main factors behind the inflated GDP figures, whereas this year contract manufacturing is having a negative contribution on overall export growth and overall GDP growth.

In recent years we have seen a new form of outsourcing.  The outsourcing is called contract manufacturing.  An Irish-resident multinational contracts out, under licence, the production of goods and services - mainly goods - to a third party in Asia.</p><p>At all stages in the production process, the Irish entity owns all of the inputs into that production, including the very valuable intellectual property.  The reason it may be doing this is that there might be doubts about property ownership, the business models in Asia and so forth, so it wants to retain the intellectual property in advanced economies.  The crucial point is that it has ownership of all the inputs into production right up until the final widget is produced and sold from, say, China to Japan.  At that stage, there is a change in economic ownership and it is classified as an Irish export.</p><p> This is not just a feature in Ireland as many companies throughout the world are engaging in contract manufacturing.  It is just that, in an Irish case, the firms involved are very large and a large amount of the intellectual property is here, so it has much more of a distorting impact in an Irish context than elsewhere.  It is very much in line with the new methodology for compiling national accounts.  There is a problem in that Europe is one of the main jurisdictions that has moved to this way of dealing with it whereas not every jurisdiction has done this, so there could be problems of double counting.  It leads to a situation in which there are goods and services - mainly goods, I would stress - produced in other jurisdictions that are now formally being recorded in the Irish accounts.  This was one of the main features of the 26% figure last year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016100400002#F00200"><p>Why the radical change from a surplus of contract manufacturing in GDP in quarter 4 of 2015 to a minus in 2016?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016100400002#F00300"><p>The chart shows the position in euro millions and I believe we can see a massive increase in the level of contract manufacturing during 2015.  This year we are seeing high levels of contract manufacturing in the first two quarters, just not as high as the level in previous years.</p> <p>  There is one point that relates to the questions from both Deputies.  Until 2014 this was a phenomenon but it did not impact on GDP because, while the export and the production was classified as Irish production, the Irish entity had to import a royalty payment from the Caribbean, Bermuda or wherever to be allowed produce these under licence.  What we saw in quarter 1 of 2015 was that this intellectual property was brought from wherever and onshored to Ireland.  We were getting the actual exports but we no longer had to offset these with imports because the royalties and the intellectual property were based in Ireland.</p> <p>  To come back to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question, the level is still very large in the first half of 2016, just not as large as it was in 2015.</p></speech>

Mr. Power may continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Power" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016100400002#F00500"><p>As Mr. McCarthy said, contract manufacturing exports were one of the main drivers of the inflated GDP figures but this year they are making a negative contribution to overall GDP growth.  We expect this to continue in the latter half of this year.</p> <p>  On the imports side, goods imports have been quite weak in the first half of 2016.  Once again, contract manufacturing is weighing on goods imports, although to less of an extent than on the goods exports side.  As we can see from the slide on display, service imports accelerated in the first two quarters, mainly because of the substantial onshoring Mr. McCarthy alluded to earlier in that the investment in intellectual property assets is all being imported.  Again, we are anticipating something broadly similar in the latter half of this year.  In 2017 we are assuming that imports will move in line with final demand, that is, in line with developments in consumption, investment and exports.</p> <p>  The graph shows the current account in the balance of payments.  We are anticipating the current account will fall in 2016 and 2017 as a share of GDP, reflecting a weaker contribution from net exports and also a negative terms of trade effect.</p><p>This means that import prices will move faster than export prices, weighing on the current account balance.</p></speech>

However, it was due to trade exports and contract manufacturing and having no offset in imports.</p> <p>  Ms Weymes will talk about the labour market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Weymes" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016100400002#G00300"><p>In 2016 to date relatively robust employment levels have been recorded, with the numbers at work having rebounded to levels last seen at the end of 2008.  Some 180,000 jobs have been created since the low point of the crisis.  Outturns in the second quarter of the year marked the 15th successive quarter in which there was employment growth.  Importantly, it remains broad-based, with expansion across 12 of the 14 sectors of activity, for which figures are recorded by the CSO.  </p> <p>  On the outlook for employment, data for economy-wide vacancy rates augur well for employment growth in the coming quarters of the year.  With no further momentum beyond what we have seen in the year to date, this would imply annual growth of 2.3%.  Our forecast of 2.6% factors in a slight softening in the second half of the year and is consistent with the creation of 52,000 jobs in annual terms.  Employment growth of 2.1% is forecast in 2017, which is very much in line with the outlook for underlying domestic demand within the economy.  Unemployment continues to decline, although the pace of reduction has been somewhat muted throughout 2016, reflecting a labour supply response which is beginning to gather pace in response to improved labour market conditions.  The first half of the year saw labour force growth of 1.1% and our outlook for the year as a whole is for growth of 1.3%, unchanged from our last published forecast in April.  Despite evidence for persistence in the rate of unemployment in the year to date, the number of persons unemployed continues to fall, with 23,000 fewer unemployed relative to this time last year.  Overall, in 2016 we are projecting an unemployment rate which will decline to 8.3% and fall further to 7.8% in 2017.</p> <p>  Slide 24 shows that rising participation rates can be expected to drive expansion in the labour force this year, a phenomenon we are seeing for the first time since 2013.  We are beginning to see evidence of a long-awaited pick-up in participation rates which rebounded in the second quarter largely on the back of females who had been within education during the crisis returning to the labour force.  The cyclical pick-up in participation rates points to evidence of a strengthening labour supply response to improving overall labour market conditions.  Demographics and inward migration are expected to contribute progressively to the expansion of the labour force in 2016 and 2017.</p> <p>  Slide 25 shows the outlook for wage dynamics.  Our forecast is for a modest pick-up in wage growth, with wages projected to expand by just over 2.5% per year in the medium term.  Hourly pay rates are forecast to evolve broadly in line with productivity trends over the period and the short-term outlook for the wage bill is for continued growth underpinned by broadly balanced contributions from wage rates and numbers at work.</p></speech>

The annual harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, decreased by 0.7% in August, while it went up, only marginally, by 0.2% in the euro area.  In the next slide we analyse the outturn in the HICP in detail.</p><p>We can see that in 2016, to date, headline inflation is averaging -0.2%, while core inflation which excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food prices is averaging 0.8%.  Until August, non-energy industrial goods and energy prices made the largest negative contribution to headline inflation.  However, the fall in the price of goods and energy continues to be partially offset by increases in service prices which, in turn, are boosted by rents and improving labour market conditions.</p><p> Looking ahead, in 2016 we forecast slightly negative HICP inflation of -0.1%, with, at 1.2%, modest acceleration into 2017.  The drag from energy prices is expected to ease gradually from the fourth quarter of this year, with its contribution to turn positive in 2017.  We also forecast a sustained positive contribution in service price inflation, again due to labour market conditions and rents.  Overall, headline and core inflation are expected to converge in 2017.</p></speech>

This is essentially what we will present to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, this afternoon.  I will concentrate on the position in 2016 and 2017 because that is probably what the committee is most interested in.  I will give it the headline picture.  </p> <p>  Members can see that in 2016 we are projecting GDP growth of 4.2% - that is a real figure; in other words, it takes account of price developments - with a very modest deceleration to 3.5% next year.  At the time of the stability programme and the SES, the figure was closer to 4%; therefore, as I mentioned at the start, we have taken off about half a percentage point, mainly because of lower investment, uncertainty and so forth associated with Brexit.</p> <p>  Consumption is an important indicator to consider, given the distortions in the GDP number.  We are still looking at fairly robust consumer spending, an increase of about 3.2% for the year and 2.8% next year.  As Mr. Papa mentioned, we are not really seeing any inflation in the system.  It is essentially flat this year, but there will be a modest pick-up to about 1.25% next year.</p> <p>  We see employment growth of 2.6% this year and 2.1% next year.  The unemployment rate, as all members will be aware, peaked at 15.1%, I think in 2012; it has, therefore, fallen fairly dramatically.  What we have seen over the course of the year is that it has continued to fall but not at the same pace as before.  The reason for this, as Ms Weymes mentioned, is there is a labour supply response.  There is returning migration and participation rates are going up.  We still expect unemployment to fall but perhaps not at the same pace as before.  It will be about 8.3% on average this year and about 7.8% next year.</p> <p>  In the budget documentation and our discussions with the IFAC we typically highlight the risks.  As I said earlier, these are contingent forecasts.  They are contingent on continued growth in external markets and so forth.  It is fair to say the risks are tilted towards the downside and mainly external in origin.  Obviously, with Brexit, we have seen fairly substantial appreciation of the euro against sterling.  This time last year &euro;1 bought 73p sterling.  I think yesterday it bought 87p; therefore, there has been substantial depreciation of sterling or appreciation of the euro.  </p> <p>  There is also the possibility that if the UK economy goes into recession, it will have an impact in terms of lower trade levels and so forth.  However, as I mentioned, it is not just about Brexit.  There appears to be an underlying structural weakness in advanced economies.  We have seen very weak productivity growth.  We are all aware of the ageing of the population in the euro area and the United States.  Then there is the possibility of sectoral stagnation, by which we have seen a number of years of disappointing growth figures which is affecting growth expectations globally.  Of course, if one expects growth levels to be weaker, firms will invest less and so forth; therefore, it almost becomes, as some suggest, a negative feedback loop.  There is also the perennial risk posed by geopolitical factors.</p><p> On the domestic front, there is always the possibility of further de-leveraging, that is, households, firms and so forth trying to repair their balance sheet at a more rapid pace than we have assumed.  Then there is the possibility of a further loss in competitiveness, either via the exchange rate or because wages in Ireland move out of sync with productivity or inflation picks up much more rapidly than elsewhere.  I will not go through this, but we have tried to construct a fan chart of our central scenario just to show how uncertain the situation is.  We will publish this on budget day, but in an Irish context in which there are 189,000 enterprises, five of those account for one third of our exports, so we are very much into firm-specific developments.  If firm-specific issues happen, that can throw a forecast off track.</p><p> We have a lot of material about the supply side.  It is of a technical nature, and I do not think it is really relevant to the committee's work.  It is something on which our colleagues in the Fiscal Advisory Council probe us quite deeply.  We are happy to go through it here, but this gives you a flavour of how we see the short-term situation evolving.</p></speech>

Regarding the fiscal space, are we still accepting that it is &euro;1 billion, that there are no changes to it?  The Summer Economic Statement was in June and the witnesses are basing their projections on that, but has anything happened since June that has led them to revise that figure?</p></speech>

This is to give greater clarity so policymakers know whether the figure is &euro;1 billion, &euro;2 billion or zero.  It is based on a number of inputs that are available in the spring every year.  Nine out of ten of them are locked down.  There is one variable that can change but it does not really impact to that extent.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that the &euro;1 billion is pretty much locked at this stage.  One issue I would flag is that there is a little more scope for spending this year because in the mid-year expenditure report, &euro;200 million was identified for schools and flooding that was not provided for in the numbers.  There is therefore a modest uptick this year, but for next year the fiscal space is pretty much locked down at &euro;1 billion.  By fiscal space I mean the maximum amount one can do to be compliant with the fiscal rules.</p></speech>

It is a phenomenon of advanced economies.  The euro area and the US are good examples.  We are seeing very weak productivity growth.  In the past, productivity in advanced economies was 1.5% to 2%.  Over the past couple of years it has been less than 1%.  This is not cyclical.  It has been there for a number of years.  Then there is this slow-burning issue of ageing populations.  We all know there was a baby boom in the US from the 1940s to the 1960s.  They are now coming towards retirement age.  The same is the case in many euro area countries.  For instance, the German population, leaving aside migration, is declining and the working-age population is shrinking.  All these factors impact on the capacity of the economy to grow.  We are at a slightly different stage in the sense that we still have a relatively young population, we still have labour force growth and our productivity numbers are highly volatile on a year-to-year basis but are still, on an underlying basis, reasonably strong.</p> <p>  However, there is this problem of growth consistently underperforming expectations.  That happens on a one-year or maybe two-year basis and is not something to worry about.  Since we have seen growth disappointing pretty much every year since the financial crisis, economic agents are saying that perhaps the outlook is weaker than they had thought.  They are reassessing their projections for where the world economy will be, and if demand is likely to be weaker, there will not be as much investment as they thought there would be.</p><p>Without investment, an economy cannot grow so it becomes self-fulfilling.  This is an issue for some advanced economies and one about which Larry Summers, a well-known economist, has written.  To answer the Deputy's question, while I do not believe it is an issue for Ireland just now, if our main trading partners suffer very weak growth and this becomes a permanent phenomenon, we will simply not be able to export as much.  Therefore, It could have spill-over effects here.</p></speech>

According to the graph provided, they are lower than they were in 2003.  The witnesses take the view that this should stimulate growth or greater investment in commercial property.  The committee has discussed the issue of access to commercial property as it is hampering growth, particularly in the capital.  Are there any indications that investment in this sector is beginning to take place?</p></speech>

The ESRI did a report about two years ago in which it indicated that the reason for the high vacancy rate at that time was that the economy was only coming out of recession and there was no incentive to invest.  It noted also that there had been no commercial investment for about five years.  However, when things began to turn around, we saw the sector beginning to pick up.  The problem with commercial investment, that is, offices and so forth, is that there is a long lead-in time and it is not something that can be turned around overnight.  While there is activity in the sector, it will be some time before everything begins to come on stream.  I accept the Deputy's point in the sense that there is probably a bottleneck now, especially in the capital, but the position should be alleviated, probably in the short term as there has been activity in the sector for two or two and a half years.</p></speech>

The figures on projected increases in employment rates were national figures.  Are figures available for employment growth in the regions?

Does the Department have figures for projected reductions in unemployment or increases in employment in the west next year?</p></speech>

The increase in the private sector was 0.8% whereas there was a fall in the public sector of 0.4%.

Presumably the 1%, if one used the revised GDP figure, the &euro;1 billion structural deficit would shrink to maybe .7% or .8%.  It is the structural deficit.  The denominator is GDP, so if the GDP goes up, the ratio will fall.  Does Mr. McCarthy have a sense of how much of the structural deficit is accounted for by overheating?  I know the Commission uses a bunch of different metrics.  It goes back ten years on employment, it has stated that 8%, 9% or 10% unemployment is about a steady state in Ireland.  Many people in Ireland would say that it is not and it should be lower than that and so forth.  Does Mr. McCarthy know how much the structural deficit was increased on the basis, or on the assumption from the Commission, that Ireland's economy was overheating, as opposed to if we were just at about capacity?  I apologise because I know it is slightly off topic but it is in the same realm.</p></speech>

There are offsetting impacts in the sense that one of the reasons for the 26% figure was the massive influx of intellectual property, which is included in our capital stock and so is also on the supply side.  It also means the estimate of the output gap goes up ever so slightly so that we are further away from the MTO.  The reference rate is based on a ten-year average which is fixed in the spring so the figure does not take into account the 26% actual GDP growth.</p><p> The Deputy asked how much the economy was overheating and what it means for where we are in terms of the business cycle and the structural balance.</p></speech>

Does Mr. McCarthy know how much the structural deficit has grown?  The Commission says we are overheating and that the structural deficit is bigger but were it to say that was not the case, and that we were at approximately output potential, by how much would it shrink?</p></speech>

It comes down to the Commission's methodology, which is agreed by member states and which finds that the labour market clears at about 8% or 9%.  My own view is that the labour market in Ireland probably clears at about 5% or 6%.  In other words, full employment is in that region.  I believe that harmonised methodology understates the true potential of the Irish economy and the gap between the two figures might be two or three percentage points.  At the moment we are probably at or very close to full potential.  In other words, there would be no output and on that basis the headline balance would be very close to the actual balance.  In 2016 we are looking at a deficit of 0.9% of GDP, as is shown in the SES, and for next year we are looking at a headline deficit of 0.4%.  If one takes the view that we are close to potential the structural deficit would go from 0.9% to 0.4% and we would be very close to our MTO next year.</p></speech>

Is it, therefore, the case that a technical assumption is being made?  The Commission is saying we are at full employment at 9% but we are saying we are at full employment at 5%.

It goes from a negative figure of approximately -0.16% in Q1 2013 to a very significant positive figure.  Is that a proxy for personal borrowings?  Is it the country spending money it has?

The Deputy is correct that it applies to phenomena such as car loans and consumer durables, but not mortgages.  However, the reason we have been seeing quite a large increase over the past year or so is because the base was so low.  There is expansion at a high rate, but from a very low base.  We see that household de-leveraging continues to increase.  There was a household savings rate last year of approximately 10%.  Therefore, I do not believe any issues arise over increasing debt.  The rate of debt to disposable income continues to fall.</p></speech>

With regard to the statistics, which obviously represent significant improvements on the earlier years, does the Department have sub-data or sub-analysis that would indicate the proportion of jobless households?  In this regard, Ireland is quite an outlier by comparison with the rest of Europe.  Has the underlying figure begun to improve?  Could the delegation give us the figure or send it to us in a note?</p> <p>  My second point is on the composition of inward migration flows.  I assume an element comprises returning emigrants.  What are the countries from which there is a significant migrant flow?  From my constituency, I know there seems to be a very significant flow of Romanians at present.  They are all becoming employed and doing very well.  I do not know whether the flow of eastern Europeans has resumed.  I refer to Poles and people from the Baltic states.  Has Mr. McCarthy underlying figures on this?</p> <p>  There are two problem areas in the Irish labour market, the first of which concerns people under 26.  What is the pick-up in this regard?  The delegation partly addressed that in response to the question by Deputy Lisa Chambers.  Is it that people with qualifications, such as degrees, are doing better, or is the pick-up also extending to people regarded as unskilled?</p> <p>  There is a very significant problem growing in the Irish labour market concerning people over 50.  Mr. McCarthy was talking about the five big companies being so responsible.  I challenge people to find anybody other than the staff at senior management level in any of those companies who is much over 30.  Does the delegation have statistics on people over 50 and 55?  Is their unemployment situation more difficult because of unspoken bias by employers against middle-aged workers or, as with many of the companies the delegation referred to, those who are classified as older?  Could Mr. McCarthy explain chart 32, which shows the changes in real disposable income?  I could not quite catch what was said.</p></speech>

Being in employment generates income for people.  It generates employment for the self-employed and so forth.  There are various transfers and so forth.  These figures are published in the detailed national accounts every year.  The chart contains our forecasts.  The beige or brown bar shows a 5% increase in labour income in 2016.  It shows what the Deputy and I, for example, earn from being employed.  It is a composition of increases in employment, increases in the number of hours worked and increases in hourly pay.  I refer to labour income, which makes up the bulk of household disposable income.  Capital income is essentially the income of the self-employed in addition to some dividends from company owners and so forth.</p></speech>

So I make transfers to the general Government sector by paying taxes on income and wealth - in my case just income; I do not have any wealth.  In addition the Government makes transfers to me via child benefit and to the unemployed via social welfare and so forth.  Therefore, it is a net position.  That would be the dark green bar.

Let us call it the CPI.  It is slightly different, but it is the inflation rate.  We are trying to look at it in real terms.</p> <p>  All these components added together give the light blue line.

That is the explanation for that chart.  It is all available from the national accounts.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a couple of issues and Ms Weymes can help me out here.  I do not have figures to hand on jobless households.  We can certainly get them and forward them to the secretariat or to the Chair.</p> <p>  The figures for the composition of unemployment by age cohort are available, but that is detailed information that I do not have with me.

The Deputy asked about the return of the under 26 bracket in particular.  During the crisis we saw a very significant tail-off in participation in the two younger brackets.

There has been some rise in the 50 and over component in terms of its future capacity to keep driving overall upward participation trends, but perhaps somewhat more limited.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the proportion of overall migration accounted for by returning Irish.  The census data, produced by the CSO on a usual-residency basis have shown stronger net inward migration than the annual population and migration estimates.  That would point to an uptake in returning Irish.  The reason for that is that the annual estimates are produced using PPS issuance.</p><p>I think it will be some time before those annual April figures produced by the CSO are aligned with what we are seeing in the more comprehensive census data.</p></speech>

I am wondering exactly what we are doing here.  I know that all this technical work has to be done.  When the witnesses say that the risks are all tilted on the downside, it is at that point that I begin to wonder the extent to which all of this goes out the window if certain of those risks materialise.  What precisely are we supposed to do about the risks?  I understand that the witnesses cannot veer into policy but maybe they can talk to me a little bit about precisely what their role is in setting out risks and how far they go in suggesting that we have to respond to certain risks.  Perhaps the witnesses could talk a little bit about that.</p> <p>  I agree with the witnesses.  I believe the external risks and I would say the internal risks are very significant.  They could throw all these projections out the window.  The witnesses might correct me if I am wrong but would it be fair to say that when the crash came in 2007, all of the projections prior to that happening did not in any sense predict what then actually happened?  When we talk about the downside risks, I wonder about all of this.  I am reading that Citibank has put a percentage - I do not know how it is worked out - of 65% on the likelihood of a recession in the US this year.  In the next year, it is saying that there is a 100% chance of a recession in Latin America.  The Bank for International Settlements is saying that we are perilously close to another major slowdown.  The IMF has made five different revisions, I think, to its growth forecasts and all are downwards.  What are we doing about these risks and how do we protect ourselves?  It is a kind of ideological point of "told you so" but I am going to say it anyway.  Secular stagnation, in my opinion, is what Marx called the long-term tendency of the rate of profit to fall and it is materialising.  It is about the ratio of capital to labour essentially appreciating.  For that reason, I think that stagnation is going to continue and we are going to move into it.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses talk a little bit about what exactly their role is in guarding against the risk?  Also, one of the most shocking things the witnesses said was that five firms account for one third of all exports.  That is just shocking.  The jump in the GDP figures of 26% which has spawned the term "leprechaun economics" is further confirmation of just how vulnerable we are.  Five firms account for one third of exports.  There are gross distortions in the growth figures.  Is this a risk?  It strikes me as a risk.  When we are talking about downside risks, that seems to me a very extreme risk.</p><p>If I understand Mr. McCarthy correctly, he is saying that, overall, there will be a slight increase in wage income.</p></speech>

Average income can mean very little when we are talking about people at the top doing very well but people at the bottom not doing so well.  What does it really tell us and can Mr. McCarthy tell us any more?  My reading of the economic growth, and I suspect the feeling of many people, is that the benefit of economic growth is going largely to the better paid and better off.  Indeed, according to a paper I am reading, the share of gross income of the top 10% of earners increased from 34% to 39% over the last five years and, over the same period, roughly half the increase in total income, which was &euro;21 billion, also went to that cohort.  Other figures suggest the bottom 50% received a tiny proportion of the growth in GDP.  Has Mr. McCarthy anything to say on this?  Are there tables, figures and statistics on the distribution of wage growth, income growth and GDP growth?</p></speech>

I think I picked up from the start of the Deputy's intervention that he agrees with me that risks are tilted to the downside - he looked at the Bank for International Settlements, Citibank and a few others.  I certainly stressed in my opening statement and in the presentation here that I think that is the case.  I believe the source of those risks are, as the Deputy correctly said, mainly on the external side, given the highly uncertain environment.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned projections at the time of the crash.  I can say, hand on heart, that they were subsequently out of date within months in 2009, given what happened.  However, what happened both in Ireland and in the vast majority of the global economy was a once in a lifetime situation.  This had not happened since the Great Depression.  I remember that, when we trying to compile the budget for 2009, which was brought forward to October 2008, we were basing our projections on IMF projections which were published a few days earlier.  Within two weeks, the IMF, which is the global leader in terms of economic analysis and economic projections, had to revise down its forecast substantially.  For such an institution to reduce its forecast within two weeks was simply unheard of.  I have spoken to those who do my job in the Treasury and practically every finance Ministry throughout Europe so I know everybody was in the same boat and everybody was behind the curve.  It was obviously a very difficult time for people on the ground but for those trying to understand what was going on, it was also difficult.  Projections were out of date within a couple of weeks, given the scale of what happened at the time.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the question of what we can do.  I have a copy of the stability programme and I would urge the Deputy to have a look at it, in particular pages 26 and 27.  In order to try to quantify the impact of some of these scenarios, we undertake a sensitivity analysis based on models we have access to, some of which are developed by the ESRI and colleagues on my econometrics team.  We are all talking about the world economy and, for example, if world growth is 1% lower than we thought, what is the impact on the Irish economy, what is the impact on the labour market and, from a Department of Finance perspective, what is the impact on the deficit?  We look at a number of scenarios, for example, more de-leveraging within Ireland, a change in world demand, a rise in interest rates or a percentage point sterling depreciation, although we have, of course, seen even more than that.</p><p>We outline what the impact would be and then we provide advice to our Minister and to the political system on the appropriate policy response.  Needless to say, part of the advice we would give is that there must be sustainable public finances in order to be able to accommodate the shock.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the five firms accounting for one third of our exports.  That figure is publicly available and is in various presentations.  We did a risk matrix, which is set out in the stability programme, where we talk about our concentrated industrial base and the impact and main transmission channel.  It states that Ireland's industrial base is highly concentrated in a small number of high tech sectors with the result that output and employment are exposed to firm- and sector-specific shocks.  We saw that, for example, in 2012 with the patent cliff in the pharmaceutical sector.  A number of drugs were coming off patent and it had a massive impact in terms of value added.  This is very difficult to control for because there is a small number of very large firms in Ireland and they pay a disproportionate amount of our corporation tax.  One cannot tell them to go away.  They are significant employers in their own right.  They contribute to the Irish economy and they are very valuable.  However, there is no doubt that it raises concentration risks.</p><p> It is difficult as well, without going into economic theory, for a small economy to have comparative advantage in a large number of sectors.  It is difficult to diversify.  It is not like Germany or the US where it is easy to develop comparative advantage in many sectors.  In our case, we must be quite specific.  What we can do to mitigate this concentration risk is remain competitive and ensure that workers have the appropriate skills, because these firms are in the high technology sectors.  They are not locating here just for the corporation tax but for the quality of our labour, the work-life balance and so forth.  Ireland is generally deemed to be a good place in which to live.  By addressing some of these concerns we can further embed these multinationals and that can mitigate the risk.  However, it can never fully eliminate it, as the Deputy will appreciate.</p><p> Regarding the distribution of wages, on budget day or shortly thereafter we will publish an analysis of what the budget measures mean for each decile of income earners.  We split the total population from the first decile to the tenth and we will be able to say who gains most from the budget measures.  If one looks at the past five or six years, and obviously it differs on a year to year basis, in general the budgetary measures have neither been progressive nor regressive.  It remains to be seen what the impact of budget 2015 will be.  We conduct that analysis - we are conscious of the social impact as well - and we publish it.</p></speech>

It depends on one's definition of "regressive".  That is one debate.  However, one way to examine these matters is to chart things over time, examine what proportion of income is going to capital and labour and whether that changes over time and look at the distribution of income and wealth and see whether there are shifts and changes in it.  Does the Department keep such tables and does it monitor that?</p></speech>

One can see the evolution of the profit share and the wage share over time from the national accounts.  There is a rise in the profit share from the 1970s.  One of the reasons for that is the multinational sector, which is profitable.  However, the profits do not accrue to Irish residents.</p><p>They feed out from GDP and are subtracted to form gross national product, GNP.  The figures must, therefore, be distorted or adjusted accordingly.  <i>A priori</i>, however-----</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. McCarthy might put a figure on it.  My understanding is wage share has dropped by approximately 20% in favour of profit.</p></speech>

Let me put it this way.  While I cannot provide exact figures, a figure of 20% in the period since the 1970s would not be out of the ballpark.  However, one needs to take into account the growth in the multinational sector in this period, especially during the 1990s and 2000s.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy highlighted this exposure when he noted that five companies were responsible for one third of exports.  Obviously, we should not say "Good luck" to these companies.  However, in comparable economies such as Austria and Denmark much greater efforts have been made to expand the indigenous sector so as to insulate the economy from the types of risk to which the Irish economy is exposed.  The GDP figure continues to be at variance with the real experience of the economy and this has a distorting effect on many economic indicators, including investment.  We measure everything as a percentage of GDP, including investment in education, debt-to-GDP ratios and so forth.  These indicators are becoming more corrupted over time.  What would happen if the figure for last year when GDP increased by 26% were flipped?  How would the fiscal rules be affected if the 26% increase were reversed for a particular reason?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016100400002#S00500"><p>It comes back to the point that the fiscal space is set each year in spring.  It is pretty much locked down at that time as nine of the ten variables are fixed.  If there was to be a major surprise subsequently, it would not really impact because the rule on which we focus most, the expenditure benchmark, is based on the potential rather than actual growth rate of the economy.  The rationale for this is that expenditure should grow in line with the trend in the economy, rather than actual developments.  It is, if one likes, about avoiding the mistakes we made in the noughties when we allowed expenditure to increase on the basis of temporary growth, in other words, growth in the construction sector and so forth.  This benchmark strips out actual growth and does not feed into it because it is calculated on the basis of the trend or the potential growth rate of the economy.  It is also smoothed over ten years to remove volatility on a year to year basis.  It is these variables, rather than an actual 26% growth rate, that would feed into the relatively complicated formula used to calculate the fiscal space.  If one were to have a negative surprise, it would not impact on the fiscal space.  I think where the Deputy is coming from - I have some sympathy with his view - is that if GDP were to fall by 26%, everything else being equal, the debt ratio would jump up.  This would create a communications challenge and so forth which we would have to try to overcome.  </p> <p>  To express a personal view, my concern, at least in the short term, is not that we will see some intellectual property being relocated out of Ireland but that more of this investment may be located in Ireland and we could have another growth shock on the other side.  Another 26% increase in GDP would probably be too extreme.</p></speech>

When Mr. McCarthy and I last spoke, we discussed the fact that corporation tax receipts were so far ahead of profile and that people were trying to get their heads around it.  On changes in corporation tax rates, is the reason for the investment in intellectual property to regularise the new corporation tax regime that will come into place?</p></speech>

First, we had a discussion on the over-performance of corporation tax last year and I believe the figure was 49% or 50% higher than we anticipated in the budget.  It is important to point out that we now have the national accounts showing the full 26% growth in GDP.  If one examines the detail of the accounts, one sees that corporate profitability rose by 44% or 45%.  The figures are, therefore, very much aligned.  In one sense, we can explain what occurred last year, whereas we could not explain the growth rate of 7.8% when it was initially estimated by the Central Statistics Office.  That is an important issue.</p> <p>  The second issue is the overall BEPS process.  The mood music is changing on the international corporate taxation front, with some multinational companies becoming less aggressive in their tax planning.  Instead of holding their intellectual property offshore, they are bringing it onshore.  What does this mean for Ireland?  We probably have first mover advantage in the sense that we have substantive multinational actual activities here, as everybody knows, and in the sense that multinationals which own IP are now taking a decision to co-locate their IP in countries where they have substantive economic activities.  That is the reason for the substantial increase in IP in Ireland.  It is coming through two channels, as discussed by Mr. Power earlier.  First, the subsidiary here will purchase the IP from abroad.  This is included in investment but it is also included in imports, which means it does not affect aggregate demand in the short term.  What we saw in 2015 was IP being brought onshore through a different channel when companies rehoused a subsidiary's entire balance sheet - its assets and liabilities, with the assets being the IP - in Ireland.  This process involves setting up a company in the Companies Registration Office and closing down a company in the Caribbean.  Suddenly, the assets - the intellectual property - are in Ireland. </p></speech>

This has a brass tacks effect in terms of what we pay into the European Union.  Growth in GDP results in an overpayment.  Has the overpayment been calculated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016100400002#T00300"><p>I would add a slight nuance to the Deputy's question.  When intellectual property is moved onshore, the company is then profitable and pays a significant increase in corporation tax.  Last year, the increase in corporation tax was of the order of &euro;2.3 billion, which gives rise to a contribution to the EU budget.  There is, therefore, a substantial net gain, if one likes.  The bigger problem relates to the so-called issue of inversions, where one has a relatively small firm taken over by a larger firm simply to shift its head office to Ireland.  Once its head office is in Ireland, all the subsidiaries, from a national accounting perspective, locate their profits in Ireland.  We do not get any of the money because we have double taxation agreements with a large number of countries.  This results in an increase in our gross national product as opposed to gross domestic product and, as a result, gross national income or GNI, which is essentially the same thing as GNP.  Our contribution to the European Union budget increases because of these corporate taxation issues.</p><p>On foot of the revised national accounts, the quantum is about &euro;280 million, additional to the EU budget.  As I stressed, it must be seen in the context of a substantial increase in corporation tax receipts.</p></speech>

It needs to kick off, given that we have a timeline and know that the United Kingdom will have exited by the first quarter of 2019.  All of that work will begin on how it is to be redistributed and whether everybody else will pay a little more or whether expenditure will be reduced.  These are decisions that will need to be made in the next couple of years.</p></speech>

It affects so many sections of society directly in people being made homeless, in terms of the physical and mental health of individuals but also in terms of foreign direct investment.  The less housing capacity there is, the more difficult it will be to attract foreign direct investment and achieve internal growth.  There is also the potential for housing issues to have a destabilising effect on the banking system.  Has there been any assessment of the effect of such bottlenecks on growth and development?</p></speech>

There were a number of years in which supply essentially was at minimal levels.  We then saw a much more rapid pick-up in the economy than would have been anticipated, with the demand for housing rising rapidly.  Of course, the price elasticity of supply is very low, given that so many developers have gone out of business and access to capital is a problem.  With the new finding model, a person cannot walk in and get a 955 loan from a bank, which is good from a financial stability perspective.  There is certainly a mismatch or an imbalance between demand and supply in the economy.  We are very conscious of the impact from a social as well as a competitiveness perspective.  As the Deputy rightly said, workers need to be housed to make Ireland attractive for foreign direct investment.  We need to be able to provide affordable accommodation.  That is why the Government has come out with the rebuilding Ireland programme, with 80 or 90 sub-actions.  It might take some time for all of them to come on stream, but it will ultimately lead to an increase in supply.  Everybody is of the same opinion: this is a supply rather than a demand side problem.</p></speech>

They merely stipulate that whatever is spent needs to be financed.  A country can choose a UK-type model, a relatively low size of government, or a Swedish-type model.  The country just needs to finance the expenditure.  In principle everybody agrees with this.</p> <p>  Some flexibility is included in the Stability and Growth Pact in that investment is smoothed over a four-year period.  Therefore, spending can be ramped up in a particular year.  In the summer economic statement we set out that by increasing the level of investment by &euro;60 million, it could be leveraged upwards to something like &euro;240 million or &euro;250 million in 2017.  This is certainly in the Government's plans and there is scope to do it.  I stress it is above and beyond what is already identified in the public capital programme.  As I mentioned, an additional &euro;200 million was announced at mid-year that had not been provided for to be used, I believe, for school projects and flood relief measures.</p><p>There will be a fairly significant increase in investment over the medium term.</p></speech>

My own view is we probably have sufficient capacity in the short term to be able to absorb that investment.  I stress that it is the scale.  If went from &euro;5 billion to &euro;10 billion, there would be huge inflationary pressures and we would get less bang for our buck because it would all be in terms of inflation.  Taking a more graduated approach probably leads to a better bang for our buck.</p></speech>

I may have misinterpreted it but did she say it is attributed to female returns because women were in education during the crisis?  If I did not misinterpret it, can she drill down into that for me?  Did women disproportionately return to education during the crisis?  Why was that the case?  Does Ms Weymes have any data on that?</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy outlined the gain for each decile after the budget.  Will that be proportionate to their income?  We always hear that a reduction in USC will give a person on low income &euro;10 but what about the person on a far greater income?  People may deliberately leave out the proportionality of that.  Is that taken into consideration with the figures Mr. McCarthy gave?  Does it also take into account child benefit and other payments people get?  If there were to be increases in that, would it be reflected in that?</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy spoke about the co-location of intellectual property by companies that have economic activities here.

I ask the Deputy to give me time to think about the switch model.</p> <p>  There are obviously a lot of moving variables in this.  It is important to stress that with the globalisation we have seen in recent years, some of these things can change at the stroke of a pen.  Everything else being equal, we have this bringing onshore of the IP and co-locating it where there are substantive activities.  The Minister took an important policy initiative in either the budget for 2013 or the budget for 2014 with the introduction of a knowledge development box with essentially half the corporation tax rate for knowledge created in Ireland.  It is part of a trend that is going on elsewhere; I believe the UK, the Netherlands and perhaps some other countries are moving down this road.</p> <p>  Another attractive feature of our corporation tax regime is the research and development tax credit.  I am not supposed to talk about policy but I think I can say something briefly on policies that have been implemented.  Those two policies will help to further embed the IP in Ireland and help Ireland move up the so-called value-added chain.  We have a strong comparative advantage given our investment in third level education, etc., and the high skills attainment of the labour force.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Weymes to respond to the other issue.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that I mentioned it.  It was not so much in terms of outlook but it was the position reported at the end of the second quarter that the 0.4% increase in the participation rate was predominantly driven by the younger cohort and, within that cohort, by females.</p><p>The CSO has collected data that look at the potential additional labour force where people declare that they have remained outside the labour market for reasons of education or otherwise.  The data are broken down by gender and they substantiate the claim that there were strong cohort effects of the younger group remaining in education.  It is their return into the labour force that is driving the current pick-up.</p></speech>

We have what is deemed to be the second most progressive income tax system in the OECD but it is difficult when we make concessions which most benefit those in the higher decile.  That is a function of the progressivity of our income tax system.</p> <p>  As far as I know, child benefit is not included in the switch model.

On the other hand, Mr. McCarthy says we are going up the value chain because representatives of some of these companies walk into the companies registration box and, with the stroke of a pen, relocate intellectual property assets.  They are not actually relocating real economic activity - they are just doing an accountancy trick.  This may benefit us but is not about the movement of real economic activity.  One cannot have it both ways.  Either we are entitled to the tax from the &euro;13 billion because the profits were booked here or we are not entitled to the stuff the company is relocating here.  There is a bit of a dichotomy in this respect.</p> <p>  The company may now feel under pressure as the mood music changes and it is no longer sustainable to avoid tax in the aggressive way they have been doing.  It may now have decided that the Irish tax jurisdiction is better from its point of view than the US, where it would be paying 37%.  However, it raises the question of how a company books intellectual property profits.  How does it cite them?  It strikes me that we are talking about accountancy here, not real economic activity.</p></speech>

The Deputy's question concerns my point about moving up the value chain, which I mentioned in the context of the knowledge development box and the research and development tax credit.  The preferential treatment in this case cannot be availed of by moving IP to Ireland but only by developing the knowledge in Ireland.  A company cannot simply develop it elsewhere, move it into Ireland and avail of our research and development tax credit.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for his remarks.  I will be delighted to work with him and all members.  Deputy Bernard Durkan and I are long-serving members of this committee.  Deputy Durkan has served as Chairman, Vice Chairman and member.</p> <p>  I know Deputy Michael Healy-Rae will be very effective in his role as Chairman because of his vast experience.  I am particularly interested in this role because I was appointed by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey as the negotiator during the negotiations on the Single European Act from 1989 to 1992.  I was dealing with those who were negotiating on behalf of the British Government at that time and we worked very well together.</p> <p>  As a Senator I will have more time than most Deputies to devote to this committee.  I think that on a joint committee it is a good idea that the Chairman is a Member of the D&aacute;il , which I support, but it is appropriate that the Vice Chairman is a Member of the Seanad.  As far as this Oireachtas is concerned, both Houses have equal status and this is a step in the right direction in that regard.</p> <p>  I look forward to working with the very experienced Deputy Durkan.  Let me assure members that like the Chairman, I will be totally impartial when called to take the Chair.  I know I will not be called too often to take the Chair.</p></speech>

I know some members have been here before, such as Deputies Crowe and Durkan and Senator Paul Coghlan, but to anyone taking up a new position here be assured it is a very interesting committee.  I certainly value the opportunity to come here and answer questions and, most importantly, to hear points of view.  This is my first time to address this committee of which I was previously a member.  I will update the committee on discussions of the September General Affairs Council, GAC, and preview the agenda for the upcoming October GAC.  I should note, of course, that the September meeting took place immediately after the Bratislava summit of 27 Heads of State and Government and that the General Affairs Council has also been looking at the preparations for the forthcoming European Affairs Council.</p> <p>  I will start with issues pertaining to the United Kingdom.  It is obvious that any discussion now at EU level has to take stock of the UK referendum in June 2016 across the Irish Sea.  The decision to leave the EU has profound implications for all the European Union member states and for the broader international community.  What exactly these implications will be, we will only know over time.  We know it is of particular significance for Ireland and, in this regard, the Government has been assiduously highlighting our concerns to the UK Government and our EU partners with regard to Northern Ireland, the Border, the Common Travel Area, citizenship issues and the interconnectedness of our trade.  We have been making these points vociferously.  The Taoiseach met Prime Minister May in July.  The British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, MP, visited Dublin earlier this month and met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, the T&aacute;naiste and me.  I also met my new opposite number, the British Minister of State for Europe, David Jones, MP, in Brussels a couple of weeks ago.</p> <p>  With regard to our broader outreach to our EU partners, since the referendum, the Taoiseach has held meetings with Chancellor Merkel, with President Hollande and with President Tusk.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has spoken individually with his counterparts and I have met a number of European Ministers.  On all these occasions, we have explained our concerns in detail and the need for them to be treated sensitively in the upcoming negotiations.  We have reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to European Union membership and our intention, once withdrawal negotiations commence, to play an active and constructive role in the European EU negotiating team, one of 27.  It is fair to say that we have found considerable sympathy and understanding from all the partners with whom we have met but it will be necessary to reinforce these points over the coming months and to ensure that they support practical results for us in the negotiations programme.  In this context, I welcome Prime Minister May&rsquo;s comments on Sunday which offered, finally, greater clarity about the triggering of Article 50 and the timeframe for the subsequent negotiations.  She also gave some important indications as to the UK's approach, although much remains to be determined.  Subsequent to that we need to negotiate.</p> <p>  In the aftermath of the UK referendum, a meeting of the European Council was held in Brussels on 28 June, just three or four days after the vote.  This was followed, on 29 June, by a summit involving the 27 remaining Heads of State and Government, obviously without the United Kingdom.  This was attended by Presidents Tusk and Juncker.  The summit agreed a number of important principles, notably that there can be no negotiations and no pre-negotiations before the UK formally triggers Article 50 and that access to our Single Market requires acceptance of all four freedoms, including the free movement of people.</p><p>That remains the broad and agreed EU approach.  It is important that we now move forward in the most practical and sensible manner and, in this regard, the Government is continuing to intensify our preparations.  I am happy to respond to any points Deputies may wish to make.</p><p> The Bratislava Summit took place on 29 June in the 27 leader format.  This began a process of reflection on the renewal and future of the European Union.  As a first step in that process the 27 EU leaders discussed the key challenges and key priorities for the European Union with a focus on migration, internal security, external security and defence, and, importantly, on economic and social development focusing on young people.  In his interventions, the Taoiseach highlighted the priority that Ireland, along with many other EU partners, attaches to economic issues and in particular the Single Market and Digital Single Market, that we continue to create jobs and look at issues pertaining to investment and trade, and he stressed the need for a balanced approach in how we deal with the many challenges we face.</p><p> There was no discussion at Bratislava of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, other than a report from European Council President Tusk of his own meeting with Prime Minister May, and a reaffirmation of the principles agreed, which I outlined earlier, that were agreed in June.  The Taoiseach took the opportunity to remind his counterparts once again of Ireland's specific concerns in relation to Brexit, particularly regarding Northern Ireland, North-South relations, the Common Travel Area and bilateral trade.  A short work programme for the period ahead was agreed at Bratislava.  It was decided that the process of reflection should continue in the October meeting of the European Council.  Another meeting of the 27 leader format will take place in Malta in early 2017.  This coincides with the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome and the founding document of the European Union.  A few days later, on 20 September, the September meeting of the General Affairs Council took place in Brussels.  It was a regular meeting and the agenda covered a follow-up to the June European Council, the mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, the Commission&rsquo;s letter of intent for its legislative programme in 2017 and preparations for the forthcoming European Council.</p><p> The need to ensure effective follow-up to European Council decisions has featured in discussions at many levels in the EU for some time now.  Building on the work of the previous Dutch Presidency, the current Slovak Presidency led a discussion at the Council on the basis of two papers produced by the General Secretariat of the Council, which highlighted some advances as well as some areas where more work is needed.  Member states' interventions focused on making more progress on the measures that have already been agreed on migration and in particular the EU-Turkey deal, the completion of the banking union and advancing the Digital Single Market.  For my part, I welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s emphasis on the development of the Single Market and the Digital Single Market.  I also stressed the importance of implementing the services directive was crucial to ensuring growth, particularly for the potential of the SME sectors of our economy which we know are vital for the Irish economy and right across the European Union.  We need to see barriers to doing business digitally and across borders as barriers to the very creation of growth, jobs and investment.  I recalled that the Capital Markets Union is also essential to support a rich diversity of financing options for businesses, that further measures around investment are welcome and that banking union must also be fully completed.</p><p> The European Union&rsquo;s Multiannual Financial Framework spans a seven-year period and is subject to a mid-term review.  The review was published on 14 September and presented at the September General Affairs Council meeting.  The Commission noted the challenges which had been faced in recent years and the need for the EU budget to be able to react swiftly to unforeseen events.  Very limited additional financing is now proposed under the jobs and growth, migration, external relations and security headings.  However, the key point to note is that existing spending ceilings will not be changed.  I intervened to highlight the added value of the EU budget, pointing to the importance of EU support for areas where we had comparative advantages, in particular the agrifood sector.  The review will now be discussed at working group level but will return to the General Affairs Council agenda regularly in the coming period.  The Commission is aiming to have the review package completed before the end of the year.  Any change made under the review will also impact on how the next multiannual financial framework is prepared.  The proposal for the framework is due by 1 January 2018.</p><p> The Commission also made a presentation on its general priorities in 2017.  There is continued emphasis on being &ldquo;big on the big things&rdquo; and concrete delivery of initiatives around President Juncker&rsquo;s ten strategic priorities.  Some of the elements on which the Commission intends to focus include the following: expanding the European Fund for Strategic Investments, complemented by an external investment plan aimed at addressing the root causes of migration; completing the Digital Single Market; producing a white paper on Economic and Monetary Union in early 2017; and strengthening trade defence instruments, with particular reference to the steel industry.</p><p> As I said at the General Affairs Council, Ireland believes that, rather than focusing on great leaps towards further integration, the focus should be on delivering concrete outcomes in areas which have already been agreed and which directly affect Irish and other EU citizens, particularly in the Single Market and the Digital Single Market.  The Commission is due to present a more detailed actual work programme in the coming weeks, taking into account the views of the Council and the Parliament.</p><p> The September General Affairs Council also looked at preparations for the October European Council of Heads of State and Government.  I will return to that issue shortly, but I would first like to refer to items which will be on the agenda for the General Affairs Council on 18 October.  The October General Affairs Council will look further at the review of the Multiannual Financial Framework and hear about the state of play at that point.  We will also consider implementation of the inter-institutional agreement on better law-making, an agreement which was finally concluded in 2015 after very long negotiations.  It sets out how the three institutions - the Council, the Commission and the Parliament - will act together to legislate collectively at EU level.</p><p> The next General Affairs Council will be the final preparatory meeting before the October European Council.  There are three items listed on the agenda: migration, trade and external relations, with specific reference to Russia.  The draft conclusions for the European Council will have been circulated by that time and our discussion will be based around the text of the conclusions. </p><p> We are all aware of how the issue of migration continues to dominate debate at EU level.  It has been on the agenda for every European Council since last year and continues to be a central feature of discussions at every level, including European ministerial level.  The September Council heard an update from the Commission on developments and I expect our discussions in October to also start that way.  In the past year Heads of State and Government have set out a comprehensive EU approach to dealing with migration which has been gradually taking effect.</p><p>This has been continuously reviewed, with both short-term and long-term measures introduced as and when deemed necessary.  A recent short-term measure, for example, was introduced at the Bratislava summit on 16 September, when member states offered immediate assistance to strengthen the Bulgarian border with Turkey.  Long-term measures include the establishment of a European border and coast guard.<br/><br/>The discussion at the October European Council will again take stock of progress.  Along with reviewing the EU-Turkey deal agreed last March, it is expected to cover the plans for co-operation with third countries, known as partnership frameworks or migration compacts.  We look forward to hearing how work is progressing.<br/><br/>Ireland, to some extent, is at one remove from the full force of the migration crisis due to our geographical location, our position regarding justice and home affairs measures under the EU treaties and our non-participation in the free travel Schengen area.  However, we do, of course, recognise the priority of the migration issue for the EU and its sensitivity for many EU partners, many of which are under significant domestic pressure.  We have sought to be constructive and to support and take part in a comprehensive approach, where possible.  In this spirit, we have made a number of commitments on a voluntary basis.<br/><br/>The main elements of our response are as follows.  First, there is our voluntary opt-in to EU programmes, whereby we have offered to take 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers between relocation and resettlement programmes.  To date, 486 people have been admitted from Lebanon for resettlement.  With regard to relocation, just 69 people have arrived from Greece so far.  However, a further 40 people have been assessed and cleared for arrival, and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made.  Second, Irish naval vessels have been deployed on search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, where they have rescued over 12,500 individuals, including, I am happy to say, 382 today alone.  The work by Naval Service and its men and women in representing our country has been done in very difficult circumstances and is saving real lives.  <i>LE James Joyce</i>just returned to Ireland last Friday and <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>has now taken her place.  I know all of us here in the Oireachtas salute the achievements of the Naval Service and thank its members for their exemplary service.  Third, we have also provided significant assistance to key organisations.  Between 2012 and 2015, Irish Aid provided more than &euro;42 million in support of those affected by the Syrian crisis, the largest response ever to a single crisis.  Fourth, on 19 September, Ireland, along with Jordan, co-facilitated a major UN summit of world leaders on migration and refugees in New York.  The summit agreed a new set of global policy principles - the first of this kind - on migration and refugees.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, represented Ireland at this event.<br/><br/>On trade, the October European Council is due to have a comprehensive discussion on trade matters.  This will include the arrangements for concluding CETA, the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which are due to be settled at an extraordinary meeting of Trade Ministers on 18 October.  CETA is a broad and deep agreement based on the reality of today&rsquo;s trade patterns.  It will remove over 99% of tariffs between the EU and Canada and create sizeable new market access opportunities.  This includes ending limitations in access to public contracts, opening up services markets and offering predictable conditions for investors.  As I said, these trade agreements are of particular significance for SMEs, which benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &quot;double testing&quot; on both sides of the Atlantic.  There are exciting opportunities, particularly for a small, open economy such as Ireland's and across the European Union, as well as in Canada.</p><p> The Commission presented in July its proposals for the signature, conclusion and provisional application of CETA.  We support the principle that CETA should proceed as a mixed agreement.  This essentially means that the agreement includes matters of national competence and will require participation by national parliaments, obviously including our own, in the ratification process.  However, it is also possible for those parts of the agreement that are within the EU's competence to be advanced through provisional application.</p><p> CETA is due to be signed at the EU-Canada summit on 27 October and we support its provisional application at the earliest opportunity, following expected approval by the European Parliament later this year.  At a time of growing opposition in many developed economies to free trade and new trade agreements, concluding CETA will send a positive signal that the EU remains supportive of the major role of trade in contributing to economic growth.</p><p> I hope that the October European Council will continue to give its support to the TTIP negotiations, consistent with the negotiating mandate settled under the Irish Presidency in 2013.  A successful TTIP agreement would boost growth and consumer welfare on both sides of the Atlantic, allow the world's two largest trading blocs to show new leadership on international regulatory standards and underpin high levels of environmental, consumer and social protection.  This is why our trade Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, joined 11 other trade Ministers in a recent letter to Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m highlighting the need for a strong and positive voice in the ongoing trade discussions.  While it seems clear that any final agreement will now have to await a new US Administration, we continue to support pressing ahead to make as much progress as possible this year towards an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial agreement.</p><p> External relations will be discussed, in particular pertaining to Russia.  These will touch upon the situation in Ukraine which, because of Russian actions, has led to the imposition of EU sanctions.  Sanctions are linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements where there has been a lack of progress in implementing security and political provisions.  After a tense August with heavy exchanges between the two sides, a local ceasefire took effect on 1 September and seems to be holding.  It is too early to say if the question of easing the sanctions will be on the table at the European Council.  Ireland supports the long-term view that a strong and stable relationship between the EU and Russia is desirable as a strategic goal.  However, we must take account of the current situation in Ukraine, which would make progress in this direction welcome.</p><p> That concludes my statement.  I acknowledge that it was long and I thank members for their patience.  Given the summer timelines and the number of meetings, several issues had to be covered.  I look forward to continuing a high quality of engagement with the committee in the months ahead on all matters pertaining to the EU.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I welcome his officials and the ambassadorial representatives.  Embassies are of course interested in this matter.  It is the most significant issue facing Europe.  It is regrettable that we have reached this stage, given that the UK will undoubtedly be a loss to Europe and to us.  I say that as a former trade Minister who worked closely with the British on issues that affected our islands.  That said, we must face reality.  A dedicated Minister for Brexit is needed, be it the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, or someone else.</p><p>We must have someone to whom we can relate.  This is the Committee on European Union Affairs and we will play an important role in discussing the matter with fellow parliamentarians in the other 26 member states.  There is a case to be made for inviting representatives of those countries' European affairs committees to Ireland in order that they might see at first hand what the border between the UK and Europe means as it applies to Ireland and realise that it is a porous border.  It was not of our making and we would rather that the Border was not there, but it is there.  Seeing it would show them the seriousness of this matter.</p><p> Ireland should have a representative on the negotiating body.  The Government should insist.  No other country is more affected than we are.  We and the UK are hand in glove as regards trade.  It is &euro;1 billion in trade per week.  Will the Minister of State indicate his views on this?  Will he indicate whether Ireland should insist on having representatives on the negotiating body to keep abreast of what is happening day by day and week by week and how it will affect our country?  The EU owes us no more and no less.  We have sacrificed by joining the EU and being dedicated and loyal members.  We are in a critical situation because of the UK's decision to opt out under the Lisbon treaty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.171" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016100400002#K00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive report on recent events in the EU and elsewhere generally.  We are told that the Bratislava summit, which took place following the Brexit vote, allowed for political reflection and consideration of further reforms.  The Brexit vote was a wake-up call for all the EU.  The referendum highlighted the rise of intolerance and fundamental nationalism, not just in the UK, but throughout Europe as a whole.  We are all aware that eurosceptic parties are gaining support.  As the Minister of State mentioned, the EU is facing many challenges - irregular migration, security and terrorism, poor economic growth and youth unemployment.  There is a feeling that the EU is not delivering for its citizens.  We speak of the disconnect between the EU institutions and its citizens.  There are issues of poor communication, institutions are perceived as remote, Commissioners come across as high handed and autocratic, and citizens believe that they are being talked down to.  Following the Brexit vote, does the Minister of State get any sense that the EU institutions, including the Council and the Commissioners, appreciate the major challenges facing the Union and the need to address these problems?</p> <p>  My second question is on Irish neutrality.  At the summit, there was a discussion about the future deepening of the EU's common defence and security co-operation.  EU leaders agreed to step up co-ordination in security measures and pool defence resources.  I understand that there was also agreement that there would be further EU-NATO co-operation.  Proposals are to be brought forward in December in that regard.  Will the Minister of State assure the committee that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is not being undermined in this process?</p> <p>  The Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il today of his various meetings with his counterparts throughout Europe and the presidents of the various institutions.  The Minister of State did likewise in his speech.  The Minister of State meets his counterparts regularly.  Do they understand Ireland's unique position arising from the Brexit vote?  He outlined concerns about the common travel area, the erection of barriers to trade, the erection of a hard Border and the threat to our peace process.  A major diplomatic effort is needed to highlight the special position of Ireland.</p><p>Certainly from my experience of being in Brussels, it is only when one talks about the threats to the Northern Ireland peace process that they engage with the issues of human rights and so forth.  I would be interested in hearing if we have a good deal more work to do in that regard, or is our message getting through?</p><p> Professor Alan Barrett contended at the recent European Symposium on European Union Affairs that a UK withdrawal from the European Union would hasten a shifting of the centre of gravity in the Union, with Germany gaining even greater influence.  Mr. Dan O'Brien said something similar.  Is this a worry for a small member state like Ireland and do we need to build new alliances in the European Union, with Britain exiting, to ensure our interests are protected?  </p><p> With the Chairman's indulgence, I have one further question.  It relates to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, which the Minister of State mentioned.  He did not mention, however, that there were concerns about the agreement with respect to the possibility of corporations suing states.  The fear is that there will be a decline in standards and regulation.  There is a need for parliamentary scrutiny of the areas within the competence of nation states.  As a political committee, we need to address these concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1332" speakername="Declan Breathnach" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016100400002#L00200"><p>I was delighted to hear the Minister of State's presentation.  As a substitute, I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.</p> <p>  Without taking from all of the other issues on the agenda, I want to focus on Brexit and its implications for these islands and the European project.  As a Deputy who represent the Border constituency of Louth, I want to focus on the currency fluctuation issue which is of immediate concern.  We are all aware of the impact it is already having on the agricultural trade and tourism in terms of currency differentials and that is only the start.  The immediate issue this raises for the European Union, which with others I have raised at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, concerns the &euro;1.6 billion in EU funding that will be and should be available both in the North and the South over the period of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes and the danger that there will be a reduction in these moneys.  Following the last meeting of the joint committee, it came to my attention that 17 projects proposed to be undertaken in Border constituencies to a total figure of &euro;120 million were at the stage where letters of offer were to be issued but that they were being withheld in the Department on the basis of concerns about what the position would be post-Brexit.  Part of the agreement is that letters of offer are conditional on their being available only up to 2017.  This is leading to uncertainty and causing worry among local authorities, community groups and in the education and health sectors about the myriad of projects at the planning stage and those at the stage where letters of offer are to be issued.  There is an urgent need to address this issue.  As Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey said, the dangers to the peace process need to be recognised in the context of the importance of these moneys, both North and South.  I ask the Minister of State for his opinion on the giving of a commitment, by the Government and the European Union, to a continuation of both programmes.  </p> <p>  Additionally, I argue that those who hold sway on the island, both North and South, regardless of a Brexit, should remain committed to the peace process.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain needs to see beyond 2017.  What is the Minister of State's view on how the European Union, as an organisational body, can give its total commitment to the continuation of that funding, regardless of whether projects are planned for the North or the South, by getting the British Government to sign up to what is effectively a solemn agreement in the Good Friday Agreement and commit to providing its portion of the funding to enable the bodies to which I referred that are planning projects to continue with them?</p><p>That is a matter of immediate importance that extends beyond any negotiations over the next number of months.  There needs to be a statement of clarity, both from the Government and from the Minister of State's Department, and a commitment from the EU to honour those projects.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on those matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016100400002#M00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his contribution.  Unlike colleagues, I will not focus on the detail of Brexit, as it has been raised by the other members.  The Taoiseach spoke about it in the Seanad last week and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will be in the Seanad tomorrow for statements on the issue.  We have a fair idea what Ireland's key aims are going into the negotiations process.  What are the initial collective aims of the other 26 members states?  What issues were discussed perhaps not necessarily formally but on the margins of the EU summit in Bratislava?  Politically within the European People's Party, EPP, has there been any discussion of a co-ordinated response by governments where the EPP is in control, as it is here?</p> <p>  As the Minister of State mentioned, Brexit has led to a new discussion on the future of Europe, where is it going and how to reconnect with the citizens, which Deputy Haughey mentioned at some length.  The Minister of State commented on the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker's emphasis on being big on the big things.  That is crucial in bringing the EU back to the people in terms of re-awakening their interest, commitment and enthusiasm for the European Union, an enthusiasm that is waning rapidly on the Continent, if less so here.  I am very much convinced that there is a need for a major EU investment plan, as was mentioned in President Juncker's ten-point plan.  We need to see big European projects similar to those we saw here in the 1980s with the investment of infrastructural funds and the road building projects which are clearly European and have been funded by the EU without them being claimed as Government projects.</p> <p>  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, is the subject of a Seanad Private Members' motion to be taken tomorrow evening and we have had a few briefings on it.  I agree with the Minister of State that it is beneficial, as is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, but it is facing considerable opposition from the labour movement here and especially on the Continent.  I am concerned the argument highlighting the benefits of CETA and TTIP is not being made well enough by the European Union and, more importantly, by the people who will benefit most from them, ordinary European citizens, the business and agricultural leaders.  All the sectors could point to the big things that being part of the European Union would allow us to do and to champion.  I fear an information vacuum has developed and that vacuum is being filled by the hard left and by people who are opposing it and giving misinformation, although others may disagree on that, and focusing on elements that are detrimental.</p> <p>  I wish to raise the issue of Russia.  The situation in Ukraine has led to the current situation and the sanctions, about which there will not be any change.  While the Ukrainian situation is being discussed, we cannot neglect to focus on the current activities of Russia in Syria, especially in Aleppo.  It was raised by Senator Bacik on the Order of Business today in the Seanad.  As much as we need to discuss the Ukraine, and the European Union has been firm in that and I commend the actions relating to sanctions, with the harrowing pictures that we are seeing and the impact of the airstrikes, we cannot lose sight of the situation in Syria.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016100400002#M00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his presentation.  This is my first time to address him and it is a pleasure to do so.  Listening to the soundings around Europe, I detect a hardening of positions towards the UK which concerns me greatly.  Ireland continually talks about the relationship we have with the UK and about how precious it is to this island, which nobody can deny.  However, that relationship is not precious to France, Germany, Holland or to any of the 26 member states.  Senator Richmond touched on the discontent, as did Deputy Haughey, among ordinary European citizens.  Senator Richmond referred to the rise of the hard left.</p><p>I am somewhat concerned in respect of the European Community and even Mr. Juncker&rsquo;s recent speeches are negative by nature and deal only with problems.  I do not deny that there are problems in holding the European Community together apart from anything else.  I am not so sure that a major investment plan will buy anybody right now.  We need a major marketing job by Europe to sell or bring home to the individual citizen on the ground the benefits of Europe.  Many motorways and office blocks around the country have signs stating that such a project was funded by the European Union.  However, people's interest in that has waned and they do not really care any more.  There is a rising call within this country for an Irish exit from Europe which would be detrimental to our economy.  Regardless of our relationship with Britain, we need to hold that together.</p><p> It is time that we were honest with the citizens on both sides of this island and informed them that there will be a Border.  There are only two options open if the other 26 dig their heels in.  The two options are a border around the island of Ireland or a border between the North of Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  That then opens the possibility - I have said this on a number of occasions - of an Ellis Island developing in Belfast or Drogheda, depending on which is easier to get into. That would create serious problems for this country with people migrating towards this country, as the only place with a land border with the UK.  That is a concern.</p><p> UK Ministers and its Prime Minister are now admitting openly that the Brexit plan will be a shock to its economy; it will get worse before it gets better.  We have already seen that the exchange rate has passed the 85 pence to the euro mark - it is up at 87.5 pence today.  If it hits 90 pence, we are in serious trouble with respect to our trade with the UK.  What plans does the Government have to support trade between the two islands?</p><p> Returning to the Border issue, 30,000 people cross the Border every day.  I believe approximately 1 million gallons of milk cross the Border on a daily basis.  These are serious issues.  Someone last night suggested building a dual carriageway between Mullingar and Letterkenny in order to get over the problem of having to cross the Border.  I sincerely hope this is not the way we are going.  I have a problem with that.</p><p> Returning to what some of my colleagues have already said, I would like what are the side-bar chats between the Minister of State and his colleagues at European ministerial level.  Is there a real acceptance that Ireland's community, North and South, voted by way of referendum on both parts of this island to have open borders and co-operate together?  Do they really understand what that means?  We simply cannot allow them to derail something that took 35 years to put together.  I am really worried about that.</p><p> I will not be embracing CETA or TTIP right now.  There are serious concerns about these trade agreements.  I understand the United States is not so enamoured by TTIP now.  We will not have time today to debate these but perhaps at some stage in the future we might set aside an entire meeting for them.  We are pretty tight on time given that the first one will be signed on 18 October.</p><p> I see a rise of protectionism and nationalism.  The migration issue has caused countries to consider closing borders and many have already done so.  We have successfully traded off for a couple of billion euro the refugee crisis to Turkey, but we all know that will not last.  At some stage these refugees will want to get out of Turkey.</p><p> The British have a view of European legislation, in particular workers' rights and human rights.  I heard the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, say that as far as possible UK legislation would encompass European law as it stands.  However, I understand there is some concern, particularly in the area of human rights, that it may not be as encompassing as we might like it to be.</p><p> I apologise for asking the Minister of State so many questions; it will keep him going for a while.</p></speech>

We should all welcome the clarity provided by the British Prime Minister on Brexit.  We might need to be patient for a little longer.  Does the Minister of State think this is the British Prime Minister's opening position and that she does not mean to be as hard as she might sound?  I think there is agreement between Britain and Ireland in opposition to a hard Border.  Given that we had so many long-standing agreements covering free movement, trade and so on prior to the EEC, not to mind the EU, this is something when the negotiations start in March of next year, about which the EU should show tolerance.</p> <p>  How will our net contribution to the EU change post-Brexit?  It is obvious that the UK had no plan and the best it can hope for at the moment is to start negotiations with all sorts of other countries.  Perhaps it thought it could have - as was put by a colleague earlier - side-bar negotiations prior to the formal invoking of Article 50.</p> <p>  We are part of the EU and the Minister of State might confirm that we will be fully engaged and fully apprised on the EU side on the negotiations that will take place.  Today I met a German delegation of parliamentarians from Bavaria visiting the House.  They seem to be very concerned, as we are.  They see their own position and, so to speak, dominance in Europe diminishing as a result of this move.  I could not get into it in great detail with them.  I took a note, but I cannot read my own writing at this stage.  They think there are too many factors and it is too early for a co-ordinated response at a European level.  I mention that because someone else here mentioned it already.</p> <p>  We might need to continue with much uncertainty and volatility.  We know what we want with regard to the Single Market or as near as possible to that.  We need Britain to be flexible and they also need to compromise a bit.  That will take a bit of time with regard to the North and the common travel area.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the all-island civic dialogue on Brexit, which the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have initiated, and which is to take place in Dublin on 2 November, involving representatives of civic society, trade unions, business groups and non-governmental organisations, as well as representatives from all political parties on the island of Ireland.  I also welcome the appointment by the EU of Michel Barnier as its chief Brexit negotiator.  I understand he will be in Dublin shortly.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that.</p></speech>

The backdrop to today&rsquo;s meeting is the decision made by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, in her recent comments on Brexit that Britain would trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017.  The Minister of State stated there is clearly sympathy and understanding.  What does that mean?  Is that there to reassure us that there will be sympathy and understanding about Ireland's unique situation?  What does the Minister of State believe this sympathy and understanding will deliver?  Will it, as some members have suggested, mean a hardening of positions with regard to Britain?  What impact will that have on Ireland?</p> <p>  From the British Prime Minister's statement, it seems to be going for a hard Brexit.  If that is the situation it will greatly impact on Ireland.  People have talked about not only the Border, customs etc., but also the impact it will have on people's daily lives and the impact it will have on the Good Friday Agreement.  People are taking a case in court today over the fact that the Brits are clearly reneging on the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>The tea and sympathy will not go down particularly well.  Alex Salmond was here during the week.  Scotland is unique in that it voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU.  Will this be part of the discussions the Irish Government will have regarding the unique situation in the North, where the majority voted in favour of staying in the EU?  Does the Minister see it being a significant part of negotiations?  Does he see it as a positive?</p><p> We discussed migration at a number of our meetings.  The last time we discussed it here, I said the migration system was broken.  The Minister of State said it was experiencing difficulties.  I am paraphrasing.  The EU agreed a two-year plan, which was launched in September 2015.  We talked about, as an act of solidarity, allowing 150,000 refugees to travel from Greece and Italy to other EU states.  I see no impact from the plan, given that 1,000 people have left Italy and 3,493 have left Greece.  Austria, Hungary and Poland have yet to relocate anybody.  The Minister of State gave figures for relocation to Ireland.  Although we promised to take 4,000, the Minister of State said 69 people had arrived from Greece and 40 have been cleared for arrival.</p><p> Something is wrong in the system and we cannot seem to get answers.  Maybe we do not have the answers.  When one talks privately to people they say there is a difficulty and many people do not want to travel to Ireland or they do not know about Ireland.  A huge number of unaccompanied minors are there, and they are clearly in dangerous situation.  Is Ireland prioritising bringing them into the country?  There is something wrong.  The system is broken.  The complete lack of solidarity on the part of some member states with the front-line states suggests that even the minimum figure of 160,000 refugees will not happen.</p><p> The Minister of State referred to Turkey and the impact it would have.  However, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, not a single Syrian who has returned from Greece has been granted temporary protection status, despite the formal guarantees.  Turkey is supposed to allow UN agencies access to facilities where returning Syrians are temporarily sheltered.  Again, it has not happened.  While the Minister of State says we will push on with the Turkish agreement, this is another indication that the system is not working.  This is my major worry.</p><p> Other members have asked about the defence situation and I have concerns about it.  The Minister of State mentioned the positives of CETA and TTIP.  Would he not accept that there are also negatives?  While the Irish Government is pushing ahead with them, other governments are saying they have failed.  The German economics minister is saying talks have de facto failed.  The French Prime Minister has announced a clear halt.  Belgian and Austrian ministers have said the same.  Although we have had no debate about CETA, we are pushing ahead with this major agreement.  It is the wrong way to do things.  If the Government wants to win people over to its argument, it must engage and talk, and it must be open.</p><p> The note says the Government wants the investment court system chapter excluded for the moment.  Why is this?  It was renamed the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism.  Every single time I raised the issue, every Irish Government Minister spoke in glowing terms about it, yet we are talking about it being temporarily excluded.  I find it odd.  Why not permanently exclude it, if there is a cause for concern, which there clearly is across the world?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016100400002#Q00100"><p>Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his remarks.  Like other speakers, I have very serious concerns about the major issues that will affect us all into the future.  Like my colleague, I do not propose to go into the details of what must be done.  I am appalled that Europe should have arrived at this juncture, given all the aspirations we had over the years.  Gradually, slowly and inexorably, people in individual member states began to undermine public confidence in the European concept.  It was extraordinary that after the referendum in the UK, a certain Member of the European Parliament claimed it as a great victory, having spent 18 or 20 years of his life working assiduously towards undermining the European project and bringing it down.</p> <p>  The original vision was that smaller countries such as Ireland would play a bigger role in the European project and would have common ground with their colleagues, the larger countries, with a view towards moving in a particular direction.  Unfortunately, this has ceased.  It does not matter what our future plans are because unless we can visualise what Europe will be like in five or even two years' time, we are missing the target.  If we do not determine the structures of Europe and what it will be like in that period, and if it does not emerge, we will continue down the path we have travelled, much to the delight of the hard left and the hard right.  They have not ceased to function.  They are still there and they have an agenda to disrupt the European concept to the extent that it no longer will be workable.  This would be a tragedy.  What has happened so far is bad, but it could get worse.</p> <p>  I cannot put into words my concern and amazement at some of the things I have seen and heard in recent times.  I have heard a Commissioner comment on this country in what I would regard as a condescending way.  I also heard the head of a committee in the European Parliament make a prediction about an appeal in respect of the Apple situation to the effect that there was zero possibility of Ireland or Apple succeeding.  My question is whether this person feels he also has control of the courts or whether they have gone by the wayside.</p> <p>  We must be very clear about what is happening around us and that none of these developments are likely to be beneficial to a small country.  I fully agree with the remarks passed by my colleagues on all sides that this is a situation the like of which we have never seen before.  We have talked about it in terms of the possibility that it might happen.  The best thing that could happen is that sometime in the next 18 months or earlier, the UK would reconsider and recover the ground.  If the UK leaves, it undoubtedly will be the first step in a direction in which we should not go, for many reasons to which my colleagues have referred.  If Europe continues on this tangent, a two-speed Europe will emerge.  We have fought against this for many years.  A two-speed Europe would be a prelude to no Europe at all.</p> <p>  There was a reference to Germany.  Germany has not always been our enemy.  Germany has supported Ireland at crucial times when other countries of a similar size to ours did not, and were derogatory in their remarks.  The theory regarding migration is that the EU was heartless, did not take account of the needs of refugees and should be condemned.  That is not what happened.</p><p>Individual member states unilaterally took decisions that forbade any discussion on accommodating refugees to the extent that was required.  It would have been easier and more cohesive if the member states had showed what they wanted to do about the migration issue.  For example, one of the visions we will live with forever is the razor wire that greets refugees.  It was not the European Union that came up with that idea.  That idea was brought up by member states on their own.  If we allow the continuation of the discussion in that direction, Europe will be no more.  It is a fact and it is with great sorrow that I say it, especially as a member of this committee.</p><p> There is a need within the European Union, in all its branches and functions, to recognise that this is where we are going and we should not in any way jump for joy at this prospect, either in this or any other country in the European Union.  This relates to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and all the others as well.  It is about who benefits more when there are barriers to trade.  Bigger countries benefit more because they have more power, clout and access on a one-to-one basis with their bigger colleagues.  I disagree with the reluctance to enter into free trade areas.  That is our loophole.  If we close that gap, along with everything that is likely to happen, we will find ourselves isolated as a small country, with little or no influence at all.</p><p> I agree with the points raised by my colleagues on the peace process in Northern Ireland.  I listened attentively to the British Prime Minister's comments and I am not so hopeful about what is intended.  There is an indication of a continuation in a direction that will achieve an objective regardless of the consequences, and that objective is to leave the European Union.  That would be a major disaster for the European Union and Ireland, North and South.  It would be a disaster for Scotland and the UK.  I do not know how well this has been thought out.  It appears that those in favour of Brexit did not have any alternative when challenged on the issue, and they still have none.  That is where the problem exists.</p><p> Much water must flow under the bridge and the opportunity is very limited.  I hope against hope at this stage that there will be a realisation that Europe and its future is at stake.  If it disintegrates, the cost will be to all the people throughout Europe, including this country.  There will be a major cost that we cannot even dare to quantify now.  For what it is worth, I sincerely hope all the options can be carefully considered before the plug is eventually pulled and we go on a tangent that will lead to uncharted waters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-04a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016100400002#R00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for coming here to speak before the committee.  We wish him every success in future and look forward to working with him in the time ahead.  One advantage of speaking last is there is not much left to say, although perhaps that is not an advantage as such.</p> <p>  I will focus on the Brexit element and I have two or three queries.  Perhaps the Minister of State can deal with them or come back to us on them.  I agree totally with the previous speakers and there is no point in going over that ground.  Deputy Durkan made a point about the people advocating Brexit.  The problem, as Deputy Haughey stated, is that Europe is seen as removed from our lives with respect to policy and it does not seem to have much understanding sometimes.  It has an idea that one size fits all, which does not happen in all cases.  Sometimes that gives oxygen to the eurosceptics when they come out to support issues like Brexit.  We saw it happening in the recent campaign.  As Deputy Durkan mentioned, the leaders of that campaign were no longer around after 24 or 48 hours to say what would be the follow-up and where the country went from there.  They did not indicate how the issue was thought through and what happens.  The reality is it was not thought through because nobody expected the vote and outcome in the way it unfolded.  People are now scrambling and seeking solutions to provide a roadmap for what has not been predicted or considered.</p><p> One of Senator Leyden's proposals is very important, as it is necessary for Ireland to be aligned with the UK.  It has had success for years with trade, business and all sorts of other relationships across different sectors.  It is very important that Ireland has somebody at that table for the discussions to look after the future of the country and sustainability across all the areas we are concerned about.  If we are to take an issue from today's meeting, it should be this and we should pursue it to see if it is possible.  We must try to make it possible.</p><p> I serve the constituency of Kildare North and, like every other constituency, it has many exports to the UK.  It is suffering because of the currency changes.  It is a massive problem.  I know there are issues to deal with down the road but now there are many problems for the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector and people exporting to the UK because of the currency exchange rate.  These people are being put under much pressure financially and cannot go after their market to seek a top-up in the currency exchange.  That would rule them out of business.  We know the employment provided by the SME sector and the financial spin-off to the national economy.</p><p> I do not know what discussions have taken place on this or if it has been considered.  Is it too early a stage?  What are the thoughts of the Department or the Government on dealing with the issue?  I know the Minister of State is aware that it is major issue with business and particularly those exporting to the UK.  Many businesses export through the UK and I do not know if that has been considered.  Many alarm bells are now ringing in businesses as they wonder how they will manage as Brexit develops and predictions ring true in the timelines set out.  They are considering how that will affect them.</p><p> These are two major issues affecting businesses, the SME sector, exports, jobs and this economy.  We must see how they can be dealt with and I wonder what are the Minister of State's views.  Has there been any discussion on them?</p></speech>

I have a very significant amount of notes taken.  I hope to get to many, if not all, of the issues.  The consensus in the country is reflected in the consensus in the questioning.  I agree with the vast majority of the observations.  I will try to work through them as I got them, starting with Senator Leyden's point.</p> <p>  I concur with him very strongly that it is very regrettable that we have arrived at this position.  It is a decision of the United Kingdom affecting Ireland but it also affects the other 26 member states.  It has the potential to affect every part of our government and institutions, some much more than others.  The Taoiseach will chair the strategic committee on Brexit issues and we are putting significant additional resources into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, so the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will have additional people.  It will be the number one issue for him to deal with in the Department and I will deal with it as Minister of State with responsibility for Europe.  It will also be the number one issue for the Taoiseach.</p> <p>  To come to Deputy O'Rourke's point, other Departments, such as the Departments of Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will consider how we look at market diversification.  This is too big for any one Minister and it will command the attention of everybody from the Taoiseach, all members of the Cabinet, this committee and party groups, including Independents.</p><p>Given our presence in the European Parliament, with Fianna F&aacute;il a member of the ALDE group, Sinn F&eacute;in having four MEPs, the Labour Party a member of the Socialist group and Fine Gael in the European People's Party, we can collectively exert significant influence.</p><p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey asked how do we deliver our message to our friends and how well our unique circumstances are understood.  We will all have to work on these issues.  Trade and currency issues will affect all member states that export to the United Kingdom.  Many continental countries that face onto the east coast of the UK are strongly affected by Brexit.  I recently visited Denmark, for example, which, while not a member of the euro area, is a country with significant food exports, as are the Netherlands and the Nordic countries.  The key point for us is to emphasise the unique journey this island has travelled and the support we have been given on that journey.  We will work to support PEACE and INTERREG funding and the issue forms part of the current deliberations.</p><p> We must establish robustly, on the basis that we share a border with the UK on this island and the journey we have travelled, that Ireland has unique issues.  All member states have trade and institutional issues to deal with and we all share concerns about the vision for Europe and its future direction.  However, Ireland will be affected in a different way with respect to common travel, the journey the two communities in the North have made and the North-South and British-Irish bodies.  We will continue to make this case robustly.  There is a good appreciation that Ireland has specific challenges.  Once the negotiations start in March, it will be up to us to explicitly ensure these issues are addressed as part of the final agreement. </p><p> To respond to Deputy Haughey's question on neutrality, the current discussions do not present a threat to Irish neutrality.  Our position is specifically provided for in a protocol to the Lisbon treaty and this is very well understood, as members will be keen to learn. </p><p> Deputy Haughey also asked an interesting question on new partnerships.  Ireland has stated that we share a common view with the United Kingdom in many areas, including innovation, trade and being open and dynamic economies.  We strongly support the position that the European Union should continue to function as 27 member states.  However, there are areas where we will seek stronger co-operation such as, for example, digital innovation.  Smaller and peripheral member states require that greater attention is paid to digital single markets because we can benefit more from them than other countries.  </p><p> Reference was made to protectionism.  Some will argue that the position taken on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, is protectionist but it is important that Europe remains innovative.  To respond to Deputy Frank O'Rourke's point, Ireland must also seek new markets and partnerships.  There is an urgency among countries across the European Union, especially in Scandinavia and north-east Europe, about increasing trading partnerships. </p><p> I touched on Deputy Breathnach's question on PEACE and INTERREG moneys.  We are determined to ensure this funding continues because it has provided significant support to local communities.  It is vital to ensure it remains predictable and stable and there are no question marks hanging over it.  We are discussing this issue with the United Kingdom and the European Commission.  </p><p> Senator Neale Richmond asked a question on the aims of the other 26 member states.  Ireland is affected in every way by virtue of our involvement and engagement with Britain in many different areas.  For this reason, we are significantly ahead of most other member states in terms of the preparations undertaken in advance of Brexit.  Other member states are involved in a process similar to that under way in the UK in examining issues that will arise.</p><p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe and Senator Gerard P. Craughwell raised the issue of the future of the European Union.  Politicians across the Union, whether Members of the European Parliament or members of this committee, should try not to speak about it in the third person.  The rules issued by the European Commission are agreements that have been put in place at meetings of the Council and by governments and democratically elected politicians from the member states, including Members of the European Parliament who have reached agreements on certain issues.  When voicing criticism of some elements of the European Union, politicians in the member states cannot absolve themselves of their role in the decision-making process.  On a personal level, one of the most disappointing aspects of the debate in the United Kingdom was that much of the criticism levelled at the European Union was directed at laws and agreements to which UK Governments had agreed.  We must have a more honest debate and accept that the European Union was created by its member states. </p><p> To respond to Deputy Bernard J. Durkan's point, it is crucial that we remember the bigger issues and the reason the European Union came into being.  It is the outcome of a peace process started by member states and nations that were picking themselves up after the Second World War.  When one reflects on thousands of years of European history, as Europeans, we should not take peace on our continent for granted.  The European Union needs to focus on concrete measures such as ensuring social services work better and young people can secure employment.  We must address the fundamentals of politics.  </p><p> That brings me to the more contentious issue of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe made a point on the investor state element of the CETA and referred to a lack of debate.  This element of the agreement will become a national competence and come before the Oireachtas and a committee of the House for discussion, which is welcome.</p><p> Ireland is an island off an island.  One of the great successes of the European Union has been our ability to trade in a free market.  I know that people have concerns about the CETA and the TTIP, but they are, in their most basic form, extensions of the Single Market to North America through free trade agreements.  If we cannot agree common terms for trade and regulation between North America and Europe, we will be passed out by the rest of the world.  Collectively, our proportion of global GDP is shrinking.  It is important, especially for islands, that we reach an agreement.  I agree with Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe, however, that a more robust debate is needed and that we must convince people of the merits of both the CETA and the TTIP.  </p><p> Senator Paul Coghlan asked a very good question on the effect of Brexit on the EU budget.  This issue has yet to be determined.  We must decide whether to reduce the overall budget as a result of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, given that some costs will reduce by virtue of Brexit, or whether member states will be asked to increase their contribution to the budget.</p><p>These are some of the issues for debate at the start of the next round of the multi-annual financial framework discussions.  Of course this is an issue.  We are very mindful in that context of the great value to our country of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We, like other members states, are strong supporters of CAP.<br/><br/>I agree that migration remains a major challenge.  Our commitment on numbers stands.  It is not down to the Republic of Ireland that numbers are very low.  We have sent Irish people out to try to identify why it is the case that the numbers travelling to Ireland have been small.  A number of people will be coming soon.<br/><br/>In regard to the visit of Michel Barnier, he will meet the Taoiseach and other relevant Ministers next week but we do not have the exact date and time of his visit as of yet.<br/><br/>On the suggestion of having an Irish person on the Brexit negotiating team, our permanent representative, Declan Kelleher, the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, other Secretaries General, and everybody involved in the Department of the Taoiseach in particular, will keep us abreast of every comma and every sentence of these negotiations.  They are the most important negotiations that the country will undertake since the very difficult talks we had with respect to the peace process in Northern Ireland.  The fact that these decisions are being taken at European Council level is significant because the Taoiseach has been in office for more than five years and he knows many of the other prime ministers very well.  We are moving into a new chapter of Irish politics.  I know Deputies Sean Haughey, Miche&aacute;l Martin, Joan Burton and others were<b></b>in the European Parliament recently to meet their groups.  This will be an opportunity to work together to influence prime ministers who are part of our groups.  There was a very good suggestion from Senator Terry Leyden to bring politicians to Ireland to see the country.<br/><br/>Equally, there may be an opportunity for some members of this committee to travel with me to meet our Commissioner and MEPs because they belong to a good cross-section of party groups.  We could dedicate some time in either Strasbourg or Brussels to reach out and meet other colleagues similar to our plan to bring members from all parts of Ireland to show where we have unity.  There may be areas where we might disagree as a committee on the issue of our national concern in respect to Brexit, but we agree on the vast majority of matters we would like to see in the outcome.  I would welcome the opportunity to work with the Chairman to see how we might do that.  Perhaps we could get the political parties to look at engaging in the coming months with our MEPs as well.  I think I have covered most of the questions.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; ar dt&uacute;s go bhf&aacute;ilt&iacute;m go m&oacute;r roimh bhun&uacute; an bhuan-choiste seo agus an st&aacute;das a bhronnann s&eacute; ar chursa&iacute; Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus oile&aacute;n i gn&oacute;tha&iacute; an Oireachtais.  Gu&iacute;m gach rath ar an gcoiste ina chuid oibre.</p> <p>  T&aacute; mo r&aacute;iteas tosaigh curtha faoi bhr&aacute;id an chomhchoiste agam ina nd&eacute;anaim cur s&iacute;os ar r&oacute;l na hoifige, ar Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;) 2014, ar ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga agus ar an earca&iacute;ocht sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;.  Is &aacute;bhair iad seo go bhfuilim tar &eacute;is labhairt faoi roimhe seo le coist&iacute; agus comhchoist&iacute; de chuid an Oireachtais agus t&eacute;ann siad go dt&iacute; cro&iacute;-l&aacute;r na hoibre at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l ag m'oifig.  Ba mhaith liom mar sin d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar na pr&iacute;omhphoint&iacute; a nd&eacute;anaim tagairt d&oacute;ibh i mo r&aacute;iteas tosaigh.</p> <p>  N&iacute; sh&aacute;sa&iacute;onn na ceannteidil a fhoils&iacute;odh do Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;) 2014 i m&iacute; Aibre&aacute;n 2014 na hathruithe at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il san Acht reatha.  N&iacute; thugann na ceannteidil aird ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; &aacute; lorg agamsa agus n&iacute; thugann siad aird ar na molta&iacute; a th&aacute;inig chun cinn &oacute;n gcomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n poibl&iacute;.  Is deacair mar sin a r&aacute; c&eacute; a bheadh s&aacute;sta le na ceannteidil mar at&aacute; siad.  Rinne comhchoiste trasph&aacute;irt&iacute; Oireachtais 33 moladh ar na 13 ceannteideal agus is d&oacute;cha go n-ins&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin a sc&eacute;al f&eacute;in.  Go deimhin, bh&iacute; s&eacute; le r&aacute; ag an Aire St&aacute;it le deana&iacute;, agus an tAire St&aacute;it roimhe sin, nach bhfuil na ceannteidil mar at&aacute; siad s&aacute;s&uacute;il.</p> <p>  An cheist mar sin n&aacute; c&eacute;ard &iacute; an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im eile.

Mura nd&eacute;anfar &eacute; sin, is faill&iacute; a bh&eacute;as ann mar beidh muid ag lean&uacute;int orainn bliain i ndiaidh bliana ag tr&aacute;cht ar na fadhbanna cheannann c&eacute;anna.  N&iacute;l aon amhras orm faoi sin.</p> <p>  Creidim gurb &eacute; an r&oacute;l gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh ag an reachta&iacute;ocht n&aacute; &eacute;asc&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; a theasta&iacute;onn uainn a bhaint amach.  I gc&aacute;s Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; mar chusp&oacute;ir againn go mbeadh teacht n&iacute;os &eacute;asca ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; i nGaeilge agus go mbeadh caighde&aacute;n na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sin ar aon dul leis an tseirbh&iacute;s i mB&eacute;arla.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mh&oacute;r-leas&uacute; curtha i l&aacute;thair an choiste agam i mo r&aacute;iteas tosaigh, agus n&iacute; shin ag &aacute;ireamh leasuithe teicni&uacute;la a theasta&iacute;tear chomh maith d&aacute;r nd&oacute;igh. D&iacute;reoidh m&eacute; ar an d&aacute; leas&uacute; is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; mar a fheicimse iad.</p> <p>  Ar dt&uacute;s, t&aacute;im ag moladh go mbeadh ar chumas an St&aacute;it a chuid seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a shol&aacute;thar tr&iacute; Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; pr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga ar si&uacute;l sna ceantair Gaeltachta faoi l&aacute;thair agus measaim go bhfuil go leor d&uacute;shl&aacute;in roimh an bpr&oacute;iseas sin ina chuid iarrachta&iacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge a spreagadh agus a choth&uacute; sna limist&eacute;ir Gaeltachta.  T&aacute;imse den tuairim go gcaillfidh an pr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga a dhlisteanacht m&aacute; bh&iacute;onn teip ar an St&aacute;t a chuid seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a shol&aacute;thar tr&iacute; Ghaeilge sna limist&eacute;ir c&eacute;anna ina bhfuil i gceist iarrachta&iacute; ar leith a dh&eacute;anamh chun &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge a choinne&aacute;il chun cinn ag leibh&eacute;al an phobail.  Bheadh s&eacute; thar a bheith &iacute;or&oacute;nach d&aacute; dtarl&oacute;dh s&eacute; gurb &eacute; sol&aacute;thar na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht an l&uacute;b is laige sa slabhra phlean&aacute;il teanga.  Creidimse gur le c&uacute;l-taca na reachta&iacute;ochta is fearr a thabharfar aghaidh ar an &aacute;bhar seo agus gur f&eacute;idir &eacute; a thabhairt chun cinn ar bhealach praitici&uacute;il i bhfoirm rialach&aacute;in ag lean&uacute;int &oacute; bhun-chusp&oacute;ir&iacute; an Achta.</p> <p>  T&aacute;im ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; aird an chomhchoiste chomh maith ar ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga at&aacute; go maith i dteoiric, ach nach bhfuil ag feidhmi&uacute; mar is ceart le blianta fada anois.  I mo r&aacute;iteas tosaigh, l&eacute;ir&iacute;m go mb&iacute;onn sc&eacute;im teanga i bhfeidhm ar an me&aacute;n s&eacute; bliana sula n-aonta&iacute;tear sc&eacute;im nua.  Is &eacute; sin dh&aacute; oiread ama agus ba ch&oacute;ir.  Ach n&iacute;l ansin ach cuid den sc&eacute;al mar t&aacute; l&iacute;on suntasach comhlachta&iacute; n&aacute;r aonta&iacute;odh an dara sc&eacute;im teanga go f&oacute;ill leo.  I gc&aacute;s 19 de chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;, t&aacute; sa bhreis ar ch&uacute;ig bliana caite anois &oacute; th&aacute;inig deireadh le tr&eacute;imhse feidhme na ch&eacute;ad sc&eacute;ime agus gan an dara sc&eacute;im daingnithe.  T&aacute; s&eacute; seo uilig ag tarl&uacute; ag tr&aacute;th go bhfuil iarracht &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an Roinn dl&uacute;s a chur le haont&uacute; sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  Ag breathn&uacute; ar an l&iacute;on m&eacute;adaithe sc&eacute;imeanna at&aacute; aontaithe sa tr&eacute;imhse sin, th&oacute;gfadh s&eacute; s&eacute; bliana breith suas ar an riar&aacute;iste at&aacute; carnaithe, sin gan aon iarratas nua n&aacute; gan aon iarratas ar athnuachan a bheith d&eacute;anta sa tr&eacute;imhse sin.</p> <p>  Is l&eacute;ir mar sin go bhfuil na f&iacute;ric&iacute; lom.  Ach, mar is dual d&rsquo;fh&iacute;ric&iacute;, n&iacute; thugann siad l&eacute;argas ar chaighde&aacute;n ghealltanais na sc&eacute;imeanna.  Is &aacute;bhar m&oacute;r imn&iacute; &eacute; an m&eacute;id sin dom mar, in ainneoin roinnt sc&eacute;imeanna maithe, is beag a bh&iacute;onn i gcuid mhaith sc&eacute;imeanna teanga go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; a r&aacute; go nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n de dhifir &oacute; thaobh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; &uacute;s&aacute;ideacha a bheith ar f&aacute;il do lucht labhartha na Gaeilge.  Mar l&eacute;iri&uacute; ar na laig&iacute; a bhaineann le c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga, t&aacute; sampla tugtha agam i mo r&aacute;iteas tosaigh don dara sc&eacute;im teanga a aonta&iacute;odh le Comhairle Contae na hIarmh&iacute; i mbliana.  Sa sc&eacute;im sin d&eacute;anadh c&uacute;l&uacute; ar ghealltanas a bh&iacute; sa ch&eacute;ad sc&eacute;im teanga go mbeadh an t-&aacute;bhar statach ar an su&iacute;omh gr&eacute;as&aacute;in ar f&aacute;il go d&aacute;theangach.  Theip ar an gcomhairle contae an m&eacute;id sin a bhaint amach agus i ndiaidh pr&oacute;iseas faireach&aacute;in agus imscr&uacute;daithe de chuid m'oifige, leagadh tuarasc&aacute;il faoi bhr&aacute;id Thithe an Oireachtais ar an &aacute;bhar.  Is gn&iacute;omh &eacute; sin at&aacute; tromch&uacute;iseach agus neamhghn&aacute;ch.  Sa dara sc&eacute;im teanga, leasa&iacute;odh agus laga&iacute;odh an gealltanas sin go suntasach.  Ghoill s&eacute; orm mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga gurb &eacute; an freagra a bh&iacute; ar neamhchomhl&iacute;onadh gealltanas n&aacute; an riachtanas sin a laghd&uacute; ag an gc&eacute;ad dheis eile.</p> <p>  Le bheith neamhbhalbh faoi seo, caithfear c&oacute;ras nua a thabhairt isteach in &aacute;it ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  An moladh at&aacute; agamsa n&aacute; go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; rang&uacute; ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; de r&eacute;ir a dt&aacute;bhacht agus a gcumars&aacute;id leis an bpobal, agus tr&iacute; ch&oacute;ras rialach&aacute;in go leagfa&iacute; amach go soil&eacute;ir na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute;, go h&aacute;irithe na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sin nach bhfuil ag brath ar acmhainn&iacute; daonna, a chuirfear ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.  Na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhaineadh le sin n&aacute; nach mbeadh aon phr&oacute;iseas idirbhearta&iacute;ochta ar si&uacute;l mar at&aacute; i gceist le c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga, nach mbeadh aon ch&uacute;l&uacute; ar ghealltanais &oacute; sc&eacute;im go sc&eacute;im, go mbeadh sruthl&iacute;ni&uacute; d&eacute;anta ar an bpr&oacute;iseas riarach&aacute;in agus, an rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute;, b'fh&eacute;idir, go mbeadh s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir don phobal c&eacute;ard gur f&eacute;idir leo s&uacute;il le &oacute; gach earn&aacute;il.  N&iacute;l aon amhras orm ach gur athr&uacute; suntasach &eacute; seo, ach leis an bplean&aacute;il cheart creidim gur f&eacute;idir &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh agus, n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; sin, go dteasta&iacute;onn &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.</p> <p>  Gan d&oacute;than daoine le Gaeilge a bheith fostaithe sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;, n&iacute; bheidh m&oacute;r&aacute;n rath le brath ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; a bheith ar f&aacute;il go s&aacute;s&uacute;il i nGaeilge.  Chuige seo caithfear aghaidh a thabhairt ar cheist na hearca&iacute;ochta.  T&aacute; cuid mhaith eolais curtha ar f&aacute;il roimhe seo a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn gur l&iacute;on an-&iacute;seal poist at&aacute; le haithint a bhfuil riachtanas Gaeilge luaite leo.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil drogall ar eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it ceangal a chur orthu f&eacute;in, mar a fheiceann siadsan &eacute;, go mbeadh riachtanas Gaeilge luaite le l&iacute;on &aacute;irithe poist.</p><p>F&aacute;gann sin go bhfuil pain&eacute;il d&rsquo;iarrth&oacute;ir&iacute; le Gaeilge &aacute; gcruth&uacute; agus gur beag post at&aacute; aitheanta d&oacute;ibh.  Bh&iacute; m&iacute;-thuiscint n&oacute; m&iacute;-bhr&iacute; ann &oacute;n t&uacute;s go gcaitheadh Gaeilge a bheith ag 6% d'earcaigh nua a bheadh ag teacht isteach sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s de thoradh cinneadh Rialtais sa bhliain 2013.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, n&iacute; h&eacute; sin at&aacute; i gceist.  Is &eacute;ard a bh&iacute; sa gcinneadh sin n&aacute; go gcruth&oacute;fa&iacute; pain&eacute;il de dhaoine le Gaeilge a bheadh cothrom le 6% den phain&eacute;al ginear&aacute;lta.  Ach, mura bhfuil poist le riachtanas Gaeilge &aacute; sainaithint, f&aacute;gtar nach bhfuil daoine le Gaeilge ag teacht &oacute; na pain&eacute;il sin ag gach leibh&eacute;al sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.  Mar at&aacute; l&eacute;irithe ag freagra&iacute; ar cheisteanna D&aacute;la, is oiread na fr&iacute;de den ch&eacute;atad&aacute;n d'earcaigh nua at&aacute; ag teacht &oacute; na pain&eacute;il Gaeilge. </p><p> Go deimhin, t&aacute; s&eacute; tugtha faoi deara agam go bhfuil c&uacute;l&uacute; ar si&uacute;l san &aacute;it go mb&iacute;odh riachtanas Gaeilge luaite le poist roimhe seo.  T&aacute; m'oifig faoi l&aacute;thair ag scr&uacute;d&uacute; an tsonra&iacute;ocht at&aacute; leagtha s&iacute;os ag an Roinn Tith&iacute;ochta, Plean&aacute;la, Pobail agus Rialtais &Aacute;iti&uacute;il do phoist sa tseirbh&iacute;s leabharlainne poibl&iacute;.  De r&eacute;ir an eolais at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn go dt&iacute; seo, t&aacute;thar tar &eacute;is deireadh a chur leis an riachtanas Gaeilge a bh&iacute;odh ann roimhe seo toisc moladh &oacute; ghr&uacute;pa oibre a buna&iacute;odh sa bhliain 2015.  Ba &eacute; dearcadh an ghr&uacute;pa oibre sin n&aacute; gur chruthaigh an riachtanas seo bac iontr&aacute;la neamhriachtanach d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d gan Gaeilge labhartha n&oacute; d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d nach raibh an deis acu an teanga a fhoghlaim.</p><p> T&aacute;thar anois ag tabhairt feidhme do na socraithe seo le sonra&iacute;ocht poist nua de chuid na Roinne.  N&iacute;l aon riachtanas Gaeilge luaite leis an tsonra&iacute;ocht at&aacute; feicthe againn i gc&aacute;s leabharlanna&iacute; cathrach agus contae, leas-leabharlanna&iacute; cathrach, leabharlanna&iacute; chathair Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, leabharlanna&iacute; feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in, leabharlanna&iacute; roinne n&aacute; leabharlanna&iacute; c&uacute;nta. N&iacute; heol dom ach an oiread go bhfuil aon socraithe faoi leith i gceist do cheapach&aacute;in i leabharlanna Gaeltachta. T&aacute; an cheist shonrach sin ardaithe agam leis an Roinn agus t&aacute;imid ag fanacht ar fhreagra. </p><p>T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite i Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge go "sonr&oacute;idh sc&eacute;imeanna teanga amach anseo na poist laistigh d&rsquo;eagra&iacute;ocht a mbeidh cumas sa Ghaeilge riachtanach d&oacute;ibh". N&iacute; chreidimse go bhfuiltear ag tabhairt faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; earca&iacute;ochta le haon d&aacute;ir&iacute;reacht agus gur sop in &aacute;it na scuaibe at&aacute; i gceist d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d le Gaeilge at&aacute; ag iarraidh a bheith ag obair sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;.</p><p> T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och as an gcuireadh teacht i l&aacute;thair an choiste inniu agus f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh aon cheist at&aacute; ag na baill. </p></speech>

Bh&iacute; an coimisin&eacute;ir agus an coimisin&eacute;ir a th&aacute;inig roimhe thar barr ar fad ag cur c&aacute;s na Gaeilge i l&aacute;thair.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil comhchoiste buan againn anseo at&aacute; in ann d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar na ceisteanna seo go sonrach.  Arda&iacute;onn an coimisin&eacute;ir cuid de na bun-cheisteanna at&aacute; ann &oacute; thaobh chur chun cinn na Gaeilge de sa t&iacute;r seo.</p> <p>  T&aacute; roinnt ceisteanna gur mhaith liom a chur.  Luaigh an coimisin&eacute;ir rud maidir le Eircode sa tuairisc a thug s&eacute; don choiste agus an deacracht a bh&iacute; ann le sin.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhf&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; beag&aacute;in&iacute;n eile a r&aacute; faoi sin agus a mh&iacute;ni&uacute; d&uacute;inn c&eacute;n chaoi gur f&eacute;idir c&aacute;sanna den chine&aacute;l sin a sheachaint amach anseo, ina thuairim.  Aonta&iacute;m go huile is go hioml&aacute;n leis maidir le Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la go bhfuil g&eacute;ar-gh&aacute; ag an bpointe seo le Acht na dteangacha nua nach gcuireann bac n&aacute; srian ar ruda&iacute; ach a bhreathna&iacute;onn ar bhealach leis an nGaeilge a chosaint.

D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, an &eacute; at&aacute; &aacute; r&aacute; ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir n&aacute; go bhfuil Roinn na Gaeltachta f&eacute;in ag cead&uacute; do eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; pobail agus St&aacute;it c&uacute;l&uacute; ar na sc&eacute;imeanna nuair at&aacute; siad ag dr&eacute;acht&uacute; an dara sraith de sc&eacute;imeanna?  An p&aacute;tr&uacute;n &eacute; sin at&aacute; le feice&aacute;il i sc&eacute;imeanna eile?  M&aacute;s ea, is ceist uaf&aacute;sach tromch&uacute;iseach &eacute; sin do Roinn na Gaeltachta, an tAire agus na feidhmeannaigh at&aacute; ag pl&eacute;igh le daingni&uacute; sc&eacute;imeanna.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go bhfuil na riar&aacute;ist&iacute; agus eile ann, ach m&aacute; t&aacute;thar ag tabhairt cead do dhaoine c&uacute;l&uacute; &oacute;n dualgas at&aacute; orthu, is ceist uaf&aacute;sach tromch&uacute;iseach &eacute; sin.  S&iacute;lim gur &aacute;bhar &eacute; gur cheart d&uacute;inn feidhmeannaigh na Roinne agus an tAire a cheisti&uacute; go dian faoi.</p> <p>  Go dt&iacute; seo bh&iacute;omar ag bualadh leis an gcoimisin&eacute;ir b'fh&eacute;idir uair n&oacute; dh&oacute; sa bhliain.  Ach i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, os rud &eacute; go bhfuil an r&oacute;l againne ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ina ioml&aacute;n ar cheisteanna mar seo, b'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil g&aacute; go mbeadh tuilleadh eolais againn &oacute;n gcoimisin&eacute;ir maidir le c&eacute;ard a chuireadh muid in &aacute;it na sc&eacute;imeanna.  C&eacute;n chaoi a n-oibreodh na rialach&aacute;in?  C&eacute;ard a bheadh i gceist leo?  Tuigim go bhfuil an c&oacute;ras rialach&aacute;in bunaithe ar mh&uacute;nla na Breataine Bige.  C&eacute;n chaoi a bhfeidhmeodh s&eacute; d&aacute; mbeadh muid ag cumadh Achta nua?

T&aacute; s&eacute; aitheanta mar cheann de na comhairl&iacute; contae is fearr &oacute; thaobh Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la de.  Chuir m&eacute; glaoch air ag lorg eolais maidir le rud &aacute;irithe a bhain le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la.  Fiafra&iacute;odh dom an raibh m&eacute; ag iarraidh seirbh&iacute;s tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla n&oacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  D&uacute;irt m&eacute; go dtriallfainn uimhir a 2 go bhfeicfinn c&eacute;n chaoi a n-&eacute;ireodh liom.  Cuireadh tr&iacute;d m&eacute; go dt&iacute; an oifigeach a bh&iacute;onn ag pl&eacute;igh le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus ansin chuala m&eacute;, "T&aacute; t&uacute; tr&iacute;d go dt&iacute; an tseirbh&iacute;s.  F&aacute;g teachtaireacht m&aacute; t&aacute; t&uacute; ag iarraidh an cheist a bheith freagartha".  N&iacute;or fh&aacute;g m&eacute; teachtaireacht mar t&aacute; s&eacute; tarlaithe dom chomh mhinic cheana go bhfuil a fhios agam go dt&oacute;gann s&eacute; l&aacute; n&oacute; dh&oacute; n&oacute; tr&iacute; cinn sula bhfaighim freagra.  Ghlaoigh m&eacute; ar an tseirbh&iacute;s B&eacute;arla agus fuair m&eacute; an duine a bh&iacute; ag teast&aacute;il uaim ar an bpointe sin.  Bh&iacute; bar&uacute;il agam go dtarl&oacute;dh s&eacute; sin.  C&eacute; chomh fhorleathan is at&aacute; s&eacute; sin?  Dar liomsa, is &eacute; sin ceann de na comhairl&iacute; contae is fearr at&aacute; ag deile&aacute;il leis an Acht.  Ar a laghad ar bith, faigheann t&uacute; tr&iacute;d go dt&iacute; seirbh&iacute;s freagartha.</p></speech>

N&iacute;l aon sc&eacute;im teanga ag r&aacute; go bhfuil duine i dteideal teiripeoir cainte i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath m&aacute; t&aacute; duine ag lord teiripeoir cainte le Gaeilge.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin luaite i sc&eacute;im teanga mar n&iacute;l a leith&eacute;id de sc&eacute;im teanga ann.  M&aacute; t&aacute; laghas fisiteiripe uait n&oacute; aon rud mar sin, n&iacute;l aon sc&eacute;im teanga ann a dhaingn&iacute;onn an ceart sin do dhaoine.<br/><br/>Chuir an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh ceist ag lorg breis eolais faoin &aacute;bhar sin.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom teacht trasna ar obair an choiste.  Is iad Baill na Tithe at&aacute; tofa chun reachta&iacute;ocht a dhr&eacute;acht&uacute; agus a aont&uacute;.  Creidim go l&aacute;idir sa reachta&iacute;ocht.  Is sc&aacute;th&aacute;n den phobal at&aacute; sa reachta&iacute;ocht agus is f&eacute;idir leis r&oacute;l ceannaireachta a ghlacadh &oacute; thaobh na socha&iacute; sa t&iacute;r seo le l&eacute;iri&uacute; c&eacute;n &aacute;it a dteasta&iacute;onn uainn dul.</p><p>Is jab do bhaill an choiste &eacute; an reachta&iacute;ocht sin.  &Oacute; thaobh bhreis eolais a fh&aacute;il mar a lorg an Seanad&oacute;ir, t&aacute; feidhmeanna faoin Acht tr&iacute;na bhronnadh cumhachta&iacute; orm chun tr&aacute;chtas a dh&eacute;anamh ar fheidhmeanna an Achta.  Sa chomhth&eacute;acs a luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir de ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga, bheinn toilteanach cinnte tabhairt faoin gcuireadh sin agus breis eolais a thabhairt don choiste ar an gc&oacute;ras sin.</p><p> Bh&iacute; ceist ansin faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; earca&iacute;ochta.  Luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh c&aacute;s chomhairle contae n&oacute; cathrach &aacute;iti&uacute;il agus an lasc ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; earca&iacute;ochta ansin.  T&aacute; fadhb ann, mar a fheictear domsa &eacute;.  Is f&eacute;idir f&eacute;achaint ar shampla&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il go hidirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta. I gCeanada, mar shampla, t&aacute; rud ar a dtugtar an tairiscint r&eacute;amh-ghn&iacute;omhach.  Go bun&uacute;sach, an rud at&aacute; i gceist le sin n&aacute; m&aacute; shi&uacute;lann duine isteach in oifig St&aacute;it ar n&oacute;s chomhairle contae n&oacute; Roinn Rialtais n&oacute; &aacute;it mar sin, tugann an ch&eacute;ad duine a chastar leis an duine ag an deasc fh&aacute;ilte n&oacute; &aacute;it mar sin an rogha don duine a chuid gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i dteangacha oifigi&uacute;la na t&iacute;re sin.  I gc&aacute;s Cheanada, is &eacute; sin B&eacute;arla agus Fraincis.  Ba cheart go mbeadh a leith&eacute;id ann anseo.  Ba cheart go gceapadh daoine le Gaeilge go bhfuil f&aacute;ilte rompu in oifig&iacute; St&aacute;it, nach gceapadh said go bhfuil siad ag cur br&uacute; ar dhaoine, nach gceapadh siad go bhfuil siad ag cur moill ar na daoine taobh thiar d&oacute;ibh, nach n&aacute;r&oacute;fa&iacute; iad nuair nach bhfuil an tseirbh&iacute;s ar f&aacute;il agus nach mbeadh orthu fanacht 20 n&oacute;im&eacute;ad, 30 n&oacute;im&eacute;ad n&oacute; uair an chloig go dt&iacute; go bhfaigheadh siad duine le Gaeilge le freastal orthu chun seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a fh&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Is bealach amh&aacute;in &eacute; sin go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; a thabhairt faoi.  Tagann s&eacute; s&iacute;os go c&uacute;rsa&iacute; earca&iacute;ochta agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine le Gaeilge a chur ag obair i Ranna Rialtais, i rialtais &aacute;iti&uacute;la agus in eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it n&aacute; mar at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair.</p><p> Maidir le na leabharlanna poibl&iacute;, mar a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir, t&aacute; s&eacute; leagtha amach agam i mo r&aacute;iteas tosaigh agus i mo chuid cainte.  Is bocht an sc&eacute;al &eacute;, seachas a bheith ag caint faoi forbairt a dh&eacute;anamh, go bhfuileamar ag caint faoin gc&uacute;l&uacute; at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l sna leabharlanna poibl&iacute;.  Mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, is f&eacute;idir liomsa an t-eolas sin a roinnt leis an gcoiste.  Tagann s&eacute; ar ais go dt&iacute; laig&iacute; san Acht f&eacute;in.  An rud suntasach faoi n&aacute; nach bhfuil aon dl&iacute; &aacute; sh&aacute;r&uacute; anseo.  N&iacute;l aon dualgas leagtha s&iacute;os go soil&eacute;ir i reachta&iacute;ocht na t&iacute;re go mbeadh a leith&eacute;id ann agus is &eacute; sin an &aacute;it ina bhfuil an chonstaic sa gc&aacute;s sin.</p><p> Bh&iacute; an cheist deireanach &oacute;n dTeachta &Oacute; Mu&iacute;neach&aacute;in ag baint leis an Acht reatha agus c&eacute;n chaoi a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; oibri&uacute; leis an Acht at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair.  &Aacute;it amh&aacute;in go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; aghaidh a thabhairt ar sin n&aacute; i sceideal an Achta.  Is &eacute; sin an &aacute;it a leagtar amach na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; ar fad a thagann faoi sc&aacute;th an Achta.  Creid n&oacute; n&aacute; creid, n&iacute;or dh&eacute;anadh aon uasd&aacute;t&uacute; ar an sceideal sin &oacute; 2006.  Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin go ginear&aacute;lta nach dtagann aon chomhlacht poibl&iacute; a buna&iacute;odh &oacute; 2006 faoi sc&aacute;th an Achta agus nach mb&iacute;onn deis againne feidhmi&uacute; d&aacute; r&eacute;ir.  Faigheann muid comhoibri&uacute; &oacute; chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; nach dtagann faoin Acht go rialta, ach chuideodh s&eacute; cinnte d&aacute; mbeadh uasd&aacute;t&uacute; d&eacute;anta ar an sceideal sin sa ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os.  &Oacute; thaobh an Achta f&eacute;in, teasta&iacute;onn athruithe strucht&uacute;rtha uaidh a th&eacute;ann i ngleic go sonrach le c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga, a dh&eacute;anann rang&uacute; ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;, a leagann na dualgais is troime orthu si&uacute;d a bhfuil teangmh&aacute;il acu leis an bpobal agus a dh&eacute;anann feidhmi&uacute; d&aacute; r&eacute;ir ina dhiaidh sin.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an Ghaolainn mar a bh&iacute; s&eacute; riamh nuair a bh&iacute; an coimisin&eacute;ir ag obair mar iriseoir anseo agus ag cur br&uacute; orainn go l&eacute;ir.  Is &eacute; seo an t-am anois chun dul ar ais ar sin.  N&iacute;lim ach ag magadh.  Aonta&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir faoi na leabharlanna.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh Gaolainn ansin agus go mbeadh an duine at&aacute; ann in ann rogha a thabhairt do dhuine maidir le eolas, na leabhair at&aacute; le f&aacute;il n&oacute; aon rud &oacute; thaobh cult&uacute;ir agus teanga de.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; ann.  Mar pholaiteoir maith, t&aacute; an cheist curtha agam chuig an Aire cheana f&eacute;in inniu.  D&iacute;reach nuair a bh&iacute; an coimisin&eacute;ir ag caint bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag typ&aacute;il anseo.  Caithfidh go mbeadh toradh maith ar an &aacute;bhar sin.</p> <p>  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla rud beag le r&aacute; agam.  Molaim go bhfuil scoileanna nua &aacute; th&oacute;g&aacute;il ar fud na t&iacute;re ach an rud gur mhaith liom a fheice&aacute;il n&aacute; go mbeadh ainmneacha na scoileanna d&aacute;theangach.  T&aacute; mise ag f&eacute;achaint ar scoileanna agus n&iacute;l ach B&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in orthu.  Measaim gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh na hainmneacha as Gaolainn agus as B&eacute;arla ar an bhfoirgneamh f&eacute;in.  Is rud &eacute; sin a mholaim gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh ann.  Nuair a th&eacute;im go Banc na h&Eacute;ireann, t&aacute; rogha agam Gaolainn n&oacute; B&eacute;arla a &uacute;s&aacute;id ar an meais&iacute;n at&aacute; acu.  Measaim go bhfuil cuid de na comhlachta&iacute; ag d&eacute;anamh jab an-mhaith.  N&iacute; fheadar an nd&eacute;anann an coimisin&eacute;ir aon scr&uacute;d&uacute; orthu si&uacute;d.  T&aacute; cuid de na comhlachta&iacute; pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha ag d&eacute;anamh a nd&iacute;cheall, i mo thuairim, an Ghaolainn a chur chun cinn.  Molaim go m&oacute;r na comhlachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh sin.  Nuair a fheiceann duine c&aacute;sanna de chomhlachta&iacute; St&aacute;it, mar shampla Irish Water n&oacute; Uisce &Eacute;ireann, t&aacute; &aacute; r&aacute; ag an gcomhlacht gur f&eacute;idir Gaeilge a labhairt ansin agus is rud maith &eacute; sin.  Caithfimid an moladh sin a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh.</p> <p>  B'fh&eacute;idir nach &eacute; seo an post at&aacute; ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, ach t&aacute; an dl&iacute; agus an spiorad ann.  Chun spiorad na Gaolainne a chur chun cinn, an bhfuil aon sl&iacute; gur f&eacute;idir leis a bheith p&aacute;irteach i bhfiosr&uacute; conas gur f&eacute;idir linn n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaolainne a &uacute;s&aacute;id i ngn&aacute;thshaol na t&iacute;re?

An f&eacute;idir f&eacute;achaint ar ruda&iacute; mar sin?  M&aacute; t&aacute; an t-ainm as Gaolainn os comhair siopa at&aacute; ag duine, is rud an-mhaith &eacute; sin i mo thuairim.

Ba ch&oacute;ir &eacute; sin a admh&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.  Sorry, n&iacute;l mo chuid Gaolainne r&oacute;-mhaith.  An bhfuil aon tuairim ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir ar an m&eacute;id sin?

T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil siad ag d&eacute;anamh a seacht n-iarracht an dl&iacute; a chur i bhfeidhm thart timpeall na t&iacute;re.  T&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im san earn&aacute;il seo.  Ceapaim f&eacute;in nach dtuigeann daoine c&eacute; chomh dona is at&aacute; ruda&iacute; don Ghaeilge sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.  Aonta&iacute;m go huile agus go hioml&aacute;n leis an Teachta O'Dowd ar an earn&aacute;il pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach, ach t&aacute;imid na m&iacute;lte m&iacute;le i bhfad &oacute; sin.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn an St&aacute;t &eacute; f&eacute;in a shocr&uacute; i gceart maidir leis an nGaeilge, gan tr&aacute;cht ar an earn&aacute;il pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; chomh dona san earn&aacute;il seo gur sheas an t-iar-chomisin&eacute;ir s&iacute;os.  T&aacute; mise anseo le s&eacute; bliana anuas agus i mo thuairimse n&iacute;l aon rud athraithe i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re i ndearcadh an rialtais ar an rud seo.</p> <p>  Bh&iacute;omar ag pl&eacute;igh Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge c&uacute;pla l&aacute; &oacute; shin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar chusp&oacute;ir don strait&eacute;is sin go mbeadh 250,000 duine ag labhairt Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il sa t&iacute;r seo taobh amuigh den ch&oacute;ras oideachais i 2030.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid chun an cusp&oacute;ir sin a bhaint amach, cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin gur cheart go mbeadh 125,000 duine ag labhairt Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il faoi l&aacute;thair chun an trend sin a chomhl&iacute;onadh.  Ach t&aacute;imid f&oacute;s 50,000 taobh amuigh den chusp&oacute;ir sin a bhaint amach ag an n&oacute;im&eacute;ad seo.  T&aacute; beag&aacute;in&iacute;n dul chun cinn tagtha ar na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; de r&eacute;ir an daon&aacute;irimh.  T&aacute;imid ag fanacht ar an daon&aacute;ireamh is d&eacute;ana&iacute; freisin maidir le sin.  I mo thuairimse f&eacute;in, caithfidh an Rialtas a bheith i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin rud seo.</p> <p>  Labhair an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh faoin St&aacute;t agus an teip at&aacute; air.</p><p>Fi&uacute; seachtain &oacute; shin, chuir m&eacute; glaoch ar an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna.  Roghnaigh m&eacute; uimhir a 2 freisin, le haghaidh iarracht a bhaint amach as.  N&iacute; raibh &eacute;inne ar f&aacute;il ar an uimhir sin.  B'fh&eacute;idir go raibh fear br&eacute;ige ann, ach i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re n&iacute; raibh duine ar bith ann.  Gach l&aacute; nuair a iarrann duine Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id leis an St&aacute;tc&oacute;ras deir an St&aacute;tc&oacute;ras, "Imigh leat."  N&iacute; d&eacute;anann an c&oacute;ras faic don duine sin.  N&iacute;l ann ach faux-facade.  N&iacute;l aon rud taobh thiar den facade sin chun an tseirbh&iacute;s a comhl&iacute;onadh.  Sin an f&aacute;th nach bhfuil daoine at&aacute; ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il a clainne le Gaeilge ag dul ar ais chuige.</p><p> T&aacute; figi&uacute;r uaf&aacute;sach suimi&uacute;il ann.  An tsl&iacute; is fearr don Ghaeilge a thabhairt don ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile n&aacute; an ghl&uacute;in sin a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge.  Idir an Tuaisceart agus an Deisceart, t&aacute; buis&eacute;ad &euro;20,000 ann chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Is &eacute; &euro;20,000 an m&eacute;id at&aacute; againn chun clanna taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht thar timpeall na Tr&iacute;ocha D&oacute; Contae a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge.  Is seaf&oacute;id &eacute; a bheith ag caint faoi comhartha&iacute; ar taobh veain ar mh&oacute;tarbhealach muna bhfuilimid s&aacute;sta labhairt Gaeilge le p&aacute;ist&iacute;.</p><p> An fhadhb at&aacute; ann n&aacute; go nd&eacute;anann an chuid is m&oacute; de St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh neamh-aird ar Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an OPW ag briseadh a chuid dualgas reacht&uacute;il agus go mb&iacute;onn Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga i dteagmh&aacute;il leis an OPW faoi sin.  R&eacute;it&iacute;onn an OPW an fhadhb ach an ch&eacute;ad uair eile a chuirtear comhartha b&oacute;thair n&oacute; rud &eacute;igin eile suas d&eacute;antar an rud c&eacute;anna ar&iacute;s.  Is cur am&uacute; ama don choimisin&eacute;ir &eacute; agus is cur am&uacute; airgid &eacute; d&aacute; hoifig go bhfuil s&eacute; sin ag tarl&uacute;.  Caithfidh p&iacute;on&oacute;s n&oacute; costas &eacute;igin a bheith ann don St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s nuair nach gcomhl&iacute;ontar an dl&iacute;.</p><p> An bhfuil foireann ioml&aacute;n ag Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga f&oacute;s?

Aonta&iacute;m go huile is go hioml&aacute;n maidir leis an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;radh faoin mBreatain Bheag agus an caighde&aacute;n.  Sin an tsl&iacute; is &eacute;asca &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  </p><p> Cad iad tuairim&iacute; an choimisin&eacute;ara faoi saghas action plan for the Irish language?  Bh&iacute; Action Plan for Jobs ag an Aire, an Teachta Richard Bruton, sa D&aacute;il dheireanach.  Bh&iacute; an Taoiseach mar chathaoirleach ar an tionscnamh idir-rannach sin.  Gach ceathr&uacute; den bhliain bh&iacute; orthu gn&iacute;omhartha a ainmni&uacute; don St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras agus ansan slat tomhais a chur ar na gn&iacute;omhartha sin.  Diaidh ar ndiaidh, d'&eacute;irigh leis.  Chaith mise anuas air ag an am ach d'&eacute;irigh leis c&uacute;pla rud t&aacute;bhachtach a bhaint amach.  D&aacute; mbeadh an Rialtas ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an earn&aacute;il seo sa tsl&iacute; chuimsitheach sin, b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeimid in ann na fadhbanna at&aacute; ann a r&eacute;iteach. </p><p> Conas a shocra&iacute;onn rann&oacute;g St&aacute;it go bhfuil Gaeilge riachtanach le haghaidh post?  Cad iad na slite ina nd&eacute;antar sin?  Aonta&iacute;m go bhfuil s&eacute; n&iacute;os fearr a bheith r&eacute;amhghn&iacute;omhach.

N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil an t-airgead n&oacute; an taca&iacute;ocht aige agus is cinnte nach bhfuil na Ranna St&aacute;it ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ocht d&oacute; le go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; mar is c&oacute;ir an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id i bhfad n&iacute;os minic&iacute; agus &uacute;s&aacute;id i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr a bhaint aisti.</p> <p>  Dar liomsa, an bunrud at&aacute; daoine as an nGaeltacht ag iarraidh n&aacute; jabanna.

Tuigeann muid an tinneas at&aacute; air nach f&eacute;idir leis an post at&aacute; aige agus rud at&aacute; s&eacute; ag iarraidh a dh&eacute;anamh a dh&eacute;anamh mar n&iacute;l s&eacute; ag f&aacute;il an taca&iacute;ocht.  N&iacute;l ann ach box-ticking.  Is m&oacute;r an n&aacute;ire &eacute; don St&aacute;t agus d&uacute;inn uilig &eacute; sin.

T&aacute; muid ag iarraidh go mbeadh seans againn dul amach ag obair agus go mbeadh clann ag daoine agus go mbeadh teach ag daoine agus go mbeid&iacute;s in ann fanacht san &aacute;it gur rugadh agus t&oacute;gadh iad.  N&iacute;l siad in ann &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; muid ligthe s&iacute;os go l&aacute;idir ag an St&aacute;t le blianta fada anuas ach b'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil seans againne athr&uacute; beag a dh&eacute;anamh air sin.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh caint an Teachta faoi cheist na leabharlannaithe.  T&aacute;im ag faire ar an toradh a bheas air sin.  Mar a luaigh m&eacute;, t&aacute; ceist ann &oacute; thaobh na leabharlannaithe agus an bhfuil an dualgas ann &oacute; thaobh na Gaeltachta fi&uacute;.  Luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh an pr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga.  Bheadh s&eacute; thar a bheith aisteach d&aacute; mbeadh daoine ag cur plean teanga le ch&eacute;ile do na pobail Ghaeltachta agus ag an am c&eacute;anna go mbeadh seans ann go si&uacute;l&oacute;id&iacute;s isteach i leabharlann agus nach mbeadh aon dualgas go mbeadh duine le Gaeilge taobh thiar den deasc.

N&iacute; thagann siad faoi mo dhl&iacute;nse faoi l&aacute;thair ach is f&eacute;idir le comhlachta&iacute; pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha r&oacute;l ceannaireachta a ghlacadh.  T&aacute; sampla&iacute; feicthe agam.  Go minic, feiceann muid gur f&eacute;idir leo r&oacute;l n&iacute;os feice&aacute;la&iacute; agus n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre a ghlacadh n&aacute; comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;.  Is bocht an sc&eacute;al &eacute; ar bhealach nach bhfuil na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; ag seasamh ar chomhleibh&eacute;al leo sa gc&aacute;s sin.  Mar shampla, is f&eacute;idir Google Gmail a dh&eacute;anamh as Gaeilge.  T&aacute; comhartha&iacute; leictreonacha i nGaeilge anois i McDonald's.  Agus duine ag f&aacute;il chips agus burger, t&aacute; na comhartha&iacute; leictreonacha i nGaeilge.  Tugann s&eacute; sin teachtaireacht do dhaoine go bhfuil an Ghaeilge feice&aacute;lach.  Tuigeann daoine at&aacute; ag labhairt na Gaeilge sa mbaile go bhfuil f&aacute;ilte rompu in &aacute;it a bhfuil an Ghaeilge feice&aacute;lach.  Ar a mhalairt ansin, nuair nach bhfuil s&eacute; feice&aacute;lach, is as sin go n-eascra&iacute;onn na fadhbanna.</p> <p>  Tagann s&eacute; sin don cheist faoi spiorad na reachta&iacute;ochta seachas an reachta&iacute;ocht f&eacute;in.

Labhair muid faoi na dualgais at&aacute; san Acht agus d&uacute;ramar go bhfuil muid ann chun cabhr&uacute; agus cuidi&uacute; leo.  T&aacute;imid ann chun tuiscint a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh freisin faoin gc&uacute;is go bhfuil an tAcht ann agus &eacute; sin r&oacute;l n&iacute;os l&aacute;rna&iacute; a thabhairt don Ghaeilge i tsocha&iacute; na t&iacute;re.
