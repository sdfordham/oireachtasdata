    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#B00300"><p>I wish to begin by thanking the committee on my behalf and on behalf of Professor McQuinn for the opportunity to appear today.  We welcome the fact that greater parliamentary oversight of Ireland's budgetary process, as recommended by the OECD, is now becoming a reality.  Before turning to the specifics of our opening remarks, I would like to wish the committee well in carrying out its important work.</p> <p>  While we might get to explore a broad range of issues in response to any questions, we have aimed to restrict the opening remarks to the principles on which budgetary decisions should be made while also giving a brief overview of our outlook for key budgetary variables.  Some of these themes may well be familiar to members of the committee but we maintain there is value in placing the later discussion in the context of those principles.</p> <p>  The first question to arise in the construction of a budget is the macroeconomic question of the appropriate size of the budget package.  Economists tend to disagree on many issues but on the question of macro fiscal management there is broad agreement.  When the economy is growing below its potential rate, a stimulatory budget can help to move the economy back to its potential growth rate.  When the economy is growing faster than potential, contractionary fiscal policy can assist in avoiding overheating.</p> <p>  In the current context we now believe the Irish economy is growing at its potential rate and so neither stimulatory nor contractionary fiscal policies are required.  Instead, a neutral stance is required.  While there are differing definitions of neutrality, a budgetary package of approximately &euro;1 billion - the net fiscal space figure in the summer economic statement - is broadly in line with this concept.  These comments on economic growth are based on a view that the economy is growing at a rate in the region of 5% and not at the headline rate as published by the Central Statistics Office recently.</p> <p>  When arriving at the figure of &euro;1 billion, the Department of Finance adjusted the gross fiscal space figure of &euro;1.7 billion by subtracting estimated impacts on spending from the Lansdowne Road agreement and demographic pressures.  This is appropriate but ESRI researchers tend to go a step further by explicitly indexing social welfare payments and tax bands and allowances to projected wage growth to arrive at an opening budget position.  This is not to suggest that the Department of Finance is incorrect in its approach &ndash; this approach is based on the notion that indexation is a political decision made within the budget.  The ESRI approach comes from a different perspective and is based on the notion that distributional neutrality can only be achieved if welfare payments and tax bands and allowances are indexed to wages.</p> <p>  Whether indexation is implemented in a budget, our view is that budgetary figures and analysis should be presented with a baseline of indexation applied.  In this way, any failure to index tax bands and allowances is explicitly shown to be a tax increase.  Any failure to index social welfare payments is shown to be a cut in relative living standards.  In this way, the policy choices become more transparent.</p> <p>  Even if the overall budgetary position looks healthy, we know from recent experience that the tax base can be fragile.  For this reason it is desirable that the tax base is broad and that reliance is placed on the tax heads less sensitive to the economic cycle.  The ESRI has been exploring this issue under a programme of research with the Department of Finance.  One of the themes that has emerged is the relative stability of income taxes and hence the desirability of maintaining such taxes as a sizeable share of total revenues.</p> <p>  Although we aim to focus on principles in this opening statement, it is difficult not to mention proposed cuts in the universal social charge in the context of discussing the need to maintain the breadth and stability of the tax base.  The USC has many desirable features as a source of revenue: progressivity, transparency and stability, to mention three.  For this reason we are unconvinced that moves to abolish the USC are wise.  In light of my earlier remarks on indexation this is especially the case if the non-indexation of tax bands and allowances is used to fund any reductions.  More generally, the need to protect the tax base leads us to urge caution in respect of any reduction in the aggregate tax take.  This point has come into sharper focus because of the potential vulnerabilities associated with Brexit and the Apple tax decision.</p> <p>  I will outline three remaining principles before moving to questions.  The first, drawing from our medical colleagues, is to do no harm.  While this is generally true, I am making the point now partly in response to fears that there may be plans to provide support to house buyers in the budget.  Depending on the design of any proposals the potential exists for any supports to simply inject further demand into the market with direct effects on prices but no net benefit to the group being targeted.  In a paper before last year's budget we analysed the potential impact of a range of tax incentives in the housing market and showed how the incentives could fail to produce an increase in supply under plausible assumptions.  The lessons from that paper are relevant this year as well.  In the context of taxation and the property market, however, we see potential merit in site taxes and can expand on this later in the discussion.</p> <p>  Second, again in the context of learning a lesson from the past, all tax incentives should be reviewed periodically to ensure they are still relevant.  We are unsure whether the tourism-related incentive introduced by the last Government is still needed but the case needs to be explored.</p> <p>  Third, as with all policies, where possible evidence should be used to assess proposals and alternative approaches to achieving the same goal should be considered.  Again, I will use the USC as an example.  It is sometimes argued that high tax rates are a disincentive to work.  At some point this is probably true but we can ask if is there evidence to suggest that the current tax rates are leading to widespread withdrawals from the labour market.  The most recent figures show that employment increased by 56,000 in the year ending quarter 2, 2016, or almost 3%.  Evidence on this issue should be gathered in a more sophisticated manner but even this simple approach raises the question of whether tax is acting as a significant disincentive to work.  It could be the case that child care is a greater disincentive.  If this is true, then a greater effect on labour supply could be achieved through child care subsidies as opposed to income tax cuts, including USC cuts.</p> <p>  Finally, we believe capital investment that increases the productive capacity of the economy to be desirable, including spending on housing.  I thank the committee members for their attention and we look forward to taking questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#B00400"><p>I welcome Professor Barrett and Professor McQuinn and I thank Professor Barrett for his opening statement.  I have four quick questions and I will deal with them all at the same time, if that is okay.</p> <p>  The first relates to growth levels.  Professor Barrett referred to the growth levels and adjusting the 26% GDP figure that came from the Central Statistics Office to determine real economic growth.  The chief economist from the Central Bank was before the committee yesterday.  He indicated that the preference of the Central Bank would be to develop an Irish bespoke way of calculating growth and using a different set of economic indicators.  He suggested we could then try to win support for that approach throughout Europe and potentially globally.  How realistic is that?</p><p>Professor Barrett mentioned the universal social charge.  Can he expand on whether he wants it to be phased out or left as it is?  If he believes it should not be phased out, could he give his reasoning for this?  If it is phased out, what will lose out?  What will come under pressure?  Is it capital investment or current spend?  Where will the sacrifices be made if the universal social charge is abolished?</p><p> In the calculation of fiscal space there is a difference between gross fiscal space and the fiscal space net of the Lansdowne Road agreement and demographic pressures.  In some of its previous reports, the ESRI has been somewhat critical of the amount of room provided for demographic pressures.  Does Professor Barrett think it is undervalued or that it is greater than in the calculation of gross and net fiscal space?</p><p> My final question relates to capital investment.  I do not think Professor Barrett intentionally set out a hierarchy of priority but a vague reference to capital investment seemed to be tagged on at the end.  Given that we have very depressed levels of capital investment and that there are obvious needs in areas such as health, housing and education, there is always demand.  We have had the Cassells report on the housing crisis and the Department has said there will be a need for an increase of &euro;3 billion in capital investment in roads over the next five years.  How important is investment in capital and what are the priorities in that area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#C00200"><p>I will deal with the second, third and fourth questions and Dr. McQuinn will take the first.  We are taking a very cautious approach to the question of phasing out the USC.  I gently said in the opening statement that we are not at all convinced that it is a good idea to phase it out, for a number of reasons.  Globally speaking, we would be worried about anything that reduced the total tax take in Ireland at present.  One might be able to make arguments for certain tweaks to the tax system and certain taxes that one might consider moving or substituting with other sources of revenue, but the universal social charge has a lot of desirable features.  Obviously, everybody hates every sort of tax but as taxes go, it is very progressive and stable.  After the crisis, the stability of tax law is something on which economists have become much more fixated.  The charge is very effective from the point of view of getting in a lot of revenue.  Why, therefore, would one abolish this of all taxes?  Much of the political rhetoric around this is linked to the notion that it was introduced during the crisis and a belief that anything that came in as a result of the crisis can seamlessly be rolled back now that we are out of the crisis.  However, we got into the crisis because we had very unstable tax revenues so it seems like a really bad idea.  I use the term "we" but the ESRI never says anything.  Individuals within the ESRI say things, however.  The question of what might substitute for the USC or what might lose out does not arise as I do not think the charge should be reduced.</p> <p>  The strongest debate on fiscal space took place between the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance and they had differing perspectives.  The Department of Finance does now adjust the fiscal space measure and adds in demographic pressures and the Lansdowne Road agreement.  In the short term, the Department is probably doing a sufficient job in this area and I have consulted people from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on this, who agree that the &euro;400 million adjustment is probably reasonable.  The bigger point is that demographic projections are a longer-term issue.  This goes back to the need to defend the current tax base.  According to projections, demographic pressures on public finances will increase at a rapid rate beyond a certain point so anything we do now to soften or reduce the tax base will have very significant implications in the long term.</p> <p>  The final question was about capital investment, which has been low for a number of years.  There is a lesson from history here.  In the fiscal retrenchment of the 1980s, public capital investment fell to very low levels.  Everybody in the room will understand that this was because it is the easiest expenditure to cut.  There was an accumulation of non-spending so that, when growth finally started kicking in during the 1990s, all the talk was about the infrastructural deficit, as it was known at the time.  It is clear to see that something similar could happen soon, if it is not already happening with issues around congestion.  Housing is the crucial issue and with that come issues around water and other infrastructural investment associated with housing.  People talk about the need to invest in housing but this implies an awful lot more besides.</p> <p>  We certainly see a need for infrastructural investment, given that it has been cut back for many years and still stands at a low proportion of GDP.  On the question of what to do with the money in the budgetary package, one can invest and will have something to show for it, while one can decide not to invest if things get bad.  The fear, however, is that we start reducing taxes and then have to raise them again or start spending money on current expenditure, for which there are otherwise, nevertheless, many good reasons to do so.  With capital expenditure, one at least has something to show for it and can turn it off if necessary.  There is a strong case to be made for expenditure in housing and associated areas.</p> <p>  While we decided in the past that we had to spend on capital infrastructure, we made the mistake of not ensuring that individual projects stood up to rigorous evaluation.  The catch-all notion that capital expenditure is, always and everywhere, a good thing should not be allowed to filter into the discussion.  There is a case for capital investment but projects should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#C00300"><p>The Deputy has identified a very pressing issue, particularly for those of us working in the analysis area of the economy.  The CSO has to follow the approach taken in the national accounts as this is mandated by EUROSTAT under the ISA 2010 approach to setting out national accounts.  There may have been some commentary to the effect that the figures were wrong but they were not - they were correct.  However, it is hugely important, for ourselves and for everybody, that we have a set of national accounts which gives us an assessment of what is going on in the general day-to-day activity of the economy that is as accurate as possible.  Nobody believes that economic activity surged by 26% in Ireland last year.  This is a particularly important issue at this moment because we are facing into the budget and we will address it in some detail in our next quarterly commentary.  We will show that it has implications on a number of levels, such as assessing what would be the most prudent budgetary package.  For example, the debt-GDP ratio is a hugely important concept for which the Commission has set a target of 60%.  When GDP is inflated to the extent it was in the figures in question, it brings down the debt-GDP ratio by a huge amount.  The question is whether that is an accurate reflection of the economy's ability to sustain its debt and we would argue that it is not.  This is an example of where figures such as these can affect a lot of our analysis.</p> <p>  A hugely important concept is that of potential output, which defines the output gap and the prudence of the budgetary package.  I agree with what Dr. Gabriel Fagan suggested yesterday.  A committee has already been established, chaired by Professor Philip Lane and including Professor Barrett, as well as many other distinguished luminaries to look at the issue.  I am sure there will be some very positive and concrete proposals.  We in the quarterly economic commentary, QEC, will try out some ourselves.  The CSO used another accounting methodology, the ISA 1995 approach, and one possible avenue would be for both sets of accounts to come out.</p><p>That would provide two different approaches and one could compare the differences from that.  However, as economists and analysts generally, there is an onus on us to come up with indicators that better reflect what is going on in the economy.  Those indicators therefore would then be accepted among the policy makers generally in setting credible standards and means by which one can assess the prudence or otherwise of budgetary packages.  Another area into which this comes is that it is not just the headline GDP figure, as the investment figure, for instance, which also surged last year.  Going back to the discussion about the amount of capital investment, another indicator we look at is the ratio of investment to GDP and if investment is surging in an unnatural way, it is then hard to get an indication as to what is the actual level of investment in the economy and what are the levels of investment we should be having.</p><p> If I can also touch briefly on the housing issue, as we do quite a bit of research on it, one reason we have been plugging the need for greater investment in social housing in particular over the past couple of years is that quite apart from the obvious social issue there, we also believe that greater investment on the social side could have positive spillovers through the effect it would have in addressing the private market as well.  When one hears of many of the difficulties that are being experienced on the supply side of the market from listening to people on the developer side regarding access to finance and the confidence factor in the market in general, a greater involvement by the Government sector in the provision of social housing could have positive spillover effects.  The other crucial reason to mention housing in the context of investment in housing is that the housing issue is not merely affecting those in the housing market, although obviously it is having a huge impact on those people.  It is also potentially having knock-on effects as far as the general economy is concerned.  Everybody in the economy has worked hard to restore competitiveness in the economy in recent years and rental levels surging to the extent to which they are can only put upward pressure on and cause potential deterioration in our competitiveness, particularly when we are trying to attract people to come and work in our major cities especially and in Dublin in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#D00200"><p>I thank the delegation from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, for their attendance.  While I wish to zero in on a couple of points, I have a follow-on question on housing.  While Professor Barrett stated "do no harm", there is harm there and Dr. McQuinn has zeroed in on the current state of the private side with spiralling rents affecting competitiveness and our ability to attract inward investment, as well as a major supply issue.  People are struggling to get together a deposit under the new rules but the ESRI's strong suggestion is to not do anything in the budget because of its fear that it may lead to price increases on the private side.  What kind of words of comfort can Dr. McQuinn offer to people who are struggling to put together a deposit?  As they may be people who might need to consider social housing if they are unable to get a deposit, there is something of a vicious circle going on there.  Second, I refer to supply and the necessity to get that supply quickly in respect of social housing.  I am conscious the ESRI has produced a report with the rather grandiose title, "An empirical assessment of macroprudential measures in the Irish housing and credit markets".  Will Dr. McQuinn provide members with a flavour of that report as to how it may address the supply issue in the context of social housing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#D00300"><p>On that point, when we said "do no harm", this was in response to certain taxation measures that were being proposed.  For instance, the VAT issue was being floated with the potential to give those on the development side a possible reduction in the VAT rates.  When we said "do no harm", we were addressing those kinds of specific measures.  We produced a quite detailed report going through the various effects as a result.  As I stated in my previous contribution, where we clearly believe there must be action on the housing market is on the social housing front.  This is one area in which the State could make a significant contribution and there obviously has been the publication of the housing plan during the summer.  As I stated, by addressing the social housing side, one can have positive spillover effects on the private sector side.  We even went so far as to look back to the noughties and even after the financial crisis had kicked in, in 2007 and 2008, as an economy we still were building approximately 3,500 to 4,000 social housing or public authority housing units at the time.  A rough metric would suggest we were spending approximately &euro;1.5 billion on it at the time.  We were putting those figures in the public domain to state this is the kind of investment needed to get that number of units up and running on a year-on-year basis.  Certainly, that is one specific measure.</p> <p>  The site tax to which Professor Barrett referred is a measure we identified clearly in some research that was published at the tail-end of last year.  Basically, we looked across other jurisdictions and tried to identify measures that seemed to have an impact in triggering supply in the housing market and the site tax, particularly in the Danish case, seemed to work quite well.  As I understand it, there are proposals to bring in a site tax - in 2019 I believe - and a tax rate of approximately 2% to 3% has been suggested.  Our recommendation would have been that this be fast-tracked, where possible, and that the rate be considered and even possibly increased.  A site tax certainly is one area that could have a quite significant impact in bringing greater supply on stream.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of the deposit, which of course ties in with the macroprudential measures.  First, I should state that I was a central banker for many years and I would state without equivocation that macroprudential policy is of huge importance in an Irish context, particularly given everything we have experienced with the credit bubble that led to the difficulties in the banking sector.  Consequently, it is important to have this series of measures in place to prevent us from going back down the route we took in the past.  We have, however, in a series of submissions and in a series of papers, suggested that the way in which these measures should be implemented should be considered.  That is part of the submission regarding the latest revision of these measures that the Central Bank is undertaking.  Our point has been that we believe the measures should have what we call a counter-cyclical dimension to them in how they are implemented.  This basically is just following on from what we think is best practice in every other area of major economic policy, be it monetary policy or fiscal policy, namely, that when one is triggering these measures, whether it be the loan-to-value ratio or the loan-to-income ratio, one takes into account the state of the housing market at a point in time.  Consequently, one examines things like house prices, supply and the credit levels that are extended in the economy.  If, on the basis of one's judgment, one thinks the measures are suggesting the market is in a contractionary phase or is in a downturn, one then may need to ease these measures.  Similarly, if one thinks the market is overperforming or that too many houses are being built, one tightens the credit supply.  This is a principle we believe should be at the centre of the macroprudential regime.  As I stated, it is of huge importance and like any other new policy area, it is important that it gets buy-in from everybody and having that element to it would help and assist in this regard.  As I stated, these three areas basically are, broadly speaking, greater involvement on the supply of social housing, a site tax and possibly a counter-cyclical dimension built into the way in which the macroprudential policy measures are being implemented.</p></speech>

To highlight specifically what the ESRI calls the tourism-related incentive, that is, the 9% VAT rate, the argument being made to retain it is that while Dublin city centre is doing particularly well, this has not spread across the regions and that to change this initiative at present would be to undermine the potential of the regions to benefit from it.  What do the witnesses think of that?  What is their view, after the passing of five years, on what the overall initiative has done for job creation, etc.?</p></speech>

The point we were trying to flag and to illustrate was again back to that theme of lessons from the past.  What we learned previously is that often, tax incentives could be introduced in Ireland, for which there was a rationale at a certain point in time, but then they just stayed in place.  Again, it is one of the core principles of Government expenditure or taxation incentives that there should be a market failure; there should be some issue that is being addressed.  Consequently, if it is something like a weakness in an industry whereby it needs some sort of assistance or boost, Government policy can do that.  However, beyond a certain point, one is not actually assisting an industry; one merely is giving handouts to the players in that industry who are doing particularly well.  Again, one should remember these sorts of variations are costly and consequently should be evaluated in exactly the same way as if public money was being spent.</p><p>The point about the regional spread of these sorts of things is well taken.  Whether there is scope for any regional variation in that sort of measure, I do not really know.  However, it is certainly very hard to look at hotels and restaurants in Dublin, especially on a Friday night, and conclude that the owners of these hotels and restaurants need public money to help them through.  The broader point is this issue of analysing and ensuring that the original rationale is still in place and really interrogating that.</p></speech>

A commission is being established.  What are Professor Barrett's views on that given that it will impact slightly on next year's budget?  What principles should apply, looking at the pressures on public services at the moment, in particular in certain areas?</p></speech>

The ESRI has made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in advance of the setting up of the commission.  The point we have always made about this is methodological, but I will try to make it as interesting as possible.  I cannot even remember what year it was but before the original benchmarking exercise all those years ago, people seemed to go into it with the assumption that public servants were paid less than private sector people.  It turned out that nobody had actually measured if that was the case.  Our starting point in this is that one has to have a very serious analysis of wage levels.  Again, people will be familiar with the notion that because public servants generally have higher levels of education and experience, they earn more.  Nevertheless, one can account for all those sort of things and try to get a sense of whether there is, genuinely, a public service pay premium or, indeed, a public service disadvantage.  That exercise, bizarrely, was not actually conducted at the first stage.</p> <p>  After the benchmarking exercise had occurred and there were increases of the order of 12% or 15% or so, Jim O'Leary, who was then in Maynooth, did the analysis and showed that actually public servants were much better paid than those in the private sector.  That did not even include the benefits of the public sector pension which was relatively generous.  Our core point on this is that the analysis should be done and that any decision should be made on the basis of it.  I can tell the committee that the most recent analysis is going to present something of a dilemma here.  The most recent analysis showed that it is no longer a simple question of whether there is a public pay premium or a public pay gap.  We have now seen that at the upper end of the wage distribution, that is higher paid people, one is better off in the private sector.  However, lower waged people are better off in the public sector.  The very harsh conclusion is that one should be reducing the wages of public servants on the lower end of the spectrum and increasing them at the higher end.  I am looking across at a group of politicians and it strikes me that this would not be the most popular and maybe not the most appropriate thing to do.</p></speech>

My thought process was dominated by the fact that we are talking about public sector pay, but the broader point the Deputy makes is fair.  Remember, however, that any tax that applies in the private sector applies in the public sector also.  The broader point is that when this analysis is done, there could be complicated and tricky issues that will arise.</p></speech>

Professor Barrett's last contribution showed one of the things that is the real problem sometimes when one looks at things economically.  While one might end up with a macro viewpoint on something, it sounds absolutely absurd when one hears it out loud.  If anyone was to suggest that we cut low-paid public sector workers' pay because of some macro economic perspective, it would be an example of the absurdity one can end up sometimes with economics.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for Professor Barrett and I appreciate that he outlined that it was his own personal view and perspective.  There are two things.  I take on board certain aspects of Professor Barrett's comments on the USC in regard to some of its benefits.  However, for lower and middle income workers the USC is an excessive tax that is really impacting on their earnings.  It is taking money out of people's pockets.  I do not agree with Professor Barrett's conclusion on it at all.  While I do not agree with the abolition of the USC, I always have a problem when sentences start with, "We should not abolish the USC" but then suggest that lower, small proportionate phasing or re-tweaking of it is not good either.  No one would disagree with the idea that we want a broad, stable tax base, but that does not prohibit us from gradually looking at the extent to which taxes like the USC impact on low and middle income workers in terms of actual disposable income.  One of the clear and obvious problems we have is that while, as the Professor said in reference to Friday evenings in Dublin restaurants, we have people who can spend money, we have a large number of people living in the real world who cannot.  They are working very hard and putting every hour they can into it, but when they look at their pay packets at the end of the week, the impact of the USC suggests that we should look at doing something for them.  If that means tweaking the USC and looking at what we do elsewhere, that is something we should do.  I do not accept the economics, which effectively suggests one does nothing and does not touch it.</p> <p>  The other thing is the "Do no harm", comment which was alluded to earlier.  If the Government was doing nothing on the supply side, I could see how the ESRI could come to its argument.  It did a paper last year a lot of the assumptions of which could be looked at again.  One of the huge things that has changed is the programme that is now being proposed by the Government which largely addresses the supply side problems in housing.  One does not take any one action in isolation.  I agree that if no attempt was being made to adjust the supply side, we could have a tax incentive here or there.  At the end of the day, however, one has to create a situation for people who are working and earning and want the opportunity to afford their own home.  As well as looking at the supply side, we need to look at how we can help them.  There is nothing inherently wrong with that provided it is done as part of a comprehensive package which addresses both sides of the situation.  I query that.</p> <p>  I am interested to know why the ESRI seems to ignore the supply side of the Government's newly announced programme.  It is probably something we will not agree on because I do not accept the principle that we should be a high tax economy for low and middle income earners just to preserve the stability of the tax base.  That is not political rhetoric, it is just a different approach in terms of how I look at things versus, perhaps, the Professor's perspective.</p></speech>

On the taxation issue and low pay, one of the defining features of the Irish taxation system is the extent to which low-paid people are excluded.  If one compares us internationally, there have been substantial efforts to exclude lower paid people from the tax net.  That applies in respect of both income tax and the USC.  If the Deputy's concern is that we need to do more to exclude more people, that is a perfectly sane thing to suggest.  Nevertheless, there are costs associated with it.  The question is how far up the distribution one wants to go in excluding people.  To the extent that there is a second defining feature of the Irish income tax system, it is the extent to which people start paying the higher marginal tax rate at relatively low levels of income.  There was an ESRI paper on this a number of years ago which compared the Irish and the British tax systems.  It made the point that one of the reasons we start taxing at a high marginal rate at relatively low incomes is that we exclude so many people at the lower end.</p><p>This is a political choice and, again, there are very good reasons we might want to do this.  However, I do not understand the notion that in some sense the Irish tax system attacks lower income people and that moves are needed on the USC.</p><p> With regard to the housing issue, our opening statement was brief and we did not mean to include everything.  We are fixated on the notion that the difficulties in the Irish housing market will be solved on the supply side.  The likely impacts of injecting additional demand into a supply-constrained market at this stage are very clear.  A number of proposals had been floating around and it was partly almost as a way, we thought, of getting over the macroprudential rules that if we could just get more cash to first-time buyers in particular, it would solve the problem as they could get deposits and could buy.  For years we have had analysis, and many people in the room will remember the &euro;5,000 first-time buyers grant.  All it did was to increase the price of houses by approximately &euro;5,000.  We give the payment to one group of people but we may as well just give it straight to the developers and builders because ultimately they will get it.  The analysis we carried out last year was on tax incentives in a market which is constrained in terms of supply and it demonstrated that, ultimately, tax incentive measures have very little effect on supply and, very often, their effect is to transfer money not to the people we are trying to help but to the people at the end of the line.  This is not to suggest for a moment we do not welcome the measures announced on the supply side, in fact we think they are critical, but our argument is that the effort needs to be focused on the supply side and if we do things on the demand side they will not be as effective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#F00200"><p>Going back to Professor Barrett's comments in the opening statement regarding how we frame and think about the budgetary package and the measures that should be taken, the crucial point for us, particularly regarding taxation or expenditure, is where we think the economy is at, whether we think it is growing in line what we call the potential level or whether it is at the potential level.  If it is above or below this, perhaps there is a requirement for measures to be taken.  At present, and it is quite difficult given the headline figures announced recently, our view is the economy is pretty much at its potential level.  This is an important assessment because it suggests that in terms of the overall budgetary package the Government should follow a broadly neutral strategy.</p> <p>  Where there is a rationale to cut taxes - looking at it from a broad economic perspective - is when one feels the economy, or the domestic sector of the economy, needs some type of stimulus and we need to put more money in people's pockets which they will go out and spend with a resultant knock-on impact on growth.  However, our assessment is that all of the dynamism and growth in the Irish economy is coming from domestic sector.  This is with the understanding of the many difficulties and the households still suffering the after-effects of the financial crisis.  Looking at the headline figures, consumption is very strong and increased by 4.5% last year, which is higher than what we thought it would be, employment growth is very strong and unemployment is reducing albeit gradually in recent times.  All of the headline figures for retail sales this year have increased strongly and I believe consumption will increase again this year.  The rationale from our perspective for cutting taxes is whether it is required in terms of its impact on economic growth and, given the strong rates of growth in the economy, particularly the fact they are coming from domestic sources rather than from external trade sources - as was the case in the initial phases of the recovery - we do not see the rationale for a cut at this point in time.</p> <p>  We will speak a little about the Government's plan on housing in our next commentary.  In line with the comments I made earlier when I spoke about identifying the role the Government can play in terms of the greater provision of social housing, we welcome the increased commitment as outlined in the plan during the summer.  The targets set out are very ambitious and they may or not be met.  However, the increase in resources in the area is clearly important.  The overall package of &euro;5.5 billion over four years must be seen in the context of the metrics we spoke about earlier regarding the spend in the noughties of approximately &euro;1.5 billion or &euro;1.6 billion on social housing.  The measures taken, particularly those announced on the supply side, will have a positive impact.</p> <p>  I echo Professor Barrett's point on breaks or a stimulus on the demand side of the market.  When we have supply-side issues and, unfortunately, supply is relatively slow coming on stream in the current market.  If we give a demand-side incentive such as a tax break, the danger is it simply just gets bid into the price of the house.  This is the difficulty with such a measure.</p></speech>

Regardless of whether we like it, we have an open economy.  We must look at how much tax is coming off starter salaries of &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 and the salaries of graduates coming out of college, be they nurses or computer programmers.  They can go to the UK and be paid effectively the same amount of money but with take home pay which is completely disproportionate to what we have in Ireland.  This is a disproportionate draw on our situation here.  The witnesses spoke about it having no effect on employment and cited the fact employment has increased by 56,000.  We had a huge unemployment crisis and it is great to see what has happened, but there is no question that there is a problem with the rates of USC and the rates of overall taxation on income when it comes to certain types of salaries and people who are highly mobile, young and want to leave Ireland.  We paid for them to have a very good third-level education but they can go to the neighbouring jurisdiction and pay a fraction of the tax on their incomes they would be obliged to pay here.  That is a matter to which consideration must be given.</p></speech>

It is normally thought of terms of it being wonderful that all these jobs have been created.  This is absolutely true but the flip side is that these 56,000 people are willing to take jobs in the context of the high tax rates which people keep speaking about as a great disincentive to work.  In terms of the labour supply figures, while we have had huge net emigration it is now moving in the other direction.  I will answer the final part of the question not as an economist but as somebody who heads an organisation trying to employ people in Dublin.  Every time we cannot employ somebody internationally it is not because of the tax it is because of the housing crisis in Dublin.  This is where the difficulty lies.  People have not yet said to us they will not come to Dublin because the tax is too high but they regularly tell us they cannot afford rents in Dublin.</p></speech>

The ESRI has spoken at length on a number of occasions about the need for capital investment.  The committee is trying to reach perspectives in terms of the budget.  The Irish rate of capital investment is low.  Do the witnesses have a calculation of where we should move to in percentage and gross terms?  Do we need to play catch-up with several billion euro in areas such as school investment, third-level investment, training and roads?  In the context of regional development, some major and secondary road projects throughout the country genuinely need to be either completed or initiated.</p><p>If we are talking about development along the west coast, there is a need for better transport links, certainly if we want Limerick and Cork to be hubs.  There are several other areas too but those two, as well as housing, are critical.</p><p> I understand the overall context for the air of caution in the Governor&rsquo;s letter to the Minister for Finance but I was rather taken aback at the suggestion that the EU target for debt, the 60%, ought in the case of Ireland for reasons of risk to be much lower, by an unspecified amount.  I refer to the letter released a couple of days ago.  What would the witnesses' advice be in constructing the budget on where capital investment should fall?  It needs to be increased.  I thought a consensus was developing on that.  There is a hike in construction costs but that is inevitable, given where the economy was three or four years ago, and should be expected.  What would the witnesses suggest would be the appropriate figure for capital investment between now and 2021?  Is the current rate very low and are there areas the witnesses would prioritise?  I would certainly go for education, transport and other areas of critical investment, including regional investment, but I would like to hear their views on that.</p></speech>

We have not considered it in that level of detail over a multi-annual period.  Any advice we have given in the budgetary process has prioritised the housing area for the reasons I have articulated, not just because of the causes within the housing market but because of the knock-on effects of higher rental rates and the pressures that high house prices put on competitiveness.  In terms of priorities, I echo Professor Barrett's comments that if we suggest investment in any area, it is absolutely critical for detailed analysis to be done on the returns from any investment programme that needs to be undertaken.  Sometimes there is a danger that it can be almost built into the popular vernacular that we need more investment.  Obviously, there are areas in the economy where we need that but it needs to be done in a very rigorous, well thought out fashion and a very detailed cost benefit analysis needs to be done on the types of project that will result from whatever expenditure goes in there.</p> <p>  In terms of the broad budgetary packages, or rules, which guide this, the Commission&rsquo;s take generally on the expenditure benchmark is that expenditure can be increased in line with the potential growth rate of the economy.  That is one of its basic principles or guidelines for fiscal rules.  In terms of any overarching principle that should guide expenditure in this area, it is important that whatever the Government engages in improves the productive capacity of the economy and by definition leads to increases in its potential output growth, for example, in areas such as transport investment.</p> <p>  The other area that is a bugbear of mine is the call for greater investment in health and while we all wish for greater investment in that area, we need to consider what kind of data and information we have of detailed costings in the health service.  I take that as an example of how when we spend large sums of money on public investment, we need to make sure we get a substantial yield from that and that it is spent in a very wise and prudent fashion.</p></speech>

That is our first constructive contribution and we would probably put the emphasis on capital.</p> <p>  One of the first projects I worked on in the institute 20 years ago was an evaluation of a global capital programme that the EU was funding.  It was 1997 and very famous people such as John FitzGerald and Patrick Honohan were also working on it.  The EU was going to spend a huge sum of money and our task was how to prioritise that across a range of areas.  I think that because we have had so little capital expenditure in Ireland for a long time, we need to step back and ask how we are going to allocate whatever quantums of money there are in the medium term across a range of areas.  We have got out of the habit of doing these things.  The housing problem is so clear that we can all agree we should be doing something about it.</p> <p>  The other point to be made, however, and colleagues at the institute have been working on this, is that we should not be thinking about infrastructural spending in segmented components, for example, broadband.  Research has shown that broadband can be very useful in terms of the economic impact on an area but only if there is a reasonably high level of educational qualification among the population in that area.  Just spending the money without there being an institute of technology or university locally does not give the same bang for one's buck.  Broadband now has a sort of motherhood and apple pie dimension to it, everybody is in favour of it and how could one be against it but we need to step back a bit and think in a more integrated way about how we should be spending on capital to make sure we do it well.  There are good lessons analytically from the recent past on how to do it.</p> <p>  An issue that has come up in certain circumstances, and I am going to talk once again about my much-derided profession of economics, is that economics says when interest rates are essentially at zero, we should invest quite a lot, more than is allowed by a narrow interpretation of the fiscal rules.  I think the Department of Finance is already talking to Brussels about this and Professor McQuinn has touched on it.  Fiscal rules should not be so ridiculous that if there are expenditures that would genuinely add to the productive capacity of the economy, they should not be reflected in the scope we have to invest in capital.  The notion of treating the productive impact, for example, of a road or houses in the same way as a reduction in the universal social charge, USC, strikes me as kind of crazy.  There is flexibility and Commission officials have said that.  As a country, we need to explore that flexibility as much as possible.</p></speech>

It has gone up slightly.  That is essentially an alternative tax measure.  It is quite valuable to discuss that versus other options.  Would the witnesses like to outline or subsequently send us the details of what they would envisage?  I think it is desirable that people do not fall into the higher rate as soon as they do in Ireland.  It is a really big problem for young people taking up technical jobs, as I know from my experience of working with graduates.  What would the witnesses envisage, for example, in terms of a three-year cycle?  I would be flexible on it.</p><p>People enter the top tax bracket relatively early on, particularly when compared with the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  This difficulty must be borne in mind. </p><p> I will make two points on housing.  With regard to the construction industry, there has been total market failure in terms of access to credit for people in the construction sector who are not in the National Asset Management Agency, in other words, small and medium sized construction companies.  A builder developing a block of ten apartments cannot build two apartments and then start to build another two units a couple of years later.  Dr. McQuinn referred to market failure.  In this case, there has been a market failure, although many of the builders concerned admittedly have impaired credit records for reasons with which we are all familiar.  Do the witnesses have any proposals for addressing this issue?</p><p> Ireland has an extraordinary large number of empty houses, as recent figures from the Central Statistics Office have shown.  While I am sure some of these houses are owned by elderly people living in nursing homes, this is a will-o'-the-wisp issue in the sense that there is never anything solid done about it.  Has the ESRI or any other entity identified whether there are a large number of people with two homes?  The Central Statistics Office specifically states that its figures on empty houses do not include holiday homes.  Are there cases of people keeping one or two spare houses in case, for example, they have a row with someone and need to move out for a while?  Intuitively, I would love to have an explanation of what precisely this is about.  I understand that at any one time a number of people may be in hospital for short or long periods and others may be in nursing homes.  If the witnesses do not have an explanation now, perhaps they will revert to the committee on the issue.  If there is a stock of empty houses and the issue is, as the witnesses noted, one of supply, why can we not get at these houses?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#H00200"><p>I will first address the Deputy's second point, which related to tax.  Research has been done on this issue.  Brendan O'Connor in the Department of Finance did a comparison across OECD countries of the levels at which taxpayers enter the various tax bands.  It was clear from some simple graphs in his paper that Irish people moved into the top rate of tax at a lower income level than in other countries.  If one is looking at desirable levels, which are difficult to quantify or estimate, cross-country comparisons are often a good place to start in terms of looking at where people in comparator countries, if one likes, move into the highest rate of tax.  This could provide some guidance in that area.</p> <p>  On the issue of market failure in construction, unfortunately there is no short-term solution to this problem.  Ultimately, the solution is that the banks get their balance sheets back into a position such that they are able to lend.  This is happening, albeit at a glacial speed, as we all know.  This reflects the fact that the banks have taken a long time to deal with the impairment issues on their balance sheets.  It is a well known maxim in banking that banks with bad balance sheets struggle to lend or do not lend for a variety of different reasons.  One element, therefore, is the need for the banking sector to get its balance sheets back in order to the extent where banks are in a position to lend.  The stress testing results published in the summer showed that some Irish banks did not fare terribly well on that score.  There is obviously an issue with confidence in the market and this clearly impacts on credit availability.</p> <p>  To return to the issue of social housing, we indicated that one of the reasons greater government involvement in this sector could play a part in terms of resolution for the overall market was that greater levels of confidence in the market could be generated if there was some scheme in place whereby developers were able to access funding and a guaranteed basis for social housing.  This would potentially enable them to get greater access to funding for private development, etc.  Something along those lines and the greater commitment outlined in the recent housing plan could help in that regard. </p> <p>  The one slight note of caution I always build in regarding the housing market - it may seem slightly strange at this point - is that generally and for whatever reason, there is a three or four-year lag built into the housing market in terms of the point at which house prices start to increase and profitability starts to return to the sector and the point at which supply of housing comes on stream.  The Deputy may be familiar with the debate on housing back in the 1990s, which was very much focused on the same issue.  We had the famous Bacon reports which told us we needed more supply.  Before we knew it, between 40,000 and 50,000 houses were being built every year.  There is always a danger than we will swing from one side to the other.  This would, in turn, bring budgetary pressures.  In our previous commentary, we noted that if we started to build the number of houses we need and possibly more than that number, it could create budgetary pressures.</p> <p>  To return to the issue of capital expenditure, I was reminded when Professor Barrett was speaking of a piece I wrote last year which is tied into this issue, albeit at the European level.  I was quite critical in my piece of the European fiscal stance that was taken during the crisis.  I believed it was important to note and place on record that Ireland had little or no choice in the matter and had to adopt the measures that were taken to get our public finances in order.  We strongly argued from a mainstream economic point of view that the stance taken by the European authorities since 2010-11 was very counterproductive in terms of the fiscal position that was taken, namely, one in which we had economies that were generally recognised as having substantial and large negative gaps in 2010, 2011 and 2012, a banking sector which was in crisis across Europe and high levels of household debt.  Ultimately, in these types of circumstances, it is plausible for the Government to step in to provide the kind of aggregate demand that was required.  We drew an analogy between what was not done in Europe and what was done in the United States where a stimulatory package - known as the troubled asset relief programme or TARP - was undertaken by the federal authorities.  Analysis of what the TARP did - and some argued it should have done more - suggests it offset, at a federal level, many of the measures that were being undertaken at the time on a state by state basis.  The individual states were trying to get their budgetary positions in check and back in order while the overall federal response helped to offset the negative impact on economic activity that the corrective measures had.  Those are important lessons going forward.  Serious mistakes were made at the European level in terms of the fiscal response and they should be noted.  </p></speech>

Obviously, we have a job given to us by the Oireachtas, namely, to formulate the parameters of budget 2017.  In respect of tax expenditures, do the witnesses have a figure for the likely tax expenditure, up to and including the last Finance Bill, off which we would operate for budget 2017?  Has the ESRI carried out much research into that?  We have been thinking about this a lot today because we all either have spoken or will speak about the Apple judgement.  I have been a member of a few Committees of Public Accounts.  At the time, although we would have invigilated revenue very strenuously at times, there was a feeling that we did not have the information.  Did the ESRI have the information in respect of tax expenditures?  Did anyone have it?  Has the ESRI figures relating to it?  In respect of some of the discussion we have heard so far with people who have come in to brief us, we are dependent on being able to come up with new revenue ideas.

The ESRI's engagement with these sort of things tends to be at the micro level, where one is looking at individual tax expenditures.  One of the things that has struck me is that the Department of Finance has considerably upped its game in this area.  For many years, there were all sorts of expenditure appraisal formalities around current and capital expenditure, but tax expenditures went beneath the radar.  There was a greater recognition in the 2000s of the effect that some of the property reliefs were having distributionally - who was benefitting from them and what the actual impact of such things was.  The Department redesigned things and got into a much stronger zone in terms of the appraisal.  This is where the ESRI engagement would have been.  It would have been topic by topic.  I am open to correction on this but my understanding of this is that much of the tax expenditures, particularly in the property area, were phased out over time.  There are a few remaining headline ones.  Is it fair to say that the biggest tax expenditure is the pension relief?</p></speech>

In terms of the USC - and it is hard to get away from it - one of the proposals that has floated around and with which members will be familiar is, if the USC is going to be abolished or phased out, whether it would be a good idea to convert it into a mandatory pension contribution in the context of the pensions crisis that most people would accept is there.  That is strand one.</p></speech>

I have argued about and discussed this for quite a long time.  We have a State-run mandatory pension system in Ireland - namely, PRSI and the social welfare pension.  The argument that many people have made is that we need to develop that basic system into an earnings-related system where one would have mandatory contributions into a fund.  It is very hard to introduce these thing straight off because it is perceived as another tax and we know there is resistance to that.  When one has something like the USC, does it provide an opportunity over the next five years to politically engineer a situation whereby one could turn that into an earnings-related pensions contribution and develop a public pension system to overcome the difficulties that most people here recognise?  Here is the catch.  If it was a mandatory system, there would be no logic for having a tax incentive attached to it, because why would one incentivise people to do things they have to do?  I know that is a very specific answer to the Deputy's broader point.</p></speech>

Does Professor Barrett see any merit in that type of taxation, whereby we would deliberately take a pot of money and put it into hostelries, hotels and so forth in some shape or form outside the Dublin region?  It was pointed out earlier that the Dublin region has the highest hotel prices in Europe, or was it the world?  The prices are incredible at different times.</p> <p>  My final point is very specific.

As a general principle, economists are completely against them for the simple reason that when the state gets a quantum of money, what dictates how it spends that money should be where it will get the best return on that money, not linking it very narrowly with particular things.  Instinctively, economists are always against it.  The flip side of that is that we all recognise that the political acceptability of certain things can often be increased if people see that they are paying or foregoing a particular tax and it is being directed in a particular way.  There are two sides to that.  If it gets down to the very micro details of giving grants to specific hotels and regions, it strikes me as a level of micro-engagement that I cannot imagine the officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport being very enthused about.</p></speech>

Why would one necessarily fixate on tourism as an industry?  One saves this money by reversing one's self out of that particular tax expenditure.  If one is worried about development in the west, surely the best way is to think how one might spend that money as part of a regional development strategy .  I am cautious about the notion of locking money in to very narrow policy objectives.</p></speech>

If one is looking consciously at addressing regional concerns, it is probably more efficient to do so in that broader context and to have an overarching spatial strategy with clearly designated hubs as the way forward.  Again, it goes back to the kind of investment question in transport.  If one feels that it would make a significant contribution in terms of improving the productive capacity of the regions, improving infrastructural expenditure is possibly a way forward.</p></speech>

A concern of mine is the difficulty younger people face in getting into the housing market.  Comments were made yesterday by Deputy Broughan about the impact of Central Bank rules on younger people.  This is fuelling the rise in rents because people cannot afford to buy and it is preventing people from relocating to other areas.  They may be staying at home for longer.</p><p>The witness mentioned site tax.  Will he expand on how that might work?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#K00300"><p>On the Central Bank macroprudential measures, as I stated in response to an earlier question, I worked in the Central Bank for ten or 11 years.  I always say in commenting on the macroprudential measures that it is essential, as a small, open economy with a highly globalised banking sector, to have such measures in place.  That safeguards as much as possible the domestic financial sector from the kind of huge inflows of credit and exposure that we all witnessed.  There were almost horrific effects in many different ways.<br/><br/>Macroprudential policy is here to stay as a policy tool and that is a good and positive development.  In our initial submission to the Central Bank on the macroprudential measures and in a revised submission recently, we suggested some tweaks in the way in which the measures should be implemented.  I was speaking earlier about comparing this, for example, to monetary and fiscal policy.  In those very important policy domains, the crucial issue very often in discussing whether to increase taxes or expenditure, or in the monetary policy area to increase or lower interest rates, is how well the market or economy is performing as a whole.  Is it performing very well or not so well?  Where is it?  In terms of implementing macroprudential policy, there is no reason those kinds of principles cannot apply.<br/><br/>There is a growing body of international literature suggesting that this is the way to implement policy, taking into account where one believes is the market.  By that I mean embedding what we call a counter-cyclical dimension.  This means that if we believe the market is over-performing, we are building too many houses and house prices are rising too fast, then those measures can be implemented and tweaked so as to tighten the credit supply, as that is what often causes bubbles.  Equally, if one feels the market is underperforming, we are not building enough houses, prices are very low, etc., we could ease credit.  That would not happen widely within big bands but there should be a principle in place.  Implementing the measures when the bank did without a counter-cyclical dimension was unfortunate as the market was still very much on its knees, particularly on the supply side.  We were only building 8,000 or 9,000 houses two or three years ago and this year we will be lucky to build 14,000 units.  That must be put in the context of research done by colleagues at the ESRI demonstrating that we need somewhere in the region of 25,000 units per annum.  In light of the recent census, we will probably need 30,000 houses per annum, as it found 100,000 extra people in the country.  The key point is that target.  This year we will be lucky to build 14,000 units so we are still a long way off that.  In that context, if there is a counter-cyclical dimension, it could lead to the easing of the measures somewhat.  Equally, if we start to build 45,000, 50,000 or 60,000 houses, we should be able to tighten measures and reduce the exposure of the domestic banking sector to the kind of credit bubble that we witnessed in 2005, 2006 and 2007.<br/><br/>The Deputy is right in that the rental issue is a by-product of many of the macroprudential measures.  Research, including some involving us, has demonstrated that if credit is tightened in a market, rents tend to increase <i>vis-a-vis</i>prices for the reason outlined; if people cannot afford to buy but still want to live in a particular area, the only option is to rent.  That drives up rents.  Another related issue is that there will be a spreading of the commuter belt.  For people who wish to work in Dublin, the only alternative is to buy further out, which would be another unintended consequence of the macroprudential regime.  It is very important that we have this policy framework in place but there are ways in which we can tweak this to ensure we take into account where is the market.</p></speech>

In research across various jurisdictions, we considered what policy measures had been used to stimulate housing supply.  A site tax was used in the Danish case and seemed to yield quite significant results.</p> <p>  There are a number of ways in which this can operate.  If there is a site tax and people hoard land, they might face the prospect of paying a 2%, 3% or 4% levy, which would encourage them to bring the land on-stream.  Related to this, if developers are asked about a breakdown of cost, they will all mention that land costs are quite expensive and constitute a certain proportion of the total.  Part of the reason land costs are so expensive relates to the speculative element.  If a person is holding land and believes it will be worth 10% or 15% more next year, it drives up the price and people tend to hold on to or hoard the land as a result.  That drives up the cost for somebody trying to develop the land.  If there is a site tax, which is properly parameterised and implemented, it should cut out much of the speculation on land, which would in turn drive down the cost of the land and building a house.  The site tax has much potential and it could be very influential.</p></speech>

I have been in discussions and some people have said that in doing this sort of measure, the argument is that people must be given time to adjust to the new tax proposal.  A former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, was involved in an argument regarding the constitutionality or otherwise of certain elements.  Mr. Edmund Honohan made the point that in Ireland we have compulsory purchase orders and a legal understanding that if a social good dominates a private interest, the State can do certain things.  I raise this so if we discuss the proposal and somebody argues it is not legally feasible, I would interrogate that a little further.</p></speech>

My next question relates to the comments relating to labour supply.  The witnesses touched on the child care subsidies and I am definitely interested in hearing more about that.  Certainly, some of their research suggests that the recession hit women quite hard, with participation rates down for the first time in years.  Child care is an issue for both men and women but it would be considered an obstacle more for women entering or re-entering the workplace.  The point was made in the paper that it is not just about income tax acting as a disincentive, as there is also the cost of going back to work.  It may not be cost-effective to have two parents working.</p> <p>  I would like to hear views on the gender pay gap.  Sometimes women may be penalised as they are seen as the primary caregiver.  Taking the burden and distributing it more evenly across both parents would probably work towards addressing the gender pay gap.  I would be very interested to hear what we could do in budget 2017 and the following year in terms of a child care subsidy.  Are there any other suggestions or views on how to address the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.86" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#K00800"><p>Child care subsidies are a fascinating area.  It is unusual to have an area where one can simultaneously achieve a range of policy goals.  I will develop that theme slightly.  The Deputy began by addressing the labour supply dimensions of this, which is correct.  There is evidence to suggest that the cost of child care is genuinely an obstacle to people's participation in the labour force.  Coming back to an earlier theme, one could abolish or reduce the universal social charge for everybody in a phenomenally expensive way and there will be a limited labour supply effect.  With something like child care subsidies, the issue around labour supply is seeing a much more targeted focused, with euro or tax dollars being used to try to alleviate a particular difficulty.  Doing something really substantial on child care will have an impact on labour supply.</p><p> The Deputy touched on the gender pay gap which leads to the next possible benefit.  Research going back years from many jurisdictions shows that by far the dominant reason for the gender pay gap is the fact that women interrupt their careers.  Judging by their reaction, members probably did not need an economist to tell them that.  We added the science to the gut feeling that was there.  It is not just women.  For people who are unemployed for significant periods, the same effect happens.  They come back into the labour market.  They do not even go back to where they were, they often go down and certainly never get back to where they would have been if they had an uninterrupted career trajectory.  If one examines the data and accounts for those career breaks, statistically one eliminates the gender pay gap.  It really is all about breaks in careers.  To the extent that this is a critical dimension in interrupted female careers, child care subsidies allow one to do much on the equality agenda.  It is unusual that there is a labour supply effect - which is a real economist&rsquo;s efficiency effect - and that there is also an equality effect.  There is this tremendous benefit for kids, on the assumption that it is good quality child care.  I am conscious that the economic evidence was dismissed earlier on.  However, if there is one area where economists have done evaluation after evaluation, the benefits of quality early child interventions are extraordinary.</p></speech>

The tax system, through individualisation, very much steers people towards working and two incomes.  I agree it should be left to the mother or father.  Why would we make that decision for some parents who may have a different view?</p></speech>

If I choose to take a career break, I personally believe it is reasonable that I am not going to be paid during the relevant period.  Taking a standard depreciation model if one is not using one&rsquo;s skills and the world of work develops, one&rsquo;s skills can deteriorate.  If I go back into the labour market after a certain period, if my productivity is lower than where it otherwise would have been and if I suffer a pay penalty as a result of my time out, then that is my choice.  I am not sure whether we have to pay people to adjust for the fact they took time off.  That is getting philosophical, however.  We can come back to it.</p></speech>

It is a slightly different issue from unemployment.  Many countries have many unemployed people.  The Irish figures in that respect are not that different.  The 8% unemployment rate is not out of line.  However, we have much higher proportion of households where nobody is working.  Very often, these are households with a disabled person or lone parent.  There is a real sense that part of the explanation of the high rate of lone parent joblessness is, again, the child care issue.  I have mentioned a whole slew of factors as to why good quality child care interventions can be positive.</p></speech>

The argument was should one discriminate against people who choose to stay at home versus those who choose to go to work.  Then the question was should child care be subsidised through the income tax system.  That became quite controversial because the argument was one could only benefit from it if one was going to work.  However, if one chose to stay at home, one could not benefit from it.  A child care subsidy which is a direct payment, regardless of whether one is going to work or not, would be somewhat more neutral.</p> <p>  Research was published last week in University College Cork on whether kids who stay at home with their parents do better.  Several months ago, the ESRI, using the growing up in Ireland data, did a study on whether there was any difference in the cognitive development of kids in cr&egrave;ches versus those at home.  The answer was &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  In the case of immigrant kids, they actually did better if they had been in cr&egrave;ches.  I remember when my colleagues brought this report to my desk, I said of all the ESRI reports, this did more for the guilt consciences of Irish parents than anything else.  I am not sure whether we put that on the press release.  For every parent putting their kid in a cr&egrave;che and worried they were doing irreparable damage, the answer from an ESRI study was "No".</p></speech>

Accordingly, it removes choice.  It effectively removes the woman from the workplace without her having a choice.  I was happy to hear the positive impacts across the board this one policy could have.</p> <p>  On regional disparities in rising employment rates, the west is the slowest to improve.  It would be helpful if the delegation could pass on information as to how the committee could address this in budget 2017.</p> <p>  Yesterday at the committee, the Central Bank was reluctant to comment on whether the tax base is broad enough, too narrow or okay as it stands.  While it claimed it was not within its remit, it was pointed out that, as it poses a risk to our economy, it is within its remit.  Nonetheless, we did not progress on getting an answer from that.  Is our tax base broad enough?  Is it robust enough to deal with another hit such as Brexit, the Apple tax finding or problems with the Chinese or US economies?  There are many international pressures bubbling away over which we have no control.  What we can control is our stability and putting in place enough buffers to ensure our tax base is secure enough.  Is there anything we can do in this year&rsquo;s budget to strengthen the tax base?</p></speech>

Recently, we looked at the responsiveness of income tax to overall economic activity.  I have been involved in other research with an international colleague examining the main headings of taxation receipts such as income tax, corporation tax and excise.  We examined what is the most stable outcome when one works out the variances between them.  Income tax in an Irish context is a stable source of tax, an area that Patrick Honohan examined several years ago.  Consequently, it is seriously considered whether to reduce it in budgets.  Over the past several years, corporation tax has surged.</p><p>One point I would make about corporation tax, and many officials in the Department of Finance also like to make this point, is that it gets a huge amount of attention and while there are many good reasons for this, it only counts for, on average, 12% of the tax take whereas income tax accounts for around 40% and VAT for 29%.  While corporation tax is important, it is not massively important in comparison with other taxation headings.  Interestingly, the real problems we encountered back in 2007 and 2008 were not as a result of a collapse in corporation taxes but a collapse in the housing related taxes and in income tax.</p><p> In the recent past, corporation taxes surged quite significantly.  There was a considerable surge last year and the receipts up to July of this year indicate another substantial increase in corporation tax.  However, that comes with quite an amount of uncertainty in that we do not really have a good understanding of how stable those tax receipts are.  Is it the case that we may witness a dramatic fall off in corporation tax next year for some reason?  We do not know.  Corporation tax receipts are not as closely aligned to what is going on in the real economy as the other taxation headings like VAT and income tax.  That supports the argument for maintaining a very broad tax base, as the Deputy has said, and ensuring that taxes like income tax remain a significant component of the overall tax take into the future.</p></speech>

That said, given where we are in terms of the international uncertainties to which the Deputy referred, our perspective would be that it does not make sense to do anything at this point that would weaken the tax base.  Hence, the remarks on the USC in particular.  To add to that, if one takes the recent experience of trying to introduce water charges and before that, the local property tax, LPT, the lesson to be learned is that there is a difficulty with introducing new taxation measures.  Therefore, if one has measures already in place that people have become used to, while not necessarily liking them, why would one unwind them if one was facing the prospect in a few year's time of having to try to reimplement certain measures?  With the greatest respect to everyone in the room, we all agree that these things are tremendously difficult.  I was struck by the thought that perhaps in a year's time a variety of people in this room could be coalition partners trying to negotiate budgetary packages in the wake of some international crisis and it would be terribly unfortunate if the tax base had been hollowed out in the interim.</p> <p>  On the issue of regional development and what can be done in budget 2017 in this area, I would urge the committee to think about this in a much more long-term way.  We have touched on this already in terms of capital investment and the need to think about it in an integrated way.  Dr. McQuinn mentioned the fact that the Department of housing, planning, community and local government is working on a national planning framework that will replace the national spatial strategy.  We must think about these things in a longer-term context.  The harsh reality of modern economic development is that it is focused in larger urban areas.  Very often regional development is a fight against natural economic processes and has to be seen in that way.  Doing anything about that and trying to reorganise the pattern of economic development will require some of the investment we have spoken about but we need medium-term strategies to make sure it will happen.</p></speech>

Some of the research that we undertook as part of this programme with the Department of Finance updated earlier research that I had done with a colleague in the Central Bank looking at the impact of the housing market on the taxation take.  In particular, the research looked at the impact of disequilibrium or the excesses in the property market - the excess supply that we witnessed, the huge increases in price and so forth - on our tax take.  The key taxation headings were stamp duties, VAT and income tax.  The objective was to quantify the impact of the disequilibrium in the property market on the overall collapse in taxes that occurred.  There are obvious lessons to be learned in terms of ensuring the stability of the taxation system going forward.</p> <p>  In terms of our earlier discussion, this is where the macro-prudential approach comes in.  It is there as a safeguard to ensure that we do not let the kinds of excesses which built up in the banking sector and then spilled over into the real economy and the housing market and eroded our tax base happen again.  It is that kind of overview and the nexus between fiscal stability and ensuring the tax base is solid, combined with financial stability and ensuring that there are no excesses in the credit markets, which is all part of keeping the tax system on a stable footing.</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to give their views on the delays in the roll-out of broadband, particularly to rural areas.  How important is broadband provision in terms of productive infrastructure, attracting investment and growing our economy?  Should we be investing more in it now?  How critical is broadband provision and how damaging is the delay in its roll-out?</p></speech>

However, I would say that research conducted by colleagues has shown that broadband in and of itself will not be the panacea for regional difficulties.  One also needs things like high educational attainment in certain areas and so on.  It is an issue that needs to be looked at in a slightly more-----</p></speech>

Just to complement that remark, broadband has been increasingly described as something akin to a human right.  There is a social dimension to it.  In terms of connecting and participating in the modern world, we are almost at the point where decent broadband access is required.  Increasingly, this can be seen as a social issue rather than purely an issue of economic development.</p></speech>

I do not want to get too involved in an historical debate but the "lessons" of 2008 have been referenced on a number of occasions, particularly the importance of having a sustainable tax base.  I would like to point out that it was not just the collapse in the construction industry that was a factor, although the witnesses are absolutely correct to point to that, but also the fact that in that very year, the Government made a ruling which allowed corporations that did not see a drop in profits to write off an extra &euro;15 billion to &euro;20 billion as so-called charges.  That was done in 2008 as a result of the tax ruling in 2007.  In a year when everyone else was being creamed and we saw a drop in tax revenue under the corporate tax heading, we gave an extra &euro;15 billion to &euro;20 billion to you-know-who in write-offs.  We have been talking about the importance of ensuring the stability of tax revenues but an important element of the discussion that is missing is that we must make people pay their taxes.  The Government was very happy to chase people for property tax and water charges but was doing deals with other guys.</p><p>That has to be referenced, particularly if we are talking about the lessons of 2007 and 2008.</p><p> That brings me to my question to Professor Barrett.  This will be my narrative for the budget.  What about some wealth redistribution?  I wonder if that is on the ESRI's radar in looking at the macroeconomic situation in this country and having stability and sustainability going forward.  Is redistribution of wealth, in Professor Barrett's opinion, a priority?  I argue that it should be.  In the 1970s people used to talk a lot about this stuff but they do not talk about the redistribution of wealth anymore and that, in fact, is what a tax system is for.  The real lesson of 2007-2008 and the global economic collapse and the real explanation underlying the incredible volatility in the world economy today generally is the inequality in the distribution of wealth.  It should actually be a macroeconomic imperative.  I would like Professor Barrett to comment on that.</p><p> When one looks through the figures, what one will find is that as a result of the recession the concentration of wealth in Ireland has massively increased in the hands of a small group.  That is what tends to happen in recessions.  At the end of the recession, a smaller group at the top has ended up with more.  We see it in spades with property.  What was already a highly concentrated control of the property market in relatively few hands pre-2008 has now become even more concentrated as a result of the recession.  We see a small number of survivors and the vulture funds coming in and buying it all up and then effectively controlling the property rental market.  That is a central question for me.  Should we not be talking about, as a priority in this budget and budgets generally, the necessity of redistributing wealth?</p><p> That then brings us on to things that do not get talked about except by us which is wealth taxes and having a database of the distribution of wealth, a proper database that identifies where wealth is in the country, who has it, how concentrated it is and the trends in the concentration and distribution of wealth.  We need that kind of stuff.  When we are talking about tax, instead of having this artificial public-private nonsense, which Professor Barrett alluded to, we need to think far more about low, middle and high.  That is what we should be thinking about in terms of tax.  That should be the informing logic of looking at the USC.  The people on the low and middle incomes do not need to be taxed any more.  They are struggling and they cannot pay their rent or bills.  They deserve relief.  It would be obscene to give relief to people earning in excess of &euro;70,000 or &euro;100,000.  Should we not start talking about that?</p><p> Those are my questions.  Following the same trend of thought, I have a question specifically on the issue of housing.  The witnesses seem to be saying this but I want them to be explicit on it.  The mantra has been that if we increase supply, it will resolve some of the problems.  Is it not the case that we had massive supply pre-2008 and it did not solve housing problems at all?  We still had a massive housing crisis back then.  It got worse afterwards.  Housing lists increased consistently every year in the pre-2007 period.  Rents and property prices were very high even though there was an oversupply.  When I hear, as is the current Government policy, that what we need to do is incentivise private developers again to deliver social housing, I just ask whether they are absolutely bonkers.  We did that and it did not reduce property prices, reduce rents or deliver housing to those on low incomes.  Why would it do it now?  That raises the question of the State filling that gap.  The market is failing, but even if it is functioning, in the recent past it has demonstrated its incapacity to deliver to certain sectors of society.  We have to talk about the State filling that gap.  It is an old fashioned 1970s idea but it worked back in the 1960s and 1970s.  The State provided the not-for-profit housing because the profit sector was not going to provide it.  Is that not the lesson that we can draw both from the 2007-2008 period and also from the fact that we have pursued this policy for at least the tenure of this Government?  It has been trying to incentivise the private sector to deliver affordable housing but it has not.  The latest figures bear that out.  It is worse now.</p></speech>

The ESRI does this probably more than any other group in the country.  I have spoken before in this committee about the SWITCH model, which does all the distribution analysis around the budgets, but the programme of research is much broader than that.  Just to remind members, we are the Economic and Social Research Institute, and while the "S" is smaller relative to the "E", for many years there has been a very strong strand of social research within the institute.  Only this week a paper came across my desk looking at social class, social risk and issues around quality of life, looking across different groups and, for example, looking at inequality beyond issues just related to income.  It addresses the impacts of those income inequalities on issues such as mental strain, perceptions of quality of life and all these sorts of things.  The institute is very deeply involved in these sorts of issues.  That is correct - it is what we should be doing.  We should not be saying what the distribution of income should be but should be providing the information as to precisely what it is.  I can absolutely stand over this sort of claim.  We know more about inequalities in Ireland as a result of ESRI research going back over the past 30 years.  I may have said before to this committee or its predecessor that nobody was measuring the rate of poverty in Ireland before the ESRI started in 1989.  A huge volume of research has been carried out since then.</p></speech>

He says it is not the ESRI's job to give an opinion on wealth distribution and I accept the point that it tries to put together figures.  However, when it becomes a macroeconomic problem and threat, does Professor Barrett accept the argument, which has been put forward by people on the left, most notably by Thomas Piketty, that it is the central danger and that where there is a very unequal distribution of wealth and a growing inequality in it, it poses a sort of existential threat to the sustainability and stability of an economy?</p></speech>

I would come at it from two angles.  One is inequality at a point in time and the extent to which in a very unequal society there is support for the institutions of the State and the way the whole thing hangs together.  There is that dimension.  To return to our earlier discussion of child care, social exclusion, poverty and those things exclude a group of very bright and able people from full participation in the economy.  This was put most starkly in a comment on South Africa that one of its great tragedies is that if an entire population is kept down, an Einstein or Beethoven might be lost.  That is probably an excessive example.  If there is a society where a particularly large group of people is excluded, the dynamism of that group will be lost.</p><p>In those two respects, I agree that inequality is damaging to society.  It is becoming an increasing feature of most OECD societies, not just in Ireland.  There is no disagreement between us on that point.</p></speech>

Professor Barrett alluded to measuring poverty in 1989.  A part of the problem is that there was no wealth survey of the economy until recently, when the Household Finance and Consumption Survey, which was funded by the Central Bank, was published a little over a year ago by the Central Statistics Office.  A part of our body of work with the Department of Finance involves examining that and the question of wealth taxes.  Research will be forthcoming on the issue in the next three to four months.  That will be interesting.  If one is not measuring or estimating these factors, one cannot examine redistribution and its effects.  I am sympathetic to the Piketty and Stiglitz perspective on this, namely, that inequality itself could be an engine of a lack of growth in an economy.</p> <p>  Regarding the overall point of view, we published a paper last year that critiqued European fiscal policy since the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, in particular since 2010.  One does not need a radical perspective to grasp the simple and mainstream economic principle that one should stimulate activity when economies underperform and remove pressure when they overheat.  If so and in my opinion and that of many economists, what the appropriate fiscal response to the financial crisis should have been was clear.  When economies are running large and negative output gaps by general acceptance, there are large elements of debt in the banking and household sectors and the private sector is essentially on its knees, there are compelling reasons for a government to intervene and provide a stimulus and aggregate demand.  This was a major policy failure in the overall response of the EU institutions.  It has led to turmoil in Greece and elsewhere where the outcomes are far from the original ideals of the European project.  This is taking a mainstream economic perspective on the issue.  All of this stresses the importance of having reliable and credible data sets that can be used to analyse and address these issues.</p> <p>  The distributional aspect of the crisis is interesting.  It has been addressed in a number of ESRI papers, but we have mainly considered it from an income perspective because of the absence of a wealth survey.  With the property-related impacts, it is an interesting issue, but it has never really been analysed.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a valid point about housing.  Until 2007, Ireland was in a unique situation, in that prices and supply raged ahead.  This was down to a number of reasons, but it mainly owed to a massive credit bubble in the economy.  It led to the highly unusual situation of both prices and supply going off the scale and in turn fed property speculation, which was a key reason for the bizarre outcome.</p> <p>  From our analysis, it is clear on the basis of household formation and likely demographic movements that we need somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000 new houses per annum.  One must accept that it is both a private and a public issue.  The public sector cannot provide all of that housing, but there must be a strong Government involvement in providing social housing.  I have articulated why I believe this to be important in terms of-----</p></speech>

If I understood Professor Barrett correctly, he stated that we should exploit a possible flexibility in the fiscal rules around capital investment in housing.  I agree with that, as it is logical.  Will Professor Barrett comment on what he believes is the situation?  Are the rules open to that flexibility?  Can we make an argument that would get a hearing to the effect that we should be allowed to borrow money for direct investment in housing and other key infrastructure without breaching the rules?  When we argue that there should be direct State investment, the Government tells us that there must be public-private partnerships, PPPs, and that everything is being slowed down because it must do things for the private sector or else breach the rules.  This is an important question and I would like Professor Barrett's opinion on it.</p> <p>  Will Professor Barrett comment on the fact that 85% of the housing plan is based on PPPs, with the private sector building and the State leasing from it?  That seems more expensive for the State.  Also, it would be more difficult for the State to make an argument to the EU that we should be allowed to breach the fiscal rules because PPPs would not generate a return to the State in the same way that direct investment would.  The Government might leverage some extra money from the private sector up front, but the longer term return to the State is not guaranteed because the buildings are in the hands of the private sector.  Does Professor Barrett know what I mean?  I do not know whether I am explaining it fully.  Since everything will be leased, our capital stock will not increase.  The housing will be built, owned and managed by the private sector but leased to local authorities.</p></speech>

The answer I was given was along the lines that, if member states submitted expenditure or other policy proposals and made real cases that the effect of the proposals would be to increase the productive capacity of their economies, there would be room for some flexibility.  I do not know whether that has been attempted or anyone has been successful.  At one level, that is a good thing.  We might grump and complain about the fiscal rules, but having an infrastructure to control the excesses of the past is good.  However, if one decides that capital expenditure can be exempt, could one make the case that paying teachers more was a capital investment because better people would enter teaching?  One can imagine the crazy arguments that would be made.  If reasonable proposals are presented to the Commission and it reflects reasonably on them, though, my understanding is that there is scope for flexibility.  From an economics perspective, the notion of borrowing for productive purposes is in no way controversial.  It is exactly what one should be doing, especially when interest rates are where they are now.</p> <p>  I am not sure that I am qualified to comment on the broader issues.  Does Dr. McQuinn wish to try?</p></speech>

We have made suggestions of greater investment in and provision of social housing.  The model that has been used - the 10% rule - is generally conditional on a certain amount of construction taking place.  One will only get 10% of whatever is built.  In terms of the rule, one needs to get 7% or 8% of actual construction.  When there is no construction in the economy, one is getting 10% of nothing.  Given the state of the housing market and, in particular, the provision of social housing, one needs to consider the model that existed in the 2000s.  Even after the crisis, we were still building 3,500 or 4,000 social houses, even if that did not meet the requirement.  In 2012, 2013 and 2014, we only built a fraction of that.</p></speech>

If one has that sort of data and one can do the calculations, one can then make the estimate to which I have referred, at which point practically all the wage gap disappears.</p></speech>

Maybe that is not a suitable question for this committee.  I am always making the point that the woman is generally considered, rightly or wrongly, to be a greater risk to the employer.  It is believed that as women - unlike men - can get pregnant, they are more likely to leave the workforce and thereby affect the flow of the company's business.  Have Professor Barrett and his colleagues done any work on that aspect of the matter?</p></speech>

We have not done it in a direct way.  The research I am talking about can be interpreted along certain lines.  If one looks at the average man and the average woman, one will see a pay gap.  When one starts trying to account for reasons for these salary differences by adding in various issues, that gap shrinks and shrinks.  It was always argued that if one found a gap one could not explain, one had evidence that discrimination of some sort was occurring.  The research we did basically showed us that the gap really diminishes.  There may well be discrimination - I do not want to be overly simplistic on that - but we did not find in the data evidence of the type of discrimination the Deputy is talking about.  The wage gap really disappeared when we controlled for various sorts of things.  It is important to stress that when one is doing economic research, one's failure to find something does not mean it is not there.  We did not find evidence of this, but it is a completely different step to say it does not exist.  I have answered the Deputy's question in two ways.</p></speech>

Does Professor Barrett have graphs showing the distribution of pay between men and women as they move up the pay scales?  Does he have such data?  When we are looking at various things like reducing tax or tweaking the USC, is there a way of targeting specific groups of people who for some reason are being discriminated against, for want of a better word?

I am getting wise now that Deputy Lisa Chambers has accepted the paper on child care subsidies.  I am going to be really cautious in responding to Deputy O'Connell.  I emphasise that all of this is complicated.  Here is the deal about the data that exists.  We have data on earnings by gender.  A colleague of ours at the institute who is currently on secondment to the OECD compiled a paper that looked at the gender impact of austerity measures.  One needs to apply a range of assumptions to this.  She was able to conduct a study that showed how various things affected various people.  The fact that she did this suggests to me in principle that the type of analysis the Deputy is talking about can be done, but it is complicated and would take a certain amount of time.</p></speech>

Reference has been made to a real growth rate of 5%.  We often used to hear officials from various Government Departments saying that Sweden spent various percentages of its GDP on child care and health, etc.  Can we make the assumption that all of this was wrong?  If the GDP figures were not necessarily right, can it be said that our goal of striving to be more like other countries was based on looking at bad data?</p></speech>

We will park the 26% figure that came up this year and come back to it.  At an earlier time, we knew what our GNP and GDP figures told us.  We knew what they meant.  Irish officials always argued that when we were looking at percentages - for example, how much we were spending on social welfare - we should look at the GNP figure because that related more to what was actually available to the Government.  GDP was always bigger, but much of it was about profit repatriation.  Officials strongly argued that we should always look at GNP.  When I was on the fiscal council, we took a slightly different perspective, which was that it was too big to say it should be either one or the other.  We came up with a hybrid calculation.  It was not quite halfway between the two, but one could use a bit of science to work out what sort of weighting was used.  The argument was that GDP was relevant to these sorts of things because some of it was taxable.  While historically there might have been a bit of controversy about the argument between GNP and GDP, we knew what we were getting at, broadly speaking.</p></speech>

I do not want to waste their time.  Is any other country in the OECD modifying or making up a new algorithm or sum?  Is Ireland the only country doing this?  I am sure outside companies that are investing in Ireland, and putting their trust in Ireland as a country, look at all the data.  Will it not look really bad that we have our own secret data, or our own sum, for the GDP?  Will it not look ridiculous if we are in our own little part of the table that shows how countries are performing?  Will companies not be concerned about whether they can believe anything we say?  I am concerned from an investment point of view about how it might look if we are making up new sums specifically for Ireland.</p></speech>

Regarding the issues with GDP and the national accounts, I suppose it is fair to say that the new standards or accounting criteria - the ESA 2010 framework - did not really come in until approximately two years ago.  As Professor Barrett has said, there have been long-standing issues with looking at the Irish national accounts.  Our former colleague, Professor John FitzGerald, recently wrote a paper chronicling most of the various issues that typically affect our accounts.  We are particularly vulnerable because we have a small open economy, we have relatively low corporation tax and we have a great deal of inward foreign direct investment and multinational activity.  As a result, we are particularly sensitive to some of these national accounting issues.  Without going into the actual technical detail, the main reason we have many of these problems is the changed way EUROSTAT looks at these national accounting issues - the way it views whether a firm is resident in or owned in a country and whether its activity takes place in that country - following the introduction of ESA 2010.</p> <p>  I would like to respond to the Deputy's question about the effect on investor sentiment of having a rival GDP series by asking her to imagine what would transpire if the opposite had happened and the official GDP figure had fallen by 26% because of some multinational activity.  While it can be presumed that everyone would know that the Irish economy had not fallen off the edge of a cliff, the tickertape on Bloomberg would still be saying "Irish GDP down by 26%".  One of the effects of the release of such results could be Ireland staying at the centre of international news for a couple of days.  It is very important that we have something like this for GDP, in particular, because GDP is central to things like the debt-GDP measurement used by the Commission as part of the fiscal rules.  It is part of the official Estimates and is used to calculate the output gap.  It is important that we have some idea of output in the economy that reflects what is actually going on in the economy.  We typically go beyond it in our overall assessments of the economy by looking at issues like what is going on in the labour market, in the tax take and in consumption.  Such measurements are specifically tied to activity in the Irish economy and, apart from corporation tax receipts, are less influenced by developments in the multinational sector.</p></speech>

Professor Barrett said earlier that this would negate the need for tax incentives for pensions.  In that regard, is he suggesting that a limit be imposed on how much money people can save in their pensions?  Ordinarily, people in the private sector put sufficient money into their pensions to cater for their needs as they get older.  Is Professor Barrett suggesting that everybody should get the same pension such that there is no incentive for people to save additional money?  It may be that Professor Barrett was only speaking off the cuff and has not developed the idea, but perhaps he would elaborate on it, including how it might work in terms of the public sector pension levy.</p></speech>

If a basic earnings-related mandatory scheme was introduced, utilising payments from the USC to do that, there would be no need for incentives.  There is no need to incentivise things that are mandatory.  That does not make sense.  The Deputy might say that the State should, perhaps, be subsidising schemes, but that is a different conceptualisation.  The current tax arrangement is to incentivise, but if a scheme is mandatory there is no need to incentivise.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what would be the position if people wanted to put more into their pensions.  The core argument is that if people want to put more in that is up to them, but why would the State be subsidising people putting more into a pension pot?  It is a bit like a whole range of things in life in that beyond a certain point people can do what they want but they do not need the State to subsidise.  </p> <p>  On the PRD, one could imagine a situation in which the public sector arrangement were aligned with the private sector arrangement.  This issue was discussed at the National Economic Dialogue.  The concern for the officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would be whether what is being proposed is a defined benefit or defined contribution system, because there is real concern that the State is building up huge exposure in this area.  These are issues that can be fleshed out.  People other than me have thought about these matters at considerable length.  I wrote it up because I think it is an interesting idea.  If there is a real move towards a reduction in USC, it is interesting to add this additional policy consideration.</p></speech>

I am sure that working that one out will keep somebody occupied for the next year.</p></speech>

It is a pity other Deputies are not here, because this discussion makes us sound socially aware and conscious.  We are always eager to do as much as we possibly can.  One of the big issues for people in defined contribution schemes, apart from inadequacy and non-coverage, is the instability of not knowing what sort of pension pot they will have.  In terms of what the State should be doing for its citizens at the most basic level, to the extent that the State can guarantee financial stability in a way that private companies cannot - because, obviously, the State goes on forever and it has a much bigger borrowing capacity and so on - I believe the State is in a position, if it does not go completely down the defined benefit route, to have a hybrid of defined benefit and defined contribution which would provide a level of financial security that a private system is probably never going to be able to provide.  This is another argument for thinking in terms of a publicly based earnings-related system.</p></speech>

I would like to make one comment and ask one brief question.  In regard to Professor McQuinn's point on the counter-cyclical tweaking of macro-prudential models for the Central Bank, I have two slight concerns: first, how would that work in a situation where, say, there is a three- or four-year lag in the housing market, and, second, if based on a metric of how many houses were being built?  Surely there is also a metric for second-hand houses.  It is not the case that we have a new housing market that is separate to the second-hand housing market.  It is all the one market.  I am nervous about the use of that as an indicator.</p> <p>  It was also suggested that price levels might be used as an indicator.  What price would be used and would the price in one part of the country versus another be different?  My own constituency would have different circumstances from Deputy Chambers's constituency in terms of pricing.  I would be nervous that that type of tweaking could lead us back to the situation that prevailed in 2003, 2004 and 2005.  I make that comment to provoke thought.</p> <p>  I will now come to my question.  Do the witnesses think we are doing enough on climate action and, depending on their thoughts in that regard, are there any budgetary implications?</p></speech>

I am a member of the climate change advisory council in an <i>ex officio</i>capacity.  There are four heads of State agencies represented on the council.  I should preface my remarks by saying that I am not speaking on behalf of the climate change council.  My view is personal, although it may reflect the position of some of my colleagues.  When people think about climate change they very often think in terms of State subsidisation - in other words, what will the State have to pay to assist people.  The real economics argument is that a huge amount can be achieved through tax system measures such as carbon taxes and so on, and that leads to a double win.  In other words, it creates a revenue stream and at the same time leads to the type of environmental outcomes sought.  That is something I would be enormously sympathetic towards.  I believe it allows for the possibility of moving us in the direction that we need to go.<br/><br/>On the distribution point, the counter-argument to that sort of approach is very often that measures such as carbon taxes are highly regressive, which is true, but again, as colleagues in the ESRI and elsewhere have argued, this is rebalanced by the welfare system.  It is almost in the direction of the hypothecated taxes about which we were speaking earlier.  These measures are brought in and they do raise difficulties for certain people.  The revenue should be moved in such a way as to alleviate the difficulties while incentivising good climate behaviour.</p></speech>

The Paris Accord - which I presume Europe is going to sign, or else we are just pirates - involves changing our entire energy, transport, food and built environment systems over two, three or four decades.  It is change of a scale that dwarfs the changes made from the 1960s up to now in terms of the move to a sustainable economy.  The view of the civil servant is that this will require great change.  Changes to tax measures change stuff on the margin and not the entire system.  I know from experience that political favour for introducing new taxes is not that easy.  The political odds of our being able to put in place a carbon tax to achieve the extent of change within the required timeframe is zero.  Are we doing enough?</p></speech>

I confess that this is not an area about which I know a huge amount.  One sometimes attends a committee meeting from which one learns more than one contributes, which was my experience in the early days of this committee.  The scale of the challenge is something that people generally are not aware of.  I am speaking in that regard of the scale of the challenge related to the measures we sign up to rather than to any notional challenge.  There is a rude awakening coming down the line.  I share Deputy Ryan's perception of the political difficulties but I do not necessarily share his pessimism about the possible power of significant price signals.  The answer perhaps is that they would have to be pretty significant price signals to get the sort of actions that are needed, which probably supports the Deputy's point on political acceptability.</p></speech>

A similar comment was made when the measures we suggested were being implemented.</p><p>If one thinks of it in broad terms, however, it is somewhat defeatist to say we cannot measure these things or that they are too difficult to measure and we should, therefore, shy away from going down that avenue.  We can point to a great deal of research, for instance, which shows clearly that some of the models we use would have highlighted in advance difficulties that were coming in the property market, including over-valuation of house prices.  Those are on record and can be seen.  More broadly - again, as I said earlier, it is just making the comparison between macro-prudential policy and something like monetary policy - the argument falls down a little in the following sense.  When the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Lane, or whoever is going over to Frankfurt for the monetary policy decision, he is confronted with a huge amount of data and analysis on where the European economy is at any particular point in time.  Those data and analyses are then used to underpin the monetary policy decision that is reached.  However, if one thinks about it, that is basically assessing the overall performance of the economy.  Within the overall performance of the economy is, of course, the performance of the housing sector.  By definition, if we are saying that what goes on in the housing sector is too difficult to analyse or too difficult to estimate or pin down, one could equally say that is a problem that should confront people who are looking at the broader issue of monetary policy or fiscal policy.</p></speech>

I am just going to ask one question and if it has already been covered, I am happy to withdraw it and take a look at the transcripts.  I thank both the witnesses.  My question is on the quantum of the tax base.  I do not expect the witnesses to make any political judgments but I would like an economic view if they feel they can give one.  There is a debate going on about whether taxes should be cut, kept broadly where they are or raised.  As far as I can see, we are heading towards an ill-advised erosion of USC, which is efficient, highly progressive and brings in a lot of much-needed money.  However, a sort of stealth tax will result from not indexing income taxes.  That will, in essence, raise tax in other areas.  How it all balances out, I am not quite sure.  I note to the Chairman that it would be quite interesting to see if the committee could get some analysis on that.  If USC goes down, as it appears the Government will propose, tax will go up in other areas if the indexation the ESRI has referenced does not happen.  It would be interesting to see how that all balances out.  I am not sure if it would be the ESRI or some other body that would do it, but it would be useful analysis to have.  My question, however, is really more around judgment.  I am of the view that we should not erode the tax base either in terms of its breadth or the total quantum.  The reason is that, when I look at other European countries which are broadly social democratic, we appear on aggregate to have significantly less tax take to a few percentage points and significantly less investment in public services, social infrastructure, capital and so forth.  Regardless of whether USC or income tax should be touched or whatever the right mix of those things is, can the witnesses give the committee a view as to whether the level of taxation it looks like we are moving towards, according to the broad outline of what is going to come up in the budget, will be enough to maintain and progress public services and investment in productive capital infrastructure?  There are lots of places where we could become more efficient in our spending, such as health care.  It may be that the answer is that we have enough taxation coming in for health care and the issue is better spending of the money.  However, my question is about the position in the round and bringing it all together to allow Ireland to progress to having sufficient broadband, infrastructure and public services while taking into account socio-demographic pressures.  For example, good-quality health care is becoming more expensive per person as we live longer.  Perhaps really high-quality education is becoming more expensive.  It may be that in terms of getting back to reasonable levels of third level performance, we are &euro;1 billion behind.  There are lots of different elements to this.  Can the witnesses at this point give the committee a view as to whether we have enough coming in, putting ideology and political considerations aside, to allow really good-quality public services, social protection regimes and all the things for which we use our taxes?  Is more coming in than we need, and can we pull back if we become better at spending the money, or should we be looking at having a conversation about increasing the total tax base by a material amount as we think about the next three, five or ten years in order to move from what appear to be strained public services and under-investment in capital to adequate levels of those things?</p></speech>

I do not want to call it an ESRI position, but a personal position which I think Dr. McQuinn shares is that it is unwise to reduce taxes at this moment.  One can try to frame it in the context of revenues and expenditures this year and the balance between them, but we are taking a slightly longer-term perspective.  In this, we are very much in line with the Fiscal Advisory Council.  If one looks down the road, the pressures on public finances and public expenditure are only going in one direction.  In comments earlier, we talked about the recent experience of raising revenue and just how difficult it is, which suggests that it would be most unwise to take away revenues which are currently flowing in.  Nobody likes paying USC or anything, but there is a level of acceptance.  It does not make sense to me - and there is an element of political economy in this - to hollow out a particular base when one absolutely knows that in the coming years one will have to raise revenues again even to maintain services at their current level.  It strikes us as a bad idea to reduce the aggregate tax take, even before one gets into the issues Deputy Donnelly raises as to whether we need better-quality public services immediately, which case one can certainly make across a whole range of areas and whatever about tweaking within the total quantum.  We made the point in our opening statement and we have elaborated on that through questions.</p></speech>

I take his point on the political economy, which is to say "For goodness sake, do not give it away."  Behavioural economics suggests that it is five times harder to put it back in again.  I fully agree on that.  Putting aside the political difficulty of raising taxes, does Ireland, in the opinion of the witnesses, need a higher quantum of taxation than it currently has to provide good-quality services and investment?  I am not talking about the best, most expensive stuff in the world.</p></speech>

Assuming our current quantum of taxes funds our current level of public services and capital investment, do we currently have under-investment in aggregate?</p><p>Do we currently have under investment in aggregate?  Maybe Professor Barrett believes we invest too much in one area or other but, in aggregate, do we have approximately the correct level of investment, too much investment or too little investment in public services and in capital at present?</p></speech>

We touched on this in some of the discussion earlier.  There is the historic lesson here that in the 1980s we cut back quite dramatically on the public capital programme.  When growth really came to Ireland in the 1990s, the emergence of the bottlenecks and all such difficulties was quick and then there was a period of time where we were playing catch-up.  In general, a smoother approach to this is fairly critical.  One need not cite a significant amount of evidence.  Obviously, the housing issue is quite acute.  We made the point on earlier questions that investment in housing is not only about housing as water and roads infrastructure goes with it.  There is a collection of infrastructural needs that must interact to achieve it.</p> <p>  I am not so much afraid of making political points.  I will happily make political points if there is clear evidence to back that up.  The issue of whether Irish public services are good enough is a tricky one.  However, on the capital side, one can draw the comparisons, look historically and make the case that we are below where we really should be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#S00300"><p>The point I was going make in tandem with what Professor Barrett stated about the USC and income tax is that we have been doing a body of research with the Department to look at the stability of the taxation system and the stability of the main key taxation aggregates.  Some of the research arising out of that clearly points to the fact that income tax in an Irish context is a relatively stable source of tax.  If one is looking at this notion of fiscal stability and the potential shocks to the economy which could accrue in the coming years, it is, quite apart from the fact of the total revenue it brings in, merely from a variance point of view clearly important that income tax would be a sizeable component of the overall tax take.  This is emphasised in recent years with the substantial take in corporate tax.  There was a substantial corporation tax take last year.  This year the figures are still quite positive but, of course, we do not have as great an understanding of what exactly is driving that in terms of the sustainability of that receipt as we have in terms of other areas, for instance, income tax and VAT.  It is another reason one must have a sizeable component coming from such aggregates in order to ensure the overall stability of the base.</p> <p>  As another argument in that regard, in other research we have pointed out one needs to dig beneath it as well.  Income tax, VAT and stamp duty collapsed after the crisis because of the relationship between the housing market and those taxation aggregates.  It is not only focusing on having income tax; it is obviously knowing the dimensions of income tax and the degree to which the tax returns in income tax and VAT are related to the different activities in the economy and how sustainable are those levels of activity.</p></speech>

Yesterday, we had a number of witnesses, one of whom was Dr. McDonnell from the Nevin Economic Research Institute.  Would Professor Barrett concur with his point, which was news to me, that the Irish tax and welfare system was, according to an OECD comparison, "highly redistributive" and one of the most progressive systems that exist?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.168" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#S00500"><p>In many ways, I should be careful here.  I think I can claim ESRI research on this, as we are the ones who do the analysis of the redistributive component.  The OECD did the study, but using the ESRI SWITCH model.  It is the case that our tax and welfare system combined are highly redistributive.  There is an additional point though, that one should not confuse that with the totality of the tax system.  For example, we know that indirect taxes are actually quite regressive.  To get a total sense one would have to factor that in, but on the narrow income tax system, it is among the most redistributive.</p></speech>

We had this discussion yesterday with Dr. McDonnell.  How does one explain the differences that exist across the country?  The issue I come up against quite often is that when people talk about economic development on the east coast and in Dublin, and that Dublin is doing well, they automatically speak about the need to counteract Dublin and have a counterbalance in the west, and yet my region, the south east, was the worst performing region during the boom years in terms of unemployment, third level attendance and household income.  It is still the worst performing, even though employment in the south east region enjoyed the second biggest increase proportionately, but that is because it was from such a low base.  Is there anything specific to the south east region or anything that can be done in this budget, if Professor Barrett were the Minister for Finance, to redress those types of imbalances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016090700002#S00700"><p>The truth, to answer the second part, is there is not much one can do in the budget.  It is a much longer term issue.</p> <p>  I am talking on the edges of my knowledge here.  Many have looked at the modern growth processes and the importance of a major urban centre is fairly critical.  If one thinks about the south east, Waterford and Kilkenny may view themselves as urban centres but clearly there is a critical mass dimension to this, and often the university issue is linked in to that as well.  However, it is not only the university.  There is a range of elements that cities provide that are relevant when decision makers are locating industries.  It is not even about the old-fashioned notion of supply chains or anything like that.  It is about how young people simply want to live and work in more dynamic centres or whatever.  This is not only an Irish phenomenon.  If one thinks of places with which we are familiar, for example, in Britain, there is the power of the south east region there.  My understanding from discussions with colleagues across Europe is that much of the recovery post-recession in France was around Paris and Lyon.  In Germany, it is in the bigger cities.  There seems to be a gravitational effect pulling resources and economic activity in to the centres.  That is why places such as Galway, Limerick and Cork have done reasonably well.  That has always been the explanation I have been given of the difficulties in the south east.</p></speech>

It is something of a chicken-and-egg argument in the sense that there is poor broadband infrastructure in parts of rural areas, in particular, not to make it too parochial, in parts of the south east.  If infrastructure is provided, does it lead to a better level of qualification?  I am always conscious that in the south east there are poor levels of third-level attendance and those who tend to go to third level go to Dublin, Cork or Galway and do not come back.  Wexford is the worst example in terms of it having consistently the lowest household income in the country and it is mainly down to the fact that it also consistently has had the lowest third level attendance.  In terms of broadband, if the Government subsidises or helps broadband infrastructure be developed in more regional locations around the country, will that lead to a higher level of qualified people living in those rural locations?</p></speech>

This is what I mean.  One should not think about infrastructural development in isolated components or packages.</p></speech>

I do not wish to argue with Professor Barrett's view in terms of the overall taxation system.  Having spent far too long of my life in the banking inquiry discussing the hollowing out of the tax base, I can see the argument that is being made.  I studied economics for years and I never found it to be, as it is often referred to, "the dismal science".  I always found it interesting.  However, sometimes there can be a disconnect between theory and reality in the sense that there are many in this country now who probably suffered most in the economic collapse, who have jobs that are in the &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000 region in terms of salary, who bought their houses at ridiculously inflated prices and who are struggling to keep a roof over their head.</p><p>These are the same people with young children who spend whatever they earn or whatever they are able to spend to send their children to cr&egrave;ches, if they are still in employment.  In theory, the incomes of these people are quite strong, but the expenditure they face to keep a roof over their heads and their families in the educational system is so high.  They are extraordinarily and disproportionately affected by our taxation system.  The way it is structured means they end up paying for everything and getting nothing for free.</p><p> This may only become apparent to a politician who deals with these people on a daily basis when he or she sits across a table in an office or clinic from them and they are literally in tears because they do not know how they are going to keep body and soul together and put bread on the table to feed their families.  In light of some of what I have read in your presentation there seems to be something of a divorce from the reality facing families in the context of the universal social charge.  I do not care what it is called, but it replaced two levies that were in place for years.  Perhaps Professor Barrett has done so in other places but no one in media commentary ever speaks about the fact that the health levy and the other levy brought in over &euro;3 billion annually.  The current &euro;4 billion plus that the universal social charge brings in is not significantly higher.  The middle and lower income group is made up of people who, for the want of a better term, put their shoulders to the wheel when the country was on its uppers.  They believe, rightly or wrongly, that they should get some benefit directly in their pockets because their incomes have reduced so much.  Whether it is through the universal social charge or income tax is a moot point.</p><p> The witnesses commented on how the notion has built up that the universal social charge was a temporary measure.  I was in the Seanad at the time.  In fairness, it was not the Green Party elements of that Government, but the other elements that specifically said in debates and on the airwaves that it was an emergency measure brought in at a time of crisis.  It is not a notion that any politician or anyone else has created; that was the way it was sold.  Surely, whether it is a question of repackaging, directing these funds towards pensions or changing the PRSI system, people have a right to expect that in the case of this temporary emergency measure, which was sold to them as such at the time, some relief would flow from an improvement in the economic situation.</p></speech>

Obviously we would all be sympathetic to the individuals you are talking about.  I emphasise the point that at the lower end of the earnings distribution we have been taking people out of the tax net.  You are talking about a group of people in the middle.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, we have to pay taxes.  You referred to the notion of whether this was temporary.  The economy was in a totally unsustainable place.  We know all the arguments and I will not bore you by going through the arguments again.  We put the question in terms of the need to keep the aggregate tax take.  We are very strong on that.  If the argument is whether we need to do something on the USC, then it leads to the obvious question of what else are we going to do.  My suspicion is that certain groups of people would say that the higher paid are paying inordinate amounts of taxes and so on.  These are the arguments that come up again and again and we could debate them to and fro.  Points can be made but, I suppose, the parting point on this question - the more important one - is around the aggregate tax take.</p> <p>  Let us bring it back to the discussion earlier.  The stability of taxes and transparency are important.  The idea that we might cut the USC but not index the bands would mean the Government is simply clawing it back in another way.  There is a general understanding of where unfairness might arise.  One particular feature of the tax code is the problem of people paying the high marginal tax rate at relatively low incomes.  If the Government is going to fund the USC through non-indexation, then it will be creating more of the difficulty because people drift into the higher bracket.  That strikes me as being unfortunate.</p></speech>

Members are aware of the Government decision of May 2011, which put arrangements in place for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  Reference to this arrangement is also made in the November 2014 Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on appointments to State boards.  The 2016 programme for Government suggests that nominees for chairs of State boards will be required to have their nominations ratified by the relevant Oireachtas committee prior to their appointment.  This committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairperson designate in public session to hear his views and we trust that this will provide greater transparency to the process of appointment by our State boards and bodies.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Pauric Travers.</p><p>I wish to draw Dr. Travers's attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

The ERC has a long-established and well-deserved reputation nationally and internationally for excellence in the area of research, assessment and evaluation.  I am honoured to have been nominated by the Minister for Education and Skills to chair its new board.  I will begin by introducing myself and saying a little about the ERC before identifying some of the challenges facing the board in the period ahead.<br/><br/>I am an educationalist and historian by background.  I am a graduate of UCD and the Australian National University.  My career has largely been spent in the public service in Ireland.  I have been successively lecturer and head of department at St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra; dean of the joint faculty of humanities in St Patrick&rsquo;s College and DCU; and finally president of St. Patrick&rsquo;s College for 13 years between 1999 and 2012.  In the last capacity I played a leadership role, particularly in teacher education, and worked closely with primary schools, the Department of Education and Skills and relevant agencies.  I have been involved in the promotion of blended learning and digital technologies in teaching <i>inter alia</i>through TeachNet, the online community for teachers, of which I served as chair for many years.  An honorary life member of the Irish Association of Teachers in Special Education, I have had an ongoing interest in access and disability issues.<br/><br/>In the area of governance, I have wide experience as a member of boards and statutory bodies in the educational and cultural field.  I have been a director of the Central Applications Office, CAO, a member of the Teaching Council, a founding director and vice chair of the Centre for Cross-Border Studies in Armagh and a founding member and chairman of the standing committee on teacher education, North and South.  I was a member of the governing authority of Dublin City University for 14 years, and I am currently chairman of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.<br/><br/>The ERC was established at St. Patrick&rsquo;s College in the 1960s on the initiative of the then Department of Education and the college.  It has a staff of 34, including researchers and support staff.</p><p>While the centre has been in existence for half a century its board is new, deriving as it does from the designation in 2015 of the centre as an independent statutory body under section 54 of the Education Act, 1998.  The members of the board, myself included, were chosen after selection and vetting through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, process and consideration by the Minister of qualified applicants.  In addition to myself, the board comprises four members: Dr. Denise Burns, former principal of Sancta Maria College, Rathfarnham who has been designated deputy chairperson; Dr. Jude Cosgrove, senior statistical analyst at the Institute of Public Health and a former research associate at the Educational Research Centre, ERC, who is taking up the role in her personal capacity; Professor Michael Martin from the Lynch School of Education, Boston College; and Edward Murtagh, former assistant chief inspector at the Department of Education and Skills.  I am confident that the board contains the appropriate balance of skills and experience to fulfil its mandate.  The ERC has, of course, an able director in Dr. Peter Archer and experienced staff who have responsibility for operational matters.  I look forward to working constructively with them and with the other members of the board.<br/><br/>The responsibilities of the ERC are laid down in the establishment order, S.I. No. 392 of 2015.  In summary, these are to provide an assessment support service to schools and centres of education, including the development and provision of standardised tests and other assessment instruments, and to conduct independent research on all aspects of education including research that will inform policy making and practice and the improvement of educational standards.  The ERC undertakes research for and provides advice and support to the inspectorate and other sections of the Department.  It also does work on behalf of a range of bodies including the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, the State Examinations Commission and the National Council for Special Education.  It has strong associations with the EU, the OECD and other international organisations. <br/><br/>The central challenge for any educational system is to achieve the best outcomes for individual students and wider society within the resources available.  Well conceived educational research and evaluation can and should influence policy and practice relating to a myriad of issues including educational disadvantage, special education needs, gender equality, assessment, the Irish language and student attainment.  For example, with finite resources, it is important that interventions which seek to address the continuing problem of educational disadvantage are targeted to achieve maximum impact.  Policy and practice in this area, particularly the manner in which Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, the Department&rsquo;s <font color="#002041">initiative for disadvantaged schools, </font>has evolved has been significantly shaped by educational research conducted by the ERC which is the external evaluator for DEIS.  <br/><br/>Another key challenge lies in the area of literacy and the minority of students who leave school with literacy and numeracy problems.  The National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy 2011-2020, which addresses this issue, has been shaped by empirical data on literacy and numeracy levels as well as qualitative research on what is happening in classrooms and what is effective.  Well focused quantitative and qualitative research and evaluation informs decisions on curriculum change and the mainstreaming of pilot programmes. <br/><br/>At a system level, large scale studies of achievement play an important role in monitoring and improving quality in educational provision.  International studies such as the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, PIRLS, and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS, which are administered in Ireland by the ERC on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, provide invaluable comparative data on achievement levels generally and, in particular, on performance in English reading, mathematics and science.  Similarly, the National Assessments of English Reading and Mathematics, NAMER, provide valuable national data.  The ERC works closely with the inspectorate of the Department on such studies which are helpful in identifying trends and informing approaches to improving standards.</p><p>While the headline results attract the most attention, often the more detailed analysis is more useful - for example, the PISA finding that although Irish pupils performed well otherwise, higher achievers lagged behind their counterparts in other countries.  A criticism sometimes made of the Irish educational system is that is serves the average student well but those near the bottom or the top less well.  Ensuring that every student reaches his or her full potential is an aspiration that can be realised with the assistance of good quality educational research.</p><p> The Educational Research Centre is an important part of our national educational infrastructure.  Its establishment as a body corporate with a board strengthens its academic independence and secures its continued contribution to policy and practice in Irish education.  Acting within the policy set by the Minister for Education and Skills, the board will set its strategic direction, approve the associated work programmes for the staff and the centre and, in due course, report on the outcomes.  The work programme will continue to include participation in major international research studies, focused research and evaluation at national level, including research initiated by the centre, and services to schools and other educational centres.</p><p> One important strategic goal will be the building of capacity for educational assessment research by making provision for professional development of staff of the centre and by providing training in, and advice on, areas of its competence to others.  To this end, the centre will seek to enhance its collaboration with the new institute of education at Dublin City University and other cognate institutions and agencies as appropriate.  Another strategic goal will be to build on work already done in the centre on the development of computer-based platforms for the delivery of tests provided to schools - that is, the Drumcondra tests - and in the context of international studies.</p><p> Until now, the ERC operated as a functionally autonomous unit within St. Patrick's College.  As such, its governance arrangements were somewhat anomalous.  The appointment of a board rectifies that situation.  An immediate priority will be to undertake a review of its existing codes and policies and to introduce new ones as appropriate to ensure that they are fit for purpose and in accordance with best practice.  The board will be open, transparent and accountable in its operations and will of course abide by and implement the revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</p><p> In this year of anniversaries, we mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Educational Research Centre.  We also mark an important transition and a new phase in its development with the creation of its first board.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the new board, the staff of the centre, the Minister, the Department, the members of this committee and all educational stakeholders to enhance the contribution the ERC makes to Irish education.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that you have vast experience in the education sector in regard to both students and teachers.  It was interesting to hear about the work of the Educational Research Centre and what it has achieved in the past 50 years, particularly the priorities you highlighted relating to educational disadvantage and access.</p> <p>  I will open the floor to members.  Please indicate if you would like to ask Dr. Travers any questions either on his opening statement or on the work he proposes to carry out as chairman designate of the Educational Research Centre.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016090700002#V00300"><p>I do not know whether the questions are really appropriate, but some points jumped out at me in the contribution of Dr. Travers.  I know Ireland does relatively well in the PISA scores.  We are approximately 17th globally.  However, we fall down elsewhere.  Approximately 15% of Irish people have not reached a basic skill level in mathematics and science.  Has the ERC done much research in this area?  Perhaps it has and I simply need to find it.  Is there a correlation between that and dyscalculia, as well as the fact that schools are slow in assessing children for mathematics disabilities?  It is not recognised in the same way as being dyslexic at leaving certificate level.</p><p>The resources are not making their way into the schools and there is no national recognition.  I believe this is having a knock-on effect on the PISA scores and educational attainment when students get to leaving certificate level.</p></speech>

The most recent PISA was in 2012.  We performed significantly above the OECD average in mathematics.  We do well in mathematics generally but we performed significantly above the average in mathematics in 2013 as well as in reading.  We have done well consistently in reading.  This outcome correlates with the findings of the other reports, including the PIRLS and TIMSS reports.  PIRLS looks at literacy and TIMSS looks at mathematics and science.  Certainly we do well, but there is no room for complacency.  I am not aware that the centre has done specific research on the relationship between early intervention and performance in PISA, but it has been working closely with the DEIS programme and the national numeracy and literacy strategy.  The early indications on the numeracy and literacy strategy suggest it is beginning to have an impact overall, particularly on the areas Senator Ruane referred to.</p> <p>  Probably the most recent relevant findings are the national assessments done in 2014, which were carried out by the ERC in collaboration with the inspectorate.  They have shown significant improvements in the areas of reading and mathematics.  I think it augers well for the future.  It is early days yet, but the view on the outcomes from the 2014 assessments is that there is no room for complacency and that there is room for improvement in the area of mathematics and the DEIS programme and disadvantaged schools.  The view was that this area needed further attention.  The centre is undertaking the main evaluation for the DEIS programme and it will be interesting to see the outcome.</p></speech>

I understand the ERC did a report for a previous committee, the Joint Committee on Education and Science, on early school leaving and that it was well received.  There was considerable debate at the time on the question.  We might have that report forwarded to our members.</p></speech>

The more clarity that can be brought to educational disadvantage and how we can counter it, the better.  I am pleased to note the mention of the Irish language, which is a particular interest of mine.  Are there any particular initiatives or research on the Irish language that Dr. Travers will seek to put forward in his role as chairman?</p></speech>

I assume it will continue to do that.  There have been positive developments in terms of our understanding of educational disadvantage.  There was a time where there was an assumption that it was an urban phenomenon only.  In fact, one of the developments in the past decade has been a greater appreciation of the need to address areas of rural disadvantage.  The centre has done some work or research in this area.  The centre has done work on the Irish language and will continue to work on standards and achievements in Irish.</p></speech>

It is a matter of ensuring that it now has a new independent status.  It cannot be assumed that the codes, practices and policies that were relevant for the wider college and its operations necessarily transfer to the Educational Research Centre.  They have to be appropriate.</p><p>In some cases, the same policy will apply, while in other cases it is a matter of adopting new policies.  It is not an area I have particular concern about, but in terms of prudent and cautious governance, the first task for a new board is to ensure the relevant policies are in place and are fit for purpose.  As it is a slightly unusual transitional position, we do not want anything to fall between two stools.</p></speech>

There has been an explosion in educational research over the last 25 years, but assessment testing and evaluation is quite a specialist area and one has to ensure one has the necessary expertise.  It requires, for example, input from a number of different disciplines, including mathematics, statistics and so on.  It is important to ensure there is a flow of people who are well qualified to ensure we can conduct high-level research at national and international level.  Ireland has been well served by the centre because not all countries have consistently participated in the PISA, TIMSS or PIRLS, but the ERC has been very consistent in its approach.  That is a tribute to its founding director, Dr. Tom Kellaghan, who was the director for almost 40 years and his successor, Dr. Peter Archer.  That is one specific challenge.  Our business is assessment, testing and evaluation.  What happens in the classroom or in practice is a matter for the Minister, the Oireachtas, the teacher and all the different groups.</p> <p>  One of the more interesting developments over the past ten years has been a strong emphasis on formative rather than summative assessment for learning, that is, evaluation that feeds into the learning process, rather than waiting until the end and then testing what one has achieved.  This is about evaluating and assessing children at different points, such as at entry, and then see how they are progressing, so that one can change direction as appropriate.  That is a challenge for teachers.  All of the new teachers coming out from colleges over the past decade should be well versed and well trained in that area, but it presents challenges for teachers.  It is quite demanding, but it is very rewarding in terms of the impact it has, because one is responding directly and in time to the problems that arise, rather than discovering five years later that we let something slip through, or that there is a major problem in a particular area.  One of the assessment findings that came out of some of the international studies in relation to maths, for example, that Irish students were very good on numbers, but not quite so good on shapes, or the geometry side of things.  That is something that can be addressed on the ground, but the teacher needs to use those assessment tools for learning.  That will give better outcomes in general, but specifically for target groups or individuals.  Very often, when a child has a difficulty early on, if it is not addressed in a timely fashion, they will always have that difficulty, whereas if one intervenes early and effectively, the problem will be resolved and that student will have an equal chance of prospering within the education system.</p></speech>

I have a ceist on the literacy and numeracy strategy.  We have seen the success of that strategy, but the focus has been on English and maths.  It is a worry for Irish-speakers, like myself, and other teachers who are passionate about the Irish language.  Irish needs to be held in the same esteem as other subjects, but we need to do this in a way that will not increase the workload on teachers.</p><p>Is there a way of evaluating whether the strategy has had any impact on the Irish language and on the standards?  Teachers now have to spend more time teaching English and maths and it could result in Irish being marginalised.  It is a valid concern.  Is there a way we could put it on the same level as English and maths in our schools without increasing the workload on teachers, who are already doing an excellent job?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pauric Travers" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016090700002#Y00200"><p>The early indicators in the literacy and numeracy strategy seem to confirm what can be achieved if we have a focused, targeted strategy that identifies areas that need to be addressed.  If it works on those areas, there is no reason it cannot work in respect of Irish or, indeed, other curriculum areas, if they are systematically addressed and if there is time on task in respect of the particular aspect Deputy Nolan wants to develop.  The development of a similar strategy is a policy decision that would have to be taken.  The evidence is that this kind of strategy does work if it is focused and informed.  The ERC has done research in this area and is very open to continuing to do research on it.  There are concerns about overall standards in Irish over a period of time.   I am not that familiar with some of the more recent research in relation to Irish, but over a period of time there has been concern about the general standards.  My anecdotal impression is that the good students are very good, but that there is an issue that needs to be addressed in terms of the bulk of students.  I am talking about teacher education students.  If that applies to them, then it will ultimately transfer to schools and outcomes for pupils.</p></speech>

I have yet to take up the role.  The board has not met.  I am familiar with the overall budget.  The centre gets a grant-in-aid from the Department, which, up to now, has come via the HEA, but will come directly in future.  It also gets supplementary funding for particular projects.  In other words, if there is a project that needs to be done, then the centre negotiates for additional funding to do that work.  Then it generates its own income, both from independent research students and from testing.  Assessment and testing for schools generates some income, which is then ploughed back into the work of the centre.  I think the budget is roughly &euro;2.5 million a year.  That is the figure.  It has had some small increase in staff recently, but I do not yet have a take on whether the resource allocation and staffing is sufficient to do the work required.  It has certainly been operating very efficiently within the cloth it has been given and, no doubt, like many organisations, if it had enhanced resources with an expectation of enhanced results, I am sure we would deliver them.</p></speech>

In terms of the board and its delivery, I am aware that numeracy and literacy are very much to the forefront across all subjects, as it affects them.  This is something I firmly believe in myself, but maybe Dr. Travers would like to pick out targets in two or three other areas that he would like to see his board achieving towards the end of his tenure.</p></speech>

A criticism sometimes made of the international studies is they measure a very narrow range of skills.  They are very important skills but it is important not to neglect other things.  If parents are asked what they want for their children, of course they state they want them to be successful and to be literate and numerate, but they also state they want them to be happy.  In other words, there are issues about well-being and resilience.</p> <p>  Interesting research has been done on well-being, efficacy, how children see themselves and how self-confident they are.  The Educational Research Centre is doing research on resilience.  We all get knocked down and we must get back up.  Those who are successful are those who keep getting back up, but others are less resilient and fall through the system.  Research must focus on these issues as well.  In general, Irish schools are much happier places than they were 30 years ago.  There are exceptions and events take place which are not necessarily terribly positive, but in general Irish schools are very happy places.</p> <p>  When I went to parent-teacher meetings, very often the teachers were very keen to tell me about how the children got on in their tests but generally the first thing I wanted to know was whether they were happy, were they getting on socially and how they were functioning, because these will follow them through their lives.  Research must focus on literacy, numeracy and particular targets such as the Irish language, but it should not neglect the central holistic view of education, because the well-being of the system will suffer if we do not look at the overall experience of the child or student.</p></speech>

We look at what we need to provide for students in terms of resilience, numeracy and literacy, but I have been working on a programme and there is probably research I could tie in to it.  It is with regard to the teacher training curriculum.  Dr. Travers stated some of the research impacts on the school curriculum.  Does any of the research impact on the teacher training curriculum, particularly regarding deprivation and DEIS schools?  Teachers should be trained to understand the social context in which they work.  When they are training in their colleges, their placements should reflect the area in which they will possibly work.  For teachers going to DEIS schools, generally their introduction to inequality is what they have learnt in the classroom and what they have been told by other teachers in the DEIS schools.  This is not adequate.  Teacher training placements should include youth centres and trainee teachers should work with victims of domestic violence, Travellers and migrants in order that they understand the context of where they will work.  Does the Educational Research Centre's research look at reforming teacher training in any shape or form or the policies in this regard?</p></speech>

The duration of the training has been extended significantly.  Of more significance, the content and focus of the training has changed.  This reform has been informed by much research, including research done by the Educational Research Centre.  I am familiar with the teacher education programmes in all the colleges, especially at primary level, and there are programmes which make a substantial input regarding diversity, educational disadvantage, early intervention and other such issues.</p> <p>  To go back to Senator Ruane's first question, which I do not believe I answered particularly well, on the relationship between early intervention and PISA, the Educational Research Centre has done substantial research on early intervention.  One of the great insights that has come over past decade is that if intervention is not done in early childhood education to solve many of the problems regarding deprivation and educational disadvantage, the problems will be replicated and will continue.</p><p>It is good to have an access programme for third level education but if we really want to address the issue, we must go right back to earlier education provision.  In fairness, there has been significant developments in early childhood education.  There is a need for more and consistent intervention at this level because the earlier the intervention comes, the less likely the issue is to continue.</p></speech>

Early intervention happens but in DEIS schools resources and acknowledgement are not available to diagnose somebody with dyscalculia.  My daughter has dyscalculia but I had to find funds to bring her to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to find this out for myself and then fight for resources.  There seems the lack of acknowledgement that dyscalculia is a thing and teachers believe the way mathematics is taught will fix it.  Dyscalculia affects learning Irish, French and any other language because there is a correlation between dyscalculia and other subjects.  Advocating through research and policy for the recognition of dyscalculia in the same way we as we recognise dyslexia might mean better resources would be put into schools to aid early intervention.</p></speech>

I am not a particular expert in the area.  A basic principle is that the teaching style should reflect the learning needs of the individual child rather than the other way around.  Differentiated teaching is now the general expectation.  One does not teach a class of X number of students and assume that one teaching style will meet their various learning needs.  The teacher is expected to respond in a differentiated way.  Where an individual student has an individual education programme, the teacher is expected to support it.</p></speech>

Listening to him speak about prioritising the development of transversal skills, resilience and early intervention gives me great hope for what we can expect to have from the Educational Research Centre.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Dr. Travers about his roles with the CAO, the Teaching Council and the governing authority of DCU.  How will they inform him as chairperson designate?  What characteristics will he bring the role?</p></speech>

I was a member of the governing body of DCU as president of St. Patrick's College and it provided a particular insight into higher education.  It is somewhat less relevant perhaps to the current role.  The centre has been part of St. Patrick's College or St. Patrick's College DCU but it will now be an independent body.  Membership of the Teaching Council was a hugely valuable learning experience from my perspective.  It is still relatively new and it is playing a significant role.  I mentioned the reform of teacher education.  One of the major pieces of work the Teaching Council facilitated and directed was reform of teacher education programmes and ensuring they were fit for purpose.  This required significant changes on the part of the colleges.</p><p>The Teaching Council is representative of the different stakeholders, particularly of teachers but also of all the stakeholders, including parents and management bodies.  Working with stakeholders was useful.  The expectation is that the Educational Research Centre will work easily with different stakeholders and different groups.</p><p> The CAO role was a specific one.  The CAO manages intake into higher education.  I found that useful because of the issue of the points race and the pressure there is on students at leaving certificate level arising from the ever increasing number of points that seem to be required to get into this or that programme.  One of the areas on which the Educational Research Centre has done research is State examinations, the relative challenge posed by different subjects within the leaving certificate and whether it is easier to get an "A" in one subject than in another, and then looking at trends over time in regard to State examinations.  One of the areas that the Education Research Centre is doing some research on - I am not sure at what stage it is and I look forward to hearing more about it - is the difference that schools make, in other words, taking the intake they have and then the outcomes they produce.  Sometimes a lot of attention in the national media goes on what are seen as high achieving schools because they get X number of students into higher education or into some high-points course, whereas other schools may get much less attention but their achievement may be far greater because of the challenge they are faced with and the issues they have to deal with.  The ERC is doing some work in that area which I am interested in hearing more about.</p></speech>

Dealing with this issue is important and I welcome the initiative of this Oireachtas committee to hold public meetings over the coming weeks.  I agree with the committee that this area requires urgent attention.  I look forward to hearing what all the stakeholders attending the committee hearings have to contribute and to what the committee members have to add.</p> <p>  I will update the committee today on my work in the Department of Finance with the cost of insurance working group which brings together all the relevant Departments and offices involved with the process.  The committee can rest assured that I will incorporate the outcome of the committee hearings into the analysis of the cost of insurance working group.</p> <p>  The cost of insurance working group was established in July and has representation from the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Justice and Equality, and Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Personal Injury Assessment Board.  The objective of the working group, as set out in our agreed terms of reference, is to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, with particular focus on motor insurance, and to recommend short, medium and longer term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs, taking account of the requirement for an economically vibrant and financially stable insurance sector.</p> <p>  The core areas to be examined by the working group in this first phase are the motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years; the effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs; the current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims; insurance data and information; the impact of accident rates; the impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector; and other market issues.</p> <p>  Given that the issue of the cost of insurance is complex and in order to get to the heart of these issues as soon as possible, I established four subgroups to review them in detail.  Chairs have been appointed to these subgroups and work has already commenced.  The outputs of these subgroups will feed into the regular meetings of the working group.  I am determined to ensure that this important work progresses at a pace, meeting deadlines and achieving results.  I am taking a hands-on approach as chair, working closely with Department of Finance officials and liaising closely with the four subgroups that are now established.  I have also personally met a number of stakeholders to help me develop a greater understanding of their perspective on this complex issue.</p> <p>  The working group has held two meetings to date, on 20 July and 1 September.  We have scheduled meetings for every two to three weeks to the end of 2016.  By the end of October, I want to have identified the priority actions required and this will form the basis for an update report to the Minister for Finance.  From November to December, my aim is to put in place an action plan to enable the relevant Departments and offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions.  In this regard, I will be consulting regularly with my Government colleagues.</p> <p>  A number of specific issues are reported to be contributing to the increasing cost of car insurance in Ireland.  Industry, for example, argues that excessive award levels, increased number of claims, and excessive legal costs are significant contributory factors.  However, because of a lack of transparency in the final settlements, it is difficult to corroborate these industry arguments.  All one can definitely say is that motor insurance costs have increased significantly in the year to July 2016.</p> <p>  In developing solutions, we have to be conscious of the need for a stable insurance sector and ensure that risks to policyholders and the wider financial system are minimised.  Consequently, the importance of insurance companies meeting regulatory requirements and maintaining adequate reserves cannot be understated in examining the pricing of insurance products.</p> <p>  I believe we need to build consensus around the causes of the problem and to identify appropriate actions which then need to be implemented as soon as possible in order to restore some stability to the motor insurance market, as well as hopefully making it more attractive for new entrants.  It is likely that some of our actions may take time to implement, particularly if legislation is required, but with the co-operation of all political parties, these measures can be prioritised.</p> <p>  As mentioned earlier, one of the major shortcomings with existing settlement arrangements is the lack of transparency around the cost of settling claims or awards in personal injuries cases that do not go through the courts or the injuries board.  There is an absence of information from the industry on the number of personal injury claims settled, average injury settlement amount, average fees and average time taken to settle.</p><p>This is crucial information if we want to get to the root cause of the problem of increasing insurance costs.  This will be a key issue for the working group to address.  Ultimately, such information is important if we wish to try to ensure consistency of awards, whether they be made by the industry, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, or the courts.</p><p> In addition to ensuring access to data on the insurance claims, the cost of insurance working group will carry out analysis of the personal injury claims environment and the various claims resolution channels such as through the PIAB, the insurance industry and the courts.  It will examine the effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs and will review how improvements in these areas in other jurisdictions have influenced the cost of insurance on the ground.  A number of additional issues have been raised that can contribute to access to insurance at a reasonable cost.  They span the work of several Departments and offices and will be addressed by the working group.  These include the lack of a link between the national car test and the availability of insurance, insurance costs for the young and those over 65, the case for rural dwellers with no public transport to have car insurance at a reasonable cost, the issue of returning emigrants having difficulty obtaining car insurance and the cost of insurance to taxi drivers, hackneys and hauliers.  The joint review of the motor insurance compensation framework was carried out by the Departments of Finance and Transport, Tourism and Sport during the first half of 2016.  The Departments are now working to implement these recommendations.  The report includes a recommendation for additional data to be provided by insurers to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This recommendation, when implemented, has the potential to result in significant annual savings to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, as it should provide for a more robust enforcement of penalties by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of uninsured driving.</p><p> In conclusion, I am keen to come up with credible solutions to address the problem of the increasing costs of motor insurance with a view to implementing them as soon as possible.  The Government and other actors are not coming at this from a standing start.  Discussions on legislative changes to support the PIAB already are under way and members will hear directly from the Injuries Board regarding changes to the new book of quantum, for example.  Measures to tackle fraud are in the pipeline and the industry and other interested parties already have brought potentially worthy actions to the table.  It must be remembered, however, that the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited, as insurance companies are required by European law to price in accordance with risk.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is thus a commercial matter based on an assessment of these risks.  While the Government cannot direct insurance companies on pricing of insurance products, with members' help it can identify measures that may, in the short, medium and longer term, lead to a better operating environment and a reduction in claims costs.  The working group which I chair will do all it can to identify such measures and to recommend changes to reduce costs.  I will be happy to accept whatever assistance the joint committee can provide in helping this objective to be achieved.  I am happy to now take any questions or provide clarifications to assist the committee.</p></speech>

While I do not question the Minister of State's personal or political bona fides on this issue, as he is aware it has been highlighted for nearly two years.  It was highlighted by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, and in the media by the journalist, Charlie Weston.  Consequently, in one sense it is disheartening that the committee and subgroups are only now being set up and have only met once or twice, with a second meeting only four or five days ago and that the subgroups have not begun to meet.</p> <p>  I refer to the reality on the ground, and with the permission of the Chair, I believe it is important to introduce one or two brief case studies, if that is all right.  I am thinking of two constituents, the first of whom was responded to by his insurer to the effect that he did not meet its insurance criteria as he had had an accident within the past five years.  The insurer stated that once a claim had been made within a five-year period, it was unable to offer cover.  That person is faced with being put off the road and one point he highlighted was that, to use his own words, he barely scraped a car and the insurance company settled for &euro;1,600 without his knowledge.  This is a point Fianna F&aacute;il has highlighted in its policy document.  His car has passed the national car test, NCT, is five or six years old and has a value of approximately &euro;10,000.  He had a no-claims bonus until that accident, as well as step-back cover etc.</p> <p>  That case involved a middle-aged man, while the other case involved an older man, who is well into his 70s with a 14 or 15 year old car, whose premium has increased from just over &euro;400 to more than &euro;1,300.  He is a pensioner in receipt of &euro;230 per week who simply has been put off the road.  Again, the car in question had passed the NCT and this driver's mileage is approximately 2,000 km per year and such modest driving had prevented him from being obliged to use public transport.  One issue, which the Minister of State mentioned in his statement, is the relationship between the NCT to the cost of insurance.  What is the point of having one's car tested if it has no bearing on the cost of one's insurance?</p> <p>  While I wish to introduce a couple of points, the Minister of State by and large has outlined a fair amount of the analysis.  All those present who have an interest in this issue are familiar with the analysis and have a fair idea as to what are approximately 90% of the issues.  People who are stakeholders in this regard, such as motoring and environmental journalists, spokespeople for different parties and players in the car and insurance industries, have a fair idea of what it is and my major question is where the Government's sense of urgency is in dealing with the issue.  In a response to one of my colleagues in the D&aacute;il, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated it would be early next year before any particular meaningful or tangible changes would take place, but meanwhile, people will face pretty significant increases in their premiums that they can ill afford.</p> <p>  While I do not intend to go through it, my party has produced an action plan to tackle rising motor insurance premiums and I wish to inform the joint committee of its existence as it may be a resource on which the committee can count.  I will highlight some of the points raised therein, which include the re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board on a time-limited basis.  This worked successfully in the 1990s and helped to reduce insurance costs by up to 40% at that time.  As the Minister of State mentioned the transparency of the insurance industry, I do not wish to labour these issues but again, it is an issue I wish to highlight.  I refer in particular to how consumers, people who hold motor insurance premiums, often feel frustrated that a claim is settled against them without any consultation.</p><p>One should compare this with health insurance where one gets a fully itemised bill and account of what each practitioner was paid.  That needs to be introduced.  One of the things we would like to see is enhanced disclosure around renewal notifications.  In the UK they have done a study which seems to indicate that when consumers are buying motor insurance they are most engaged in the first purchase of insurance and then stick with the insurer and drift after that.  The Financial Conduct Authority in the UK describes this as a loyalty premium.  One stays with the same insurer but it actually costs on average &euro;110 per policy to do so.  There needs to be some way to address this.  The insurance provider might be obliged to say that a person has been with it for four or five years but that if he or she shops around, there is greater value to be had.  Perhaps the Chairman or Minister of State can comment on the legality of this.  My car insurance renews in November.  My insurance provider has taken to providing the insurance disk in November as opposed to sending out the letter of renewal.  If I accept the renewal, I then get the insurance disk in the run up to it.  While the onus is on me to shop around, there should be some obligation on the insurer to say to me that I have been with it for four or five years but that it is costing me to be with it and it would be cheaper for me to insure with others.</p><p> The book of quantum will be dealt with but I want to raise it.  It tends to be a reflection of the prevailing awards as opposed to what might be a suitable or appropriate award.  That needs to be tackled.</p><p> I have spoken about the care-not-cash model, particularly for minor injuries.  We have to be careful about that.  There is genuine whiplash and there is fake whiplash.  Who discerns the difference between the two?  It is difficult to identify that.  </p><p> I will go through the headings of the issues.  The consistency in court awards in personal injury cases needs to be raised.  The reform of the role of the PIAB is another issue.  A big hit can be made in the legal costs in personal injury claims.  False and exaggerated claims are another issue.  One of the things that my party feels very strongly about is that there is legislation in place which allows that if any material aspect in a case in a sworn affidavit is false or misleading, the person is guilty of an offence for which the penalties are up to ten years in jail and a fine of up to &euro;100,000.  In practice, few cases ever reach the DPP.  There was a very noteworthy case in the last six or eight months that hit the newspapers and about which the journalist, Peter Murtagh, wrote.  It was taken to court and it was seen to be a completely fraudulent case.  I wonder if there were prosecutions after that.  A very strong message needs to be sent out.</p><p> I want to raise a couple of specific points.  We have talked about strengthening road safety enforcement.  There are a lot of things we can do about that.  If we look at the UK for example, driver behaviour grows over time.  In London, in particular, they have safety enforcement cameras, particularly at busy junctions and locations where there have been fatalities.  They have installed speed and red light cameras at sites where people have been killed or seriously injured due to a driver going too fast or running a red light.  That happens a lot particularly in the cities in Ireland.  It reflects a behaviour that begins to be developed and taken for granted and which causes accidents.  One of the points Fianna F&aacute;il raises is about strengthening road safety enforcement.  In the UK on roads where they have introduced it, the number of people killed or seriously injured fell by a dramatic 50%.  That can only have a positive impact down the road for insurance.  </p><p> I would like the committee, the Chairman and the Minister of State look at innovative insurance models.  I am sure the committee is familiar with BoxyMo insurance.  I would be hugely surprised if it was not familiar with it.  It is an insurance company and is Ireland's first telematics dedicated insurance company.  It fits a telematics device to the car, particularly for young people.  That device tells the insurer how one drives and how far.</p><p>Each month the insurer sends out a report to the young driver on how their driving has been for that month and how they can improve it.  Anecdotally, I understand that if a driver on the BoxyMo model hits 140 km/h at any stage they get a letter the following day saying their insurance is cancelled.  The better one drives, the more one is rewarded.  One is rewarded with additional kilometres at the end of each month.  It is full tracking and it monitors younger drivers' behaviour and speed.  It does not only monitor younger drivers.  Each month they get a driving report.  </p></speech>

There are just some final points on this.  The relationship between the insurance industry and body repair centres has not been mentioned.  That is the motor aspect of this.  I would like if the committee could investigate it.  I am told that traditionally if one's car had got a bang, one went to the panel repair shop, they assessed it, called one's insurance company and it was approved or whatever.  I am reliably informed that it is invariably centralised now.  There is no wriggle room for the body repair shop in terms of increased or reduced prices.  There are approved body repair shops and body repair shops that are not approved.  There may be a cartel operating there.  It may be a little too cosy for comfort.  One cannot go to one's local garage like one used to.  In many ways the damage is banded because the body repair shop says that it will take half a day or a full day but there is some work that could take an hour or two hours.  It seems to be banded and I would like the committee to investigate it.  Perhaps the Chairman could call someone in here.  I do not know under whose remit it falls.  It is at that level that a huge amount of costs arises.  I suspect that in the case of the constituent whose claim was settled for &euro;1,600, the body repair shop decided it was either a half a day's work or a day's work.  That can be regulated.</p></speech>

I am told that insurance officials used to have to have a six-exam qualification.  It is now a three-exam qualification.  The knowledge base is not there anymore within car insurance companies.  That is mixed with the banding of work over a half day or a day.  These are things I would like the Minister of State to investigate and add to the work of the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090700002#RR00600"><p>Those watching the proceedings of the committee are looking for some comfort that the Government is intervening in a manner that will seek to reduce the cost of motor insurance premiums and other premiums as well.  For the purposes of today we are talking about motor insurance premiums.  I am a little bit worried by the Minister of State's response.  If I interpret his intervention correctly, he is telling us that "the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited, as insurance companies are required by European law to price in accordance with risk".  If a person received a letter from the insurance company saying that the premium had increased by 30% or 50% or whatever and that person been driving for quite a number of years with a clean record, he or she would be shocked at having to pay upwards of 50% of an increase in his or her insurance premium because there is not such an increased risk overnight.  One has to conclude from the point of view of ordinary motorists that the provisioning arrangements by insurance companies was too low, that there is the lack of transparency and that perhaps the insurance houses, most of which are global corporates, are readjusting the price setting for the Irish market in order that they can engage in super-normal profit sharing.</p> <p>  What we really need to hear in this committee is whether the Government has the power to legislate effectively to compel the insurance companies to meet their obligations to ensure that people pay a fair premium for a fair risk on their driving.  I am worried about the Minister of State's intervention and that the working groups are predominantly constituted by Departments of State, which is fair enough and is appropriate.  There is the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Injuries Board.</p><p>I have not heard from the Minister of State what the level of engagement has been so far with the insurance companies based in Ireland and those underwriting that risk, be they operating in the Irish market or externally.  I have a funny feeling that they are readjusting their business model to extract a lot more profit from the Irish market overnight with a short sharp shock.  That is what many people are experiencing this year with the massive increases in their premiums.  If the purpose of the insurance companies is, under European law, to price in accordance with risk, it has to be said, with some degree of fairness and balance, that the behaviour of most drivers has not changed and they are still driving competently, so why should they pay extra for their premiums?  Can the Minister give a clear idea of whether we can legislate to change the behaviour in the insurance sector?  That is a simple yes or no question.  It is incumbent on us to be very clear with motorists experiencing these difficulties.</p><p> Is there a proper level of co-operation with the insurance companies, if they have been engaged in this process, and the working group?  If they wanted to, they could ignore this process and continue to do whatever it is they want to do.  If they do not buy into this process we could argue that we are at nothing here.  There could be some legislation around what the PIAB does, or transparency in respect of settling claims.  Can we legislate to ensure there is transparency around settling claims out of court, through the PIAB, and within the courts?  We need much more transparency and we must be clear with motorists about whether we can legislate to reduce premiums.  We also need to have some degree of compellability in respect of how the insurance industry engages with the working group and politically, to give motorists some comfort about reducing the cost of premiums.</p></speech>

That cannot continue.  How many insurance companies providing motor insurance are not regulated by the Central Bank, like Setanta?  Setanta has given rise to a ruling of &euro;90 million that the insurance industry says will probably result in further premium increases for ordinary people.  When will the report be ready?  What type of forensic due diligence analysis is the working group doing of what companies are charging?  A total of 80% of all awards are agreed outside the courts - in other words, the 20% that happen in the courts dictate the fact that many settle outside the courts.  Is the working group considering the level of awards made by various insurance companies and tracking those back to the increase in premiums with those companies?  The problem is that we are hearing a lot of abstract talk from the insurance industry, and I would like to see the detail on that.</p><p>If the insurance industry is using this smoke screen, based on worldwide activities, to rip off young Irish people who are trying to get motor insurance, we cannot allow that happen.  We need forensic details to point that out.  I note that the Governor of the Central Bank is looking for regulation and I am worried that there are companies in the market which are not regulated by the Central Bank.  They are beyond the pale.  What exactly is the basis for that?  We need to know the reason.  Abstract reasons for pushing up motor premiums do not wash with me.  I want to see the detail.  I want to see it across all the companies and the level of claims for individual companies.  Therein probably lies the answer.</p><p> The review group cannot just be a discussion group, it must drill down into the market to see why these premiums are being charged.  A couple of years ago premiums were reasonable value but suddenly they went up in a very short period of time.  The figures quoted make for alarming reading: they went up by 36% in the past 12 months and by 70% in the past three years.  That means some young person was paying &euro;600 for insurance but may now be quoted &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000, which is astronomical.  What practical measures is this review group taking?  When will the report be published and be made public?  Then we can get down to the detail of why this is happening rather than have an abstract discussion which the insurance industry appears to be dictating.</p></speech>

People want the cost of their insurance to come down.  They feel they are being exploited by insurance companies and our job is to find out why.  Transparency is the key word because people remember when they were told that the fundamentals of the economy were sound and the banks were stable and they have the same concerns now about the insurance industry.  We have to get to the crux of the stability of the insurance market in Ireland and of those companies operating in that market which are based abroad.  We have seen the impact on people of two big companies going to the wall.</p> <p>  It worries me when the Minister of State says that we cannot direct insurance companies on the pricing of insurance.  While that may be true, it may indicate that there will be some hand washing.  There needs to be regulation.  Will the Minister of State direct us on the legislation that needs to be put in place in order to reassure us about the insurance industry?  People do not buy the suggestion that the number of accidents has increased and that there is an extra cost on the insurance companies.  There is a worry that bad investments have been made by insurance companies and people on the ground are paying the price.  They want to be reassured about the companies' stability.  We need to be able to compare final figures before the report is published.  Can interim reports be provided to help this committee do its work effectively?  Different people will appear before us who have concerns about the insurance industry and we need to be able to get to the crux of the matter so if figures could be released before the final report, that would be useful.</p> <p>  I am not filled with confidence about the compartmentalisation of the legal costs.  That was one of the stipulations of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, to tackle high legal costs.  Nothing has been done about that.  It will be interesting to see figures with integrity being isolated to give us information on that.</p><p> I come from a rural constituency and public transport is not an option.  People are unable to access the employment market because they have no chance of getting employment in their own area and must travel to find it.  Whatever we do needs to be rural-proofed as well in terms of how the extortionate costs of insurance impact on rural communities.  Every week, returning emigrants tell us that one of the biggest barriers to them returning is the cost of insurance and the fact their no-claims bonuses from other countries are not recognised.  I thank the Minister of State for his report but we really need to get to the crux of this, which is transparency and the insurance industry owning up to exactly what is happening within the industry.</p></speech>

Who is on the four sub-committees?  The Minister of State said that he wanted to make sure they stuck to deadlines.  What deadlines has he set?</p> <p>  The Minister has not spoken about the business model of the insurance companies despite the fact that the motion was agreed by all parties in the D&aacute;il.  An amendment of mine discussed the fact that the business model was one of the main reasons insurance premiums were increasing.  It is a view shared by the Central Bank, which has provided the Department and me with figures relating to the fact that the investments made by insurance companies with the premiums they receive have decreased substantially in the past number of years.  If one looks at the investment income attributable to the loss, one can see that in 2012 it was &euro;278 million, but two years later it had dropped by &euro;100 million.  This is one of the reasons premiums are increasing.  It is because they are not getting the return on safe investment - the likes of German bonds - that they were getting at 4% a few years ago.  They are now zero rated.  Could the Minister of State address that issue and why he has ignored the issue on the motion that asked him to look into this?  Does he share the Central Bank's view in respect of this?</p> <p>  I find this very awkward and, for the record, it is not a good format.  This is not the way to deal with questions and answers of this type.</p></speech>

There has been a dragging of heels on this.  On 2 July 2015, a letter was sent to the Central Bank under section 6(a) in respect of the insurance sector, yet the committee is only beginning to get its work together.  The second meeting was held only on 1 September.  In the meantime, every person in the State has received an increase in his or her insurance premium.  The Minister of State has not given us any clear deadlines in terms of when he expects work to begin.  I believe this should have been the priority work of the committee.</p> <p>  My next question concerns regulation.  One of the major issues discussed in respect of the motion that was agreed by the Minister of State and others was that we would look at the regulation of the sector.</p><p>The Minister of State did not mention the regulation of the insurance sector at all despite the fact that in the past number of years, we have seen three insurance companies that were operating here go into liquidation, receivership or administration.  Enterprise Insurance, which is one of the most recent examples, ceased trading a number of weeks ago.  Although it was regulated in Gibraltar, one of the other companies was regulated here.  The Central Bank has a role here.  What is the Minister of State's response to Patrick Honohan's very clear request on 18 August 2015 when he asked the Minister for Finance to give the bank the power to regulate the insurance holding companies?  Has the Government given the bank the power over the past year because in the mean time, we have lost another insurance company?  People who were insured are basically up the creek without a paddle.  They have lost their investment.  In the same letter, the then Governor said that he wanted to strengthen the supervision of the non-life insurance sector, which includes the motor insurance sector, and asked for the consolidation of disparate insurance regulation in a coherent whole.  Has this happened or when will it begin to happen?  The Solvency II Directive was the other issue that was raised but that has been dealt with.  I would like clear answers relating to all of these issues in terms of progress.  </p><p> I spoke about the role of the committee.  Could the Minister of State send the terms of reference of the working group to the committee, including the terms of reference of the four subgroups and the actual membership instead of the Departments that are represented on it?  Will any of the subgroups look at how the regulator allowed an unusual market failure?  </p><p> I received a letter dated 18 August 2015 from Patrick Honohan to the Minister through a freedom of information request.  The letter said that a number of non-life insurance companies took a very optimistic view of the future economic outlook, built up an unsustainable overhead and followed an imprudent pricing and underwriting approach across most business lines which resulted in companies' business plans becoming less resilient to downside risk such as an increase in the frequency and severity of claims.  This was the former Governor of the Central Bank telling us that companies which the bank regulated were following an imprudent pricing and underwriting approach.  I want to know how the Central Bank allowed this to happen.  The Central Bank has a responsibility.  If this happens with a financial institution, it has an responsibility to step in and make sure that there is no imprudent pricing.  The definition of imprudent is "without due regard to the consequences".  The then Governor was telling us that these firms, and I am sure he was not just talking about ones regulated in Gibraltar, were following an imprudent pricing and underwriting approach.  The Central Bank has a responsibility to step in there and make sure they are not doing this.  In fairness, the Central Bank has made very strong statements.  At a major meeting earlier this year, Philip Lane asked the insurance sector not to chase risky investments because of the effects of quantitative easing.  Why did it allow it to happen at that time?  </p><p> Transparency is key to all of this in terms of the payout of claims and all of the different types of data.  In light of the CSO review of strategy, where it wrote to this committee asking us to input into its strategy in the next few years, I have written to it asking it whether it would consider taking on a role in terms of publishing data relating to the insurance sector.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the UK regularly compiles and publishes this type of data.  This role should be taken on by the CSO, which has carried out excellent work in respect of collating and publishing data in other sectors, aside from the GDP figures, which were not its fault.  Again, Apple was to blame for that one.</p><p>There is a need for this because, even in his speech, the Minister of State referred to the difficulties with claims and so forth.  If one looks at what is available in Britain, one can break it down.  One can go into different regions where one can see the claims that were paid out, the number of uninsured drivers, the frequency of accidents and so forth.  That is a role I would like to see.</p><p> Young drivers being refused a quote and a system being in place to ensure they will be afforded a quote when all others refuse to quote them was mentioned earlier.  While the system is in place, usually the quote they get is unfair.  There is a serious issue where legislatively all drivers are required to be insured but we do not force the industry to provide a fair quote.  I understand the difficulty is with EU rules and we cannot impact on pricing.  There is an issue, however, that needs to be dealt with.  What are the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on other models of insurance?  Are we going to examine other models such as those in other parts of Europe and New Zealand which are different from the one here that requires every driver to have insurance?</p></speech>

This is an urgent issue.  We have to be responsible in how we manage public expectation because there is much work that has to be done and can be done.  I want to ensure we can see what those early priority actions are so we can get moving on this.  If we can do that with consensus, it will pre-empt any potential increases in premiums in the coming months.  I know the Chairman, Deputy John McGuinness, Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty and others have been raising this issue.  It is an important issue up and down the country.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has been taking it seriously for the past year.  That is why he established the task force.  Its first port of call was to look at compensation in the industry itself.  That is the work it began with to ensure there was a proper structure in place.  The second piece of work that had to be done by the task force was in respect of flood insurance.  A report is with the Office of Public Works, OPW, which will be published soon.</p> <p>  The next task was to move to the increasing cost of motor insurance.  The real spike happened in the past 12 months to July and was approximately 40%.  An important thing the Minister did was to give political direction to this by making it one of my delegated responsibilities as Minister of State in the Department of Finance.  This has allowed a working group emerge and get work done.  It highlights the importance the Government places on this.</p> <p>  The impression that work is not going on behind the scenes and between meetings would be a false one.  We all know, as people who work on various issues and as part of our job to attend meetings, that we work hard in between meetings.  We needed to ensure we had all the relevant stakeholders in the room.  The next point was to ensure we had robust terms of reference that would get the job done quickly.  We then had to ensure we would be engaging with the right elements of the industry and different stakeholders so we would have a clear picture and be able to build consensus.</p> <p>  We have not been coming at this from a standing start either.  Of course, several streams, such as legislative measures, uses of new technology or tackling particular issues, have been examined in the past 12 months or more.  Part of the work I have to do with the working group is to see what the priorities are, bring them from the centre and get them done.</p> <p>  There is a real problem with transparency with easy and early settlements in the industry which have been raised.  Up to 20% of cases are settled through the Injuries Board and 10% through the courts.  That means there are 70% of cases where we are not sure what is happening.  Are they being settled before they go into the Injuries Board or afterwards?  What quantum is involved?  How long is the settlement taking?  What other costs are incurred?  What level of claims are being given out?  We definitely need more transparency in that area.</p> <p>  While we need respect for privacy and data protection laws, the sharing of data between the NCT, insurance and tax agencies with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant bodies should be happening and should be easier.  I hope we can build consensus, through the committee&rsquo;s engagement with the various stakeholders and my working group&rsquo;s engagement, so that easy measures could be introduced quickly.  From some of my informal engagements so far with different elements of the industry, matters in database development are not proceeding as quickly as they should be.</p><p>There needs to be a big push politically.  That is a big push I am willing to give but I need support in that regard to ensure the industry is on board and working with us.</p><p> From the informal engagements I have had to date, there is not necessarily consensus on what is driving up premiums.  The committee will hear that as well from the different people who appear before it, who will be making different claims as to what is driving up costs.  We are going to have to decide which is correct and which is not.  We need to take the standard insurance premium, if there is such a thing anymore, and break down its constituent costs.  For example, is &euro;50 is being added on to premiums for fraud or &euro;35 for uninsured drivers?  How much is because of early settlements or fear of litigation?  How is that affecting premiums and what levers do we pull to address that?</p><p> My intention is to have a detailed understanding and roadmap by October for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, showing exactly where we need to go.  Between October and the beginning of December, I intend to put in place an agreed action plan that has buy-in from everyone.  If we want to get this done in a meaningful way for consumers, we are going to need to ensure there is a consensus and buy-in at the very beginning.  Much of that work is already progressing.  We had a second plenary meeting recently but much work was done between the two plenaries.  There is a busy schedule of meetings between now and the middle of October and then through to December, when we hope to have a formal report and action plan ready.  Some things will happen sooner, such as the book of quantum.  I will let the Injuries Board speak more on that because it is more appropriate.  It will explain the changes with the new book of quantum, which will help with the information that is being provided to the Judiciary.  Measures such as an enhanced renewal notification process need to be examined and will be on our side.  Reform of the Injuries Board is also being examined.  That work has already begun.  It is about deciding the medium and long-term actions that can be taken.  For example, if we want to give a greater legal weight to the documentation that appears before the Injuries Board, then that might be a longer-term issue.  However, we could look at statutory timelines with medical appointments.  For example, if one does not attend a medical appointment within nine months, then one automatically falls out of the Injuries Board and the case can go to court.  Can we look at ways of pausing that timeline so that it cannot be the case that people who just miss a medical appointment are out of the Injuries Board?  It is alleged to me that people sometimes intentionally fall out of the process because they believe they can get a better settlement in the courts or after the Injuries Board.</p><p> The industry will have much to say about costs.  Different companies in the industry will have varying perspectives on that too.  On increases in safety, the AA will explain improvements in technology and telematics.  My understanding is that more work is needed in this area.  Some good work has been done but it is not there yet in terms of having standard telematics built into every car which cannot be tampered with easily.  It may become an opt-in for the driver to get a lower premium.  The AA has conducted surveys among its own members on this.  I believe it was surprised by the results but I will allow the committee to ask it in more detail.  I thought telematics technology might be a quicker route but my understanding is that it will take a little bit longer to actually put it to good use.  It is a solution.  We must bear in mind that the motor industry will change dramatically over the next five years.  We have already seen this with self-driving cars and in enforcement areas.</p><p> The relationship between insurance companies and body repair shops is an interesting question.</p><p>I will ensure that we look at it and I would like the committee to put it to the industry groups publically - I will be putting it to them privately.</p><p> The issue relating to insurance staff has been highlighted to me by some industry players.  I hope the committee will be talking to those players because, although I cannot speak for them, I believe they would also have some interesting observations on the points raised.</p><p> Deputy Sherlock referred to a number of issues.   In order to be clear, I reiterate that I was asked to examine the areas of non-life insurance but I very much wanted to focus on motor insurance because so many colleagues have been raising the matter with me, as have my own constituents.  People who have done nothing wrong this year compared to last year - no penalty points, no accidents and no changes to their vehicles, which might only be one year older and have passed the NCT - were hit with hikes of 40% and more in their insurance premiums in the 12 months to July.  This situation is not acceptable and it is the reason something must be done.  The price cannot be set and regard must be had for the stability of the sector.  In addition, there should be no unintended consequences to our actions.  While we must move quickly and together, we need to be conscious of them impact of anything we might do.  I give as an example the suggestion by one industry player that if a move was immediately made to engage in a data dump in respect of all claims settlements made outside of the PIAB and the courts system, the unintended consequence might be to drive premiums up if people became aware of the awards being made in respect of certain injuries.  We absolutely need transparency but we must plan our work carefully in order that it will not have any negative effect in the context of what we are trying to do, which is to try to maintain some sort of control over the rising costs of motor insurance and to work to bring the cost of premiums down.</p><p> Provisioning was too low and I believe the representatives from Central Bank will speak to that when they come before the committee.  Evidence seen by the committee shows that profits have not been made in recent years by any of the main players operating in the market.  They are now moving to correct that position but there is risk of an overcorrection.  If more market participants could be brought in from abroad, then a better idea of the actual state of the market might become evident.  However, there is a reluctance for foreign competitors to become involved due to a lack of transparency in the market as a result of data not being shared on foot of concerns regarding fraud and uninsured drivers and, if we are to be honest about it, market failure.</p><p> The price of insurance cannot be set but we can examine the factors that make up premiums and tackle those various levers.  For example, a breakdown of what makes up a premium would be helpful.  The insurance industry is saying that &euro;50 of each premium relates to the costs of fraud.  Therefore, if it were possible to come up with a national claims database - I believe it would be possible to do so - I would hope that this would immediately reduce the need to provision for &euro;50 on the price of a premium because of fraud.  Greater levels of technology could be introduced to allow sharing of information between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, the NCT provider and the motor tax office.  We should be able to use cameras - as is the case in other jurisdictions - to record number plates and give the Garda all the relevant information it requires.  This would mean it would be almost impossible to drive an uninsured vehicle on the road.  If that was the case, then another &euro;35 might come off the cost of premiums.  These are small amounts compared to the significant sums people are paying for premiums and I reiterate that we cannot set the price.  However, we can identify the component parts that would seem to be increasing premiums and we could start to use policy levers to tackle them.  Much of that work has already been identified but one will find that there is no consensus about what needs to be done first or how quickly things can be done.  That is what the committee needs to establish.</p><p> I have met industry players.  I have also representatives from the brokers' associations on an informal basis.  We will also engage with the latter formally in the context of the sub-groups.  There is no evidence that has been brought to my attention - although it might be raised with the committee - of players entering the Irish market and making money off the back of Irish citizens and the premium rates that apply in order to make a quick profit.  We have not seen evidence of that.  If there is evidence, however, then it is important that it be made public.  Legislation can be introduced in respect of fraud, data sharing, transparency, the injuries board and claims.  If we are going to be bold, we can legislate in respect of new areas if radical ideas are put forward.  There is an idea floating around regarding the concept of "care instead of cash".  I understand the downsides of moving towards a care-instead-of-cash model.  One negative would be the moving of costs incurred by the legal profession to the medical profession.  However, under a care-instead-of-cash model, one could drive down what might be seen as excessive costs - in comparison with those which obtain in other jurisdictions - for injuries such as whiplash.  One would certainly move fraud out from that part of the insurance system.  If radical change is needed, it will require work and it would not be a short-term solution.  We need to understand that we can still build around it as a longer-term solution if there is consensus on it.  We need buy-in and we need consensus.</p><p> Senator O'Donnell highlighted some good examples of prohibitive rates.  The Senator is correct when he says this cannot continue and that is why we treat the issue with such urgency.</p><p>The Senator asked questions on Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance.  I have some details noted with which to update the Senator on the current position with Enterprise Insurance.  It is a developing situation.  As Deputy Doherty has said, Enterprise Insurance is a Gibraltar-incorporated company under supervision in Gibraltar by the Financial Services Commission there.  Enterprise Insurance sold motor insurance in a number of European countries, including Ireland, on a freedom of service basis.  Wrightway Underwriting Limited - a retail intermediary regulated in Ireland - acted as the managing general agent and sold private motor insurance policies on behalf of Enterprise Insurance via the Irish broker network.  The Gibraltar regulator notified the Central Bank of Ireland on Friday 22 July 2016 that it was taking steps, with the co-operation of Enterprise Insurance, to petition for the winding up of Enterprise Insurance.  Enterprise Insurance had told them that the company was insolvent and had been unable to secure additional funding.  At the time the provisional liquidator was appointed to Enterprise Insurance - Monday, 25 July 2016 - there were approximately 14,200 Irish private motor policyholders.  In response to the appointment of the provisional liquidator Wrightway Underwriting agreed to refund unexpired premiums to next renewal for policyholders and started actively working with its brokers to find alternative cover for Enterprise's Irish policyholders.  Since then the original figure of 14,200 policies has decreased to approximately 2,200, and this remains a work in progress for Wrightway Underwriting and its broker network.  I realise that the committee would like to have a clearer picture of the position in relation to claims but I would be hesitant to provide figures that are not yet confirmed.  The full picture of the financial position of Enterprise Insurance will remain unclear until the liquidator is appointed on a permanent basis, which is due to happen this month.  The Central Bank is in close contact with Wrightway Underwriting on this matter.  Other EU and EEA member states affected are the UK, with some 500,000 policies, Greece, with some 100,000 policies, and France, Italy and Norway, with a smaller number of policies.<br/><br/>With regard to the up-to-date position of Setanta Insurance, the situation with regard to payment of the first Setanta compensation payments is not yet clear.  The Setanta case is  awaiting the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court in the case of the Law Society of Ireland <i>v</i>. the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland.  This will be heard on 24 October 2016.  It may well be 2017 before the Supreme Court decision is delivered.  On 4 September 2015 the High Court held that MIBI was liable in respect of claims against the Setanta policyholders.  This decision was subsequently appealed by the MIBI, as the committee knows, and the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision in this case.  MIBI was granted leave to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, which is now happening.  These potential MIBI payments relate to third-party motor insurance claims only, and the insurance compensation fund is liable for a further small number of additional claims.  These are currently being processed by the office Office of the Accountant at the Courts of Justice.  These claims are not as significant, as the bulk of the claims are third party motor insurance.  The liquidation of an insurance company is a legally complex process.  As Setanta Insurance was incorporated in Malta, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.  The Setanta liquidator has informed me that the number of open claims stands at approximately 1,700.  The claims-reserved position stands at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.  Setanta policies were cancelled in May 2014, so the two years allowable under the statute of limitations within which to lodge claims has expired.  This means that claims' figures will not increase further.  However, final settlements can only be paid out by the liquidator after all the company's liabilities are quantified, including claims.  Since the liquidator will not be in a position to pay out more than 30% of the claims, if the Supreme Court rules in favour MIBI, an insurance compensation fund may begin paying out 65% of eligible claims.  The Law Society <i>v.</i>the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland court case has significantly delayed the process and the liquidator has reported that it is proving very difficult to settle claims in advance of the outcome of the MIBI appeal.  I would expect to be in a better position to inform the House after the legal proceedings are concluded and the implications of the outcome have been assessed.  That is the up-to-date position on both of those companies.<br/><br/>With regard to when I hope our report will be ready, as I have said, there will be an interim update to the Minister for Finance in October.  At that point, if this committee has concluded its work and provided some sort of consensus on what the actual problems are and how to move on them, that will feed in to our own work and we will have a clearer idea for the Minister for Finance.  We can then spend the remainder of October and November building a road map and an action plan to agree in December in order to put it to work.  In the interim, certain things will happen; I understand the book of quantum will be published quite soon.  There may have been a couple of weeks' delay, but it will have happened in the interim.  We are already looking at the use of technology for detecting fraud or uninsured drivers, or the use of legislation to give more powers to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  These will continue to be progressed.</p><p>They will not wait for our action plans which will, I hope, affirm that we will move to do that in any case. </p><p> The Central Bank holds a large amount of data.  One of the subgroups will do a gap analysis and the Central Bank is working on that subgroup to help identify what data we are missing, what data it has and how these date could be released in a way that would be useful and would not undermine the bank's role as the regulator of the industry or the confidentiality of different agreements.  The Central Bank is involved in work in that regard.</p><p> Senator Kieran O'Donnell also referred to awards made outside of court.  I noted that 70% of the awards are being processed outside of court, with a further 20% processed through the Injuries Board.  The board will probably make the case that the whole purpose of establishing it under a previous process concluded in the early 2000s was to avoid litigation.  If litigation is avoided in 90% of cases, the board is doing its job in one sense.  However, the Injuries Board will also note the lack of transparency in respect of the 70% of cases that are being settled outside of court and issues such as the point at which they are being settled in the system, the way in which they are being settled, the length of time it is taking to settle them and other costs arising in such cases.  It will call for transparency, as I and others have done.  However, this is not a discussion we are having because there is no point in having the joint committee hold a series of robust and vigorous meetings and produce a report and having a working group holding similar meetings, albeit in private.  We are trying to ensure that, as the work progresses on both fronts, the levers of government are used to identify what precisely can be done and what actions can be taken.  This is not about producing a report that will sit on a shelf but about drawing up an action plan and getting something done.  Members of the public will not stand for what is happening and we must be responsible in responding to the issue collectively.  </p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh raised a number of issues and spoke extensively about transparency.  She is absolutely right that we will meet resistance.  The joint committee will meet resistance from the various stakeholders when they appear before it because I have met such resistance in private, although it may not be so evident in public.  A hell of a lot of information is available and it is being used in other jurisdictions.  Companies operating in this jurisdiction share data in all sorts of ways publicly in other jurisdictions.  It is unacceptable that such data sharing is not taking place here.  We must ensure we plan our work with the industry to ensure this issue progresses.  The joint committee will have another opportunity to discuss this issue with AA Ireland and other organisations which have been talking about it a great deal. </p><p> The stability of the insurance market is key.  We must protect ourselves from further market failures, ensure consumers are protected and prevent further unforeseen and unmanageable spikes in insurance premiums.  As I stated, this is not about washing our hands of our ability to set prices.  However, we must make clear to members of the public that we cannot set prices.  We must manage expectations because we cannot require insurance providers to charge X amount for premiums. Insurance companies must taken into account provisioning requirements and Solvency II compliance.  They set prices based on risk.  The work everyone has been doing on this issue in recent months has been informed by people setting out their perceptions of what they are encountering and the engagements they have had.  Deputy Pearse Doherty, for example, spoke about his experience of trying to elicit more information.  We know from this work that different steps can be taken to influence how premiums are set.  We must then try to drive proper structural reforms because there will be no point revisiting this issue five years from now.  Proper structural reforms are needed to ensure we have a properly functioning motor insurance sector.  That is the outcome we must achieve and if we structure the process in a short, medium and long term, we will achieve it.  The joint committee has an important role in helping to set the agenda and build consensus by discussing the various issues that are coming to the table and I do not want to pre-empt any of that work. </p><p> I will consider the possibility of providing our interim report to the committee.  While I do not envisage any problem with doing so, I would first like to discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance.  If we are to address this issue, everyone must be on board.  As such, there is no point in me producing something for the Minister which both he and I believe is great and subsequently getting other Departments, elements of government and State actors involved in an action plan if we then return to the joint committee to be told the plan is no good because we would not get buy-in when the legislation starts to come down the tracks.  I mean it when I say I want to work with committee.  Before I give a firm commitment on this matter, however, I will double-check with the Minister. </p><p> We do not know what role legal costs play because this is a matter of dispute.  Members will hear this argument because we are already hearing it on our side.  We can definitely dig down, find out more information and find out what impact legal costs are having.</p><p>Some players in the industry have indicated that legal costs can account for 60% of settlements they make.  This speaks to cultural problems we have, about which other commentators have spoken.  Deputy John Lahart referred to the journalist Charlie Weston, who has also written about cultural factors.  We have considered these types of cultural factors in terms of what precisely is involved in claims and awards and what people expect.  FBD Insurance has taken a strong public position on this issue and members will be aware of comments made by its chief executive officer on public expectations with regard to the costs of premiums and awards and managing these two competing or conflicting sets of expectations.  A bigger piece of work needs to be done on this issue, which will clearly arise in the public sessions as it has certainly arisen out of the engagements I have had.  </p><p> Rural-proofing is crucial, and I referred to the difficulties we are experiencing in this regard in my opening comments.  As we progress our work, we must examine every type of case study coming through our constituency office doors, whether that of the returning emigrant, the person living in the country, the taxi driver or disabled driver or the driver of a 12 year old car that has passed the national car test and is in great condition.  A car built 12 years ago will be in much better condition after 12 years that a car that was built 30 years ago was after 12 years.  We must ask, therefore, why a 12 year old car is treated differently when it has been found to be safe in the national car test.  We must consider all aspects to ensure we do not miss a trick in finding solutions that will work for everyone.  For example, in respect of returning emigrants, I do not see any reason for not accepting official documentation from other jurisdictions.  If other countries do this, why can we not do it?</p><p> Technology will have a role to play in making the system more efficient.  I am aware of one case study related to what is being done in Canada.  We will examine this issue in terms of the efficiency with which all of this is done.  The industry will point to efficiency factors in terms of costs that contribute to the premiums it sets.  It has not provided me with a drilled-down number similar to the figures it has provided on fraud and uninsured drivers.  However, this is definitely a component part.  Obtaining insurance and tax, passing the NCT and so forth must become much easier and we must ensure all the different technologies are talking to each other.  </p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to deadlines in respect of the four sub-committees.  I spoke about the composition of the four sub-committees before the Deputy joined us.  Each sub-committee has a chair and vice chair.  As they progress their role, the subgroups will identify different stakeholders with which to engage.  As I indicated to the Chairman, it will be a matter for the sub-committees to invite stakeholders to join the committee.  For example, the Central Bank official who chairs one of the sub-committees may pull in any constituent part that needs to be part of the subgroup at any part of the process to take part in the subgroup's work.</p><p> We will examine the business model of the insurance sector and insurance companies.  This will be part of the work of the first subgroup.</p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty asked about deadlines.  I wanted to move with the subgroup model to ensure each aspect of our work received the necessary focus and I was able to interact with each subgroup separately from the plenary working groups to ensure their work was progressing and they were not meeting any unforeseen roadblocks in the process.  This is the approach I want to take.  In terms of deadlines, therefore, we envisage that the interim report to be submitted to the Minister in October will set out areas on which consensus has been achieved in respect of where the problems lie and what immediate actions need to be taken.  As I stated previously, it may be appropriate to return to the joint committee at that point to set out what we are doing in terms of spending the following month or thereabouts trying to secure agreement among the various State and Government actors on specific actions and timelines for starting to implement them.  </p><p> We need to be cautious about managing expectations.  Some things will come on line sooner than others and some may even come on line before the action plan is in place.  I hope they will help.  From my engagements to date, I believe that if we can show a strong working relationship between the working group I am chairing and the joint committee and achieve consensus on certain actions, we will pre-empt any further serious escalations in premiums.  The first subgroup will examine the business model of insurance companies and the issue of transparency, as will the data subgroup, with which it will work closely.</p><p> Solvency II has changed provisioning requirements.  The data we have been shown indicate that insurance companies have been booking losses.</p><p>I will let them explain more about the operating model but we will be looking at that in detail.</p><p> I note that members of the committee have been raising this and it has been very much to the forefront of the importance that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has placed on the different aspects of work.  I spoke about this earlier, in terms of setting up the task force.  What we have seen in the 12 months to July last is the rocket in insurance premium prices.  Increases have been going on for three years.  In the first two years, the year-on-year increases for most motorists could be said to be modest, but in the past year, this 38% figure - circa 40% in most cases - has been incredibly significant.</p><p> What we have seen also in the past year is motorists finding it almost impossible to get an insurance quote.  Deputy Pearse Doherty talked about this aspect.  It is also being considered.  The sector must come up with a realistic insurance quote.  It is not acceptable for it to state that it has offered three quotes when those quotes are completely unaffordable.  That does not solve anyone's problems and it appears to be trying to subvert a process that was put in place to protect consumers.  That definitely will be looked at.</p><p> In terms of the regulation of the sector and the different correspondence Deputy Pearse Doherty has had with the Central Bank, I have met the Central Bank, given its role in this as part of the working group but also its role as regulator of the sector.  Nothing has yet been expressed directly to me regarding those concerns that were expressed to the Deputy by the former Governor, Professor Honohan, but we are in constant contact.  I will check within the Department as to whether it was copied on any of the correspondence sent to the Deputy from the Central Bank.  I will not speak for the Central Bank because it would not be appropriate for me to do so.  I assume the committee will meet the Central Bank at some point in its work and the Deputy will have a chance to tease out some of those issues with it in more detail.  I do not want to speak for the Central Bank but it can speak as to its responsibilities directly in this area.</p><p> There is much better transparency in the United Kingdom and there is no reason we cannot have it here.  We are similar common law jurisdictions.  Indeed, a number of entities operate in both jurisdictions, on the insurance side but also on the legal side.</p><p> I commented on young drivers being refused a quote or given an unfair quote.  There is a process whereby a motorist who is refused a quote on three occasions must be quoted for insurance.  What we are hearing anecdotally is that motorists are being given unrealistic quotes.  It is not that they are being refused a quote; they are given a quote they cannot afford.  That is leading to what we are seeing already and what the evidence shows, namely, a dangerous increase in uninsured driving.  The increase is large.  It is coming from a low base.  In terms of the number of overall claims coming in, it is still very low but it is a worrying development.  There are, as I said, simple technological improvements that can be made and that are happening in other jurisdictions which can help us address that aspect.</p><p> I addressed looking at other models of insurance with Senator Conway-Walsh earlier.  We must look at other models of insurance.  I have looked at the New Zealand model of insurance.  Perhaps I should not be giving a personal view, but I will.  That is not the way to go, rather a care-not-cash model is the way to go.  That is a personal view and perhaps I should not give it, given my role in chairing this working group.  The working group will require big cultural changes in how we go about our business and there will be considerable resistance to some of these changes.  Not all of the changes, if they happen, for example, the care-not-cash model, are positive because it might merely end up displacing costs from one sector of the economy to another, for example, from legal to medical.  It definitely would help in terms of addressing fraud but this requires further examination.  If we can build consensus around this as a route then it will be the way to go but I would not underestimate the difficulty in terms of introducing legislation to make such changes even in that regard, and the kickback that there might be.  Nevertheless, if we believe that it is the way to go, we must fight that case.</p><p> It will be interesting to hear people's different opinions on those possibilities when it comes to the committee's public sessions.  If one looks at the data, one can see the frequency of claims that are related to minor bodily injuries, the award levels for those injuries and how much higher they are then in jurisdictions, what is happening with whiplash and how many more claims there are here than in other jurisdiction, and the evidence that we do not grade whiplash as they do in other jurisdictions.  One could have a panel of medical experts in the injuries board process that could be compulsory if one could make it compulsory under the law and that could assess the degree of whiplash according to a graded scale, and then one would not have this fluctuation in terms of the costs awarded.</p><p>Once one has such fluctuation and uncertainty, it creates a difficulty for the insurance sector because it must make provision for expected costs under the new requirements and if it does not know, it will always book the higher price.</p><p> We are also seeing difficulties around changes in jurisdiction and changes in awards in the courts.  To take the prudent course of action, the insurance firm will say it must book the higher price.  It would be difficult for us to make an argument against that, if it might be seen to undermine the stability of the sector or the functioning of the market and, of course, the Central Bank would have a say in that as well.  However, there are long-overdue improvements and structural reforms that we need to make urgently which, when we get them in train, will make a big difference to how premiums are calculated and the cost of motor insurance for drivers in this country.</p></speech>

Apologies, I missed earlier.  It is one of those days.</p> <p>  Listening to what the Minister of State stated in the radio interview this morning, the key repeated phrase is "managing expectations".  That is not complex code.  It is code stating that what motorists expect is that the massive hikes in premiums and the discrimination against all sorts of different groups of drivers will be reversed.  The Minister of State is correct to think, in terms of the model he has put forward and what the working group will look at, that is unlikely to happen because he and the Government have already tied their own hands behind their back in advance of engaging in this in terms of what they have ruled out.  There will be no directives on pricing because these are private companies and one cannot direct them what to do and there will be fundamentally nothing in terms of regulation - legislative change that forces companies to do different things.  It is not unfair to say what is being talked about is largely tinkering around the edges.</p> <p>  This is not new.  It is a problem that has gone through different phases and there have been particular crisis moments.  These crises have reduced and then returned.  In 2002, there was a report by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board precisely because at that stage there was huge public pressure, there was an outcry about it and something had to be done.  It produced 67 recommendations, many of which were good and were acted on and which had some impact.  However, we are back to where we were before.</p> <p>  An issue the Motor Insurance Advisory Board found and which the Minister of State is partly pointing towards is the co-operation of the insurance companies.  The insurance companies are not likely to be fully transparent.  They are not likely to on their own bat open up their books to show what is really happening because it is in their interest to make as much profit as possible without coming under pressure about that profit.  The board's summary report stated, "It has not been this board's experience that insurers have willingly provided all material information in the fulsome manner which the Minister is entitled to expect."  That, in the unique language of reports, states basically that the insurance companies told the board were to go and it would not get the information sought.  I suspect what the committee and the Government will get is largely the same, namely, more partial information to tell a partial story.  Let us engage in the discussions and let us get the information.</p> <p>  The issue is fundamentally about profit and the for-profit model of car insurance that we have.  It was reported that there was a briefing document to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport which states, "Motor insurers are now imposing higher premium rates to return themselves to profitability or to boost profitability after a number of years of insurers competing for market share, with prices driven down".  Fundamentally, this is about profit and a return to as much profit as can be made by car insurers.  That was not any different in 2002.</p><p>In 2002 they found that between 1983 and 1999 the return on car insurance in Ireland was 11 times greater in terms of profit than in the United Kingdom.  Profits between 2003 and 2008 have been around the 50% mark over percentage of claims.  It is a significant rate of profit for corporations to be making.  As there are huge levels of profit made by these companies, does the Minister of State agree that profit may be the problem?  Does he agree that those companies will fight tooth and nail to maintain those levels of profit because that is what they do?</p><p> The model of car insurance should be part of the discussion instead of individual elements.  There are international examples and it is not just a case of pointing to some socialist dream world where these things exist.  There are state-owned not-for-profit models of car insurance in a number of different countries, including Canada and Australia.  In a number of those countries it is paid for through fuel, so there is no way somebody can be an uninsured driver; if somebody is driving a car, he or she is insured.  That deals with a number of problems and takes profit out of it.  I welcome the Minister of State's personal view that this is not the ideal model, but perhaps in our discussions in committee we can consider the issue in terms of different models in different countries.  We can find different experts.  We can just do what we did in 2002 again and get back to the same point, but a different model is needed.</p></speech>

The working group is set up and doing what it does.  It is made up of officials in various Departments, including those dealing with tourism, justice, jobs, finance, the Central Bank and claims.  We are kind of in the loop but out of the loop in that they are all doing their stuff at meetings and between meetings.  We kind of get involved somewhere along the way but it is not really our job to do the activity of the working group.  They are doing that stuff.  I would like some of what I mention to be investigated by the working group.</p> <p>  The logic seems to be that premiums must rise to pay for the increased cost and volume of claims.  I would like to see the percentage of motorists making claims and the size of claims broken down into legal, medical, compensation and settlement costs.  I agree with everything said by members so far in that we do not know what is going on.  Much of it is invisible because of settlements.  One hears anecdotal stories of insurance company representatives hanging around courts and realising that a certain judge is not there and a different judge, who may tend to give higher payouts, is there instead.  That may lead to a doubling of settlements because the company could still save money in comparison with what might have to be paid if the case went to court.  There is talk of a book of quantum but, although it is nice, they apparently do not have to use it.  I am intrigued by the value of it and whether it can be ignored when it suits.</p> <p>  I would like to see the average cost of claims, the age profile of claimants and whether urban or rural parts of the country have a higher incidence of claims than other areas.  Ultimately, we can try to reduce the cost and number of claims while improving driver behaviour.  We have all been driving at the speed limit on motorways while seeing plenty of cars going past us.  In England and other jurisdictions there are average speed detectors: for example, a car might be clocked on at the Jack Lynch tunnel and clocked off at the Red Cow, and if the car gets from A to B too fast, a penalty is imposed for breaking the law.</p> <p>  I went pretty much all over the country during the Seanad campaign and I did not see many Garda vehicles.  We know the number of garda&iacute; in the traffic corps is down.  People are taking chances and ultimately we end up with claims and injuries because of people not behaving as they should.  There was a reference to technology.</p><p>There must be a way in this day and age of tracking every car in the country.  We all have mobile phones and the companies know where we are.  Every car could have technology to record average and maximum speed as we drive through towns.  In five or ten years that could be in place and perhaps the technology already exists.  A sensor on the car should alert the driver to slow as it is entering a zone with a limit of 50 km/h or 60 km/h.</p><p> Why is whiplash in this country so different from everywhere else?  As a nation, why are our necks or bodies far more sensitive than every other country in Europe?  There was a reference to paying for care, not cash, and I agree there are concerns about legal costs becoming medical costs.  It seems that insurance companies are just paying out rather large amounts to settle a whiplash claim just because somebody said he or she had it.  That is without any serious investigation as to whether the problem is real.  It seems it is cheaper to give people &euro;15,000 than to investigate the issue properly.  One might wonder why an accident involving a tiny tip would lead to this.</p><p> We have a better theory test, provisional licences and improvements on what we used to have.  Driver behaviour should be getting better.  People and their cars are getting older and yet their premiums are rising.  I know a person who reached the age of 80 and the insurance premium went from &euro;800 to &euro;1,360.  That person does not drive too many miles and although the premium was reduced somewhat with negotiation, that 70% increase was just presented to the person.  Most people in this room are probably paying a third more for their insurance.  If the average rise is 36%, most people in the room will be paying more despite not having a claim.  I want to know if the issue lies with 2%, 5%, 15% or 40% of drivers making claims in the past year.  We must have far more information on what we are told is driving the cost.  Private companies will always have a responsibility to shareholders and, in the current set-up, will want to make a fair return.  There is the idea that we can just increase motor insurance by 30% this year - we fear it will be 30% next year and the year after - but our road network is better than it used to be and drivers have more screening than they used to have.  It is not the case that somebody driving for ten or 20 years is just given a licence because of a backlog, as happened a long time ago.</p><p> The working group must present far more data to us.  I am not referring to individuals or bringing privacy to this but I want to know who is claiming, what they are getting and why they are getting it.  We are a small country, and compared with most other EU countries we have a very small motoring population.  We cannot be the only country in the world with a motor insurance issue.  Let us have a look at international best practice and see why we cannot be as good as the better countries in terms of motor insurance cost.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State and the working group, as well as other stakeholders, in this process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090700002#FFF00400"><p>Deputy Paul Murphy referred to the managing of expectations.  I just want to be upfront about the challenges facing us.  As we cannot control price directly, we must ensure we are building appropriate actions into a plan that everybody can buy into in order that we can get something done about the issue.  I do not want to give people the false expectation that by October they will see premiums coming down because I have given a report to the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  That is why I would have mentioned it a few times when speaking publicly about it this morning.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we ruled out.  We ruled out setting the price because that is illegal.  I have not ruled out any legislative changes relating to regulation but none has been requested to date.  The Central Bank has representatives on the committee and is playing a very active role.  That will come immediately to my attention if there is a required need.  The Deputy mentioned that we have been here before, which is correct.  One of the subgroups is considering why the structural changes did not happen or perhaps did not work.  There is a race to the bottom that undermines the market.  One of the reasons given for increasing premiums is that they come as a result of provisioning rules and enforcement by the Central Bank.</p><p>However, it will not be tinkering.  Establishing a claims register to detect fraud by sharing information would not be tinkering.  In fact, it would be quite radical, as would giving stronger powers to the Injuries Board whereby the cases before it would have some sort of legal footing so that people would not be starting from scratch again if their claims had to go before the courts anyway.  The legal profession and the Injuries Board would not call that tinkering but a big deal.  It will require a great deal of work, but that is the way that we want to go.  Putting in place a data hub that affords the transparency that everyone has been discussing is not tinkering.  It is not impossible to do, but it would not be tinkering if we actually achieved it.</p><p> These major changes will have a significant impact.  We need to break down the constituent elements of setting a premium and tackle each.  If we believe that fraud accounts for &euro;50, what are the necessary fraud measures?  A national claims database, new technology to read number plates and linking the NCT to insurance discs and taxation would knock &euro;50 to &euro;80 off the premium, according to the industry.  These would have a dramatic impact on the price.</p><p> I understand why the Deputy might prefer some profit models from abroad, but I prefer the care-not-cash model.  This would not be tinkering if we could achieve it.  I do not like the pay-at-the-pump model because it penalises people who drive more and takes the onus off the insurance sector to be a part of the reform and to provide greater transparency.  It also removes the onus from the legal profession, which is another contributing cost.</p><p> Provisioning rules and what has happened in the market have made it more difficult to book a profit.  The data that I have seen show that a number of the companies operating in Ireland are doing so at a loss when the provisioning is taken into account, given future uncertainty.  This situation may change.  Some of the people whom the committee will be meeting might claim that we have just about reached the appropriate premium pricing and profit is returning to the system.  This point should be examined.  We have discussed related issues in respect of the operation of different industries and the appropriate approach to take.  I have not examined the pay-at-the-pump model in detail yet, but I have explored it a little with a few people.  It would remove the onus to reform in other parts of the sector and penalise people who drive more.</p><p> These hearings are necessary and helpful because they are in public.  During some of the chats that I have been having in private, I have sat there and hoped that others would tell the committee what they were telling me because people need to hear it.  It is not a duplication for this reason, but also because, based on the list of stakeholders with whom the committee is engaging and our own provisional list, we and the committee are meeting different people, which means that we will get different aspects.  The committee might place more of an emphasis on examining consumer concerns, for example, whereas the working group will have to place a balanced emphasis across those who are involved in the industry.  This committee is important because we will need to make legislative changes, which will require buy-in if we are to make them quickly.  There is no point in my going away with a group of interdepartmental officials and devising an action plan that the committee does not support.  That is not in anyone's interests.</p><p> We do not know what is happening, so we need the data.  We have too many worrying anecdotes.  For example, one might hear anecdotes from the insurance sector.  I do not know whether it is possible, but the committee might request a presentation from someone who once worked in that sector and no longer has an interest in keeping schtum.  The industry might be open about this matter, but one hears anecdotally about how and why industry is so quick to settle, the balance of probabilities that it takes into account, etc.  This is worrying at an anecdotal level, so we need the data.  They are there.  We must ensure that we can pull the data together, interrogate them and put them to good use.</p><p> The book of quantum is published in other jurisdictions.  In the UK, I believe it is published by the judiciary.  In such a scenario, there is buy-in from the judges.  We must consider how to strengthen the book of quantum.  I do not want to pre-empt the Injuries Board's appearance before the committee, but it will discuss improvements that it has made to the book of quantum.  They sound like good improvements, although more can be done.  I suppose it will also mention its engagement with the Judiciary, but I do not want to discuss that, as it is for the board to comment on that matter.  It is important to understand that the book of quantum quantifies costs awarded and does not try to set out what costs should be.  However, compiling the awarded costs is helpful, and it is helpful for the Judiciary if those costs are stuck with.</p><p>However, one hears complaints about how changes in jurisdictions have introduced awards that have created uncertainty about what average cost levels should be.  Some of them are doubling.  If a company is trying to provision for possible claims in so far as it is meant to do under Central Bank rules, uncertainty about what the courts will award poses a problem.  The company will try to keep a matter out of the courts by settling more quickly.  We need to weed out and address the many perverse incentives that are in the system.</p><p> Technology is key to improving driver behaviour.  The AA will probably discuss its survey of the level of buy-in from its members to the concept of sharing technology freely as long as they own the data, just as one owns the data in one's mobile phone.  One is probably not aware of what some of the apps are picking up in terms of mapping, etc.  As long as people owned the data, many would be willing to share it, be it from their phones or their cars' telematics.  I like the idea of average speed cameras.</p><p> I can refer to recent personal experience of Garda enforcement.  I have seen quite a number of camera vehicles on the roads clocking drivers, with penalty points and fines arriving in the post.  I have seen increased Garda enforcement as more resources have been devoted to that area by the T&aacute;naiste and the Department.</p><p> The question of tracking every car relates to telematics.  Were it to be put that way, though, one would hit data privacy concerns, with people saying, "No way".  It is a longer-term issue, given how the car industry is beefing up and improving its technologies.  We need to find the right way to achieve buy-in.  Dublin City Council is trying to introduce mandatory 30 km/h speed zones around schools and other areas.  What I would like to see in that regard, although it might be future tech, is inhibiting technology that automatically reduces speed.  That is not Big Brother, but prudence and safety.  That is down the line, though, and there is no point in our focusing on it in the next weeks or months.  There would be no harm in exploring it, of course.</p><p> Ireland has a problem with whiplash.  The committee will hear more about that from witnesses.</p><p> We will provide as much data to the committee as we go.  Senator Horkan suggested that we revert to this committee in October to share what we have learned.  Many people will watch this committee closely, but it will not be able to see the work we are doing.  Reverting might be a good way of showing where we are.  However, I will consult the Minister, Deputy Noonan, before giving a definite commitment.</p></speech>

That includes how the Central Bank handled the issue.  To clarify, the Central Bank did not tell me this.  Rather, it told the Minister of State's boss, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in a letter dated 18 August 2015.</p><p>If the Minister has not informed the Minister of State to whom he has given responsibility in this area that the Central bank has written to him and said that there was an imprudent pricing and underwriting approach taken by the insurance companies, then that is an issue the Minister of State needs to clear up with the Minister for Finance.  This is correspondence between the Minister and the Central Bank that I received through a Freedom of Information, FOI, request.  The question I have is crucially important and one that cannot be brushed under the carpet.  There may be a very legitimate reason for the Central Bank's actions but it is important that the working group, chaired by the Minister of State, would deal with all of these issues.  </p><p> A further extract from the document asserts that "Irish general insurance companies have eroded their capital base".  The next part of the document is blacked out and I assume it contained information on the capital base of the companies.  The document goes on to say the following: "You will have noticed as well that these companies have put in place, at their helm, new CEOs, to effect this return to profitability".  That is what is at the core of this.  The nub of the issue is that these companies eroded their capital base, as the former Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan outlined to the Minister for Finance in August.  They did this because they lost &euro;100 million on investments over two years.  They employed new CEOs, almost across the board, to increase their profitability, as the former Governor pointed out.  They have increased their profitability by increasing premiums by approximately 50% in the last two years.  In some cases, the increases have been in the order of 100% to 200%.  They have made several excuses such as whiplash claims and so forth but the core of the matter is something else entirely.  If that is the reason, that is okay and we need to deal with that.</p><p> It is crucially important that we ensure that this does not happen again in the future.  If the Central Bank was of the view that the insurance companies were taking an imprudent approach to pricing and underwriting what steps, if any, could it have taken to prevent that from happening?  If it could have taken steps to address this, why did it not do so?  This is crucial.</p></speech>

All I am saying is that if the concern of the Central Bank was that legislation was not in place to allow it to perform its regulatory function, that has not been brought to my attention.  If there are concerns that capital requirements are not adequate, that has not been brought to my attention.  Solvency II is a new regime and there is more intense scrutiny by the Central Bank of these companies.  Again, it is up to the Central Bank to speak to that issue.</p> <p>  I do not want to reach any conclusions here.  Deputy Doherty has come to a conclusion and has articulated very strongly his assessment of why premiums have gone up.  He has spoken about the market model and how the competitors acted in that model, as well as the instrument of provisioning that was put in place in terms of capital requirements and what that has meant in the last two years.  If that is the conclusion the committee comes to, then we will have to deal with that.  We must work on this together but I cannot come to that conclusion yet.  </p></speech>

I believe it is the primary reason for the increases but there are other reasons which have also been articulated.  I am not asking the Minister of State to reach a conclusion now.  I am asking him, as the chairman of the working group, to identify why the Central Bank believed that imprudent pricing and underwriting approaches across most business lines resulted in the companies' business plans becoming less resilient to downside risks and what it did, if anything, to address this at that time.  It is crucially important that we know the answers to these questions.  The Central Bank might say that it did not have the power to act and if did not, then we need to make sure to give it that power.  On the other hand, the bank may have been asleep at the wheel.  We need to know why the Central Bank believed this was happening.  The Central Bank is the regulator for these companies and we are under the impression that it would deal with issues such as this because that is its job.</p></speech>

We must raise these matters with the Central Bank.  We are looking at the adequacy of Solvency II and it might be something that needs to be fleshed out with representatives of the Central Bank when they come in.  We need to determine whether the Bank believes it is sufficient.  We need to look at the move from Solvency I to Solvency II and the changes that have occurred in terms of the type of risk-modelling that has to be done for assets and liabilities by insurance companies as well as the inability to cross-collateralise risk, depending on the different parts of an insurance book.  The regime is much more stringent and is making things much more difficult for companies which, for example, have a strong focus on motor insurance, to build up their capital requirements.  One of the reasons given to me as to why a company recently left the Irish insurance market was that it could not meet the capital requirements.  All of this must be looked at but I do not have any answers regarding the view of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

They include the consolidation of disparate insurance regulations in a coherent whole, transposing without further delay the Solvency II directive and giving the bank the power to regulate insurance holding companies effectively.  The Minister of State took on this job at the behest of the Minister for Finance.  My point is that the Minister of Finance was made aware, through correspondence from Professor Honohan, that the Central Bank was seeking additional powers to regulate insurance holding companies and wanted the disparate insurance regulations gathered together into a whole.  We also know that Mr. Moran was aware of this because the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank flagged it to him previously.</p> <p>  I am asking the Minister of State if these powers have been given to the Central Bank.  My understanding is that they have not, even though Solvency II has been transposed since this letter was written over a year ago.  Have these powers been given to the Central Bank?  If not, why not?  Why is the Minister of State not aware that the former Governor of the Central Bank and the Deputy Governor were looking for additional powers to regulate the insurance holding companies effectively?</p></speech>

We had to move on Solvency II.  That is what we had to look at first and that was the most important thing that had to be done.  There is continuing engagement between the Central Bank and the Department on what the next moves might be to make sure that the Bank has the powers it believes it needs.  That is the ongoing situation at the moment.</p> <p>  In so far as the working group is concerned, we are identifying the priority areas.  I said earlier that a number of things are in the pipeline, to which I also alluded in my opening statement, that will take effect in the near future.  Part of the job of the working group is to make sure that we drive those as well and they may come on stream in advance of the actual action plan.  We hope that will happen and I do not want the Deputy to think that they are not being worked on at the moment.  </p></speech>

The Bank wrote to the Minister over a year ago seeking those powers.  When will the Bank be given the necessary powers?  Solvency II was transposed in January of this year and we are now in September.  The Minister of State's response earlier suggested that he was not aware of a request for more powers, despite the fact that Mr. Derek Moran and the Minister for Finance received such a request from both the former Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Honohan and the Deputy Governor, Mr. Roux.  I am seeking a clear answer to my question.  Is it the intention of the Minister of State, his task force or the Department to provide the additional powers that the Central Bank is seeking?  This is particularly pertinent given that since this letter was written, another insurance company operating in the market has gone bust.</p></speech>

I thought that the Deputy was suggesting that the Central Bank was talking about new powers but clearly it was not.  What I mean is that since the committee has met, the Central Bank has not come to us and said, "In addition to the engagements we are having, we are proposing these new powers".  Of course, I was made aware of the interactions between the Central Bank and the officials that were happening prior to my appointment to this role.  Apart from that letter and some other items of correspondence that have come through, nothing new has been suggested since the task force first sat in July.</p><p>That is being developed and we are having those discussions with the Central Bank.

We talked about the increases in insurance premiums, and the CSO gives us the average increase.  The reality is that we have seen, or know of, people who have had increases of 100%, 200% or 300%.  Those are bizarre increases for people who, as the Minister of State mentioned earlier, have made no additional claims or have not incurred penalty points.  I have spoken to a large number of people in the sector and everybody has different views.  When I cited certain examples, it was suggested to me that the insurance companies want those individuals off their books.  They have basically quoted them exorbitant prices just because they may have too many females under the age of 35 on their books, so they increase a premium from &euro;420 to &euro;1,237.  That is nearly a 200% increase.  We have seen some examples of 300% increases.</p> <p>  We all know that we cannot interfere in setting insurance premiums, but insurance companies have to charge based on risk.  Will the Minister of State's working group ask the insurance companies for a sample of the premium renewals they have quoted their customers that were in the 200% or 300% area?  They should be asked to justify, on the basis of risk, how those premiums went up.  It would be an interesting case study to see why Mary, who had a premium last year of &euro;427, is being charged &euro;1,237 this year, although she has had no accidents or penalty points.  The insurance companies should be asked why that is the case.</p> <p>  Earlier on, the Minister of State suggested drilling down into the average premium to see what makes up the different components, which is helpful.  Equally, however, the insurance companies need to be able to justify the increases based on risk.  In some of these cases the increases are unjustifiable, yet the companies are able to get around it because they have too many of a certain cohort of individuals on their books.  They want to de-risk that type of cohort, be it people living in rural areas, young people under 20, or people aged over 85.  It is crucial that the companies be asked to justify such increases.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090700002#MMM00500"><p>Yes.  I am not drawing a conclusion; I am just taking it as what is known within the industry - that that is what is driving an awful lot of cases from the PIAB to court.  When one gets to court, one has not only the solicitor's fees but one also has the barrister's fees and the time taken up in the courts.  In addition, one has a greater settlement impacting on the insurance industry because that is the way it is in the courts.  I am looking at this from the viewpoint of what can be done now or in the medium term to resolve some of this.</p> <p>  How much of the action is actually within our own remit in terms of legislation?  A review of the PIAB legislation, in the context of how it was intended to work and how it is actually working, could be undertaken.  As we discuss this matter, there is a significant upward movement in insurance costs.  If we, as legislators, do not intervene, in terms of the PIAB, it will just shoot way beyond the mark.  My concern is that the PIAB is not working in the way it was intended.  When it first started in 2004, there was a significant change in settlements, which had a positive impact.  That legislation needs to be reviewed, however, because of the issue of payments to solicitors.  We need to take immediate action which would lead to a positive outcome in terms of the work the Minister of State is undertaking.</p> <p>  As we deal with this, I expect it is not so much that we might kick the can down the road.  However, if one of the players in this - that is, the Government - does not take a role in it through legislation, we may very well see further exits from the market.  We may see a further consolidation within the market and, if so, we will definitely see insurance premiums going up.  Zenith went out of the market this week, so all of that is going on.  I am suggesting that we should examine that immediately.</p> <p>  I have another concern about insurance, the NCT and licensing in a number of cases that I have examined where premiums were being renewed.  For example, one young woman was being quoted &euro;2,300 which was up almost 100% on the previous year.  However, when she went a different route, it was reduced to &euro;1,300 by another company on the basis that she would do a test.  Look at the difference in the premiums.  Is there now not enough confidence in our NCT and licensing that an insurance company would take that route?  </p> <p>  The haulage industry has been hit and that impacts on the economy.  Some haulage operators have seen insurance increases of 50% last year and 50% again this year.  It is just not sustainable.</p><p>When they engage with individual members of the committee, they are looking for explanations and immediate action because all the costs associated with the haulage and transport industry will get passed down the line.  At the end of the day, the consumer will take the brunt of all of this.  It is inexplicable that young and old people travelling to work are now being forced to look at paying enormous insurance costs.  A taxi driver told me the other day that his insurance costs have increased by &euro;50 per week.  The Minister of State mentioned that an interim report will be ready in October.  I respect the work he is doing.  It is obvious from his contribution to today's meeting that he is on top of his brief.  The Injuries Board legislation will delay this process.  Maybe it would be better to front-load it and look at it now.  That is the reality of the claims.</p></speech>

I agree that we should not follow fanciful things around technology and telematics in the car industry, although I would be very interested in looking at such matters at a later stage in the work of the working group.  We have to look at what we can do immediately.  We are looking at the Injuries Board legislation at the moment.  That is being done in the Minister's Department.  We probably need to do a bit more.  My understanding is that we need to toughen our approach to that legislation and some of the potential changes we could make in it to ensure people cannot fall out of the process as easily as they seem to now.  Consensus will be required from this committee when the legislation comes before it so that it can be supported and enacted.</p> <p>  I believe the committee will be impressed when representatives of the Injuries Board appear before it.  I was very impressed when I met them.  It would be good if we could all listen to them.  If this committee wants to structure its priorities in that way - by saying this will take some time, so we should do it first and nothing else - I will be open to that approach.  As I have said, we can do this in tandem with other things that are under way without distracting from the focus of getting something done immediately.  I emphasise that we can act immediately.  The sooner we act, the sooner we will see some sort of sense coming back to market pricing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090700002#NNN00400"><p>A number of factors need to be considered in this context so we can improve the Injuries Board.  In addition to looking at the legislation that underpins the board, we can look at legislation relating to the provision of legal services, the obtaining of medical tests and the availability of data.  For example, we can look at the grading of different types of whiplash.</p><p>The legislation underpinning the Injuries Board is being examined at present.  In addition, consideration is being given to legislation in other areas that is directly relevant to how the board does its work and how we can ensure the Injuries Board is the <i>de facto</i>place for activity of this kind.  If it is not the <i>de facto</i>place, we need to make sure anyone who is settling before or after the board does its work settles at basically the same price.  When the officials from the Injuries Board come in, they will say that the main intention behind the establishment of the board in the first instance is being achieved.  The evidence for that is the fact that just 10% of cases are going to litigation.  They will also mention that they do not have transparency in 70% of cases.  I would listen to what they have to say because they have a number of good ideas.</p><p>The Chairman is right when he speaks about the damage that is being done to competitiveness in the economy.  This is affecting individuals and industries in the economy.  We are also seeing the significant risk of no insurance.  According to the industry, this is adding to premiums.  Taxi drivers are in a very difficult situation.  I was in a taxi when someone attempted to cause a fake accident.  Taxi drivers are able to spot how and when this happens.  Some people believe taxi drivers are quicker to settle in cash, without even going to insurance companies, because of the damage claims can do to their insurance policies.</p><p>All sorts of things are happening and are not even being recorded.  These things are negative consequences of the current situation we have.  We need to find ways to address all of them.  If the committee decides in two or three weeks' time, after it has done this work, that it considers the Injuries Board, and the attendant factors to the Injuries Board in relation to the different areas of legislation, is the way to go, I will come back in then and we will look at it in terms of the work we have done on our side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090700002#OOO00100"><p>I put it to the Minister of State that legal fees comprise the most significant inbuilt cost in most of the claims that are settled in court.  One must ask why just 20% of cases are settled through the Injuries Board.  It is possible that legislation or regulation is the only lever we have.  My strong belief is that the Government should be showing intent in respect of all the vested interests in the insurance industry by making it clear we are serious about leading the way and doing certain things.  There is obviously something wrong with the market because companies are leaving it.  My greatest fear is that a further consolidation in the market will lead to an upward-only change in premiums.  That is a certainty.  If the Government can intervene by leading the way in terms of taking legislative action - it needs to do more than arrange hearings, etc. - it will force the vested interests to see that the game is up and that this House is intent on doing its business.  Neither data protection nor anything else should get in the way of having an industry that is capable of dealing with the claims and so on that come before it.  There is a need for certainty about the legal process involving the Injuries Board or otherwise.  We should be taking that action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016090700002#OOO00200"><p>The Chair is absolutely right when he expresses fears about people leaving the market and what that might mean.  He is also right when he says the Government should come with actions.  I will take action.  The sooner we can show consensus between the Government and the Opposition parties, the sooner we will send the right signal to the industry and the other players that something is about to happen.  I hope that can have a calming effect in terms of preventing any unnecessary spikes in premiums before the actions actually begin to take hold.</p> <p>  I would like to set out what I think the committee will hear about the costs associated with awards being given in court.  Representatives of the industry will probably say that 60% of these costs can be attributed to legal fees.  Certain players in the industry have voiced an expectation that when an accident happens or damage is done, people will go looking for an amount to cover the fixing of the car, but they will also look for more than that as an additional type of compensation.  That is a cultural issue.  A CEO in the industry made the point that we cannot have low premiums and high court awards.  We need to bear such cultural factors in mind.  I think the committee is right to focus on the Injuries Board.  I believe, on the basis of the engagements I have had, that such cultural factors can be avoided.  The industry wants certainty because it needs to provide against uncertainty.  Volatility does not help it to make such provision, so it always provides for the higher cost.  Even if the Injuries Board were beefed up, more transparency would help because it would give the industry certainty about what it needs to provide against.  If the number of cases coming through the Injuries Board were to increase by 50%, it would mean that 30% of cases would be coming through the Injuries Board, 10% of them would be going to litigation and 60% would be dealt with outside the Injuries Board.  I think that would help to have a calming influence on premiums.</p></speech>

If that person receives an award for the repair or his or her car and for a health issue or injury that might have arisen from the incident, that is what insurance is for.  Insurance is not for what is happening now, which is the legal profession getting a massive amount of money.  That is what seems to be happening in these settlements.  There might have been a better opportunity to settle for smaller money, at far less cost, in the Injuries Board.  I understand the Minister of State's strategy for dealing with this.  I respect his wish to get everyone to buy into it.  I would like to see the Government leading the way by saying it is going to do this by introducing legislation with regard to the Injuries Board or whatever it might be.  That would really show the market that we are serious about this.  I think the Opposition is serious about it.  The Government needs to be serious about it.  If the Minister of State acts in this manner, he will get buy-in and everything else will begin to fall into place.</p></speech>

As far as the public is concerned, I have met many people who battled with their insurance companies about increased premiums and succeeded in having them reduced.  The public have a role in this too.  People should not take increases in their premium at face value.  They should engage with their insurance companies and seek reductions, thus bringing attention to this issue, which is critical to all of our lives, as we want to be insured.</p></speech>

With me from the Department are Mr. John Conlon, Mr. Denis Moynihan, Ms Roshin Sen and Mr. Tony Crean.</p> <p>  As requested, my statement will be relatively short and will outline my priorities in the Department of Social Protection, particularly in a budgetary context.  However, I am also very keen to listen to, and understand, the views of committee members on what they see as the key social protection issues in the years ahead.</p> <p>  It is useful in the first instance to outline the scope and scale of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure and its importance for millions of citizens in our country.  Our budgetary allocation for this year is &euro;19.625 billion.  This represents 38% of gross current Government expenditure.  We also have a capital budget, but this is very small.  Expenditure to the end of August was just short of &euro;13 billion and is very close to target for the year to date.  We more or less expect to come in on budget.  Each week, approximately 1.37 million people, including pensioners, people with disabilities, people on sick leave, those on maternity leave - and, since this week, paternity leave - as well as carers and jobseekers, receive a payment from the Department.  In addition to this, more than 625,000 families receive child benefit each month for almost 1.2 million children.</p> <p>  Committee members are no doubt aware there is a misconception that most welfare payments go to the unemployed.  This is not the case; in fact, it is far from it.  The biggest single block of expenditure in 2016 will be on pensions, which will amount to &euro;7 billion, or 36% of overall expenditure.</p><p>Expenditure on working age income supports includes jobseeker's benefit, one-parent family payment and maternity and paternity benefit.  It will account for &euro;4 billion, or 20%, of overall expenditure.  The expenditure provision for illness, disability and carers will amount to &euro;3.5 billion, or 18%, of expenditure.  The expenditure on children and families will account for 13%, or approximately &euro;2.6 billion, of which &euro;410 million will be spent on the family income supplement paid to low income working families.  Expenditure on employment supports includes community employment schemes, Gateway, T&uacute;s, back to education, back to enterprise and all of the other various employment programmes which amounts to &euro;1.1 billion, or 6%, of the Department's budget.  Expenditure on supplement payments like rent supplement, agencies like the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Citizens Information Board and miscellaneous services accounts for &euro;867 million, or 4%, of the budget.  The main supplementary payments, as Members will be aware, are rent supplement, the household benefits package, the fuel allowance and free travel.</p><p> The primary focus of the last Government was to repair the economy and save Ireland from national bankruptcy.  Unemployment reached a crisis peak of over 15% but CSO data now show that the latest monthly unemployment rate is 8.3%.  Long-term unemployment, that is, people who have been unemployed for more than a year, stands at 4.4% and represents a reduction of over 50,000 people in the past two years.  There are now more than 2 million people in employment for the first time in almost a decade, with an additional 56,200 people in work over the past year.  At the end of August, there were nearly 43,000 fewer people on the live register than the same time last year and 82,000 fewer people than this time two years ago.  The live register peaked at 470,000 in mid-2011, which was shortly after the change of Government.  We are on track for the live register to go below 300,000 in the next couple of months.  The figure remains too high but it is worth noting that the last time the figure was below 300,000 was in December 2008, which was before the financial crisis or just as it was starting to unfold.</p><p> The ongoing fall in the live register is freeing up resources that we need to meet additional demand in other areas such as pensions, people with disabilities and carers.  We estimate that we will need another &euro;200 million in 2017 to cover the cost of an increasing number of pensioners, and that is before any increase in rates.</p><p> The question that will arise in the coming weeks is how to build a sustainable budget that will benefit all of our people, young and old, rural and urban, in the workforce and not in the workforce, and to do so in such a way that does not spread scarce resources so thinly as to not make much of a difference.</p><p> There have been a number of important developments in 2016 which I will touch on.  First, I have honoured the Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael agreement and the programme for Government commitment to increase rent supplement limits.  The new measure is in place since 1 July and means maximum rent limits have increased in every part of Ireland.  I know that rents are back to what they were at peak or higher and so is rent supplements.  They vary from county to county and from household type to household type but they have been restored, in most cases, to where they were at rent peak, or higher still.  The extent of the increase reflects the rise in rents in each location for each household type.   For example, there has been a 25% average increase in Laois and Roscommon; a 21% average increase in Leitrim, Cork city, Longford and Galway city; a 29% average increase in Dublin; a 19% average increase in Westmeath, Kildare and Louth; and a 15% average increase in Cavan and Donegal.  This varies according to household size, as do market rents.  In some cases, there are variations within counties.  Kildare is a county that has two very different rental markets - one is located very close Dublin and the other is quite different.</p><p> Provision remains in place for discretionary increases on a case-by-case basis.  For example, where somebody needs a higher rent supplement than the limit in order to remain in his or her house, Department officials can grant a discretionary increase.  As many as 10,000 discretionary increases have been granted in total.  Since the increase in rent supplements, the number of people who have come looking for a discretionary increase, and needed it, has been pretty minimal.  There has been a more than 90% reduction in the need for discretionary increases.  On one level that demonstrates the case that other parties may have made that rent supplement should have been increased sooner but it also indicates now that the problem is less the rent supplement limit than finding somewhere to rent.  The major issue now is supply.</p><p> I am delighted that the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act was enacted over the summer.  The legislation was brought through the D&aacute;il and Seanad by my colleagues, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton.</p><p>My Department starts making paternity benefit payments this month to social insurance contributors, including the self-employed.  This is an example of the social insurance system adapting and responding to the changing needs and wishes of families in this country as well as changes in the labour market.  My Department is currently undertaking an awareness campaign for the scheme to ensure that eligible parents take it up.  I would appreciate the committee's assistance in directing anyone with queries to the Department&rsquo;s website, where there is detailed information on how to apply.  More information can be found at <i>welfare.ie/paternitybenefit</i>.<br/><br/>As was the case in 2014 and 2015, when the Christmas bonus was paid, there is currently no provision for a Christmas bonus in the Department&rsquo;s allocation for 2016.  In 2014 and 2015, the Government was ultimately in a position to pay the bonus given the continuing improvement in the State&rsquo;s financial position.  The State&rsquo;s financial position is improving again in 2016 and I will, therefore, be seeking approval from my Government colleagues in the coming months for the payment of a Christmas bonus once again this year.  Any announcement will have to be made on budget day in October.<br/><br/>Looking ahead, the programme for Government contains a number of commitments on social protection.  These include increasing pensions and the living alone allowance, protecting free travel for pensioners and people with disabilities and a rate increase for people with disabilities and carers.  The programme also outlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of a new working family payment to reduce child poverty and make work pay, ensuring that no family is better off on welfare than in work.  This is, of course, a five year programme and everything cannot be done in one or two budgets.  However, they will be done. <br/><br/>The benefits and pensions that social welfare recipients receive are funded by both PRSI contributions through the Social Insurance Fund and general taxation through the Exchequer Vote.  As a result, I believe we need a strong consensus across society on the importance of a comprehensive social welfare system, whereby the PRSI contributions and taxation paid by all workers, including the self-employed, provide adequate, sustainable and appropriate benefits when required.  I want a welfare system and, in particular, a social insurance system which responds to life&rsquo;s risks such as losing one's job, long-term illness and parenting.  None of us knows when we might require the support of these schemes or the services operated by the Department.  However, what we all know is that we want those supports to be available if we, or loved ones, families or friends need them. <br/><br/>I want to reinforce the contributory principle by strengthening the social insurance system.  I want to enhance the treatments available under the treatment benefit scheme, which was significantly cut back during the austerity years.  This includes dental and optical benefits.  As Members will be aware, I want to extend the level of social insurance coverage available to the self-employed.  This is a personal priority for me and I have requested that the Department carry out a major survey of the self-employed to find out what new benefits they would most like to receive from social insurance reforms planned in future budgets.  The deadline for the survey was 31 August and there was a very good response to it.  The results are currently being analysed and I will share them with the committee in the coming weeks.  These plans form part of the Government&rsquo;s new deal for the self-employed, which will encompass tax, welfare changes and greater supports for entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>I should point out that this year, for the first time in many years, the Social Insurance Fund will be in surplus, having been in deficit for a number of years.  That has happened for two reasons.  First, the economy has been recovering.  The second reason is the reforms, some of which were unpopular but necessary, made by the previous Government and my forebearer, the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton.  Now we are in a strong economic period, it is important that we keep that fund in surplus and run surpluses so that there is a surplus available when the next recession comes, which it surely will.  We need to ensure that any changes we make to social insurance are sustainable and are based on contributions because without contributions going in, nothing can come out on the other side.<br/><br/>The summer economic statement outlined that there will be approximately &euro;1 billion of fiscal space available for new initiatives across all Departments in budget 2017.  Roughly one third will provide for tax reductions and two thirds for additional spending.  Clearly, if we were to do all that we would like to do, big Departments like mine and the Departments with responsibility for health or housing could spend it all on their own, but that would not be right or fair.  Therefore, choices will have to be made; everything cannot be done in one year.</p><p> On 22 July, I hosted the Department's annual pre-budget forum, during which I listened to the views of representatives from 40 non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and advocacy and representative organisations.  The forum was extremely useful and it provided me and my officials with a much greater insight into the competing priorities within the sector.  Bearing this in mind, rather than a shopping list of items that cannot be purchased, what I would welcome from the committee is input on what it believes should be the two or three main priorities for me in the budget talks.  I will then provide the committee with the cost of and knock-on effects in that regard.  Anything that is changed in social protection has a knock-on effect somewhere else.  There are things that I can take up in the budget talks and I look forward to receipt of the committee's advice in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016090700002#L00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the committee and thank him for his presentation.  There are a number of matters I would like to advert to.  In regard to the self-employed, I welcome the Minister's statement that this area is a personal priority for him.  It is an area Fianna F&aacute;il has been concerned with and in respect of which it has put forward specific proposals over the past couple of years, as the Minister will be aware.  The Minister mentioned that the cost to the State of providing a jobseeker's benefit scheme in respect of the self-employed would be &euro;87 million and the cost in that regard in terms of invalidity pension would by &euro;78 million.  What is the position in relation to illness benefit?  I am aware that the advisory committee dealt with the issue of long-term illness.  However, people who are self-employed can become ill on a short term basis also.</p> <p>  On the advisory group report on tax and social welfare, I do not agree with the group's conclusions on jobseeker's benefit.  However, as that is not central to what we are discussing today I do not propose to state my objections in that regard.  On illness benefit, Fianna F&aacute;il has always envisaged that any extension of social insurance to the self-employed would be done on a gradual basis, starting with people who become ill.  The issue with which the advisory group wrestled is whether this could be done on a voluntary or a compulsory basis.  It came down in favour of it being done on a compulsory basis because, it states, if it was done on a voluntary basis this could lead to the selection of bad risks.  There is no guarantee that it would but it could lead to a selection of bad risks.</p> <p>  If my interpretation of the group's conclusions is correct it is also of the view that this cannot be done because it has not been done before.  In other words, we never do things like this and so we cannot start now despite the fact that a wholly or partially voluntary system is in place in other developed countries of the European Union, including France, Germany, Spain, Finland, etc.  If all of those countries have managed to do this on a voluntary basis, why can it not be done in Ireland?  There is much talk about a system of auto-enrolment, whereby people would contribute extra to protect their State pensions, with people being opted in and also in a position to opt out if they so choose.  If one can have a system of auto-enrolment for employees I do not see why it is not possible to have a system of auto-enrolment for the self-employed.</p> <p>  An issue raised towards the end of the Minister's contribution on the social insurance system for the self-employed is the possibility of the income limit for entitlements being raised from &euro;38 per week to, I think, &euro;70 per week.  I fail to see the logic of that.  For example, if the limit was raised to &euro;70 it would save employers 8.5% of the difference between &euro;38 and &euro;70 per week, which is approximately &euro;2.60 per week.  As I said, I do not see the logic in that.</p> <p>  I take the Minister's point that the bulk of expenditure on the social protection side is on pensions.  There is a democratic imperative here.  If we decide to pay people a pension at a particular age then we have no choice but to pay them that pension when they reach that age, whether they have sufficient contributions to make it a contributory pension or whether it is a non-contributory pension.</p><p>They are entitled to it.</p><p> I note that in some reports that have been issued, some learned people have come to the conclusion that the impact of the recession has fallen least hard on pensioners.  Of course, that depends on how one juggles the figures and what one takes into account.  Learned reports saying that the recession has impacted pensioners less than anybody else is of cold comfort to people who are living their lives - I know many of them and I am sure that other members of the committee know them as well - in a state of abject misery because of the extra expenses they are incurring because of their growing old.  There are medical expenses, heating, etc.  I know people who stay in bed half the day in bad weather to save on heating.  Social welfare working age payments were reduced and, admittedly, pensions were not.  However, they were frozen until last year.  Even with the increase last year, it is estimated that pensioners are about 5% worse off now than in 2010.  They have 5% less purchasing power.  That is only on the basic pension alone and does not take into account the loss of the free telephone rental allowance, the reduction in the fuel allowance, the reduction in the household benefits package and things like the abolition of the bereavement grant.  There have been many changes in the overall system such as prescription charges, the introduction of property tax, water charges, restrictions on tax relief for medical expenses, the reduction in home help hours and the reduction in housing adaptability and mobility grants, all of which have particularly and disproportionately affected pensioners.  I do not think that any of the bodies that compile those figures has taken that into account.</p><p> Pensioners are on a fixed income.  They do not have the opportunity to get a job or to be re-educated to become nuclear physicists or something like that.  They are retired people who have lived all their lives in the country contributing to it.  The least we can do, now that the economy is improving, is to ensure that they can live out their declining years with some measure of dignity.  That was recognised in all of the election manifestos, both our own manifesto and the Minister's party's manifesto, in which there was a commitment to increase pensions by &euro;25 per week by 2021 on the assumption that the Government would last for five years.  That is &euro;5 a year.  For people living alone, I noticed that the increase would be &euro;30, which is &euro;6 per year for five years, if the Government lasts five years.  In its wisdom, the electorate has thrown up result which makes it less likely - if I can put it like that - that the Government will last five years.  Therefore, I believe it is imperative that we begin this process immediately.</p><p> I do not want to go on for too long.  We had many debates with the Minister's predecessor, particularly myself and the then Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, about the changes to the lone parent's allowance.  If the Minister goes back and studies the debates, the warnings we issued at the time have unfortunately come to pass.  Lone parents are now less well off when they go to work as a result of changes made in the provisions relating to them.  That was cushioned to a certain extent by the introduction of a thing called the family dividend.  However, I could read the Minister letters and e-mails from lone parents until 12 o'clock tonight telling me that things are beginning to bite again now because the family dividend goes down 50% at the end of the first year and it will be completely gone next year.  It is only a two-year cushion that goes down by 50% after the first year.  If one looks at the poverty statistics, lone parents are the highest in relation to consistent poverty, risk of poverty and deprivation.  Some of the figures are truly appalling there.</p><p> I want to give other people a chance to come in and I do not want to hog the time of the committee.  The Minister said that he wanted a short shopping list.  His own shopping list is fairly long because I noticed in the programme for Government that every possible area is covered.  However, I take his point that not everything can be done in one budget and he wants to know where we should prioritise.</p><p>The social insurance scheme for the self-employed, pensioners, lone parents - possibly carers - and those in receipt of disability benefits should be our priorities in the context of the forthcoming budget.</p></speech>

I commend the work of all the staff in the Department of Social Protection.  They work under difficult circumstances and make difficult decisions every day of the week.  I concur with Deputy O'Dea, who outlined some issues.  Some of the things I see as being a priority, as does Sinn F&eacute;in, would overlap with those referred to by Deputy O'Dea.  I think there may have been a veiled threat about the length of the Government term, but we will not go there.</p> <p>  The first area I wish to touch on is the issue of poverty.  Social Justice Ireland estimates that there are more than 750,000 people throughout the State living in a constant state of poverty.  However, I have yet to see a comprehensive Government policy on how the State will deal with this.  The Department has had to revise its figures for the target of how many people it would remove out of poverty, particularly children.  The number of those it wanted to move out of constant poverty by 2020 was 70,000 but that has been increased to 97,000.  That the Department has been obliged to revise its own figures by 35% shows there is no comprehensive policy in place to deal with poverty.  I mentioned the figures from Social Justice Ireland.  We also have CSO figures which show that in the region of 230,000 children are living in a constant state of poverty.  This is up 12,000 in a single year despite the so-called economic recovery.</p> <p>  This Government and its predecessors have taken measures in the context of targeting lone parents.  Again, I concur with Deputy O'Dea on what he said.  The cut to the lone-parent family payment and the change in the qualification in respect of the age of children from 14 years to seven years has had a detrimental impact on lone parents.  We know from the evidence available that lone parents are at the biggest risk of poverty.  During the summer there were some high-profile cases that showed the impact measures introduced by the previous Government have had on access to education, the back to education allowance and so on.  I know the Department is in the process of bringing forward a report on the barriers to lone parents accessing education.  Perhaps we can get an update on that.</p> <p>  I deal with people every day who are experiencing fuel poverty.  It is estimated by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that 28% of our citizens are experiencing some type of fuel poverty.  We know the measures that were introduced by previous Governments, such as the cut to the fuel allowance from 32 weeks to 26 weeks, and the impacts they have had.</p><p>We have all heard the cases and the real-life stories of elderly people, in particular, having to sit in public buildings and libraries and to take train journeys to try to avail of heat.  I have spoken to many people who would get on the train to Rosslare, County Wexford, from County Wicklow a couple of times a week to get some heat because they could not afford to turn on the heating in their own home.  I know there was a minor adjustment in the payment from &euro;20 up to &euro;22.50, which was welcome, but if one has a look at the cuts that have been imposed over the course of a year, &euro;120 was cut in terms of the loss of the week.  Is that is going to be addressed in the budget?  I believe it is a key area that needs to be addressed.  We know that winters are, unfortunately, getting longer and temperatures are dropping.  We have had that experience over the last number of years.  I ask whether that is going to be addressed.</p><p> Another issue I have raised with the Minister in the D&aacute;il is the back to school costs.  It is very much a topical issue at this time of year.  Again, numerous reports have been brought out, such as the annual Barnardos report and the report of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  They have put the cost of going back to school at &euro;900 for a primary school pupil and anything up to &euro;1,500 for a secondary school pupil.  We know the cuts that have been implemented and the impact that they have had on people.  The Minister, as opposed to answering the questions that I put to him directly in the D&aacute;il, used what is now regarded as a long-established Government tactic of hitting back and not answering the question.  He started using some example of what is in place in the North.  Again, what he said was totally incorrect.  In the North, all textbooks are free, public transport is free for pupils living more than two miles away from their schools and there are school meals.  We are certainly not comparing like with like.  The cost of sending children back to school in this State is substantially higher.</p><p> The measures that have been introduced by previous Governments have impacted dramatically on many families and have driven them into the arms of loan sharks.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Irish League of Credit Unions which is making loans available to people who otherwise might find it difficult.  What is the Minister going to do to address this issue?  Will he look at increasing the back to school clothing and footwear allowance?  As I said, costs are escalating.  Many schools are moving towards iPads and there are associated costs with that as well as schoolbooks, etc.  Can I get some specific answers on that?</p><p> The Minister mentioned the paternity benefit.  My party certainly welcomed and supported it.  It was something that was a long time coming.  However, an issue has arisen there which affects fathers.  If in the unfortunate situation where the child dies - I think the period is 24 weeks - the mother is entitled to the benefit but the father is not and has to go back to work straight away.  The mother is entitled to two weeks' payment but the father is precluded.  There have been a couple of examples of that in the recent past.  This is a serious anomaly that is forcing fathers, who should be entitled to this payment by right, back to work, leaving the mother who is entitled to the benefit for the two weeks at home.  At a time like that, when the mother needs as much support as possible from the father, he should be able to stay at home.  After a period of 24 weeks, if in the unfortunate situation where the child passes away, such as being stillborn at 24 weeks, the mother is entitled to the benefit but the father is not.</p><p>He has to go back to work and this is a serious flaw that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

In a report from the ESRI, looking at the social impact of budgets between 2009 and 2016, it states that the greatest losses imposed by budgets between 2009 and 2016 were for single, unemployed people.  The measures which were brought in attacked people under the age of 26 by reducing their social welfare payments to &euro;100.  They were discriminatory and need to be addressed.  For the many people who live on their own, this is not sustainable.  Will the Minister address this?  There have been a number of cuts over the years for those under 26 and this needs to dealt with immediately.</p> <p>  The Minister made many announcements over the summer about job activation schemes and there was a lot of flag flying.  A serious issue arose when an audit carried out into JobBridge identified serious issues in the scheme dating back to earlier in the year.  The Minister has already said it is his intention to bring forward a replacement for JobBridge.  Are we close to seeing the detail on that?  My predecessor, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, raised serious concerns about JobBridge, as I have done.  The Minister said he did not know of any concerns about the scheme and that none had been brought to his attention.  The auditors carried out the audit and it is sitting somewhere.  I have written to the Minister asking to see it as it is essential it is seen by all Members.</p></speech>

It is critical that we look at what the auditor has identified before any new scheme comes forward.  My party has put forward alternatives to JobBridge and whatever the Minister brings forward should not amount to an exploitation of people for a minuscule amount of money.  There are real alternatives and I hope the Minister takes them on board.</p> <p>  In response to questions on the subject, the Minister said he would have a look at JobPath and at Turas Nua and Seetec.  A review of these is now well overdue as there are serious issues, particularly regarding Turas Nua and Seetec.  The Minister asked me to come back to him if I had heard of any issues about which people had been in touch with me.  There are many, one of which involved a man who found a job in his own right, independently of Turas Nua and Seetec, but was hounded by Seetec, a private company, which wanted to know who his employer was.</p><p>There is a payment for operators if they have found employment for someone but Seetec hounded that man until he handed over details of his new employer.  I am not sure whether Seetec was trying to claim a financial reward for finding work for the man in question but, as I understand matters, it had nothing to do with Seetec.  Another man, highly qualified but out of work, was hounded by the same body to find a job.  The latter is qualified as a journalist.  He was told not to wait around for a dream job but to look for something "a bit beneath him", with examples of work on building sites and in warehouses cited.  He was threatened with having all his payments cut if he did not take a job that was beneath him.  There are many other cases which I could talk about, but will not.  I ask for a commitment from the Minister that he will review these cases.  Any process would need to be initiated before the budget.</p><p> The discretionary clothing allowance, which was decided on by CWOs, was cut by the previous Minister.  There was a lot of debate on it and there were some suggestions that it had been used for purposes for which it was not originally intended.  Many elderly people were entitled to this payment to buy clothes and would buy themselves a heavy coat with the money in January or February, or a suit for a funeral when there had was a bereavement in the family.  The payment has been completely done away with and this needs to be addressed.  We might not be able to bring it back in its previous form but there needs to be some allowance for elderly people.  The bereavement grant was also done away with and also needs to reinstated.</p></speech>

This relates to bogus self-employment, an issue on which the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Finance commissioned a report.  Over the summer months I talked to many young professionals who said they were continually being offered jobs as self-employed workers, when the jobs in question were really for employees.  This results in a loss of PRSI to the Department and a loss of benefits to the person who is forced into bogus self-employment.  I ask the Minister to look at the report and to publish it as soon as possible.  He should look at the possibilities in the report for additional sources of revenue, to ensure that funds stay in surplus and money can be paid out.</p> <p>  The previous speaker mentioned micro loans, which have been successful since the Minister launched them on a nationwide basis.  The money involved constitutes some &euro;100 million to tackle moneylenders and is an anti-poverty measure which I know the Minister will continue to support.  It would be extremely useful to get the idea of the standard bank account across the line, and there has been a commitment from the financial institutions to support this.  If people on social welfare and on low incomes had access to standard bank accounts, they would be able to pay their heating and lighting bills online and this alone would bring them an additional &euro;500 per year.</p><p>That is a tenner a week for a fairly small measure.  As part of its social dividend the financial sector gave a commitment to sponsor or put money into the pot for the standard bank account.  A lot of work was done on it but it did not, unfortunately, get across the line so I ask the Minister to prioritise that area continually.</p><p> JobsPlus has been quite successful in helping people back into employment by enabling employers to take people on a little earlier.  People in their late 50s are a specific case.  Those who lost their job at the height of the recession are at the wrong age and employers are not anxious to take them on.  Most initiatives are targeted at youth unemployment.  A specific measure in JobsPlus could help a lot of older people back into the market and the Minister might have a look at that in the context of his budget priorities.</p><p> I will move now from short-term budget priorities to the long term - perhaps a period of two, three or four years.  One of the major challenges for the Department of Social Protection and the Minister is pensions.  I would welcome a very early engagement on pensions with a view to developing a model, and Deputy Willie O'Dea mentioned automatic enrolment in this context.  As we move on from a difficult recession we need to plan for our next challenges down the road, and the biggest financial challenge the State faces is on pensions.  The sooner we start plotting and planning our way through that issue, the less detrimental it will be to individuals, society and the economy.</p></speech>

As Deputy Brady said, the system is discriminatory against young people who cannot find work.  They are being discriminated against because of their age and it has very serious implications.  Single parents are also being discriminated against.  Are there plans to continue discriminating against people on grounds of their age and their unfortunate position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016090700002#R00500"><p>I will try to avoid wider policy issues but will focus on the budgetary issues.  However, I want to comment on the costings for some of the proposals we have heard.  I appreciate the quality of material we get from the Department but it would be useful to have a sense of how measures impact on consistent poverty.  The Department has worked on minimum essential standards of living and it would be useful to know how our current payment rates compared with the Department's figures in that area.</p> <p>  A priority area that has been mentioned at some length is that of lone parents.</p><p>If we are looking at the consistent poverty targets that the Department has outlined for itself - reducing consistent poverty to 4% by this year, which is obviously not yet achieved, and to 2% by 2020 - then the fact that we have a consistent poverty rate of 22% for lone parents must be treated as a matter of urgent concern.  It must be a priority.  I am aware that the Department is examining this area and I urge it to ensure that resources are allocated within the budget to allow it to respond in that area.</p><p> I have two specific recommendations and I hope we will have a chance to debate this area in more detail in the future.  I recommend the resourcing of a financial impact assessment and, for those who would qualify for jobseeker's transitional payment, looking at providing that somebody could be on both family income supplement and jobseeker's transitional payment, although it would be suitably means tested to ensure that it is not anomalous.  That would come with a cost but it would address many concerns.  The other concerns, in relation to the anomalies involving the back-to-education allowance, SUSI grants and rent supplement, are not as simple as a payment rise but, because they would increase the number of people qualifying for certain schemes, resources would need to be allocated in the budget.</p><p> I would like to highlight one particular vulnerable group.  The McMahon report highlighted those in direct provision.  The payment has remained the same for over a decade.  It is &euro;19.10.  The McMahon report was clear on the need to increase the payment.  That is something that must be on the agenda in terms of sending a clear and important signal, particularly at a time when we have seen such increased vulnerability and, indeed, increases in racism in Irish society.</p><p> The issue of those under the age of 26 has been highlighted previously by Deputy Gino Kenny.  It is crucial that we look to that.  We do not know yet the full impact of the changes on those under 26.  We do not know what impact that has had on emigration.  We know that people are leaving, often from low-paid jobs, but we also do not know to what extent the driver - the feeling that they do not have the same safety net as the rest of society - has been a consideration.  It is something we need to look at.  If we are to plan in the long term around pensions, it is, of course, a serious long-term cost and concern if those who are under 26 in Ireland do not feel valued.  We need to look at restoration of the payments, beginning, certainly, with full payment for those who are on courses or in training.  That has been recommended by the National Youth Council of Ireland.</p><p> Moving to the other end of the age spectrum, the pension system has been mentioned.  I would ask the Minister to address how the proposals he might put forward or is considering, both in the longer term and also in the shorter term in terms of budget 2017, will address the pension gender gap.  Ireland has a pension gender gap of 37%, which has increased from 35%.  This is a core concern.  We will have an opportunity to debate the proposals that we have spoken about, in terms of the long-term and future auto-enrolment scheme.  Some of the proposals we have seen are merely a flat-rate increase at the top, but what I am concerned about is the fact that only 16% of those receiving the full contributory pension are women.  Eighty-four per cent are men, and while the pension rate may not have been cut at the top full rate, the reduced-rate pension has been cut.  It has been cut in terms of changing the qualification criteria, which has had a disproportionate impact on women.  It has also been cut at the very base levels of contribution - just a flat cut.  We are looking really at the fact whereby pensions for women in Ireland, in addition to all the costs the charges that were outlined by Deputy O'Dea bring to families, have been reduced.  That must be a priority and we need to see that as a priority in the next steps in terms of pensions.  It is a more complex issue and it needs a more complex response.</p><p> Qualification for voluntary credits is also a notable issue.  We talk about contributions to the PRSI system.  It has become more difficult, particularly for women returning to workplace, to make voluntary contributions.  The threshold of previous contributions required has raised.  That is something that can be examined.</p><p> Moving from pensions, I want to highlight a particular issue in terms of employment measures.  There are proposals in relation to the long-term unemployment.  It is clear that one of the core problems we have now is addressing long-term unemployment, and constructive proposals have been put forward about how we begin to address this, but we also need to look fundamentally at the question of quality of employment.</p><p>With the issues that were raised in relation to JobBridge and the issues that might be raised in relation to any review of the new Seetec schemes, the quality measure is crucial because people are finding that employment is no longer a guarantee of moving out of poverty.  It is a real concern that Ireland, according to the Department's own report, has among the highest at-risk-of-poverty levels prior to social transfers within Europe.  This shows us that not everybody is moving out of poverty and that many of those who are in employment are still reliant on social transfers.  In terms of the long-term development of the Department, an area that will need research and resources allocated to it for research is clear measures of quality employment, looking to every lever that the Department might have, how it is using those levers rather than simply addressing the damage of short-term and precarious employment which it is doing successfully, and how it can engage with other Departments to demand stronger measures on quality employment.  That is a crucial area which needs to be resourced.</p><p> In terms of risks, we have often heard the self-employed described as risk takers but I noted with interest the point in the Minister's speech that parenting is also mentioned as a risk.  Of course, it should not be a risk.  Parenting should be something that people can rely on and plan on, and it is calculated as a major contribution to society.  It is what allows us to replicate and build and plan for the future as a society together.  I welcome strongly the commitment to paternity leave, and especially the commitment to an awareness campaign to ensure that it is taken up.  However, I believe there is a need for a fundamental examination of the contribution of care and how we recognise it, how we ensure that people are able to balance care and employment in the most constructive way, how we build routes back, for example, through a care credit - it is an issue I have raised previously with the Minister and I am sure we will get to debate in the future - and how a care credit might be useful not only in terms of pension equality, but also as a route of re-entry to the employment market.</p><p> Returning to the question of risks, I welcome that the Minister highlighted the importance of building a robust system which builds a surplus, which is responsive to risk in that sense and to any future instability.  There may be also a need to build responsiveness to opportunities.  For example, although we are not here to discuss the Apple tax case which will be discussed in other arenas today, nonetheless, in preparing for all outcomes, if in four years' time Ireland was to find itself in a position in which it had to look to accepting &euro;13 billion, it would be important that the Department of Social Protection would have strong ambitious proposals in place to ensure that such moneys benefited the most vulnerable in society.  I believe the Commission has indicated there would be flexibility if that were to be the outcome.</p><p> The Minister understands that the social protection system is not simply a safety net, but is the foundation of society.  It is something everybody relies on; it is crucial.  The Department of Social Protection has shown leadership in the past around thinking with the whole of society lens.  I note the Department led the way, for example, in terms of looking at social impact.  I urge the Department to engage.  I note that the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has highlighted the Department of Social Protection as one of the core Departments which can look to engage with the equality and gender-proofing commitment around budgetary practice.  The social impact assessment system and the SWITCH model, while strong, are not yet adequate in terms of addressing the equality concerns and I believe the Department could show real leadership by allocating a budget line to the delivery of the public duty on equality and human rights to planning how it can be concretely delivered, which is a requirement by all under IHREC.</p><p> I look forward to debating all of these issues further in the future.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the work of the officials in the Department.</p> <p>  New politics gets a lot of criticism, but I acknowledge the fact that the Minister is here before the committee, setting out his priorities for the Department and asking for our views.</p><p>I believe that is a welcome step.  The fact that the Minister has put it to the committee to outline our priorities and what they should be is welcome.</p><p> I believe priorities should be given to family carers of people with disabilities.  Family carers do tremendous work up and down our State.  They save the country scores of millions of euro everyday.  I believe priority must given to them in the forthcoming budget.  There must a recognition of the work they do and the money they save in caring for their loved ones and people with disabilities.  I concur with Deputy O'Dea in relation to pensioners.  I acknowledge the fact that there was an increase in the rate in the last budget and I look forward to a similar increase in reflection of the new partnership Government.  I think we need to focus on pensioners and how we can improve their lot.  I also welcome the priority that the Minister is giving to the self-employed.  It is an issue that was raised with me on numerous occasions during the last election.  I welcome the fact that a new deal will be on offer to the self-employed.  I welcome the work that has been done to date and the fact that the Minister has consulted with employers.  I look forward to the outcome of that survey.  I believe that we need to extend social insurance to the self-employed.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has given priority to that in his contribution today.  Much ground has been covered by other committee members and I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1246" speakername="Maria Bailey" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016090700002#U00200"><p>Like my colleagues, I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I thank them for the level of detail that was given to the committee members prior to the meeting.  The amount of work that has gone into it is incredible, down to the last cent so to speak, in order that we can analyse this detail properly.  That our views are taken on board demonstrates a new politics and I welcome it greatly.</p><p>Many of the areas have been covered, especially regarding low-income families.  Items that I would like to see retained or increased include travel passes.  I welcome the introduction of the scheme for the self-employed.  Anybody who is self-employed in this country is entitled to the same security and benefits as his or her employees.  I also welcome the fact that our figures for self-employment since 2010 are up 5% in quarter 1 this year.  We have more than 325,000 people who are self-employed.  Those people are entitled to the same security as their employees.  I would also like to see the extension of the dental treatment benefit and an increase in the living alone allowance.  I know that this is a big shopping list and we might not get it all, but there might be increases in some of them.  I very much welcome the working family payment.</p><p>I also want to mention the positives.  In the first six months of this new Government, we have had announcements of measures such as microfinance loans, which will help families on small incomes to offset many of their small debts.  If they have small purchases that they need to make, it keeps them away from moneylenders as well.  I very much welcome the paternity benefit scheme.  I would have welcomed it back in 2008.  I believe every mother deserves help for two weeks from their partner.  The extra sleep would also have been welcomed.  It is a huge step for this Government to support families behind their hall doors.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is very welcome.  What is completely different about it is that the rent supplement, which was only supposed to be an interim measure, actually prohibits people from going back into the workplace, whereas the HAP scheme allows people back into the workplace.  I believe we need to explore that further or carry out some kind of awareness campaign because I do not think people are that <i>au fait</i>with it in certain areas.  It is a welcome scheme.  I know it has to be rolled out in three local authorities at the beginning of next year.  They will be the final ones.  I look forward to that coming to D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p><p>I also welcome the rent supplement increase on a discretionary basis.  We are obviously very aware of certain areas in the capital and in counties such as Cork where rent is extremely expensive.  I welcome that it is on a discretionary and case-by-case basis and that it is now being explored to an intensive level.</p><p>I would also like to see an increase in disability benefit, which is deserved by that quiet cohort of people.  I know the Minister is examining the possibility of increasing the Christmas bonus and I would welcome that.  It is crucial for many people and a large volume of people attending our clinics depend on it each Christmas.  There is currently a lot of interest in that matter.</p><p> What further measures are being taken to tackle long-term unemployment?  Are further measures being considered to help those who have been employed for over a year?  I would like a breakdown of those figures.  </p><p> I hope the Minister will explore the possibility of extending the number of people who are exempt from the USC.  Perhaps there is scope to include more people on low incomes.  I think it currently concerns those earning up to &euro;18,600 per annum.  I welcome measures that will positively affect people at home, giving them a better quality of life, especially those on low incomes.  </p></speech>

This is my first committee meeting and I look forward to working with the Minister and his departmental officials over the term of this D&aacute;il.  Previous speakers have mentioned a number of issues and we can all wax lyrical about our days canvassing on the doorsteps, as well as various levels of deprivation in our constituencies.  Everyone has a story about families and the elderly.  I would like to see an increase in pensions.  I would also like to see, as Senator Alice-Mary Higgins mentioned, bringing in carers' credits and backdating the home-makers' disregard.  I would like to know what exactly the Minister is considering in terms of pension equality.</p><p>The sum of &euro;19 per week for a person living in direct provision is scandalous in this day and age.  It forces many people in direct provision to work in the black market.  They may work in restaurants where they have no proper terms and conditions.  It is both unfair and negligent on the part of the State.  </p><p>I welcome the parental leave for fathers, which should be extended to take shared parental leave into account.  I would like to see a review of the role of discretionary welfare officers.  I have come across families and individuals who are experiencing hard times.  The scope of the discretionary welfare officer is not as far-reaching as it used to be.  It might, therefore, be an idea to consider how benefits are distributed to those in such difficult situations.  </p><p>Representatives of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul will be attending this committee in due course, but I know they do a lot of the State's work as <i>de facto</i>discretionary welfare officers.  However, maybe they should not be taking on that burden as much as they are at present.</p></speech>

I will not go over all the comments that were made.  The Minister said: "The ongoing fall in the live register is freeing up resources that we need to meet additional demand in other areas..."  On a no-change basis, comparing 2016 to 2015, what additional funding would that free up, given the decline of numbers in receipt of jobseeker's allowance?</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's comment on bringing the Christmas bonus forward at budget time.  He might indicate what percentage rate he has in mind and if it will be the full rate. </p> <p>  I have a vested interest in the self-employed because I was self-employed for over 20 years before entering politics.  For the past decade, I have been a director of a community enterprise centre, so I see many self-employed people.  They are vulnerable and at risk.  Most people who are running successful businesses today failed at first.  That is the reality.  The problem for them is accessing any support because they do not have that type of paperwork.  They may have money in a bank account and debts to match.  It is difficult for them to plead a case with any social welfare officer if they are coming from a failed business.  Self-employed people are a particular niche and I am not suggesting for one moment that they should get something for free.</p><p>People are prepared to pay but at the moment they are excluded from an awful lot.  Self-employed people make a significant contribution to the economy, yet they are not supported in the same way as an employee might be.  It is not solely a budgetary figure.  It is a question of how we develop policy over a number of years and that requires some attention.</p><p> Some members of the committee spoke about budgetary cuts affecting the elderly.  The reality for older people is that reductions in the fuel allowance, electricity allowance and the removal of the telephone allowance have impacted on them.  Approaching any budget, the Minister will be restricted in terms of what is available to his Department.  Are there other ways of dealing with things rather than just adding an additional three, four or five euro?  Does the Department have the capacity to buy electricity, gas and telephone units, thus supplying people with better value than they could obtain themselves?</p><p> We all campaigned during the winter in the previous general election and I was very taken by meeting older people living alone.  Their heating bill is the same as if two people were living in the house.  Such people stay in bed all day in winter because they cannot afford to heat the house.  That is my abiding memory of the previous election.  More commonly it was older people living alone who raised the issue.  They have fewer opportunities to look after themselves and are more vulnerable as a result.  I hope the Minister will take that cohort into consideration in the forthcoming budget.</p><p> The issue of direct provision needs to be addressed as well as the payment because both things go hand in hand.  It has gone on for too long and it is an inappropriate system of accommodation.  The payment might be the Minister's responsibility, but the Oireachtas needs to address the issue in a more substantial manner.  The &euro;19 payment has been around for as long as I can remember, so it needs to be addressed.</p><p> I thank the Minister for his attendance here today.  A number of questions and issues have been raised, so the Minister will now have an opportunity to reply.  He has invited the committee to make further submissions to him in advance of the budget and I expect we will do so by means of correspondence.</p></speech>

At the outset, some people asked me to give specific answers on what I am going to do in the budget.  I am not being evasive, but I will not answer that question because I do not yet know how much of the fiscal space is coming our way.  While I have had initial discussions with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, we have still not made our formal submission to him.  The Chairman knows how budgets work.  There is always a squabble at the end over a couple of hundred million euro, but we have not even got to that point.  I cannot tell the committee what will be in the budget.  It is not that I am evading the answer but because I do not actually know yet.  Needless to say, I will obviously seek an adequate social protection package which is not just about increased payments but also about real reforms, including those for the self-employed.</p> <p>  As regards Deputy O'Dea's questions, we do not have a figure for what it would cost to extend illness benefit to the self-employed.  That is a short-term payment, as most claims are for a couple of days or one or two weeks.  It would be a tricky one to do for the self-employed because self-employment by its nature is different from employment.  If an employee who is paid hourly does not attend for work, it is very different from a self-employed person.  In terms of certification or being paid per job or item rather than per hour, I am not saying it could not be done but it was not examined by the Mangan report.</p> <p>  That report did examine the invalidity pension and jobseeker's allowance.  They worked out that extending the invalidity pension to the self-employed would cost &euro;80 million, and the jobseeker's allowance would be a further &euro;80 million.  That calculation is based on self-employed people getting it on the same basis as employees.  It is also based on them claiming it on the same basis as employees.  I think that, for various reasons, self-employed people would be less likely to claim those things than employees.</p><p>Moreover, they would not necessarily have to get it on the same basis because self-employed people of course do not pay the same PRSI.  They are their own employer but they do not pay employer's PRSI and consequently, one can bring down those costs by changing the basis on which they can claim.  One thing the Deputy said with which I agree completely is that we should bring in these changes on a phased basis.  We already have brought in paternity benefit for the self-employed and I would like to bring in new protections on a phased basis.  I believe one important protection is the invalidity pension for people who get injured or incapacitated in the course of their work and therefore can no longer work.  It could be a farmer in a major farm accident or a taxi driver who gets beaten up and cannot work any more.  It could be a professional who for some reason gets very sick and cannot keep his or her business any longer.  While self-employed people do not think it will ever happen to them, it actually happens all the time, and that is a measure that was recommended by Mangan.  Something also must be done in respect of jobseeker's benefit, but it would be necessary to do it on a different basis because it is not straightforward to determine when a self-employed person comes unemployed.  They do not get a P45.  I have spoken to Ministers from other countries about what they do in their countries and, in an interesting point I had never even thought of, the Swedish Minister told me that in order to claim a jobseeker's benefit in Sweden when one is a self-employed person, one must close one's business.  People actually are incentivised to close their businesses more quickly than they would otherwise because that is the only way in which they can get the benefits.  Others want to get the benefit while keeping their businesses open and therefore want to receive it while still being self-employed.  One has all these complicated matters.  In Austria, to prevent people from being self-employed for six months and then being in receipt of jobseeker's benefit for six months and then back for six months, one can only claim the benefit when one has been paying in for eight or ten years.  This then captures people who were paying in for a long time before something perhaps went wrong.  There are many different options and, to be frank, I do not believe we will get it perfect.  We will make a significant start on it next year and then we may be obliged to modify it as we go along.</p><p> The Mangan report recommended against such a scheme being voluntary for lots of reasons, but it is not that voluntary is impossible.  Deputy O'Dea is correct to state that some countries do it, but when they do, this tends to be limited to certain sectors and the uptake can be quite poor.  If one sets up a voluntary scheme into which very few people pay, one has not really achieved one's objective because people then do not have the social protection.  They will regret not paying into it, but one still is telling them they are entitled to nothing.  However, there are options in this regard.  One could provide some benefits, such as the one on incapacity - that is, the invalidity pension - without it being voluntary.  That one could be done on a compulsory basis but a scheme in respect of a jobseeker's benefit could be done as a voluntary scheme.  There are many options in the mix and it will be interesting to learn what self-employed people would like to have done when the survey is returned.  That will be really important.</p><p> Deputy O'Dea mentioned the proposed change regarding income limits for contributions in the tax strategy group document from &euro;38 per week to &euro;70 per week.  That would not save any money in the short term.  It actually would cost us money in the short term because we would have reduced contributions from employers.  In the long term, however, it would help to make the Social Insurance Fund more sustainable.  One must ask the question of what is a contribution, as 4% of &euro;38 is not a big contribution.  I do not know precisely what it is, but presumably it is a euro and something.  Ultimately, one must ask seriously what actually constitutes a contribution.  I am not sure how many people earn between &euro;38 and &euro;70 per week but I would say the number is relatively small.  However, it is not something I am pushing in particular.  It is just something that was presented as an option for it by the tax strategy group.  I apologise - I should correct myself on that one. It is not 4% but would be the employer's contribution of 8%, not the employee's contribution.</p><p> A few members mentioned older people, and I must agree with the comments that were made.  Even though poverty rates among pensioners are lower than among other groups and are much lower than among families or lone parents, and even though the pension was not cut, many things were.  Prescription charges have really had an impact on pensioners.  It comes up all the time when I am doing the doors.  Two or three years later, the cut to the telephone allowance still comes up, and obviously, the impact of the local property tax on somebody who is in receipt of &euro;200 or &euro;230 per week is highly significant.  While it is a week's pay for very few people, for pensioners it often is.  However, one must bear in mind that in a fiscal space of &euro;1 billion, with &euro;660 million going on spending and &euro;330 million going on tax relief, that means &euro;660 million on spending to be divided among health, education, housing, the Garda and social protection, and never mind any other Department.</p><p>For instance, a &euro;5 increase in the pension could be achieved, but that is pretty much all that could be done.  I just need to bear that in mind and to be honest about it.  When we divide &euro;660 million among health, education, housing, the Garda and social protection, we are not talking about a lot of money, quite frankly, and I need to be honest about that. </p><p> Poverty rates are very high among lone parents.  However, I do not think the most effective way to bring down poverty rates among lone parents is by tweaking the benefits system or by providing an extra &euro;3 to &euro;5 a week but by facilitating entry to the labour market and allowing people to work.  Work is not always but is generally better in terms of income than being on welfare.  There are barriers to education but the main barrier is the phenomenal cost of child care.  The most effective thing we could do for lone parents is in the space of child care, which does not fall into my brief but, obviously, I have to take an interest in it because it impacts significantly on my brief and my budget.  We had some progress this year with the second early childhood care and education, ECCE, year, but a lot more can be done.  I do not need to tell anyone here that if we compare child care costs in Ireland with those in continental European countries, the difference is phenomenal. </p><p> Deputy Brady mentioned that according to Social Justice Ireland 750,000 people are in poverty.  How these things are defined is important.  Social Justice Ireland states that there are 750,000 people below the poverty line.  However, when they use the term "poverty line," they include those who are at risk of poverty and not just those in poverty.  Of course, by definition, if one is at risk of poverty one is not in poverty.  One of the interesting things that happens is that when poverty rates go down the at-risk-of-poverty rate goes up because people move from the category of being in poverty to being at risk of poverty.  It is important when we use these terms that we are clear as to what they mean.  However, we have plenty of consistent poverty and deprivation in Ireland - no one is denying that - and the objective is to ensure that it goes down and keeps decreasing every year.  Both deprivation and consistent poverty are consistently higher than they were in 2007 and 2008.  We have to aim to get back to those levels.  If the economy is fully recovered and GDP is back to where it was and all of that, surely poverty rates should be back to where they were at that point.  We must bear in mind that the most recent figures we have are from the survey of income and living conditions, SILC, in 2014.  Therefore, when people say the poverty rate in Ireland is x, y or z, they are not correct.  That is what it was in 2014.  We will have the figures for 2015 in October or November and we do not have the figures for 2016 yet, so we actually do not yet know what the impact of the past two years of real economic growth and falling unemployment have had on poverty, but we will know it sooner or later. </p><p> The study on lone parents and their access to education is being led by the Department of Education and Skills and is being carried out by NUI, Maynooth.  It is not yet complete but an initial presentation has been made to officials.  I have not seen that yet.  I hope that out of that study will come some ideas and suggestions that my Department and the Department of Education and Skills could implement to improve better access to education for lone parents.</p><p> There is often confusion about the back to education allowance, so it is important to say that the allowance is for those who are on a weekly welfare payment and go to college or back to school.  The allowance allows them to keep the weekly payment while they go back to college or school because to get a jobseeker's payment a person has to be looking for a job full-time.  All the back to education allowance ever is, ever was and probably ever will be is saying to someone who is already dependent on a weekly welfare payment that he or she can go back to education and keep getting the payment while in education.  The aim was never that working people could give up their jobs on Thursday, take up a course the following week and get &euro;188 a week from the State to do so.  That is not practical.  We could not possibly afford to allow people to just give up their jobs and the following week suddenly expect to get &euro;188 a week for education.  It would not be affordable and I am not sure it would be fair.  However, I will come back to that issue another time.</p><p> To give the committee an idea of the figures, to increase the fuel allowance by &euro;1 would cost &euro;10 million and to extend it by another week would cost &euro;9 million.  All of these things are options, but if one were to extend it by a week and increase it by &euro;1 it would cost &euro;19 million, which is a lot of money.</p><p>Similarly, on back to school payments, it is always important to point out that the payment the Department of Social Protection makes is the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  There is a school book rental scheme and most schools are now availing of it.  The former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, led on that.  We have put more than &euro;50 million into school meals and school breakfasts already - I hope to expand that - and school transport is heavily subsidised as well.</p><p> The Department of Education and Skills provides the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  If one looks at the clothing and footwear element of the Barnardos survey on what it costs to send a child to school, Barnardos states that the cost for a primary school pupil is approximately &euro;150 and the cost for a secondary school pupil is &euro;250.  We pay &euro;100 and &euro;200, respectively, which is approximately &euro;50 short of the actual cost of clothing and footwear.</p><p> With regard to paternity leave, I am advised by my officials that a father is entitled to paternity leave where there is a stillbirth and the child has reached 24 weeks' gestation.  Obviously, one must pick a cut-off point at a certain point.  The same applies for mothers.  I will double-check that to ensure we are not wrong about that, because I agree there should not be an anomaly.</p><p> With regard to lower payments for young jobseekers, Deputies John Brady and Gino Kenny and Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, who raised this, stated that the &euro;100 for the young jobseekers is discriminatory.  I would point out that it does not apply to lone parents.  If one is on the one-parent family payment, one gets the full amount.</p><p> We need to bear something in mind.  Senator Alice-Mary Higgins correctly mentioned that we do not know the impact that this low payment may have on emigration among young people, but young people coming to Ireland get off the plane from Eastern Europe, from countries such as Poland, probably with neither good English nor good qualifications, and within a week or two they find a job.  Even a job at or just above the minimum wage in Ireland pays &euro;400 a week, and we must ask why any young person in Ireland, particularly in this economy where jobs are not that hard to find, is in a situation whereby he or she cannot find employment.  Such a person may well have personal or individual issues, but he or she also may not wish to take up employment.  I do not want to be the right-winger at the table here, but somebody needs to say that.</p></speech>

The level of emigration in previous periods when we had employment opportunities and were not in recession was not as high.  I certainly do not think it is a moral failing among younger people who are choosing to emigrate or who are not finding employment.  There was a reality that it was extremely hard to find consistent employment.</p></speech>

Young people whose first language is not English and whose qualifications may be limited are coming into Ireland all the time and within a few weeks they find employment and are earning &euro;300 or &euro;400 a week.  We need to bear all those points in mind.  I accept that people may have individual reasons for not being able to take up employment but we should not be so naive as to think that everyone wants to take up employment.  There is a small group - it may only be 1% or 2% of society - who would rather not work.  Frankly, we need to be wise to that, deal with that and be honest about it.</p> <p>  One point that was mentioned by a few members is whether those who take up schemes in education should be treated differently and should get some benefit or extra payment for doing that.  To a certain extent, they do, but maybe not enough.  If I was to make a change, it would be in that space.  It would not mean giving more to those who do not take up employment but would acknowledge that those who take up schemes, education or training should be recognised.</p></speech>

Those in that age bracket are substantially more likely to be homeless.  I just want to pick up on the comment to the effect that there is no evidence of the impact that this cut is having on people.  There is a real impact out there, specifically in homelessness.  There is evidence that these cuts are having a detrimental impact on people, to a substantial degree, in terms of homelessness and sleeping on the streets.</p><p>I can get the Minister the facts of that report.  The evidence is there that it is having a grave impact.  It is a discriminatory act.</p></speech>

Perhaps they should not be on jobseeker's allowance at all.  Perhaps they have disability issues, mental health issues or need help with addiction.  One cannot speak about everyone in a general way.  However, we do need to ask a serious question.  In an economy like this in which there is a lot of employment available and in which people can enter the country and get jobs within weeks, why is it that there are people who are willing to accept &euro;100 a week who are not taking up employment?</p></speech>

The labour force is therefore smaller.  It is not that young people are twice as likely to be unemployed.  It is important to understand statistics in these things.</p> <p>  Touching on that note, somebody mentioned JobPath.  JobPath refers people to Seetec and to Turas Nua.  What we have there is something new.  It has only been around for about a year.  It is a placement service that supports people who are long-term unemployed to be placed in employment.  There are 40,000 or 50,000 referrals so far.  Of course there are going to be issues.  In anything that involves 40,000 or 50,000 referrals, there are going to be issues.  I want to know about them, I take them seriously and I want them to be addressed.  If there are any abuses, they are going to be dealt with.  To give the committee an idea of the figures, out of 51,000 referrals so far, there are 92 complaints.  In anything that has referred 50,000 people, there are going to be 92 complaints or more.  I meet many people who have been referred to Seetec and to Turas Nua.  For many people, it works very well.  They are placed in a job and are delighted to be placed in a job.  For some people, quite frankly, it has come as a bit of a shock because for years they had been on a carousel of unemployment, schemes, a bit of training, back to unemployment and nobody had ever actually said to them there was a job for them and that they could go for it.  It is not surprising that there is a cohort of people for whom this change in which the Government will find a job for them and place them in a job is coming as a bit of a shock.  Quite frankly, not everyone can have their dream job.</p></speech>

The onus is put on the vast majority of people, and in some cases they are being told to get ten to 15 interviews every week.  If they are not coming back having hit those targets, the threat is hanging over their heads that it will be referred back to the Department and their payments will be stopped.  It is incorrect to say a job is offered to people.  The onus is put back on many people to find a job themselves.</p></speech>

It is not a job of one's choice.  For some people, this is coming as a bit of a shock to them.  Instead of just being offered a cycle of training and schemes, they are now being told that there is a job there for them.  However, I believe it is something that is going to work.  There will be a review of it, of course, but it is early days yet to be doing reviews.  We need to see the long-term analysis.</p></speech>

It is beginning to reach fairly alarming levels at the moment.  I suspect the vast majority of the individuals who approach me did not make a complaint to the Department.  Therefore, I think the statistic of 92 complaints out of 51,000 referrals is pretty meaningless.  There are quite a lot of complaints.  I ask the Minister to have a look at that situation because there are problems there.</p><p>I am speaking from my experience on the ground on a weekly basis.  There are problems in this area, such as the types of activity mentioned by Deputy Brady.  I know that people cannot always have their dream jobs, but people are being put into jobs that they have to travel to get to, the cost of which is leaving them less well off than they would be if they were on social protection benefits.  Also, people are being forced to do courses that are inappropriate to their needs.  As I said, there are problems developing such that this area needs to be monitored.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-07a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016090700002#BB00200"><p>We will do that.  There will always be issues and problems arising.  Some of the problems relate to communications and interactions between jobseekers and the people interviewing them.  I would encourage Members and others to pass their complaints on to the Department, which will take them seriously.  This is a big change.  For the first time in a long time, if ever, the Government is offering those who are long-term unemployed a job rather than just participation in a scheme or training.  This is a big change for people, but I am convinced it is the right thing to do.</p> <p>  With regard to the JobBridge audit, it is important to point out that this was an internal audit carried out by the Department.  In terms of how the audit cycle works, auditors raise queries and then the person being audited responds to those queries.  What probably did not come across in the media reports is that the auditors were happy with the responses to their queries.  The auditors carried out the audit and raised their concerns, the Department responded and the auditors were happy with the response but I do not think that came across in the media in the way it should have.  </p> <p>  In regard to the clothing allowance, it is still possible to get those funds under the exceptional needs payment.  I recall that during my time as a general practitioner I often had to sign forms for people in respect of claims for the clothing allowance.  I believe that system has since been abolished.  That scheme, rather than being evidence-based, was based on the idea that a person needed additional clothing for a medical or health care reason, as opposed to a medical garment, which is a different thing entirely.  People who need clothing as an exceptional need can get an exceptional needs payment from their community welfare officer for that purpose.</p> <p>  On the issue of bogus self-employed people, I will have to come back to the Senator on that.  I agree that revenue is probably lost to the Social Insurance Fund in that regard.  In addition, people are losing out on their protections.  Construction, in particular, is one of the areas in which this is an issue.  On standard bank accounts, which is more a matter for the Department of Finance than the Department of Social Protection, I understand that from this month banks are required by regulation to provide standard bank accounts.  I expect to see those products appear on the market very soon.  My Department is working with An Post in regard to its product.  Having a standard bank account is important in terms of financial inclusion.</p> <p>  On future-proofing of pensions, given the enormous scope of the pensions issue, I think we need a dedicated session on it following the budget.  My focus up until last week was on paternity benefit.  It is now on the budget, the self-employed and the social welfare Bill.  Pensions will form a huge part of the Department's work programme in 2017, alongside the working family payment.  It would be useful for the committee to hold additional sessions on that issue.</p> <p>  On the assessment of the financial impact of the lone parent reforms, I agree there is a need for such an assessment, and my Department will resource it.  The advice I have been given is that it is necessary to allow a little time for the impact of the changes to become evident.  While in some cases the impact might be a reduction in welfare payments, the increase in the amount of work and the number of people moving on to FIS is slower.  I agree with the Senator that we should do an assessment of the impact of the reforms.  </p> <p>  Policy on direct provision is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The child rate was increased this year from &euro;9.60 to &euro;15.60.  Further increases in this regard can be examined in the context of the budget.  On the issue of joint payment of jobseeker's payments and family income supplement, I am not too sure how that would work.  I know that some recipients of jobseeker's payments are not also eligible for FIS.</p></speech>

This is true not only in respect of the State pension but in relation to private pensions.  There are contrary gaps too, including that women live longer than men, such that over the period of their retirement they may get more in cash terms than men.</p><p>Generally speaking, women make fewer contributions both in terms of cash and years.  Whereas on the one hand gender pension gaps are often raised, on the other they are never raised.  I am not accusing the Senator in this regard.  People see gender gaps when it suits them.  They do not often see them when they work the other way.</p></speech>

There is a debate about it.  In terms of the widow's pension and survivor's pension, more women than men benefit from these pensions. The only way to fully resolve the issue is to have a separate set of rules for men and women.  Some countries have different retirement ages for men and women but I would not agree with that.</p></speech>

There has been a delay in processing claims for the carer's allowance and carer's benefit.  I am pleased to report that the situation has improved in the past four months.  Medical assessments are now being done a lot quicker but the process is still a little slow.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady mentioned the retention of the travel pass.  The Deputy can be assured that it will be retained.  On dental treatment benefit, there is a programme for Government commitment in that regard but, obviously, I cannot say whether that will be provided for in the forthcoming budget.  It may be a matter for a future budget.  On the working family payment, it is hoped work in that regard will be completed this year and that it will be introduced in budget 2018.  I have had meetings with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, on the matter and we will continue to work closely on it and will also consult the committee on it.  The key objective of the working family payment is to reduce child poverty, which is crucial, and to make work pay such that families that enter the workforce are better off for doing so.</p></speech>

Work on the issue carried out by the previous Government produced four or five options, including replacing FIS, retaining it and closing it off to new entrants.  It is fair to say that the reason this was not progressed is because there would have been losers as well as winners.  The nature of politics is such that the winners will be happy and the losers will be the people politicians will hear from.</p></speech>

That is the type of initiative we will be seeking to come up with in the early part of next year.</p> <p>  As I said, long-term employment is down to 4.4%.  The target is to reduce that figure to below 2.5%, which would be an acceptable level.  There are a lot of things happening in this space, including JobPath and initiatives to make sure work pays.  Somebody made the valid point earlier that having a job is no guarantee of being out of poverty, which is true because we do have a working poor in Ireland.  Part of the solution will have to be increases in the minimum wage and rising pay levels in a sustainable way over the coming years.  I do not think anyone would disagree with that.</p> <p>  On pension equality and pension reform, as I said earlier, this is an issue to which we should probably dedicate a full session of the committee.  We are moving towards - this was decided some time ago - a total contribution approach to calculating the contributory pension.  Currently, a person is required to have made 520 contributions over ten years.  There are very few pensions that would provide a full pension after ten years' contributions.  This certainly is not the case in respect of a public sector pension.  The current system also provides for an averaging of the number of weeks a person worked during the course of his or her life, which creates all sorts of anomalies and injustices, as such things always do.  I am sure all members have come across people who worked for 17 years, but spread over 40 years, and were not entitled to a full pension while somebody who worked the right 11 years received a full pension.  It is really messy.  Once again, any changes made in this area, unless one has hundreds of millions of euro to invest, will result in winners and losers.</p><p>Any member who wishes to make a proposal in this regard should run it by us, because we hope to be to able tell them how many losers there will be, as well as how many winners, from the changes that are proposed.  It will take some time but we will eventually move to a total contributions approach, whereby the number of contributions a person makes over the period of his or her working life is what matters, not when they made them.  There will have to be a generous recognition of all forms of caring - not only looking after kids.  We have a lot of work to do on this yet, and at the moment we are going through individual pension records and PRSI records to see what the implications will be for real individuals.  More work will be done early next year, but it will be tricky, and I would be cautious about rushing into any changes without fully understanding the impact they might have.</p><p> As things stand, every time the live register drops by 1,000 it saves us &euro;9.2 million in a full year.</p></speech>

We will need information from the Department of Finance and we would, of course, have to agree on the figure with that Department.  The live register has been falling by approximately 40,000 per year and unemployment has halved but, as we get down to a smaller level, it is difficult to see it falling as quickly.</p></speech>

He has been putting out a lot of figures; he said, for example, that if the fuel allowance were to go up by a certain figure it would yield &euro;10 million, and mentioned that, of the fiscal space of &euro;1 billion, &euro;660 million would be for spending.  He also said the reduction in jobseeker's allowance would yield additional funding.  The committee, in trying to form a view on this, would like an estimate of the new money coming into the Department as well as the naturally occurring savings.  The Minister asked for suggestions that were affordable, rather than just a shopping list, and it was in that context I asked the question.  It was not an attempt to be awkward.</p></speech>

As I said, with the rising number of old people it will cost an extra &euro;200 million next year just to stand still.  I did not say what savings could offset that.

We will give the committee what we can.  I take the Chairman's point.</p> <p>  It is well recognised that poverty rates are higher among those living alone.  The gap is not as big as I thought it was, but there is one, arising from the additional costs of running a house.  An increase in the living alone allowance of &euro;1 per week costs &euro;10 million and I am not sure that an extra &euro;1 would change much.  It would be better than nothing, but I am not so sure how well it would be received.  I have already covered direct provision.</p></speech>

He touched on the audit but did not go into detail.  I asked a specific question.  The Minister has indicated that he is going to do away with JobBridge and bring in a replacement scheme.  I am sure there will be a budgetary impact and I wanted to know what the timeframe was for the new scheme.  It will need to be analysed, because some of the issues raised by my party, such as the way the scheme displaced real jobs, were substantiated in the audit.</p><p>The companies made self-declarations and no one checked them.  A lot of serious issues were identified in the audit going back over a considerable period of time and it is important that they be taken on board in whatever is introduced to replace JobBridge.  What is the timeframe for the new proposals?  If there is no budgetary impact, does it mean the figure of &euro;52 will remain for people who signed up to JobBridge?</p></speech>

We could put a proposal to the Minister on the question of averaging which would improve the situation for women but would not create losers.  A lot can be done for relatively small amounts of money.  For example, if we were to restore the provision whereby a person would qualify for lone parent allowance if their youngest child was 12 or younger, rather than seven as at present, the cost would be just &euro;10 million because it would get rid of transitional jobseeker's allowance.  I learned this from a parliamentary question I put to the Minister for Finance.  We have to encourage lone parents into the workforce but we will not do that by making them less well off when they go to work.  Deputy Brady referred to the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and I note from the Minister's own figures that doubling that would cost &euro;35 million.  If he wanted to increase it by 30% it would cost &euro;10 million, which is not a lot of money.</p> <p>  On the question of the way we are treating people under the age of 26, it was, unfortunately, our Government which started that trend.  Its successor took it up and ran with it, but I think it was wrong.  The Minister should seriously look at raising the rates for people going back into training or education, at least to the level of somebody in receipt of the full rate.  An interim payment raises the amount from &euro;100 to &euro;144 or &euro;160 but it should be &euro;188 if they go back into training.</p></speech>

We will have proposals for a replacement scheme for JobBridge in the next few weeks, in October if not in September.  I do not want to pre-empt decisions that have not yet been made, and the budgetary impact has to be worked out in the context of the budget.  We are moving towards capping the number of work experience placements and increasing the payment a person will receive.  Capping the numbers will bring down the cost but increasing the payment will increase the cost and we do not yet know what the final position will be.</p> <p>  I accept that there were abuses in JobBridge and that it has had a lot of bad press.  However, I have been around the country and talked to staff who engage with employers and jobseekers, as well as branch managers of social welfare offices, and, by and large, they are big fans of JobBridge.  They say that, unlike other schemes, people can get involved in JobBridge very quickly.  One must be unemployed for only three months to qualify for JobBridge, while other schemes are only available to people who have been unemployed for much longer.  They also say that people get real work experience with a private-sector employer, as opposed to what is offered in Gateway or T&uacute;s, which tend to place people with a sponsor, an NGO or a public body.  These people are big advocates of JobBridge and, while I am going to replace it, I do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  I would not like to take the opportunity to work for multinational companies, retailers and other companies away from people who have never had work experience or worked for a private sector employer in a normal, traditional job.</p><p>A lot of them are very good work experience placements.  The conversion rate in terms of the numbers who actually go on to employment is very high.  It is much higher than for schemes that get very little criticism and we must bear that in mind.</p><p> In response to Deputy O'Dea's question, if he has an averaging submission on pensions, I would ask him to give it to us as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It would be a very useful exercise to do equality budgeting to determine the social impacts of the budget.  Unfortunately, because so many budget decisions are made so late in the day, it is hard to do that analysis.  It is a flaw in the budget process that so many decisions are made so late that we only find out about their impact afterwards.</p> <p>  It is only worth doing if it is going to be for real.  That is why we would need full engagement and buy-in from the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is no point in us just doing it, publishing a report but not having any impact on decisions.  That said, changes are happening already.  The tax strategy group's papers were published for the first time this year and we also have the new budget scrutiny committee which is a real step forward.</p></speech>
