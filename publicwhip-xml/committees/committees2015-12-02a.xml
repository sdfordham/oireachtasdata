    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015120200002#A00200"><p>Thank you Chairman.  Vote 7, Office of the Minister for Finance, provides for the salaries and expenses of running the Department including the Office of the Paymaster General.  It also provides for the payment of certain grants.  In 2016 my Department will be required to provide for a new service, the payment of a fuel grant for disabled drivers.  This new fuel grant is being introduced to replace the excise repayment on the fuel element of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme.  As members are aware, the excise repayment was discontinued on 31 December 2014 following a ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  The new fuel grant is available in respect of fuel used from 1 January 2015 and the grant will be paid from the 1 January 2016 in respect of fuel used in the previous 12 months in the same way as the excise relief was paid in arrears.  </p> <p>  Since payments under this grant scheme will be required to commence in early 2016, a technical early Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 is required under Vote 7, essentially to establish the new subhead under which these grants will be paid.  The fuel grant will cost &euro;10 million in 2016, and in a full year it is expected that some 13,700 claims will be made by drivers, passengers and organisations.  The fuel grant will be paid on the same basis as the excise repayment on fuel which will ensure that no beneficiary of the scheme loses out as a result of the EU court's decision.  Provision for this scheme was included in the Finance Bill 2015 and secondary legislation will come into force immediately after the Finance Bill is enacted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015120200002#A00300"><p>I welcome the Minister.  It goes without saying there is no issue with setting up the new subhead.  I gather there is unlikely to be a payment in 2015, that this is to simply provide for the establishment of the subhead to allow payments to roll out from the start of January 2016.  The Minister outlined an estimated cost of &euro;10 million.  Is that in the same ball park as the previous arrangement?  He mentioned payments can made to drivers, passengers and organisations, which I presume are wheelchair user organisations.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this.</p><p>What about a case concerning a child with an intellectual disability?  An autistic child, for example, often has particular requirements and this can be disruptive in a car.  Under the old scheme, the criteria centred on physical disabilities and were quite stringent.  Sometimes there is a requirement to adapt a car in families where disabilities might not be purely of a physical nature.  These have not been facilitated up to now.  Perhaps the position has changed but if it has not, I ask the Minister to consider including such a provision where the need arises.  Parents of children with severe Downs' syndrome may need to modify their car or get a people carrier.  People with mental disabilities are being discriminated against <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>people with physical disabilities. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015120200002#A00400"><p>The Deputy is familiar, as we all are, with the excise rebate scheme to persons who qualified for the disabled drivers scheme.  That was deemed to be illegal by the European Court of Justice.  We had to replace it with something that would be deemed to be legal and therefore are introducing a grant scheme where a grant of the equivalent amount is being awarded in respect of fuel excise costs during the relevant period.   The payment is made retrospectively.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that the payment does not extend to all areas of disability.  The scheme is designed specifically for persons with severe physical disabilities in recognition of the significant cost associated with adapting a vehicle for the transport of persons with certain disabilities.</p><p>I have considered the scheme criteria on a number of occasions but the cost of extending it is prohibitive at this point and certainly was over the past couple of years.  I know a good case can be made and it is something we may consider again in future.</p><p> Organisations which look after disabled people must have a No. 4 primary certificate.</p></speech>

The committee secretariat had already been working to make improvements on how Estimates are presented to committees before this report was issued along with last year's intensive engagement with eight Departments.  Our own committee has already done considerable work with the OPW on improving the quality of the performance measures included in its Estimates.  We now request that the Minister's Department engage closely with the secretariat to begin a process of making its performance targets and outputs more outwardly focused, meaningful and measurable both for the committee and the broader public.  We would ask for the Minister's support and co-operation as the Houses move to implement the broader OECD recommendations in co-operation with Departments to improve transparency and ensure public moneys are spent as effectively as possible.  The Minister might at some point give us his views on the report's recommendations.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and his officials and call him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22015120200002#A00500"><p>I was about to thank the Chairman and members of the select sub-committee but I will thank the Chairman and Deputy Sean Fleming as no other members are present.</p> <p>  I am here to present a proposal for a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;16.77 million, gross &euro;37 million, in respect of Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, and a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;400,000, gross &euro;900,000, in respect of the Public Appointments Service.  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the superannuation Vote will bring the total 2015 Estimate for the Vote to &euro;515 million gross and &euro;386.7 million net.  This compares with a final outturn in 2014 of &euro;473.9 million gross and &euro;368.7 net.  The Supplementary Estimate arises mainly from approximately 250 more retirements than were forecast for the year under the established scheme.  There are also balances payable to people who retired in 2009 under the previous Government's early retirement scheme.</p> <p>  Pensions and lump sums paid to members of the pension scheme for established civil servants make up just under 90% of total gross expenditure on the superannuation and retired allowances Vote.  As such, the main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire in the year.  However, it is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next for the following reasons.  The majority of established civil servants may choose to retire within a five-year window between the ages of 60 and 65 years.  In addition, a number of people under the age of 60 retire each year under the cost neutral early retirement scheme or are retired on grounds of ill health.  Each year, a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement, in other words, these individuals retire early but reach the appropriate retirement age in a different year and become eligible for a lump sum payment in that year.  The number of cessations of pensions also varies from year to year.  I love this euphemism, which is a way of describing those who are no longer on the planet and, therefore, unable to claim their pension.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22015120200002#A00700"><p>It is a discreet way of saying that.  The average pension benefits - lump sum and pension - that will fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year will vary depending on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.  If a number of Secretaries General retire in one year and very few senior personnel retire the following year, the costs incurred in the two years will vary, even if the number of retirees is similar.</p> <p>  This year, the gross Estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;474 million, which was based on a forecast of 950 retirements from the established scheme.  However, there have been 1,050 retirements as at the end of November and if the current trend continues, the annual total will be in the region of 1,200.  The effect of this higher than forecast number of retirements has been to place upward pressure on subheads A1, pension payroll, and A4, pension lump sums.</p> <p>  As a general rule, for each person who retires, the once-off lump sum paid out is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which is the most variable subhead as it provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  The subhead is, therefore, a key driver of expenditure on the Vote in any given year.</p> <p>  By the end of November, just under &euro;75 million had been expended from subhead A4, whereas the 2014 Estimate had envisaged expenditure of &euro;66 million in that period.  Further expenditure of &euro;14 million by the end of the year is anticipated, resulting in an overall excess of &euro;23 million on the subhead.  A further expected excess of &euro;14 million on subhead A1, pension payroll, also driven by the higher than forecast number of retirements, means it is now estimated that gross expenditure for 2015 may be in the region of &euro;511 million, which is approximately &euro;37 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;474 million previously approved by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  To ensure the required funding is available, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;37 million gross is being sought.  The select sub-committee should also note that the level of the gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated somewhat by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid which, for 2015, were estimated at &euro;104 million.  Any additional receipts in excess of this amount will act to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.  To date, receipts of some &euro;112 million have been recorded.  In particular, receipts with respect to the public service single pension scheme are growing strongly.  As Deputies will be aware, the single pension scheme for all public service employees has been operable since 1 January 2013.  This means that public servants recruited since that date pay into the single scheme.  As the value of the scheme increases, it will be offset against the cost of pensions on an annual basis.  It is likely that total appropriations-in-aid will be in excess of &euro;124 million by year end, which is &euro;20 million more than originally expected.</p> <p>  The requirement for a Supplementary Estimate for the Public Appointments Service for 2015 is based on the significantly increased levels of recruitment and selection activity in the service in the current year.</p><p>These levels of activity were not foreseen at the start of the year and all the costs are activity-led.  This is the impact of a very positive situation in the fact that we have prudent management of the finances of the country and that has allowed us to start recruiting to targeted areas of the public workforce again.  There have been large increases in demand for competitions to fill roles in the Civil Service and local authorities, as hospital consultants and trainees in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in various other specialist, professional and technical positions and all of these have driven up costs in the PAS.  Costs are driven by three main components - the processing of applications through an interview and via a series of online tests; fees paid to interview board members; and the cost of managing and administrating the recruitment process.  I am happy to answer any questions that may arise.</p></speech>

It states in the notes that the contributions received from people who joined the public service single pension scheme were estimated at &euro;25 million but that the current projection is &euro;45 million.  I take it the Supplementary Estimate would have been higher had appropriations-in-aid not been so positive.  That is fair enough as it is part of the income of the Department.  Can the Minister send us a note at some time showing the number of retirees each year for the past three or four years?  Each year we see more than we expect.  The principal issue is that we seem to think fewer people will want out each year.</p> <p>  Will I ask all my questions together, including those on the Public Appointments Service? </p></speech>

I understood the chairman was to be picked from the board but it has been done in reverse order and the chairman has been picked before the board members were picked.</p> <p>  Will the Minister give us the figure for recruitment across the public service, and a breakdown of grades, for example principal officer or clerical officer, not just for 2015 but 2014 too, so that we can see the trend?  On Garda recruitment, I understand 33,000 might apply, which will be challenging.  However, I believe the first application is made online from one's home computer and the number is then whittled down but the next round is also done off site, from a person's computer.  I have been told that people have got other people, who were experienced and knew what the job was about, to complete their online applications for them.  There is no guarantee that the people who filled in the first two rounds are the people who will move onto stage 3.  Lots of parents get their children to fill in forms for them online and the same is happening with the applications to join the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Nobody knows who is actually filling the forms in and the next round will be the same. </p></speech>

I am sure there is a security mechanism to deal with this.  On the overall vote, there is a new integrated pension scheme for all public servants which became operable on 1 January 2013.  Everybody, a judge, a Deputy, a civil servant or a garda is part of the single integrated pension scheme from that date.  The calculation of a pension is different and will be on a career average profile rather than an end-of-career profile and the implications of that will be to reduce the pension Bill by some 35%.  We are now recruiting again in significant numbers and that is impacting on the quantum of money people are paying into the single pension scheme in annual contributions.  Deputy Fleming asked me if that was offset against the net cost and the answer is "Yes".  It will increase into the future.  When we brought in the single pension scheme we did not think about it because, in 2011, we were in a crisis.  There might be an argument, however, for re-establishing some sort of a pension reserve fund or, at least, a bespoke fund that is transparent about the funds that are being built up.  It would have to be topped up for a number of years with annualised pensions as we go along but it might be something to be looked at in the future and I have opened a debate on the issue.</p> <p>  One of the most significant things to have happened within the PAS in the past 12 months is the fact that it has taken responsibility for appointments to all State boards.  An analysis of the impact was done last week by the Institute of Directors and it was uniformly positive about the effect on the skills mix of boards, the volume of applicants and gender equality.  In terms of gender equality, 55% appointed were male and 45% female so it was approaching the 60:40 ratio.  Applications received were 69% male and 31% female so the balancing carried out by the PAS equated better to the target we want to achieve.</p><p>We are not very far from having a proper 40% gender quota established across State boards and I am confident we can do it very quickly, if it has not already been done since this analysis was conducted.  The arbitration board is now with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  There was a real issue about appointing the right chair, which is why the chair was recruited separately.  If I recall, it was Dr. Bunni who was appointed.  He was recruited because he has international experience in the area.  The panel is still being finalised.  I will obtain up-to-date information for Deputy Sean Fleming on when this might be done.</p><p> With regard to Garda recruitment and the unique identifier-----</p></speech>

Every person is required to apply with photographic ID and receives a unique identifier.  After the second test, successful candidates are brought forward for supervised tests.  There is still an unanswered question.  It could potentially give a person a leg up if he or she got over the first hurdle with assistance.</p></speech>

Now that Deputy Fleming has raised it with me, I will see if anything can be done.  It will be very hard.  There were approximately 25,000 applicants for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Online applications make the process very efficient.  It is the same with any postal application in that one cannot be sure the person who signs the form is the person he or she claims to be, unless everyone is brought in in tranches.  To do that for 25,000 people and to supervise them would add immeasurably to the cost.  I will raise the point and ask PAS to consider the point Deputy Fleming has made.</p></speech>

The Minister said he is trying to predict who is going to retire or to apply to retire.  Could there not be a yearly cap on that so that the predictions would be more accurate?  Could a time limit be put on it whereby everybody has to submit his or her application by the end of October, for example, so there is no discrepancy in the figures?  I am glad to hear the National Pensions Reserve Fund is being discussed.  It would probably be prudent to put something in place there to start building that back up again.  The Minister spoke about cost-neutral early retirement.  For whom is it cost-neutral?  Have any costings been done on the loss of experience from people?  It might be cost-neutral for the employee at some stage but is there a cost in terms of the loss of experience that is hard to replace?  Do we have to bring other expertise in to cover for people who leave with very significant experience?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22015120200002#E01100"><p>Deputy Barry asked a number of questions.  We do not have redundancy in the public service in general but we have cost-neutral early retirement.  That is simply if one wants to retire before reaching one's retirement age.  Actuarially, we have worked out that it is approximately 5% off one's pension and lump sum per year that one retires early so that the cost to the Exchequer is not impacted.  When I say cost-neutral, I am talking about the cost to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  Bluntly, if somebody gets to a certain age and they really want to retire, is it in the interest of the public service to keep him or her if he or she says he or she is burned out or finished?  I am not sure it would be wise to require people to work beyond that if they are within hailing distance of their normal retirement age.  There could be a whole range of family circumstances, new responsibilities, caring responsibilities and so on that might make it impossible for people to go on.  In terms of predictability, we do our best to look at what average annual retirements occur and then we look at the age cohort.  There will be particular peak years because an intake year will mature at a given point.  As there is a time horizon between the ages of 60 and 65 for people to make that choice, normally, one cannot be absolutely accurate in respect of it.</p> <p>  In terms of notice, principal officer grades and above are required to give three months' notice but other grades lower than that are legally obliged to give notice of only a week.  In fact, virtually everybody will give significantly more notice than that because they will want to work out what their entitlements are and to ensure that the shared service for pay is geared up to pay them on time.  To alter that, there would have to be negotiations on a sectoral basis with each of the trade unions involved.  I have looked at a minimum notice period myself because, for example, when we were mapping the exit during the difficult period, as a matter of policy, I determined that everyone should give a minimum of three months' notice.  That was adhered to, although it could be challenged.  I asked for a minimum notice of three months for practical purposes so that in a time when we were not recruiting, we could prepare to ensure that services ran smoothly where there would be a particular impact and for everyone to be paid in a timely fashion.  It is something the next Government might look at.</p></speech>

This report recommended a number of changes if we are to improve the ratings that put Ireland at the bottom of the ranking of OECD countries in terms of the level of budget engagement by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The committee secretariat had already been working to make improvements in how Estimates are presented to committees before this report was issued and over the past year, it has engaged intensively with eight Departments.</p> <p>  Our committee has already done considerable work with the OPW on improving the quality of performance measures it includes in its Estimates.  We now encourage and request that the Minister's Department engages closely with the secretariat early in 2016 to begin the process of making its performance, targets and outputs more outwardly focused, meaningful and measurable to both the committee and the broader public.  We also ask for his support and co-operation as the House moves to implement the broader OECD recommendations in co-operation with Departments so that we can work together to improve transparency and ensure public moneys are spent as effectively as possible.  I know the Minister has a strong interest in this and that he is very well aware of the report but maybe he will give us his own comments on the recommendations in the new year.</p></speech>

Pursuant to Standing Orders, we must report back to the D&aacute;il no later than 9 December 2015.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of an Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe and his officials and invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1098" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI32015120200002#A00400"><p>I thank the committee for making time available today to consider my request for a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  As committee members are no doubt aware, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and provides solicitor services within the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and to Government Departments and offices.  The office has a wide remit including the area of civil litigation in all courts, including the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, and the provision of conveyancing, property law and general services for an array of Civil Service clients.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive, capable of attracting publicity and sometimes involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate is sought to cover extra expenditure on fees to counsel in 2015.  Expenditure on counsel fees is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any time and so is always difficult for the office to forecast.  In addition, recent years have seen a marked increase in the complexity of work being handled by the office in areas such as commercial litigation, transactional and procurement work, as well as advisory and litigation work resulting from our membership of the European Union and the implementation of directives in areas such as environmental law, planning, employment and social welfare law.  In areas such as judicial review, a faster throughput of cases by the courts has resulted in a marked increase in the number of fee items payable such as brief fees, fees for refreshers, consultations, advice, opinions, submissions and affidavits and a greater involvement of senior counsel.  </p> <p>  It should be borne in mind that the Estimate allocation for fees paid to counsel was very much reduced in 2014 due to the ongoing financial situation.  The office struggled to remain within the allocation last year and had an overspend of &euro;200,000 which it managed to cover through savings in other areas of the Vote without the need for a Supplementary Estimate.  </p> <p>  The management of expenditure on counsel fees is a key activity for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  These are fees payable to counsel representing Departments and offices in litigation before the Irish courts and other tribunals as well as the European Court of Justice.  They also include fees payable for the provision of legal advice for the State, whether sought for the Attorney General&rsquo;s office or for Departments and offices.  </p> <p>  An allocation of &euro;9.6 million was made for expenditure on fees for counsel in 2015, which was the same as 2014.  However, due to a number of factors it has not proved possible for the office to remain within that allocation.  The office has observed that the issues raised in cases taken against the State are becoming increasingly complex.  In late 2014 and into 2015 the office dealt with a major civil action in the High Court which required significant input from counsel over a long period of time.  While the fees paid to counsel in this one case were very large, the exposure of the State to damages awarded if the State had lost would have been far greater.  The office has also had to deal with a number of challenges to referendums.  The area of public procurement has also expanded in recent years and some significant challenges are beginning to arise.  This has led to an increase in the requirement to use counsel.  The office has seen a 14% increase in the services delivered by counsel in the period January to mid-November compared to the same period last year. </p> <p>  It is estimated that the office will have an overspend of &euro;2.5 million on fees to counsel this year.  However the office has made savings of &euro;1 million in other areas of the Vote and is now seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1.5 million.  The office has made savings of &euro;500,000 in its payroll allocation due to difficulties filling vacancies at solicitor level and the retirement of senior staff at the top of their pay scale with replacements commencing at the first point on the scale.  Savings of &euro;300,000 have been made in the general administration subheads due to lower than estimated expenditure on IT systems and refurbishment work on the offices.  A further &euro;200,000 has been saved in general law expenses as the requirement has proved lower than expected at the start of the year. </p> <p>  Expenditure in the area in 2015 is expected to compare to the level of spend in 2013 and will still be approximately 30% lower than the expenditure in 2008, at the start of the financial crisis.  I am pleased to recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the select sub-committee.</p></speech>

If cases were settled earlier, would it result in lower fees?  If one takes the example of the HSE, it regularly issues half hearted apologies seven years after children suffer catastrophic injuries at birth.  That seven year period would involve quite a build up of fees.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the relationship between the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the State Claims Agency because on average, if a settlement is made for &euro;1 million, the legal and professional costs add another &euro;0.5 million to the bill.  In other words, for every &euro;1 million settlement by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the HSE, by far the biggest area, the add-on for professional and legal fees is 50% on average.  That has been the case for the last number of years.  If there are settlements of &euro;60 million in full year, the legal fees are &euro;30 million.  I often feel that if State agencies were a bit more up front earlier in the process, cases would be settled more quickly.  A lot of people who take cases would be happy to settle earlier with an acknowledgement that something went wrong.  That would take a lot of the heat out of such cases.</p></speech>

We are at fault in that regard to some degree because debates have been going on in this House for the last decade or more about a no-fault compensation system and annual rather than lump sum payments.  The problem is that annual payments are seen as income whereas lump sum payments are not taxable.  We should do something about that as soon as possible.  We have a responsibility in this House to get that issue sorted out.</p></speech>

There are cases where an individual's legal team is encouraged to enter mediation with the State but that does not always happen because some people want their day in court, so to speak and that is where the expenses begin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI32015120200002#A00800"><p>Has the new Court of Appeal which is now up and running become another gravy train for the legal profession?  Are there many cases where one State agency is suing another?  I am not expecting to get that information now but I ask the Minister of State to provide a report on that as soon as possible.  We often hear of cases where a local authority is being sued by the Inland Fisheries Board, for example.  State agencies often have competing briefs.  If we want to do something on a river, for example, the Inland Fisheries Board might have one view on it, while the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, or a local authority might have a different view.</p><p>Sometimes in such cases, State agencies end up facing each other in court at the taxpayer's expense.  If the Minister of State does not have any information on that question now, I ask that he would send on a note to the committee.  That is the sort of thing that drives people bonkers, when the taxpayer is being caught for the costs on both sides.</p></speech>

I am certainly aware of plenty of cases where one arm of the State is up against another arm.  That does happen and is quite normal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI32015120200002#B00300"><p>I mean no disrespect when I say that this is a fairly arcane area as far as parliamentarians are concerned.  We would not really be in a position to evaluate or assess the information we get at Estimate time about the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  It is very difficult to form a view on it.  There have been celebrated cases in the past fitting into the first category mentioned by the Minister of State, that is, cases that might be deemed to have a constitutional basis but there have also been a number of celebrated cases where the advice to the State or to the Minister was the State should not mediate or settle the case because that would mean the end of civilisation as we know it.  The advice was that there would be terrible knock-on effects and so forth but I have been around long enough to know that once or twice we had to suck it and see.  After all of the delays and so forth, the outcomes were embarrassing but the house of cards did not come tumbling down.  That may well not be a matter that the Chief State Solicitor's office decides upon but it is an issue nonetheless.</p> <p>  In terms of the delays to which Deputy Fleming quite properly drew attention, is the Minister of State in a position to clarify the impact of the Court of Appeal?  Will that court facilitate speedier resolution of cases?  How much of this relates to how the system works, namely that lawyers determine the speed with which these cases are disposed of?  At the end of a number of years, lawyers can decide that they want to mediate, negotiate and settle but those options were out of the question earlier on.  The costs mount up and we are not really competent to say that the fees paid out are fair.  I presume the Minister of State will say that they are market prices but to the man or woman on the street, the market prices are almost incomprehensible.  Is the Minister of State in a position to say how the last eight years of recession have impacted on fees?   Have the fees dispensed come down appreciably?  Is that evident in the sense that the recession affected every other section of the community?  Have fees come down in the case of lawyers?  </p></speech>

I can understand people's frustration when they see the exorbitant fees that some people are getting.  That said, they do not get the rates of pay that some senior counsel might enjoy because they are appointed by the Attorney General.</p></speech>

Some members have been detained with other business and are due to arrive shortly.  We already have three members present.  I extend a very warm welcome to Ms Sarah O'Toole, Mr. Lars Bosselmann and Dr. Mary Keogh of Christian Blind Missions, CBM, Ireland.  I congratulate CBM Ireland on its work in protecting the human rights of people with disabilities around the world and its advocacy on their behalf.  It is important that we have the witnesses before us to tell their story because it is a very good news story.  Today's meeting is timely in so far as the recently adopted sustainable development goals, SDGs, include references to people with disabilities.  There are explicit references to them in the goals and we look forward to hearing more about the issue in this afternoon's presentation.  The format of today's meeting will involve an opening statement followed by a question-and-answer session.  I was delighted to hear that members of CBM Ireland from as far away as Australia saw our press release yesterday.  It is good to see that we are being listened to far away as well.</p><p>I remind members and those in the pubic Gallery to switch off their mobile phones.  They must ensure they are completely switched off for the duration of the meeting as they do cause interference even in silent mode with the recording equipment in the committee room.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Without further ado, I call on Ms O'Toole to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am the CEO of CBM Ireland and with me today is Mr. Lars Bosselmann, director of advocacy for CBM International.  On my left is Dr. Mary Keogh, a board member of CBM Ireland and also the adviser on advocacy and policy for both CBM International and CBM Australia.  I will give a brief introduction about the organisation and Mr. Bosselmann will talk about the sustainable development goals.  Dr. Keogh will speak further on Ireland's commitment to people with disabilities through the SDGs and our overseas development aid programme.<br/><br/>Members are probably aware that one in seven people in the world today live with a disability.  That equates to 1 billion people.  They are the world's largest minority.  CBM<b></b>is an international development organisation, committed to improving the quality of life of people with disabilities in the poorest countries of the world.  We do that in a number of ways.  Currently, we are working with approximately 500 partner organisations in 65 countries across Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.  We work with the partner organisations to deliver medical services, health care, community-based rehabilitation, education and livelihood opportunities for people with disabilities and their families.<br/><br/>When an emergency occurs in times of conflict or natural disaster, we ensure the rights of people with disabilities in those situations are not forgotten.  We partner with local organisations on the ground to provide access to emergency relief and supplies for people with disabilities.  In terms of our advocacy work both in Ireland and internationally, we work to protect the human rights of people with disabilities are met both in development policies and programmes.  We work with governments, state agencies and other development organisations to ensure we meet that goal.  I will hand over to Mr. Bosselmann who will speak further on the sustainable development goals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lars Bosselmann" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015120200002#B00800"><p>I thank Ms O'Toole.  I also thank members for their kind invitation to speak before the committee.  As the Chairman has already said, in contrast to the millennium development goals, the sustainable development goals that were recently adopted and that will be in place for the next 15 years include a number of specific references to the rights of persons with disabilities.  I will start by making some reflections on why that is important and why the disability movement has fought so hard for almost the past three years to get inclusion and recognition in the SDGs of the rights of persons with disabilities.  These kind of global frameworks set and agree priorities for a long time.</p><p>When a topic is included, it is much easier to argue that it is important.  When a topic is not included, it is almost impossible to talk to decision makers, officials and others about it because they say "It is definitely an important cause but it is not part of the globally agreed agenda" and it stays as a sort of side issue.  That happened frequently with the millennium development goals, for example, in the case of disability.  We are extremely happy that the potential now exists for this to change in the context of the sustainable development goals.</p><p> The second point I will make is that it is important for a topic to be included in the sustainable development goals from the beginning because they will be in place for 15 years, which is a long time.  If a topic is not included, which is what happened with disability in the case of the millennium development goals, it is out for 15 years.  It is very difficult to rectify that during the course of the implementation of global frameworks that have been agreed.</p><p> The third point I would like to make is an obvious one.  The global frameworks determine to a large extent where the money goes.  If that were not the case, why would priorities be set?  If the cause one is defending is not part of the agenda, money will not be spent on it.</p><p> My final point relates to what happens when an issue is not included in an agenda such as the millennium development goals or the sustainable development goals.  What is not in is not measured.  The big advantage of the sustainable development goals from our perspective is that disability is included.  It is there, so it needs to be measured, reported and monitored.  That is one of the most significant things the sustainable development goals have the potential to achieve.</p><p> I will explain the importance of measurement.  As a result of the exclusion of disability from the millennium development goals, today in 2015 we have a fairly weak body of evidence with regard to disability.  There are good examples of country studies and case studies and there are good research pieces here and there, but overall we have a fairly weak body of evidence regarding how many people with disabilities there are, where they are living globally, what their needs are and how they can be included in different sectors such as education and employment.  That is why it is so important for the collection of data to be improved.  We need to have data available so that we know where people with disabilities live, what their needs are and how policies can better address their rights and needs.  We need a much better base of data and evidence than we have at present.  One of the achievements of the sustainable development goals is that they foresee making data disaggregation a reality in their implementation.  For those who want to have the precise reference, this is set out in goal 17.</p><p> Implementation has already been mentioned.  Of course the sustainable development goals, like all global frameworks, will only be as good as we make their implementation.  We all have a role to play - I refer to civil society, parliamentarians, Governments and UN agencies - in living up to the high expectations that have been raised.  We have to be honest and say that expectations have been raised with regard to disability and many other causes.  Of course expectations are high because disability is included this time.  We want to see progress in implementation as well as inclusion in the document.  For that reason, it is important to look at monitoring, at how to translate global goals to the national reality, at the indicators and at how to measure progress.  Parliamentarians and many others have a role to play in all of that.  My colleague, Dr. Keogh, will say a few words and offer a few thoughts and suggestions from our side on the concrete things the committee can do to make the goals for people with disabilities a reality.</p></speech>

I am honoured to be here.  Mr. Bosselmann spoke about the international context and the sustainable development goals.  I will speak about the Irish context.  In recent years, the Government and Irish Aid have made significant progress on the inclusion of people with disabilities in Ireland's overseas programme.  As the briefing paper that has been furnished to the committee goes through that in detail, I will not allude further to it.  I suggest it is fair to say that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is largely driving the commitments being made by the Government with regard to inclusive development.  I know the Government has set out a roadmap for the ratification of the UN convention in the future.</p> <p>  The significance of the One World, One Future policy is that it involves a leadership approach to disability.  This progressive document commits the Government to devoting more resources to achieving equality for people with disabilities.  We are delighted to see that Irish Aid is delivering on these important commitments to people with disabilities in the developing world in areas such as human rights, public services and livelihoods.  We acknowledge that the parliamentary questions which have been discussed in recent times have given an increased visibility to people with disabilities in the overseas aid programme.  There is a commitment within that programme to look at Ireland's role in ensuring the implementation of the sustainable development goals is inclusive of people with disabilities.</p> <p>  This is a crux time because the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the sustainable development goals have given us a foundation, for one of the first times ever, to advance the human rights of people with disabilities who live in some of the poorest countries of the world.  We strongly urge the committee, in its regular review of Ireland's overseas development aid programme and in its future progress reports on sustainable development goals, to look at ways of measuring the specific impacts these initiatives are having on people with disabilities.  Mr. Bosselmann alluded to that when he spoke about the importance of monitoring data.</p> <p>  We would like to see continuing engagement.  We have had very good engagement with Irish Aid in recent years through CBM Ireland and through the coalitions with the D&oacute;chas working group on disability and development.  We would like to see that continue.  We are endeavouring to work in partnership to ensure we can support an international development programme that is inclusive of people with disabilities.</p></speech>

I congratulate the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.  I have read their substantial documentation and have put it on file upstairs for future reference.  I thank Dr. Keogh for acknowledging the Government's efforts to fine-tune its overseas development aid programme through Irish Aid.  I have a great deal of experience of Africa, having lived there for four years.  In comparing the facilities that are available in premier western countries to treat people with disabilities with the ability of countries like Sierra Leone that have emerged from war to look after such people, we need to bear in mind the presence of indigenous illnesses like malaria in such countries.  The effects of malaria can have a damaging effect on the brain.  Similarly, I remember that the Masai people used to put stuff on their hair - I think it was cow dung - and blindness was a significant problem for them.  When one compares the ability of various societies to treat people with disabilities as equals, it is clear that we have greater prospects in that regard in the west.  That is why the sustainable development goals are of key importance.  They reflect an international commitment to treat everybody as an equal citizen of the world.  I congratulate the witnesses and ask them to keep up the good work.  I apologise again for having to leave the meeting.</p></speech>

This important area has been neglected over the decades.  Those of us who have travelled to Third World countries with Irish Aid have seen some examples of that neglect.  I would like to raise two particular issues, the first of which is Irish Aid's approach to the treatment of intellectual disability in developing countries.</p><p>Globally, we must ensure that disabilities are included in sustainable development goals, SDGs, and so on.  However, people in many of the countries in question think of physical disability more than intellectual disability.  In Ireland, we have spent decades working on developing thinking in this regard, so it is not unique.  It was the thinking in the western world 100 years ago or less.</p><p> While mental illness is an illness and not a disability, it is often included with disabilities in the countries to which I refer.  Sometimes, the treatment of mental illness falls between the two stools of disability and physical illness because of a question of interpretation.  People occasionally group intellectual disability and mental illness together but intellectual disability is a condition, not an illness.  Will the witnesses address these points?</p><p> I have seen extreme neglect of disability in other countries.  In India, for example, there are people with disabilities on the streets as a result of that country's caste system.  Very distressingly, I have seen people with extreme disabilities begging on streets and trying to survive while being neglected by every system.  That is how it appears, so perhaps the witnesses will clarify the position.  India is not strictly a Third World county but that could be argued.  This problem is present and the cultures of some countries have a bearing on the neglect of people with disabilities and mental illness.  A short address on this issue would be appreciated.</p></speech>

That disabilities and so on are included in the SDGs is significant for our guests.  I read their submissions briefly.  They are doing significant work in some of the most troubled parts of the world.  What level of support are they getting from Irish Aid and how has that changed in recent years in light of the worsening humanitarian situation in some parts of the world?  What are the group's plans, ambitions and main objectives for 2016 and what are the most difficult challenges it faces?</p></speech>

We have partnered with Irish Aid for a number of years.  Currently, we are co-funding a project with it in Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC.  It is a significant programme for us because we are working on community-based rehabilitation, which is focused on providing access to services for people with disabilities and ensuring their participation in providing those services.  It is a significant leap forward in how we deliver our development programmes.  The project focuses on orthopaedic care.  It is sometimes misleading when one says, &quot;Christian Blind Mission&quot;, so we say &quot;CBM&quot;.  Our founding services related to eye health but they now concern eye health, ear and hearing care, physical disability, mental health and intellectual disability.  We cover the whole spectrum of disability.  We view poverty as a cause of disability and <i>vice versa</i>in the communities in which we work.<br/><br/>In 2015, Irish Aid gave us funding to the tune of &euro;51,500 for the Goma project.  We hope to build upon that project.  We welcome that we are a recipient of a civil society fund grant from Irish Aid.  An important part of the programme is that it supplies us with good data on how to provide our services better.  They also serve as a measure of the programme's performance.  We are committed to that.  Significantly, we seek to fight the stigma of disability under the programme.  Members spoke about culture and beliefs around disability.  We have a group of community workers involved in the project who are trained.  They also have disabilities.  They go into communities to discuss the project and encourage people to participate and come forward for services.  It is an important project for us.  Obviously, we hope to build on it next year and work more closely with Irish Aid with a view to disability-inclusive development in the broader sense and a consideration of how we might assist in developing and enhancing programmes in order to ensure that people with disabilities are not left behind.</p></speech>

It works with people with mental health issues and tries to improve their integration in their community.  As Ms O'Toole mentioned, this is done via self-help and empowerment.  It is a major focus of CBM's work in terms of working with people with intellectual disabilities and mental health issues.  It has led to benefits for people in their community, in that they have developed to the point of running their own businesses, gained acceptance from other community members and become involved in a stronger movement in their local area to hold decision makers to account.  It has been a successful project.</p></speech>

It is important for CBM International to view ourselves and the cause of disability not just as a theme that we are concerned with and working on but as a broader movement towards human rights and their realisation.  Many groups in the population do not qualify medically as persons with disabilities but are marginalised and excluded from their communities or societies.  It is important to us that we fight for the same rights for everyone.  We focus on disability in our project work but we do that from a human rights perspective.  The SDGs call on all of us, including CBM and civil society, to see that bigger picture and work on it comprehensively.  We try to move strongly in that direction.</p></speech>

It mainly causes misunderstandings but not trouble or difficulties, which are different.  We must always explain that, while these are our roots, value base and history as an organisation, that does not mean that we are doing missionary work.  Instead, we are working with people.  This means among our own staff as well as with partners and the projects that we support.  We do not ask people to be Christians or have a Christian faith base.  We are working with everyone.  That question arises, as the Deputy has rightly guessed.</p><p>We have to explain that, but it is not something that causes trouble or difficulty in the ongoing work.</p></speech>

In regard to people in Ireland with disabilities, does CBM have to explain its work to people who feel excluded from Irish society?  Some people would say we have enough of a problem here at home and ask why CBM is not addressing that problem.</p></speech>

We are discussing this in the context of the sustainable development goals, SDGs, which are both international and national.  Therefore, the Irish Government will also be considering the creation of a plan for Ireland, which will provide an opportunity to advance the rights of people with disabilities.  As a campaigner for disability rights in Ireland previously, I am quite proud of the fact that the Irish Government funds overseas programmes that include people with disabilities.  I do not see it as an either-or situation.</p></speech>

We are talking about 1 billion people with disabilities, 80% of whom live in developing countries in areas of high risk.  Does CBM work in areas like that?  Many of those people fleeing from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan have disabilities.  Is CBM working with them? </p></speech>

I had not realised the impact of disasters on people with disabilities until I attended the event held by CBM in regard to the Philippines.  That brought home in a stark way the impact disasters, whether man-made or natural, have on communities, but the impact on people with disabilities is a hundred thousand times worse.  We are not as cognisant of that as we should be.</p> <p>  I know CBM is supportive of - I acknowledge the work it has done on this - having disability included in many of the sustainable development goals.  However, we know these goals will not be worth the paper they are written on unless we make plans and these are monitored and implemented.  I know there could be difficulties in regard to this if we just consider the data in terms of disability, as opposed to disaggregating it.  I would like to hear CBM's views on that.  It is important we get the evidence and that work is evidence-based in the future.  If something is not working or achieving the target, how are we to deal with that?  I believe regular but strict monitoring is required and that we need specific data on the goals and whether they are being achieved.</p></speech>

As a rule, the difficult questions come to me.  How could I now sit here and say the goals will not be achieved?  However, the point is well taken.  There are 17 goals and 169 targets and it goes without saying that these numbers tell us it will be difficult to achieve and make equal progress on all targets and goals.</p> <p>  It is important that we look at the progress we make globally and overall towards achieving the targets.  Also, every country comes at this from a different starting point in regard to making progress towards the targets.  The monitoring must make that differentiation and must understand that Ireland, Germany and others do not come from the same starting point as, for example, Malawi.  This is part of the novelty of the SDGs compared to the millennium development goals, and it is because it is global.  Of course, this also makes the monitoring pretty complex and complicated, because it can be difficult to make comparisons.  It is not really about making comparisons, but about tailoring the goals to the status of each country.</p> <p>  Overall, we are 15 years working in development.  This may seem a long time, but it is a short time in development.  A key target for me is to sustain the momentum that has been created around the adoption of the SDGs, not only in New York in September, so that we do not waste the next five to eight years.  The first half of the implementation phase is critical, because that is often when it becomes a little difficult to implement global frameworks.  We are also satisfied now the goals have been adopted, because we have been working already for up to three years on them - not just CBM but all UN agencies and governments.  Often after the goals are adopted, we are inclined to relax a little and take time to breathe, but that is not what should happen.  The momentum must be sustained because the next years are critical for making progress. </p></speech>

We have come through a period of exclusion and are now at the table, so now is the time for funding and facilitation to support that.</p></speech>

Are there frameworks operating in other countries that we can adopt?  We need to see progress on these goals.  There has been disquiet over the millennium development goals in regard to how much they achieved.  Now we have 17 sustainable development goals and have an even greater task.  It is important we monitor regularly whether these goals are being achieved and if not, why not, and that if necessary we can then move in a different direction.</p></speech>

For example, UK Aid and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are looking at the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, which provides a short set of questions that can be applied to statistical surveys within a country to gather data on disability.  Currently, there is investment at UN level for that.  Therefore, I believe that may be the framework for the future.  Again, because we are working through a global framework, different countries will have a different approach.</p><p>This appears to be the consensus at the moment.  There is progress on that and I can provide further detail.  I can send the committee a paper, if that is helpful.</p></speech>

The main point was that we had to raise awareness of disabled people living in such places and how vulnerable they are.  After such events, people face difficulties trying to travel from one place to another.  The message was that disability should be at the heart of any response.  How aware are the different programmes of that issue?  Disability is unquestionably a development and poverty issue.  How can we better mainstream disability into the development process?</p></speech>

A Sendai framework was developed at a conference on disability, inclusive development, disaster and risk reduction.  On that occasion, we advocated for people with disabilities to be included in the framework.  I am delighted that a specific reference to people with disabilities has been included in all emergency response programmes.  Hopefully, that will merge together with the sustainable development goals, thus ensuring we have inclusion throughout for sustainable development and in emergency situations.</p> <p>  The Philippines were mentioned.  Last year we were delighted to host a disabled persons' organisation that we partnered with when the typhoon hit.  It was a partner we had worked with for a number of years.  Importantly, in terms of our response, it knew where the people with disabilities were and was able to access them.  That was crucial in saving many lives.  It responded quite actively during that disaster by getting emergency supplies to people with disabilities, whether it was simply their medication or blankets or getting them out of the situation in which they found themselves.  For us, it is not just about us delivering services to people with disabilities; it is about the participation of those groups.  We support a number of disabled persons' organisations around the world, as does Irish Aid.  We think that is an important part of true inclusive development.  We are at a point in time where we have a real opportunity for true inclusion.  As Mr. Lars Bosselmann said, we should not wait for ratification and decisions on indicators.  Ireland has a very significant overseas development aid programme and has made significant commitments to people with disabilities.  We are at a point now where we must start to measure performance and we urge the committee to build that into its annual review in terms of Ireland's commitments.  There are frameworks that Ireland can use and now is the time to do it so that nobody is forgotten.</p></speech>

The purpose of this meeting is to have an engagement with Ms Margaret Taylor, chairperson designate of the Classification of Film Appeals Board.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Taylor and thank her for attending.  The format of the meeting will be that she will be invited to make a brief opening statement and there will be a question-and-answer session after that.</p>  <p>  Before we begin, I draw Ms Taylor's attention to the position on privilege.  She should note that she is protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence she gives to the committee.  However, if she is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and she continues to so do, she is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of her evidence.  She is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind Members that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I have been nominated as chairperson of the Classification of Film Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  I can demonstrate a track record of successfully applying regulation, sound judgement and a solid record of decision-making throughout my career.  I have 29 years' experience in the retail and leisure industries, starting with Golden Discs in 1979.  I have ten years' direct experience in the cinema industry as managing director of Virgin Cinemas and UGC UK and Ireland.  I have over ten years' experience at board level in companies whose turnover has ranged from &pound;90 to &pound;500 million.  During my time in the cinema industry I had exposure to the film distribution and production industries.  I also served as a member of First Light, an initiative funded by the United Kingdom Film Council to encourage young film-makers in schools and youth groups.  I completed the successful sale of both the Virgin and UGC cinema circuits, achieving multiples of 13 and 11 times EBITDA, that is, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, respectively, in 1999 and 2004.  I retired to Ireland in 2005 and I live in west Cork.  I am currently in my final year at UCC completing a BA in English and politics.</p>  <p>  Classification decisions are made by the director of film classification at the Irish Film Classification Office, IFCO.  The classification awarded to any given work is determined by application of classification guidelines, the main issues under consideration being violence, sex, drugs and language.  The overall tone and context in which this material is presented will often be the determining factor in the classification awarded.  When deciding on a classification, the IFCO considers the context and impact of the film as a whole rather than on the basis of one short image or scene.  Consideration is given to whether content is presented within an educational context, for example, social themes such as anti-drugs or anti-discrimination or historical themes.</p>  <p>  Although the prohibition of films remains within the remit of IFCO, there is general recognition nowadays that, as long as it is within the law, adults should be able to decide for themselves what they would like to view when they go to the cinema.  The main emphasis is, therefore, on classification rather than censorship, as well as the protection of children and the promotion of parental responsibility.  The IFCO has a duty to protect children and young people from harm and actively encourages feedback from the public and parents or guardians in particular.  If a member of the public is not happy with a film classification decision, it is open to that person to contact IFCO directly by e-mail, as outlined on the IFCO website.</p>  <p>  The provision of the Film Classification Appeals Board is required under the Censorship of Films Act 1923.  The board consists of nine members, one of whom serves as chairperson.  The board also provides the appeals function under the Video Recordings Act 1989.  Therefore, theatrical and DVD certifications may be appealed.  The process is straightforward.  Any distributor who is aggrieved by the decision of the director of film classification to either grant a classification or prohibit a title may appeal to the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Under the process, a letter to the chairperson outlining the reasons for appeal and an appeal fee of &euro;1,000 is forwarded.  Upon receiving notice of appeal, the secretary contacts the board to arrange a suitable date to view the title.  The secretary will circulate the letters of the director and the distributor to the entire board.  After the board members have viewed the title, they discuss and complete a register with their decision to either grant or reject the appeal.  The secretary will notify the director and distributor of the decision and if the appeal is granted, the appeal fee is refunded and a new certificate is issued.</p>  <p>  There were no appeals to the Classification of Film Appeals Board during 2013.  The term of office of the board ended on 29 April 2013.  There were no video appeals in 2012 and three theatrical appeals.  In those cases all the certificates were revised by the appeals board.  In 2013, at total of 768 films, trailers and shorts received certification and 4,336 DVDs or videos received certification.  There are currently no appeals on hand but this could, of course, change at any given time if a distributor is aggrieved by a classification decision.</p> <p>The chairperson of the appeal board reports annually to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I will ensure, as far as possible, that decisions of the board, after full consideration reach consensus.  Unanimous decisions are always desirable.  I thank the members for their attention.</p></speech>

If an appeal board had been in place in 2014 and 2015, it would not have been busy.  Have the other board members been appointed?  What is the board's structure?  Are the appointments made by the Minister?  Are people from the film industry eligible for appointment?  How are the appointments decided?  What is Ms Taylor's remuneration, as chairperson, and what level of remuneration do ordinary board members receive?</p></speech>

That is down to the legislation.  The appeal board is provided for in the legislation.  It is an example of good governance.  If there is a dispute, this is a mechanism to resolve it.  Whether the legislation should be amended is a matter for the Minister.</p>  <p>  There are nine members.  I believe they are ministerial appointments.  A completely new board is being put together and I understand this is being done by the Public Appointments Service.  The board is gender equal or perhaps split five to four.  There is no remuneration for any board member, with the exception of expenses in the event that travel or accommodation are required.  There were three appeals one year but, as the Senator rightly pointed out, we do not expect to meet often.  That is a sign of the good job the film classification director does.  Appeals are the exception rather than the rule.</p></speech>

If there is an appeal, &euro;1,000 seems an onerous amount to be obliged to pay.  Perhaps it is not.  I do not have great knowledge of the financial structures of the industry.  When a film is referred to the appeal board, it is circulated to the members.  They will view it and then meet to have a discussion on it before deciding whether to uphold the appeal.</p></speech>

It is a new board and it makes sense that we meet initially.  I have no doubt they will have questions and will want to review previous decisions.  I can reassure the Senator, based on my experience of the industry, that &euro;1,000 is not a great deal of money in the grand scheme of things in terms of film turnover.  That would be true of the big studios' productions but not necessarily of the smaller films.  I understand the appeals that have been heard have tended to be taken by the major studios and there may be an issue in this regard.</p></speech>

Given the wide availability of material on the Internet, does this make classification redundant?  We have received presentations over the years regarding what is available online and children of any age can access virtually anything at the touch of a button.  Obviously, neither the film board or the appeal board can classify, censor or otherwise regulate this material.</p></speech>

The 1923 legislation is fantastic.  It is six pages long and it is incredibly succinct compared to the Video Recordings Act 1989, which is 70 pages long.  That is an observation that might be worth exploring.  It is testament to the 1923 Act that it has stood the test of time.  It was introduced when silent movies were out.</p>  <p>  The film censor would probably be able to give the Chairman a much better view.  The world is changing.</p></speech>

The purpose of amendment No 1 is to provide for a tougher sentencing regime.  When we engage with members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly at public meetings around the country, they tell us that the same small number of people are engaged in the vast number of burglaries.  We want the message to go out that there will be stiffer sentences.  We do not think, from what we have been told, that the number of people involved is large so there will not be a revolving-door problem with the prisons.  Its purpose is to try to build in tougher sentencing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015120200002#A00700"><p>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is participating in a debate in the Seanad.</p> <p>  It is important to note that burglary is an indictable defence which is triable summarily.  While the vast majority of burglary trials ultimately take place in the District Court on a summary basis, trial on indictment is the default position in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  Even for what might be considered a less serious incidence of the offence, a summary trial can only occur where a court is of the opinion that the offence is a minor one fit to be tried summarily, the accused does not object to being tried summarily and the Director of Pubic Prosecutions consents to the accused being tried summarily.  In that context, we must keep in mind the wide variety of offending that can constitute burglary ranges from a terrifying home invasion to the less serious offence of entering a garden shed to commit criminal damage through graffiti or by damaging the shed in another way.  Providing for a mandatory three-year minimum term of imprisonment for such behaviour could in some cases be seen as disproportionate.</p> <p>  Apart from offences where mandatory sentences or presumptive mandatory sentences apply - for example, in murder or drug trafficking cases, respectively - the general approach is for the Oireachtas to set a maximum sentence in statute and leave the precise sentence in any case to the discretion of the judge who will have regard to the relevant principles and circumstances of each case.  Proportionality is the main principle in forming the approach to sentencing in Ireland.  Tom O'Malley, BL, the leading legal academic on sentencing law and a member of the Law Reform Commission, has stated, "However, in this country we adhere strongly to proportionality as the dominant distributive principle of punishment."  He continued to say that a sentence should be "proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the personal circumstances of the offender as they exist at the time of sentence."</p> <p>  The Law Reform Commission examined the issue of mandatory sentences in detail in its 2013 report.  It was in favour of retaining the mandatory sentence for murder but was of the view that for other offences, mandatory sentencing regimes are too rigid and have not been shown to be effective in reducing offending and offences.  It recommended that presumptive minimum sentences should not be extended and that existing provisions should be repealed.  The unanimous report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality published in March 2013 is also an important contribution to the debate on penal reform and contains analysis and recommendations which significantly advance the debate on how best to protect society through effective offender management and reduced use of imprisonment.  The report of the penal policy review group which took the joint committee's report into account was published in September 2014.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, referred the group's report to the joint committee in November 2014 for its consideration and appreciates the committee's feedback.  While the reports have much in common, there are some variations in approach.  These can be examined as part of the ongoing process of implementation.</p> <p>  The penal policy review group recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced and existing provisions should be reviewed.  The report of the review group contains 43 recommendations in total, some of which can be implemented in the short to medium term while others will require a much longer-term approach.  As an initial step, in November 2014, the Minister obtained the agreement, in principle, of Government to proceed immediately with the implementation of the following key recommendations: to bring forward legislative proposals to establish the parole board on an independent statutory basis; to prepare proposals and options for Government on reform of sentencing policy including a review of the threshold at which presumptive minimum sentences on drugs and other offences apply; to prepare proposals for Government on legislating for the review's recommendation that courts set out in writing their reasons for imposing a custodial sentence; to prepare proposals on the potential for increased use of earned remission; and to pursue options for an open prison for female offenders.  Work is under way to progress the implementation of these recommendations.</p><p>To this end, the Minister has established a penal policy implementation oversight group to oversee implementation of these recommendations and to report back to her on a regular basis.  The group is chaired by Dr. Mary Rogan who is head of law at the Dublin Institute of Technology and who was a member of the review group.  In November 2015, the group presented its first progress report to the Minister and she is considering it at present.  The intention is the group will again revert to the Minister in or around May 2016 and in light of this work on the broader framework of sentencing and offender management, the Minister believes it would not be timely to amend the Bill as proposed by Deputy Niall Collins in amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  The implementation oversight group should be allowed to continue its work, particularly on preparing proposals and options for the Government on reform of sentencing policy and minimum sentences.</p><p> It is clear, however, that lengthy custodial sentences can be applied by the Judiciary in appropriate cases.  The 2001 Act allows for sentences of up to 14 years for burglary and life for aggravated burglary.  Repeat offending is a factor that is viewed as aggravating and the Bill will ensure that where a court decides to impose a custodial sentence, it will be consecutive to any other custodial sentence imposed for domestic burglary committed within a 12-month time window.</p></speech>

Section 27 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 already provides for ancillary disqualification orders to be made where a person is convicted of an offence in the commission of which a mechanically-propelled vehicle is used.  As the Deputy will appreciate, road traffic legislation contains its own technicalities and I am advised by officials that the appropriate place for any amendments to disqualification orders is through the Road Traffic Acts.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 4.  However, I understand the road traffic (amendment) Bill will be before the Houses shortly and this may present an opportunity to tablet amendments such as this to it.</p></speech>

Prosecution on indictment before the Circuit Court would allow for a maximum sentence of 14 years for any one offence of burglary and up to life imprisonment for any one offence of aggravated burglary.  There is, in theory, no limit to the aggregate consecutive sentence which the Circuit Court could impose and while the courts have set no definitive limit to the aggregate maximum sentence the District Court can impose by way of consecutive sentence, to date the standard approach taken in legislation is not to exceed two years.  Article 38.2 of the Constitution provides that &quot;Minor offences may be tried by courts of summary jurisdiction.&quot;  In the case of Meagher <i>v</i>. O'Leary, the courts upheld the provisions of section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951, which allow for the District Court to apply consecutive sentences up to an aggregate of two years' imprisonment.  Mr. Justice Moriarty acknowledged that had the District Court been statutorily permitted to impose &quot;an indeterminate succession of consecutive sentences, it could give rise to an aggregate sentence of six years imprisonment, which would exceed the maximum allowable for many serious offences following trial on indictment, and could on no rational basis be viewed as an exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to Article 38.2&quot; of the Constitution.  Unfortunately, the Deputy's proposed amendments would clearly contravene the constitutional principles underpinning Article 38.2 of the Constitution - as explained in the judgment I have read out - and, therefore, the Government cannot accept either amendment No. 5 or amendment No. 6.</p></speech>

I am grateful to the committee for making time available today to consider my request for a Supplementary Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and prisons Votes.  The Supplementary Estimate requirement in respect of the Garda Vote is &euro;35.2 million and &euro;6.297 million in respect of the prisons Vote.  The additional requirements will be offset in part by surrender balances of some &euro;8 million in respect of the other Votes in the Justice group.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate requirement in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote is mainly due to additional payroll costs of approximately &euro;33.8 million.  The costs in question arise for a number of reasons and include the payment of allowances and overtime for the final roster period ending in December prior to year end.  In previous years this would have been paid on the first pay days of the new financial year.  The earlier roster end date facilitates the making of the payment within the financial year in which the duty is performed.  In addition, the Supplementary Estimate also provides for other payroll costs, including overtime, which arose during the course of the year.</p> <p>  The additional requirement includes the costs related to anti-crime and anti-burglary measures, including the recently announced Operation Thor which builds on a dedicated Garda operation and has five elements to it.  Measures being taken include the provision of extra high visibility patrols in identified burglary hot spots, increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs which use the national road network, the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed regional response units as they come on stream, efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market, programmes to help reduce reoffending by prolific criminals; a high profile national crime prevention awareness campaign and the provision of targeted crime prevention advice for local communities.</p> <p>  A central aspect of the Supplementary Estimate is the utilisation of an underspend in 2015 in one area of the Vote to meet other capital requirements.  This includes further investment in the Garda transport fleet and ICT investment.  The total provision in the capital building subhead in 2015 is &euro;42 million.  Work has commenced on the construction of the three new Garda divisional headquarters in Galway, Kevin Street in Dublin and Wexford and it is projected by the Office of Public Works that approximately &euro;10 million will be spent in the current year.  An unspent amount of more than &euro;6.6 million will be carried over in line with the relevant capital provisions to increase the 2016 budget to meet expenditure on these ongoing projects.  Expenditure will be required to continue them next year and there is substantial provision in this regard.</p> <p>  That leaves a balance of more than &euro;25 million which is being used to fund other capital requirements in 2015, including &euro;17 million for ICT, &euro;6 million for Garda transport and &euro;1.8 million for upgrading the Garda surveillance aircraft.  The additional allocation of &euro;6 million for Garda transport means that we will have invested more than &euro;34 million in new vehicles since 2012.  In addition, a further &euro;48 million is committed for investment in the Garda fleet under the Government's capital programme.  These provisions mean vehicles can be routinely replaced as they reach the end of their normal lifespan.</p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been able to accelerate certain elements of its ICT management programme.  Yesterday I announced that additional capital funding of &euro;4 million would be provided in 2016 for the Garda Vote to allow Ireland to participate in the Schengen information system, SIS II, a centralised secure database used by European countries for maintaining information and alerts related to border security and law enforcement.  It is important that we align ourselves with this important source of live data.  The United Kingdom, for instance, has been using it since last April.  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already makes full use of the range of available information-sharing methods, including via its close links with Interpol and Europol, the SIS will provide an even more efficient way of sharing information in this important area.  The expenditure we are seeking for this purpose complements An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's new reform programme.</p> <p>  Turning to the prisons Vote, the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.297 million in this area mainly arises from additional payroll costs of &euro;5 million and &euro;1 million in respect of the capital building programme.  The additional costs present because the number of serving prison staff is higher than the target number under the employment control framework, ECF, on which the original provision was based.  They also include the payment of arrears relating to the reinstatement of a payroll allowance following the outcome of an arbitration hearing.  The provision of an additional &euro;6.4 million under the prisons Vote in 2016 will address any remaining shortfall in payroll costs and allow for the filling of a number of key posts.</p> <p>  There are several positive developments to report in regard to the refurbishment of the prisons stock.  As members will be familiar with the ongoing work being done at Mountjoy Prison, I will not go into the details.  It is planned to demolish part of Limerick Prison.  The replacement of this cell space will involve a significant redevelopment project, to include a 150-cell accommodation block for male prisoners and a stand-alone female accommodation block for 58 prisoners.  The additional capital expenditure requirement in the Supplementary Estimate arises, for the most part, from the requirement to carry out preliminary works on the Limerick Prison development project at an earlier date than originally planned.</p> <p>  I will comment briefly on the review of performance measures that has been ongoing in recent months.  I reviewed the information included in the mid-term review which was submitted to the committee in July and the output of some of the subsequent engagement at official level.  Several points struck me arising from this process.  First, while I fully appreciate the objective of the exercise, undertaking a meaningful review of three years worth of data in a relatively short period was an ambitious exercise, to say the least.  In the case of the Justice group, across all Votes, there was a total of 180 performance measures and key outputs.  It is worthwhile to take a close look at the value of the performance-related measures published to date.  I am aware that the OECD is in the process of completing a review of budget oversight by parliament.</p><p>We will have an interesting discussion when that is published.  It is a complex task to develop the right balance of meaningful performance outputs, quantitative and qualitative.  We do not want undue complexity or for it to be administratively burdensome, but we want a system that works and produces benefits and where the information is strong.  There is room for improvement.  We can all work together on this.  It should facilitate our work as policy makers and the oversight role of Oireachtas Members and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as the Department with responsibility for the Estimates and the Votes.  I recommend these supplementary estimates for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and propose them to the committee.  I am happy to answer questions on them.</p></speech>

There were times in the past when the kind of supervision that is essential was not what it should have been.  Now we are hearing about people further up the line who did not have that kind of experience.  That is extremely important.  The cost increases up the line in terms of increments.  It increases very substantially once they move from training to being members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

There is some physical work being done at Templemore and facilities are used outside Templemore, which works well and is not a problem.  It is probably good for the local economy and works to the satisfaction of Templemore.  We have decided on 600 and restarted the investment.  The number of retirements varies considerably in any one year.  It is hard to predict it.  We are training and recruiting and building up the workforce, and we intend to continue doing that.</p></speech>

In view of the fact that the Garda can only recruit to the maximum capacity of Templemore, which is 600 per annum - I acknowledge the Minister's remark that it is impossible to predict how many garda&iacute; may retire in any year - would she consider offering short extensions of service to garda&iacute;, given the significant problems in places such as County Louth, where a garda was murdered recently and where in two years we have lost two garda&iacute;?  Would that be a way of having greater numbers of garda&iacute;, if they were to agree voluntarily to an extension for a year or two years as an exceptional measure?</p></speech>

The Deputy&rsquo;s point raises issues across the public sector.  There was a challenge in court, as the Deputy may remember.  The Government&rsquo;s policy approach has been that there is a need for this ongoing recruitment and refreshment of the garda&iacute;, the lifeblood of the organisation.  The Garda is very pleased to have new recruits now.  Every division in the country has got new garda&iacute;.  The total figure will be 1,150.  The primary focus is to keep that going.  We have taken the approach that we need to invest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enable it to have mobile policing and the vehicles it needs.  Also, information and communication technology, ICT, is critical in terms of efficiencies.</p></speech>

This issue has come up and parliamentary questions have been tabled on it.  Obviously, I have discussed it with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, because it has arisen in the case of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other professions.  Many years ago there was an allowance, but it was removed.  The cost of reinstating it across the public sector would be very substantial.  It, obviously, could not be done for any one professional group as it would have implications for all others.  As soon as garda&iacute; come out of the training college and begin to work and do overtime, the payment does increase substantially.  I know that people still have concerns about the level of pay.  Clearly, with improved economic stability which I hope will continue, the payments agreed under the Lansdowne Road agreement and the tax changes from 1 January will begin to be felt.</p></speech>

The computer crime unit is essential because the dark net, an issue I have raised with the Minister previously, poses a real threat to our security.  Persons can avail of anonymity to view images of children being abused and so on, which is repugnant to everyone in society.

It was a priority project in terms of reform, one in which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, had a particular interest.  He felt it would be to the advantage of the ICT section in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if we put together such a group to analyse the needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and come up with a plan.  The capital budget we have allocated is based on that plan, to which there are different elements.  As the Deputy rightly states, it follows the recommendations made in the Garda Inspectorate's report.  Rosters are still done with pen and pencil.  There are significant ICT needs in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one of the major ones identified by the Garda Inspectorate being that the PULSE system not just be able to record crime but also deal with information on the investigation of crimes in an ongoing way.  That is what we are prioritising for the rest of the year.  What An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has done - it has put significant time and effort into this - is develop an ICT plan and obtain tenders.  When we had the money available, it was able to state it had a number of projects which it could fast track before the end of year and begin to put in place.  The money is being utilised to support and develop the PULSE system and to provide new systems such as e-vetting which is capable of processing up to 500,000 applications annually.  A figure of &euro;7 million in additional expenditure is accounted for by the three new phases of what is called the major investigation management system, to which I have referred.  That means that all across the country the Garda will be able to state what exactly is happening in the investigation of a crime and that other members of the force will have access to the information.  Obviously, this will make for much greater efficiency.  The cost of the three new phases will be &euro;5.9 million, while the cost of the additional hardware will be &euro;1.1 million.  The total is reflected in the Supplementary Estimate.  There is also the larger plan to meet ICT needs, the total cost of which over the lifetime of the capital expenditure plan will be &euro;330 million.  There is a significant amount of work to be done on it.  It will aid decisions on where gardai should be based and the investigation of crime, as well as create greater efficiencies within the Garda family.</p></speech>

There is basic integration between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service, but the issue of IT systems in public bodies is ongoing; it is one on which there is a constant requirement for development and integration.

A very strong initiative is being taken to ensure data can be exchanged between the Courts Service and the driver licensing system, but it will take a period of time to complete it.  I know that the original estimate was three years, but that figure has been brought down substantially.  Both the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and I are members of a joint committee with representatives of the Road Safety Authority and others which is looking at this issue which we are very keen to progress.  There is also a criminal justice interoperability project as part of which the integration of District Court offences between the Garda and the Courts Service is being looked at, but no one system will deal with all of the issues.

They are offset by savings.  Does anybody want to come in on that?  There are no questions or comments on transport.  Is this based on a scheduled replacement of the fleet?  Is there an ongoing plan?</p></speech>

It was an eye-opener.  Is the Minister satisfied that there are enough helicopters to back up An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly when one thinks about Operation Thor and targeting criminal gangs that are using the motorways to access rural communities in the Dublin commuter belt area.  I imagine the deployment of these helicopters is an essential weapon for the Garda&iacute; to target these gangs and bring them to justice.  I know members of the committee were impressed with the professionalism of the corps and the team there, but we want to ensure they have everything they need in terms of helicopters.  Is the Minister satisfied that what she has allocated is going to address that and maximise the potential?</p></speech>

The &euro;1.8 million was for the upgrade of police equipment on the Defender aircraft.  The equipment that was there was obsolete and no longer supported by the manufacturer, so it was essential to replace it.  I must check, but I think it was also so that it could be used at night.  Yes, it can be used at night as well and it has the machinery and infrastructure it needs to operate at night, which it did not for some time.  The equipment includes a video distribution system, including monitors and recorders; a downlink-uplink system; a moving map system; a mapping overlay system for the video feed to the monitors and a daylight and shortwave infrared thermal imaging camera system.  This effectively means that aircraft is now up to date and able to do its work.  There is always a need to examine whether there could be further use as society develops and there is more movement.  We have already heard about criminals using motorways and so on.  It is very good to have this aircraft.  There are two helicopters in total, I understand.  The fleet available to the Garda is two helicopters and the Defender aircraft.</p></speech>

It was a couple of years ago, in fairness.  I know it is an operational matter, but is the Minister satisfied that what she has just outlined to us is what is required?  Has the Garda requested additional equipment, or is that a plan for the following year?  Is it being rolled out over a couple of years?  Is she satisfied this is what the Garda needs right now?</p></speech>

I have no doubt that it will be kept under review.  I would go back to the point that we are now at a stage in the Department of Justice where we have been able to allocate extra funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; there have been extra allocations this year for next year and last year.  That is a new situation and we are coming out of a difficult economic situation.  These issues will be kept under review and it is very important that the Garda has the type of equipment and resources it needs to do the job efficiently.  I have no doubt that this is an issue that will be kept under review and as the economic situation improves, it may well be reviewed, but it will be up to the Garda Commissioner to do that.  I am very pleased at this point that we are able to invest in making sure that this aircraft works efficiently and has the most up-to-date equipment needed to do the job 24 hours a day.</p></speech>

In view of the exceptional need at this moment and the inability of the Garda to train more than 600 recruits at a time because of the physical limitation on the buildings at Templemore, would it not make sense, as an exceptional measure, to see if more people would continue to work?  That is my point in a nutshell.  Are there facilities to train garda&iacute; somewhere other than Templemore?  When Templemore is full, would it make sense to have a second location, such as a military barracks or somewhere that would be appropriately kitted out for people like that?</p></speech>

It was mentioned that in other countries people are not asked for their age and they do not have to retire if they do not want to - they can carry on working.  It was an interesting Bill, which got unanimous support, and we had some very powerful presentations.  In light of Deputy O'Dowd's comment, it is very timely to bring that forward.</p></speech>

There would have to be detailed negotiations on the points that have been raised.  People have very different views on it.  I accept what Deputy O'Dowd said about the very tragic situation regarding Garda Tony Golden in his area, the appalling situation that he faced and that his family is now facing.</p> <p>  I do not believe we should be considering any other place for training other than Templemore.  Templemore is the centre of excellence.  We can examine flexibility in relation to numbers but the Government has made a decision now.  We started off with groups of 500 and have now moved that to 600.  We have committed to ongoing continuous recruitment.  There are other measures that could be taken, such as replacing some garda&iacute; with civilian staff so that garda&iacute; can operate on the front line, rather than carrying out administrative duties.  Some improvements can still be made in respect of that.</p> <p>  The kind of investment we are making is the way to deal with the issues Deputy O'Dowd is speaking about.  At the recent talks about the North, for example, it was decided that a further cross-Border task force should be established to enhance the work between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will be meeting with the UK Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, and the Northern Ireland justice Minister, David Ford, who rang me today to congratulate the Garda on the work it has been doing recently.  That is the way to deal with the complex issues that are being faced in the area Deputy O'Dowd speaks about in particular.</p></speech>

Garda management will continue to keep the allocation of resources in County Louth under continuous review in the context of additional garda&iacute; becoming available for assignment as a result of Garda recruitment.  They will also be taking account of crime trends, the demographics and policing priorities, as they always do.

Allow me to explain to the Chairman why it has, and I will put it into context.  I understand that prison staff are on duty to receive incoming prisoners who are convicted by the courts or who are brought for incarceration for whatever reason.  The problem is that thousands of these prisoners are people who have not paid fines, are brought to prisons and are processed in the prisons.  They are brought in and released the same day or the day after.  This is a huge waste of resources  and it has been happening for years.  The Minister has introduced legislation to change that situation and I ask her to update the committee on this.  The figure runs into tens of thousands of euro and it has a significant impact on the number of staff within the prison.  They have to be on duty, yet the prisoner is let out at the end of the day.</p></speech>

The courts have been setting up an IT system to manage it effectively and it is taking a few months to do that but they will be ready to start in early January 2016.   Once we have that legislation enacted it will make a substantial difference to the situation outlined whereby people are being brought to prison.</p></speech>

I will give Mountjoy Prison as an example.  The investment in Mountjoy Prison has enabled the elimination of the slopping out practice there and allowed significant reductions in overcrowding, as have capital programmes of investment in Cork Prison and Limerick Prison.  Preliminary works have started in Limerick Prison which involved a boundary wall to facilitate the courts PPP development there, and then the development of the prison, which has started earlier than anticipated.</p> <p>  The practice of slopping out will be completely eliminated when the work that needs to be done in Portlaoise Prison is finalised.  That is some time ahead but there is a continuous programme of investment in the prisons, as members can see from the capital outflow into that area.  Portlaoise Prison will be included when the money becomes available and that will mean the practice of slopping out will have ended.</p></speech>

Subheads A6 and A8.  We will stick with subhead A2, administration, non-pay, corporate services or administration costs in the prisons.  Are there any comments or questions on A2?  As there are no questions I move on to subhead A4, prisoner services.  It includes cost efficiencies relating to the usage and supply of items such as cleaning materials, catering supplies and other large expenditure items.  The reduction in prisoner numbers has also contributed to cost savings in this subhead.  The saving in this subhead is &euro;2.3 million.</p></speech>

Prisons contain some of the most disadvantaged in society in terms of educational attainment.  In many cases those with serious learning difficulties need as much educational service as they can get to improve their capacity to function on leaving prison, particularly in respect of issues around literacy and health.</p></speech>

We are very conscious, as is the Prison Service of the absolute importance of work and training opportunities and education.  There is a strong emphasis on that.  Education services are available in all the institutions and are provided in partnership with the ETBs so that the standards are good.  They broadly follow an adult education approach.  There are more than 120 workshops and service activities across the prison estate.</p></speech>

Given the reduction in prisoner numbers it is likely, following the Minister's previous remarks, that the saving is based on that.  With regard to diversionary programmes and or policing of the availability of illegal drugs, as opposed to any methadone treatment, within the Prison Service are there any programmes the Minister would like to highlight?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015120200002#T03200"><p>The issue the Deputy has raised of making sure that contraband does not get into prisons is one of high priority.  We have to make continuous improvements in this area.  It is an international problem.  People are often surprised that it is an issue but it is one that is shared internationally.  A number of initiatives have been taken.  The Deputy has probably heard Michael Donlon, the director of the Prison Service, speak recently about some new initiatives he has put in place.  For example, the introduction of the new free confidential telephone line has been good as prisoners, visitors, staff or members can be intimidated.  Visitors can be intimidated into bringing in drugs.  We are hoping, and it has begun to happen, that members of the public with information on the trafficking of prohibited items will make that known.</p> <p>  There is an increasing number of passive and active dogs which are operational in all prisons.  There are five active dog teams in operation.  That initiative has been strengthened in recent times.  There are also initiatives around the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, enhanced CCTV monitoring, stricter control of visits and the use of target and random cell searches so there is a lot of work to be done.  There has also been the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines which has helped efforts to tackle the problem.  Random searches of cells and their occupants unfortunately still uncover significant quantities of contraband.  The Prison Service recognises that it is an area where constant improvements are required.</p></speech>

One could see the netting which had been installed there.  I appreciate it is required because of the daily onslaught of attempts to bring contraband into our prisons.  I am sure it is an extremely difficult job for prisoner officers to deal with.  I read in a national publication recently about an individual who had been off drugs for a couple of years and had been in prison for a relatively minor offence and ended up being addicted to certain illicit materials.  As it was anecdotal I do not expect the Minister to respond but, obviously, any work that can be done to reduce that would be welcome.</p></speech>

One of the major issues at present, which we debated last night and will do so again tonight, is homelessness.  A number of prisoners who leave prison may not have any place to stay or to live.  We are aware of organisations such as Care After Prison, the Churchfield Community Trust in Cork and others around the country, who support prisoners.  I am aware the Prison Service supports those organisations.  Under the social disadvantage measures, can the Minister say anything about that issue, that is, prisoners coming out of prison who may be at risk of homelessness because they have nowhere to go and possibly no family connections and may end up on the street and back on the street again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015120200002#U00100"><p>The Chairman is absolutely correct.  If one wants to look at the rehabilitation of offenders, one of the things one has to do is to plan his or exit and ensure the supports are in place when a prisoner is released.  The initiative that was launched earlier this week was the Joint Agency Response to Crime, JARC, which brings the Probation Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na together.  That is really important.  One of the issues they want to address for prolific offenders who have served their sentences is to deal with the range of social issues that need to be place if there is any chance of rehabilitation on their release.  Housing is clearly part of the solution.  There are some good hostels available, voluntary housing and groups that are working and giving a significant number of voluntary hours to help in the rehabilitation of prisoners.  Given the current challenges, it is not an easy issue to address but the Probation Service, in particular, co-ordinates the other service to try to ensure he or she is reintegrated into society.  There is more pre-release planning than ever before.  Everybody, including the Prison Service, recognises that recidivism and people returning to prison is not the answer.</p></speech>

Let me highlight the good work that is being done by Care after Prison projects.  The Churchfield Community Trust in Waterford won an award recently and there are other projects around the country.  With a small amount of finance they can do a very significant amount of work.  The work they are doing is really impressive.</p> <p>  The net Supplementary Estimate is &euro;6.297 million.</p></speech>

Our committee has received a total of 153 petitions to date since the launch of this petitions system.  The secretariat has been examining them to establish admissibility of the petitions and how best to progress them.  Of the 153, 137 petitions have been brought before the committee on at least one occasion.  Of these, 77 were considered, agreed upon and closed, 44 were deemed inadmissible, and 36 are awaiting decision or still under consideration.</p> <p>  There are five petitions before us today.  The first is petition No. P00026/14, which relates to civil rights for civil servants, from Mr. Tom Geraghty.  We have deliberated on this and we have agreed to correspond with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, seeking clarification on whether he believes legislation might be required with regard to the response received from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and with reference to Article 16.1.1&deg; of the Constitution.  We will correspond with the Minister on that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

We will correspond with the Minister, seeking clarification on whether legislation is required.</p> <p>  The next is petition No. P00006/15, that Ireland should join the Antarctic Treaty, from Ms Rose Waldron.  We have agreed to refer this petition to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade for examination, report back and write to the petitioner, advising of the committee decision.  We have agreed to correspond with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department to ask why there would be significant administrative costs associated with Ireland's accession.  Notwithstanding this position, the committee has requested that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade reopen the interdepartmental discussions of 2009 to 2011 and explore further options associated with joining the Antarctic Treaty, such as non-consultative membership.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition is No. P00017/15, a citizenship matter from Mr. Jacob Owowdunni.  Unfortunately, as it a personal matter, it must be deemed inadmissible, as we have no room in Standing Orders to address anything of a personal nature.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00024/15, which argues that Ireland should join the EU Schengen area, is from Mr. Daniel Haden.  After deliberating on this petition, we have agreed to write to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister to ask that they outline, particularly in the context of the debate surrounding a possible British exit from the EU, the reasons Ireland did not sign up to the Schengen area in the first place.  Given the developments in the UK relating to the referendum, we will ask if the Department has any intention of revisiting the decision not to sign up to the agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00019/15 deals with an amendment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 from Mr. Christopher Galligan.  We corresponded with the Department of Justice and Equality, raising the request that the Act be amended.  The Department has responded and our committee considers the response to be reasonable.  We will send the response to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

As members will know, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is an independent statutory body established in 1993 under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, with a wide range of responsibilities, including regulation of large-scale industrial and waste facilities, monitoring and reporting on the state of the environment, overseeing local authorities' environmental responsibilities, co-ordinating environmental research in Ireland and radiological protection.  The main role which the EPA would potentially have in regard to unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects would be its regulatory role though integrated pollution control licensing, whereby a licence would be required for onshore extraction of shale gas on a commercial scale.</p><p>The EPA does not have a regulatory role at the exploration stage of these projects but is a statutory consultee with respect to any environmental impact assessment conducted by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in assessing any applications received for exploration licences.  The agency on behalf of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency commissioned research into the environmental impacts of unconventional gas exploration and extraction, in particular hydraulic fracturing in shale gas.<br/><br/>The research programme is composed of five projects and will involve field studies, including baseline monitoring of water and seismicity as well as an extensive desk-based literature review of unconventional gas exploration and extraction practices worldwide.  No fracking will be undertaken as part of the research programme.  The five main elements include assessing impacts on surface waters, groundwaters and related ecosystems; impacts on seismic activity; impacts on air quality; international operational practice and impact mitigation measures; and regulatory regimes for fracking in different countries.<br/><br/>I will respond to the observations listed in the correspondence from this committee to the EPA dated 4 November 2015.  The first question related to the independence of the study.  The unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme contract was awarded following a robust evaluation process in full compliance with procurement guidelines.  The contract award procedure chosen for this competition was by open procedure.  Six tenders were received.  The evaluation panel included personnel with the capacity to make informed decisions on the tenders received.  I have given details about the evaluation panel in a previous appearance before the committee.  The constitution of the evaluation panel was approved by the joint research programme steering committee.  The evaluation panel found that the tender led by CDM Smith Ireland provided the best response and a contract was awarded to the consortium led by CDM Smith Ireland Limited in August 2014.  This consortium includes commercial consultancies, academics, a geological research institution and a legal firm, each offering a particular specialism required by the project scope, as was detailed in the terms of reference.  It is stated as, &quot;The proposed project team is expected to include members who have comprehensive understanding of geology and hydrology as well as an in depth knowledge of a range of legal, environmental, health, socioeconomic and technical issues, as well as knowledge of mineral and fossil fuels (preferably unconventional gas) extraction practices and technologies.&quot;<br/><br/>The second question regarded the role of Queen's University.  The role of staff from Queen's University, Belfast, QUB, was to contribute to the joint research programme Project A1, which related to groundwater, surface water and associated ecosystems.  Specifically, the three researchers in the QUB groundwater group were proposed to work on a number of Project A1 tasks, leading tasks 2 and 7 and supporting other tasks.  Additionally, a full-time academic was nominated as part of the consortium's internal technical review team, with an internal review process carried out by the consortium before submission to the steering committee for Project A1.  On appointment, QUB informed CDM Smith Ireland Limited that the three researchers would not be able to fulfil their agreed responsibilities on Project A1.  Following discussion with and agreement by the unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme steering committee in November 2014, they were replaced internally with British Geological Survey and CDM Smith Ireland staff taking on additional tasks.  However, QUB did not withdraw the permanent academic from the consortium's internal technical review team of Project A1.  The full-time academic from QUB has since undertaken his review role in full on Project A1, as proposed in the tender, and our understanding is that this was done with the knowledge of the university and not in any independent capacity.  The primary contributors to the overall research project in terms of staff resources are CDM Smith Ireland Limited and the British Geological Survey.<br/><br/>The third question was research into health impacts.  The key research questions included in the revised terms of reference - I have circulated a reference to members - and they are:</p><blockquote>Can unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects/operations be carried out in the island of Ireland whilst also protecting the environment and human health?<br /><br />What is &quot;best environmental practice&quot; in relation to unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects/operations?</blockquote><p>The EPA launched a public consultation on the draft terms of reference in January 2013, which closed in March 2013, with 1,356 submissions received.  The EPA and the unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme steering committee reviewed the submissions and the draft terms of reference were amended and strengthened after the public consultation.<br/><br/>Section 4 was added to the revised terms of reference to clarify and clearly define the scope of the proposed research with regard to human health.  The wording &quot;human/public health&quot; throughout this tender document refers specifically and is limited to potential health impacts deriving from impacts on environmental media, such as exposure to chemicals, vibration, light and noise, and pollution of environmental media, such as soils, air and water.  In addition, the wording &quot;protecting human health&quot; refers and is limited to preventing environmental factors from degrading human health.<br/><br/>The unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme will not incorporate a health impact assessment as this was not part of the terms of reference signed off by the steering committee.  However, there is a requirement in the terms of reference to specifically consider the potential role of health impact assessment in the regulation of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects, based on the experience in other countries and to make recommendations towards developing a protocol in the island of Ireland context.  The deliverables relating to task 3, the potential role of health impact assessment in regulation of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects,<font color="#0082BF"></font>will include<b><font color="#0082BF"></font></b>a consideration of the approaches of other countries regarding health impact assessment to include but not limited to scope, process, timing, how it is used in the planning and permitting process, who carries out and evaluates the assessment, as well as recommendations for a protocol for Ireland regarding the potential role for health impact assessment in the regulation of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects.  The output of this task will form part of final report five.<br/><br/>I have circulated some examples of some specific references to &quot;human health&quot; in the terms of reference.  I will not read all of them out but the first is:</p><blockquote>Projects A1, A2, A3: Baseline Characterisation <br /><br />Geology is the science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which it evolves.  Hydrogeology is the area of geology that deals with the distribution and movement of groundwater in the soil and rocks of the Earth's crust (commonly in aquifers).  A comprehensive understanding of both these topics is a basic requirement in order to make an informed decision in relation to the potential impacts on the environment and human health which unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects/operations may present.</blockquote><p>There are a number of other references in the tender that are similar.<br/><br/>The fourth question was on the availability and use of research outputs.  The next phase of the research project includes baseline monitoring of seismic and water resources to be completed by a supplementary tender as provided for in the framework contract for the research.  The primary purpose of this aspect of the research is to provide a greater understanding of the quality of the water resources and flow regimes and to determine the baseline seismic activity in the study areas.  The programme is intended to assist regulators, both North and South, in making informed decisions about unconventional gas exploration and extraction activities and operations.  The data obtained during the course of the current research will provide valuable information on the local and regional environment to a variety of stakeholders both North and South.  That includes Departments, State agencies, academics, people in the industry and the public.</p><p>The intention is that all the final and summary reports, as well as the datasets, will be made publicly available on an online EPA research data archive once the project is complete.  In terms of the timeframe, the next phase, the supplementary tender, can only be started once the interim reports for projects A1 and A2, which include tasks relating to the specifications for the baseline monitoring network, have been finalised.  It should be noted that the EPA wrote to the funders about confirming the securing of funding for the next phase, and is currently awaiting responses.</p><p> The last question from this committee was the intended purpose of the research.  The EPA&rsquo;s position with regard to activities using hydraulic fracturing is in no way predetermined.  The EPA is an independent body which makes decisions based on scientific evidence, and it is envisaged that this research will assist with providing such evidence on the risks and environmental impacts of this emerging technology. </p><p> As an environmental regulator, the EPA makes decisions on applications for licences and permits for many categories of activity.  The primary decision the EPA must make is whether to grant or refuse a licence, and under the EPA Acts the agency is statutorily barred from granting a licence to an activity which would cause significant environmental pollution.  The definition of &ldquo;environmental pollution&rdquo; in section 4(2) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act includes &ldquo;the direct or indirect introduction to an environmental medium, as a result of human activity, of substances, heat or noise which may be harmful to human health or the quality of the environment."</p><p> This research programme has been designed to produce the scientific basis to assist assessment of the environmental impacts associated with high-volume hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in Ireland.  The programme of research is intended to assist regulators both North and South in making informed decisions about fracking.  Ministers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland have publicly stated that the issuance of fracking licences will be dependent on the outcomes of a thorough, independent investigation of potential impacts on the Irish environment.  The unconventional gas exploration and extraction joint research programme will not replace, or diminish the need for, any of the statutory processes necessary to seek permission for a fracking licence or development.</p><p> In summary, research reports are intended as contributions to the necessary debate on the protection of the environment.  The key questions this research needs to answer are whether this technology can be used while also fully protecting the environment and human health, and, if so, what is best environmental practice in using the technology.  The question of whether the existing EU environmental regulatory framework is adequate for unconventional fossil fuel projects is also being addressed. </p><p> This research project will examine the potential health impacts deriving from impacts on environmental media, such as exposure to chemicals, vibration, light and noise, and pollution of soils, air and water.  The project will also examine the mitigation of environmental impacts that have the potential to degrade human health.  The research team will review health impact studies worldwide to explore the potential role of health impact assessment in the regulation of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects or operations based on the experience in other countries, and recommendations will be made towards developing a protocol in the context of the island of Ireland.</p><p> In conclusion, this joint research programme aims to inform policy makers and other stakeholders on a range of questions in relation to environmental protection.  We will get a series of reports that will help regulators North and South in coming to an informed decision if and when a licensing application is received for unconventional gas exploration and extraction in the coming years.  I hope I have provided the committee with a satisfactory response to the five points of the invitation letter, and I am happy to answer any questions the committee members may have for me.</p></speech>

This is not their first time and I do not think it will be their last.  I want to acknowledge the outstanding work done by groups opposed to fracking in my part of the country, with particular reference to Dr. Aideen McLoughlin, who has provided valuable assistance to those of us who need to be updated on the technical aspects of what is a very complicated process.  There are quite a lot of questions.  I know Deputy Colreavy will be putting some questions to the witnesses in the context of the information that has been provided to us.  There are quite a lot of questions, so I will try to condense it as best I can.</p> <p>  Not only I but also my friends and neighbours in County Leitrim, who will be severely and immediately impacted by any decision to introduce hydraulic fracturing into my part of the country, are totally opposed to it.  I will continue to be opposed to it.  It is not in the best interests of the community in which I live and it will have a devastating impact on our largest economic contributor - that is, tourism - apart from the farming impacts on the ecosystem.</p> <p>  How can the EPA possibly justify having a survey where the main consultant is a company that is avowedly pro-fracking?  Any investigation or research into its activities worldwide could not but come to that conclusion.  How can it be independent if it is a pro-fracking company, which has assisted in the development of hydraulic fracturing as a process and continues to do so, particularly in Poland?  How has this company ended up not only being one of a consortium of parties, as has been outlined, but also taking a leading role over the last 12 months?  If one looks down the list published on the EPA website of who is undertaking particular tasks and projects, if it is not CDM Smith, it is AMEC, another pro-fracking company.  That is the context of the question.  At the end of this process, who is going to evaluate?  Who is going to be the independent arbiter of the report once it is published?  What will happen the report when it is published?  Will a review or evaluation of the report be carried out either by the lead Department or by either of the other two Departments mentioned here?  This survey, as it is currently being operated, is so deeply flawed in the minds of those who are watching and monitoring the development of the process of hydraulic fracturing in Ireland, to the point at which I do not believe they will accept the conclusions of this report, simply because CDM Smith is directly involved.</p> <p>  The witnesses have gone some way towards addressing the issue of health.  One of the key questions raised by those opposed to fracking is how the operation can be carried out on the island of Ireland while also protecting the environment and human health.  It was implied that a review of the impact of fracking on human health is included in the study.  Maybe the witnesses could clarify and confirm that.  I know they have made reference to human health issues, but which task will include such a review of health, who will be carrying it out and what medical expertise does this contractor have in the context of human health?</p> <p>  Irrespective of the issues surrounding the process of hydraulic fracturing, one of the major concerns people have - and which I have, thinking of my family in Leitrim - is the impact on health.  Chemicals will be injected into a natural environment.  Chemicals have consequences.  They can, and will, in my opinion, interfere with watercourses.  They will create pollution.  It is perfectly obvious that the wastewater that is pulled out of hydraulic fracturing worldwide is not useable.  It is contaminated.  It raises other questions I will not go into now about what happens the millions of gallons of water used.  Where is it going to come from, and what is going to happen to it?</p> <p>  The definition of human health in the terms of reference is very narrow and does not consider impacts on human health caused by a number of key items.  I will not go into great detail on these, but they include radioactive releases from underground in the context of the chemicals, threats from fracking infrastructure and traffic accidents, and the risk of birth defects and fertility issues.</p><p>A range of issues can have an adverse impact on human health.  The conclusion is drawn that even if a review of the health impacts of fracking was carried out in accordance with the terms of reference it would be incomplete.  Does the EPA have an opinion on this?</p><p> My next question is on an issue which has been raised by Friends of the Earth in the very topical context of the climate change conference in Paris.  Its view is that the research does not fully address damage to the environment if it does not address greenhouse gas emissions, but this is not an issue that has been raised so far in the report's terms of reference or in the tasks being carried out.  I suggest that as the terms of reference do not require an appropriate assessment of the impact on climate change, if the Government decides to allow fracking based on this research, the decision will not be based on full information.  I agree with Friends of the Earth's conclusions that we should ensure that any research that would influence future national policy takes into consideration climate change impacts.  It is an important issue and perhaps the witnesses have a view on it.</p><p> Friends of the Earth raises another question which needs to be put to the EPA.  The report does not ask fundamental questions on whether Ireland should extract fracking gas; rather, it is concerned with how to frack.  In other words, the entire process screams with the view that the survey, which is led by a pro-fracking company, will conclude it is justifiable to introduce hydraulic fracturing in this country so long as the regulations are complied with and the EPA is happy that everything is regulated and complied with.  However, international evidence has indicated that compliance has not happened and does not happen, and that even in the most regulated environments, accidents have happened.  This is particularly the case when dealing with unstable chemicals.  In the environment about which we are speaking, which is in my part of the country, there is absolutely no guarantee that there will not be accidents.  This question needs to be addressed.  Is the EPA able to tell us with any degree of certainty that the survey's conclusions are not about how to frack but about whether or not we should frack?</p><p> As the EPA has a leading role in climate change research and policy, it is important that it address these questions.  If Ireland extracts its estimated recoverable shale gas reserves, will Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions increase, stay the same or decrease?  This is one of the tests President Obama applied to the Keystone XL pipeline, which he recently rejected in the United States.  It is a valid question to put to the EPA as the regulatory body concerned about the environment.  If all countries extract their recoverable shale gas reserves, how would it affect our chances of staying within the globally agreed target of limiting global warming to less than 2&deg;C?  Mary Robinson, along with many others, cautions that to stay within 2&deg;C globally, two thirds of fossil fuels must remain in the ground.  I pay tribute to Eamon Ryan, the leader of the Green Party, who addressed a group of Deputies and Senators at a briefing organised by Dr. McLoughlin and her allies and supporters, which was very informative.  Mr. Ryan made this very point.  He believes that in light of the existing reserves worldwide there is absolutely no need to take out two thirds of the fossil fuels which are underground.  This raises the question as to why Ireland should bother with hydraulic fracturing.  Why do we need to do it?  Why should we even be having this discussion?</p></speech>

Members might remind me if I miss anything.  The first question was on the CDM.</p><p>The role of the Environmental Protection Agency is the protection of the environment and as part of that, it commissions what it believes is world class research, which is peer reviewed.  That is a core part of why it is looking at the area of fracking.  I emphasise that no fracking is going to take place as part of this research.  Ministers have said that no fracking would take place until this research is over and there is no guarantee that fracking will ever take place.</p><p> With regard to the process, the EPA's corporate governance is scrupulous in how it procures and how it delivers a process to determine the outcome of tenders or calls for research.  This is a sensitive area of research.  There was an open call for research and the agency did not preclude anyone from applying to do it.  It was a worldwide call and we only got six tenders in but this would not be uncommon for large pieces of research.</p><p> The evaluation panel includes 27 existing and retired personnel from organisations such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency, ETH Zurich, Geological Survey of Ireland, the Health Service Executive, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, University College Cork, University of Bergen in Norway and Ulster University.  The EPA relies on an esteemed technical group of people to inform it that the tender process for the evaluation committee is coming up with the right decision.  They came up with CDM but it is not CDM on its own, it is with the British Geological Survey, Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran, Ulster University and other universities.  It is not a research study that can be dominated by one individual or group.  It must go through the consortium which includes the British Geological Survey, a reputable firm of solicitors, Philip Lee, and other universities, all of whom have reputations to uphold.  The outputs of that research must go through the evaluation committee of 27 members with all of the criteria.  That is why I have absolute confidence that the outputs of the research will meet the EPA's own standard in terms of quality and peer review and that it will be second to none.  It will be as good as any research the agency has commissioned in the past 15 years.  The EPA's research budget peaked at approximately &euro;15 million per year but is now down to around &euro;5 million to &euro;6 million per year.  The agency has very good practices, processes and corporate governance in place to ensure there is no bias within the system and the research can stand up to any research conducted by any other funder in Ireland or Europe.</p><p> When it comes to the evaluation of outputs, the 27 existing and retired personnel on the panel from all those organisations have to agree.  I have confidence in those personnel to deliver the type of research required.  I agree there are documented impacts associated with fracking.  We know that because the EPA commissioned a worldwide literature review in advance of this current research programme.  The review found there is potential for groundwater contamination from methane migration, impacts from chemical additives in the fracking fluid, treatment and disposal of flowback fluid, greenhouse gas emissions and water usage.  The EPA's own research tells us that these are issues which must be dealt in any involvement the EPA might have in an application.  The agency is legally obliged to accept applications and we have a quasi-judicial role in evaluating applications.  Therefore, the evidence and science by which we make the assessment of the application must be second to none and stand on its own two feet.  The assessment must be able to withstand judicial review and as part of this work, the agency is trying to get the information that will allow us to make a rigorous assessment of any application that may come to us in the future.  The information will be equally available to the public, to other regulators both North and South and to industries, if they wish to use it, as is all the agency's environmental data.  The EPA is trying to move forward on an open data front that provides all its datasets free of charge on an EPA website and it is working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to provide open data in a format that is of use to anyone anywhere in the world, and it will continue to do this.</p><p> Climate change is a huge topic.  We have more fossil fuels under the ground than the world can take right now.  Whether these fuels are extracted is a matter for international policy, European policy and Irish policy.  These decisions will be made by the Oireachtas and the Government.  It is purely within the remit of legislators and the Government to take a high level decision that fracking must not take pace in Ireland.  Using this research, the EPA is trying to prepare the basic information that would allow the agency to fulfil a statutory role which it may be called on to fulfil in terms of basic groundwater data.  This is not the only area EPA researches.  It researches other controversial issues, such as genetically modified organisms and nano-particles and materials.

If more fossil fuels are dug from the ground and burned, whether from the sea or land, it will create greenhouse gases.  That is a fact.  The EPA has a significant role in preparing the inventories for Ireland to determine whether Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocol, which has gone, and the new targets for 2020 and 2030.  The EPA knows it is still very challenging for Ireland to meet the renewable energy targets, particularly as Ireland's development is dominated by transport and agriculture.  To add significantly more fossil fuels into that mix will make it very difficult for Ireland to meet 2030 targets or 2050 targets.  This is why the renewable energy targets and the reduction of greenhouse gases by 85% to 90% by 2050 is a challenge for Ireland.  There is a huge policy issue to be decided in terms of where Ireland gets its fuel in the future and where hydraulic fracturing, offshore gas and oil or imported gas and oil sit within that challenge.</p></speech>

If fracking was introduced into Ireland, we would not be talking about a small number of wells but about hundreds of wells in a landscape that would not be able to absorb that.  Could Mr. Lynott confirm that the cumulative effects of hundreds of wells in Leitrim, west Cavan, Fermanagh and the Lough Allen basin are being addressed in this survey?  What would be the consequences of the process?  I understand the EPA is addressing the issues relating to what goes into the ground and what comes out of it but the physical consequences would be horrendous.</p><p>I do not think anybody fully realises what fracking would mean in physical terms on the landscape.  Is the EPA aware of the consequences of that for the environment?</p></speech>

We are developing policy on biofuels and energy as a country.  There is a possibility that significant national impacts can be assessed through a strategic environmental assessment process.  It is up to the various Departments to carry out a national assessment of fracking in its totality across the island of Ireland.  On a lower level, there is an environmental impact assessment which is project based.  If any regulator or agency were to evaluate any application, it would have to go through the EIA process.</p> <p>  In terms of our research, we are looking at the impacts on health and the environment associated with the activity of fracking.  We are aware that in order for volumes of gas to be commercial, a number of wells would be required.  I am not an expert in this area; I will be reading this research as much as anyone else to find out what the issues are.  If assessment on groundwater contamination, methane migration, the impact of chemical additives on fracking fluid, treatment and disposal of flow-back fluid and greenhouse gas emissions is done for one well, it will also generate the data for 100 wells.  That will be put against what is one groundwater resource, one surface water resource and one air quality standard that we are trying to do for Ireland.  It can be ramped up and then it becomes closer to the environmental limits that would be in that area.</p></speech>

The second point is that as a large company, it takes on a full range of work.  The work it has done is to advise governments and regulators in different countries, contributing to outcomes that have both permitted fracking operations in the UK and Poland, and also caused moratoriums to be imposed in German states.  It advises on both sides, depending on the countries it is involved in and the work that it gets.  This is a very similar argument - I have full sympathy for it - as applied to some of our large legal and accountancy firms.  Owing to their size and capabilities they can be - even though they will refer to Chinese walls and all that - advising both sides of the camp.  It is no different for environmental consultancies.</p> <p>  Let me add that we specifically took the decision to seek companies that knew about fracking so that we would get the best advice, commercial or otherwise.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the same level of research has been commissioned by the sector itself.  I would need to get some figures for the Deputy but I would bet that the non-commercial sector, particular governments and regulators, are probably the biggest procurers of research in this area, principally because they are trying to fulfil their statutory roles for the protection of health and the environment over a regulatory role.</p></speech>

What level of engagement does it have with its EU counterparts or the US authorities on this?  I look at this very coldly from an outsider's point of view.  In the US, it is open season on fracking at the moment, which would not inspire confidence in a person who has legitimate concerns.  What level of engagement, if any, has the EPA had with the US EPA?</p> <p>  My understanding is that fracking is basically the injection of air and water under high pressure into the ground, which bursts the rock open and releases gas.  The geological survey map of Ireland reveals that many of the areas that would be regarded as potential fracking areas - the limestone areas of east Clare, Galway, Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal, west Cavan and across the Border - are also areas susceptible to high levels of radon, if one looks at it very coldly and without looking at it without major levels of research.  Would it be fair to say that if rock is burst open to release methane, other gaseous elements could also be potentially released?  Nature has designed that they be released over tens of thousands of years.  However, injecting water and air under high pressure to burst the rock open could release gases other than methane or other organic hydrocarbons.</p><p>It could release carcinogenic elements such as radon.  Has that been examined? </p><p> I know the study is at an early stage but if water is injected under high pressure and elevated temperatures it will cause the precipitation of a salt, maybe sodium chloride or sodium with other halogens attached and it will wind up in the aquifer.  How is it taken out of the water?  A person who bores a hole on a half acre for water might have to go down several hundred metres before hitting a good quality source of water but will have no idea of the geology gone through to get to that level.  God alone only knows what will happen if water and air are injected-----</p></speech>

My biggest concern is that vein of territory, starting on the shores of Lough Derg in east Clare up to the border between Cavan and Fermanagh, is very susceptible to high levels of naturally-occurring radon which we can deal with if it is allowed to be emitted naturally.  What is the effect when man sticks his oar in and encourages it to be released faster and over a shorter period?</p></speech>

Radon is also an issue and when it coalesces and becomes denser it is a problem.  When it is unconfined it is not such of a problem.  We are very aware of that.  The Office of Radiological Protection, ORP, is on the steering group and one of the scientists will make that evaluation.</p> <p>  Ground water is very difficult.  In our research, which predated this research, we indicated that in terms of how any of this activity could be licensed and still meet the very rigid requirements of the ground water directive, it is nearly prohibited.  We are not trying to decide whether it can be done but we definitely will have a fuller understanding of the problems that have to be overcome or maybe cannot be overcome in the way of introducing anything into ground water.  We hope this research will add more information.  The Deputy is right that it will be very difficult to do this on a stand-back basis. </p> <p>  In respect of international groups the EPA, representing Ireland, participates in an EU technical working group on environmental aspects of unconventional fossil fuels.  The working group consists of member states, the European Environment Agency, the EU Commission and the purpose of that group is to assist in identifying and addressing knowledge gaps, act as a platform for information exchange so we will definitely bring this research into that group to share what we have seen, and to contribute to the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to assess where the existing EU environmental legislation ensures an appropriate level of protection.  It is moving closer to the view that its current laws are all right in terms of the ground water, water framework and air quality directives.  We are very tuned in to what is happening internationally.  Our inspectors are involved with the EU Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law, IMPEL.  Senior management of the EPA is involved with a multiple agency network that involves Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland.  We are also involved with the European Network of Heads of Environment Protection Agencies.  That is also a forum for discussing issues such as this.  We all face the same challenge, how to protect the environment and health and get the information that will tell us how best to do that.</p></speech>

It is easier to research because of the consistency of the characterisation of geology and hydrology.  It is difficult to apply that research to Ireland because our hydrogeological and geological setting is much more complex.  The research is good within its context but one of the prime reasons for commissioning this research was that we did not have location-specific data that would help us determine what this means for Ireland.  It is difficult to take US EPA research in its totality, given we have such different ground water and geological regimes.</p></speech>

They spoke about different governments and bodies doing research in this area.  If they are doing so much research would it not be a good idea to get the whole gear, the boring gear, the whole lot to make an independent study?  I am not accusing anyone of anything but CDM Smith has sent us information about its contacts in gas exploration and oil companies.  It would be like asking me to do full research on a bog because I am involved in a bog.  Has it not dawned on anyone to set up our own unit to make a completely unbiased analysis?  It could be funded by the EU, for the betterment of all the people of Europe, or funded by Ireland and England because it affects people north and south of the Border.  It could involve Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast or wherever, colleges here and the EPA.  Has that ever been considered?</p> <p>  There are chemicals pumped into the water in America.  Where does the water needed for fracking go afterwards when it is contaminated?  We are trying to build tourism in this country, yet we could also damage the long-term interests of the country by going down a different road that could have grave consequences for our water system.</p><p>Has this side of it been examined by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA?  Has the agency thought about getting its own gear to carry out an independent survey?  People are sceptical about what is going on.  We were told it was a Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast set-up.  Now, we find that there were agencies which did not take part and one company that did had ties with the gas and oil industry.  I am not accusing that company of anything.  When the EPA was putting out contracts for this, did it decide that it better do this independently as fracking is a new activity in this country?  One wrong mistake in this and the consequences will be ferocious for the whole country, not just the parts where fracking will occur.  Has the EPA done that?</p></speech>

What I mean by that is that we are talking about bias before one output has come out of this research to date.  The art of science is the art of disproving.  Someone puts out a hypothesis.  It becomes a theorem which then becomes a law.  In that process, people try to disprove what is there.  All we are doing is putting out information that will be open to everyone, as part of the scientific method, to say they got it wrong, this is biased or this is incorrect.</p> <p>  I get the Deputy&rsquo;s point that there is a much greater acceptance by the public of research that is commissioned by the Government, regulators or unbiased agencies.  This would not be the first time that the EPA has researched into topical areas.  We have seen that with genetic modification, nanomaterials and nanoparticles.  The EPA's sole role is the protection of the environment and health.  We have no other role except that.  The only reason we are doing research is to fulfil that role.  As an independent agency, we do not get funding from oil companies or whatever.  We are totally funded by the taxpayer and the fees we generate through our own activities, such as licensing and enforcement.  We have completed a process we feel is of world standard.  We know that because we are involved with the Horizon 2020 EU research programme, as well as other multi-country joint programming initiatives and research.  We know the way we scope, tender and execute our research is as good as anywhere in the world.  We feel we have done the same in this case.</p> <p>  I fully accept there are concerns because CDM Smith, in the past, has been involved in advising both pro-fracking and anti-fracking governments and people might see it could be biased.  That is not the view of the EPA.  At the end of this, there will be a series of reports and data that will be open to everyone to decide whether they are appropriate, biased or not, or whether they got the facts right.  We are totally open to that.  If the scientific method of disproving the science continues, we will have added to that debate.  That is not to say, however, that we should not have the debate or shut it down.</p> <p>  With 27 individuals from 15 State bodies, as well as those in the consortium, including Phillip Lee Solicitors, the British Geological Survey, Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast and University College Dublin, I am confident it would take many people and much persuasion to get all those involved to a one view that is biased.</p></speech>

These are all the issues and we know these exist from our US EPA research.  What we are trying to do is find out if these known impacts could be amplified in an Irish context.  It is then up to policymakers, legislators and Departments to take that information to decide which way they want to take it.  Regulators like An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Commission of Energy Regulation, the Health and Safety Authority and the EPA, have to take that information and use it as best they can.</p> <p>  We know there are issues.  We are trying to find out if those issues could be amplified in an Irish context which has a much more complex geology and hydrogeology.  If they are amplified, that raises the bar of whether fracking can be regulated in any way in Ireland.  This is what this research will tell us.</p></speech>

It will not start until the first phase of the project has been finished.  Basically, the first phase would have involved identification of groundwater and surface water issues.  On the basis of that, it will determine how many groundwater wells there will be and where.  We have not finished the first phase.  We anticipate finishing it in the next month or so.  Following on from that, the last action will be to determine the scope of work for putting in groundwater wells and seismic testing in the area.</p></speech>

This committee was given a clear impression that Queen's University Belfast was an integral part of this research project when the EPA last appeared before the committee.  We were never officially informed that there had been any change in the dynamic or relationship between QUB and the study project.  On the contrary, a number of statements were made by the Minister which indicated that Queen's University would be actively engaged in parts of the study and would be involved in peer reviews.  QUB, in response to a freedom of information request, on 8 September, stated that the university is not part of the consortium specified above and is not involved with the UGEE project, and that the university's involvement in this area was limited to the provision of consultancy during the initial tender stage.  That is not what we were given to understand by the EPA or by the Minister.  Could I have their comments on that?</p></speech>

When I was last before this committee, I stated:</p><blockquote>The research is being undertaken by a consortium of independent organisations, comprising CDM Smith, British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster of Ulster, Queens University Belfast, [AMEC] Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors.</blockquote> <p>On foot of the question I was asked today, I stated that the role of staff from Queen's University Belfast was to contribute to Project A1.  Specifically, it was divided in two parts as follows: three researchers in the QUB groundwater group were proposed to work on a number of Project A1 tasks; and a full-time academic was nominated as part of the consortium's internal technical review team.<br/><br/>Upon appointment, as can happen in any research, persons say that, although they signed up for research, they are busy doing other stuff.This happens all the time.  It can happen, particularly between the tender for research going out, a response coming in from those who want to do the research and them being notified that they are good to go on the research.  As a research body, we get that all the time.</p></speech>

We still see invoices from Queen's University Belfast, which are being invoiced to the project associated with that statement of member.  What might explain the difference is that there is a difference between what I would call the corporate entity that is Queen's University Belfast and the research or academic bodies which individually apply for research projects.  Again, as a significant environmental research funder in Ireland, we would have multiple academics within various universities who avail of the administration and facilities of their colleges in applying for research funds and completing research but are distinct from what I would call the executive of a university.  That is the only explanation I can give for the letter the Deputy has obtained.</p></speech>

Within the project team, there is CDM Smith, the British Geological Survey and the University of Ulster.  As a project team, they decide the end product that will go to an external evaluation panel.  In the context of the inside of this consortium, Queen's University plays a role.  The particular role the academic plays is as an internal reviewer for the consortium as to the quality of its work.  It then decides, as a consortium, that it is happy it has fulfilled the requirements of the terms of reference and it puts it forward as its output for the research.  The output is then evaluated by the 27-member panel that is being put in place by the EPA for the sole purpose of peer reviewing the outputs of the consortium.</p></speech>

The first projects have to conclude, which will set a scope.  That scope will go to the consortium.  The consortium will then think about the scope and how best to do it.  It will then prepare how it will do it.  That will go back to the evaluation panel.  The evaluation panel will say if it looks reasonable or not and then it will go back to the consortium, possibly with amendments, and it will carry out that piece of work.  None of this has happened.</p><p>In the tender for this supplemental work we stated:</p><blockquote>The successful framework operator will be responsible for negotiating with landowners toi. Obtain permission to enter onto lands suitable for the installation of the additional monitoring points; and<br /><br />ii. Use and have access to the additional monitoring points as well as making any payments arising to landowners in respect of losses-inconvenience incurred by them as a result of the operation of monitoring points on their land.</blockquote></speech>

But for the good work done by the groups studying it, we would not have known to ask the question.  The change should have been made known to us.  I am not saying Mr. Lynott misled the committee.  At the last committee meeting he described precisely the position.  However, there was a significant change and the committee was not advised of it.  An anti-fracking group did the good work and obtained the information under freedom of information legislation, which prompted us to ask the question this time and Mr. Lynott answered it.  Without the freedom of information request, we would not have known to ask the question.  That is not good.</p></speech>

This is a quantitative review of what is available in terms of a HIA.  It is with a view to getting the best of what is available internationally, putting together a programme of how a HIA would be done in the event that fracking is ever done in Ireland and that these are the steps that would meet best international practice.  We feel that is of value particularly to policy makers, legislators and other regulatory authorities that they would be aware, through this research, of all the appropriate steps for doing a proper HIA if fracking ever takes place in Ireland.</p></speech>

For example, the Burren in County Clare has very vulnerable groundwater, as it has very little soil on top, as has east Galway and Gort, which have very fractured limestone, or groundwater is interchangeable with surface water.  Various studies have been done in the past that would try to give information as to what areas are most appropriate for land spreading.  Land-spreading on top of the Burren is not a good idea but land-spreading in County Meath with significant soils over groundwater is a good idea.  We would have been involved in multiple studies of that nature.</p></speech>

I am not sure what the other characterisations would be.  I would imagine that some parts of the north west would have been classified as vulnerable.

Mr. Lynott will recall the expressions of interest invited in regard to this matter were issued by the last Government and that the permits were issued just as the last Government was breaking up.  I am not making a political point because for me this is not political.  Since I became a member - because I live in the area and, hopefully, my children and grandchildren will live in the area that is threatened with fracking - I have been speaking to many Deputies and Senators and almost everyone will acknowledge that it is a pity these invitations to submit expressions of interest were ever sent out.  If we knew then what we know now, on the basis of research that has been carried out since the expressions of interest were submitted, we would not do it.  We are doing a detailed, expensive study.  We have a population which is very concerned about agri-tourism, agrifood, fishing, that the waters will be poisoned, that the houses will diminish in value and that the place in which they live and love will be turned into an industrial wasteland.  All of this was done with no public discussion and no political discussion.</p> <p>  My concern is that this whole project seems to have taken on a momentum of its own.  There is a train heading towards fracking and I do not know who is the driver.  It does not appear to be the current political system, if one wants to call it that.  I am not being critical because decisions are made based on a level of knowledge that people have at the time.  Almost all of the political opinion here, and certainly those I have earmarked, have reached a stage where they are darting into doorways if they see me coming because they have a good idea of what I am going to talk about.  The overwhelming response of Deputies and Senators is that it was wrong ever to look at this.  Who is in charge?  Who is driving that train?</p><p>The EPA is a passenger on that train.</p></speech>

Since we are charged with protecting the environment and the health of the people, we also look at issues coming down the tracks.  We see that as a very important part of research, not only to research what has happened but to research what may be in the future.</p> <p>  As part of that and before this research, knowing when we began to see fracking on our horizon that we, as an agency, needed to find out more about it on behalf of the people, we commissioned preliminary research which set out a range of issues of concern to regulators, which issues I have named and which include contamination of groundwater and so forth.  That research recommended that some in-depth research needed to be conducted in the context of Ireland and not in the context of the United States, France, Poland or wherever.  We accepted those recommendations and on foot of that decided to commission further research that would give us the information we require to do our duty as an environmental regulator.</p> <p>  On foot of us commissioning that research, other decisions have been made not to give exploration licences.  Policies on energy are being drafted but they are in parallel to research.  Research goes on its own track, but based on a strategy that has been developed and which is open for consultation.  In terms of consultation, approximately 800 people provide input to our research strategy and also, in terms of the scope of work for this research, we received 1,300 or 1,400 submissions.  We have widely consulted on this.</p> <p>  We see our role as researching not only good matters but controversial matters, and not only what has happened but also what could happen.  We see that as an integral part of our role as an environmental research funder.</p></speech>

In other words, it is saying there is no way anybody could, based on current scientific knowledge in this area, guarantee there will not be adverse effects on health.  The New York Department refers to &ldquo;health&rdquo; but we could also include water and the environment.  Is that not just a fact?</p></speech>

Much of the research the EPA commissioned has taken international research and examined it from an Irish context, particularly given that, under current legislation, anyone who carries out fracking in Ireland will have to go through a series of hoops, including the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Health and Safety Authority and the EPA.  Those decisions have to be based on science.  Our research will provide that science.  The science can inform policy-makers and also those in the localities in which the research is done in order that they can be fully informed.</p></speech>

We carried out an evaluation of international literature that indicated there are many places in the United States where hydraulic fracturing can be done and many where it cannot be done.  The EPA has been advised that the prudent step was to commission research that would put hydraulic fracturing and its impact on the environment and human health in an Irish context.  That is what we do.  We examine controversial research in addition to non-controversial research and we believe, as part of our role as the primary environmental researcher and funder of environmental research in Ireland, that it is prudent that we consider this ongoing controversial issue and try to put some science into the debate.</p></speech>

This work will not recommend in favour of or against fracking but will start to put together the science that will allow others, including the EPA, to evaluate whether fracking should go ahead in Ireland.

I question the wisdom of carrying out this study.  I have figures from Minister of State Deputy Joe McHugh implying the total cost is &euro;1.75 million, which includes &euro;500,000 from his own Department.  This is excessive and it is wastage in view of the country's austerity programme.  The money could be put to much better use to address problems such as hospital waiting lists, particularly given the controversial nature of the fracking industry and the questions associated with it.  Has Mr. Lynott communicated with Britain, which has topography and geology very similar to ours?</p> <p>  This is a sham exercise, or a bit of a charade, and we have much more important things to be doing.  We should have a moratorium on fracking in this country for at least 20 years, during which period we could learn the experience abroad.  Ours is but a little island and fracking could have a considerably detrimental effect on us.</p> <p>  It was interesting that Mr. Lynott stated there is nothing in the study regarding the effects on health.  I find that hard to justify.  In the state of New York, the health department carried out a review in December 2014.  In our study, there is an onus on the chief medical officer in the HSE and the Department of Health to become engaged.  Health is a priority in addition to protecting the environment.</p> <p>  There is a clear conflict of interest for parties involved in this.  The independence of the study must be queried.</p><p>The progress report, presented in September, shows that the bulk of the study is being carried out by CDM Smith and Amec Foster Wheeler, both of which are heavily involved in the oil and gas industry.  Amec is reviewing regulations, legislation and the writing-up of best practice for fracking.  Its client list also includes BP, Shell and ExxonMobil.  We are told the research is undergoing internal and external independent review.  The internal review is being carried out by the members of the consortium.  For example, a task carried out by Amec is reviewed by CDM Smith and <i>vice versa</i>.  This clearly is inadequate.  The independent external review is being carried out by members of the steering committee. This, again, is inadequate and extremely poor practice.<br/><br/>I cannot fathom how this extensive research was commissioned in the first place.  I will make a comparison with the process of acquiring planning permission for a domestic dwelling.  Particularly in the past ten years, groundwater testing for percolation in sewage treatment systems has become very detailed.  The EPA guidelines are barring a lot of people from setting up a family home in their own areas.  I know of numerous people in my county of Kerry who have, more or less, been barred from building a house owing to extensive regulation.  The EPA is adopting a very loose procedure in respect of fracking and appears to support that industry.  At the same time, there are guidelines for groundwater testing in the case of a domestic house and people are being prohibited from building even on their own land.  I find it hard to comprehend.<br/><br/>I advise the EPA to go back and become involved in the health aspect also.  We are on a bit of a wild goose chase.  I ask the EPA to come out with a very strong statement to the Minister.  All it has to do is look across at the United Kingdom and the reports from there.  The EPA has also carried out some preliminary investigations which should have found enough evidence to conclude that this not the way to go in this country.</p></speech>

It is not in any way, shape or form.  Like any statutory authority, it has a quasi-judicial function and it cannot carry out its quasi-judicial obligations with a biased view.  As the primary environmental regulator and funder of research, it is appropriate that it should look to develop the science on topical and controversial issues, not only things that happened in the past but also future issues.  Given that anyone who wants to engage in fracking has a legal right to seek planning permission, permits or licences from various regulatory authorities, it is also appropriate that the EPA should seek to provide the science to back up any future policy or decisions by these regulators.  Our research prorgamme has been reviewed extensively and the reviews are available on our website.  We are benchmarked internationally in terms of how we commission and carry out research and the adequacy of our peer review process to ensure the science stands up internationally.</p></speech>

This is a controversial issue and the first I heard of it was from media outlets which referred to the mid-west region.  When I poked around a little more, I found out that it was to be undertaken in County Leitrim and west Cavan in my part of the world.  Are there plans for an extension into other parts of the mid-west region?</p> <p>  The problems with groundwater and the seepage of chemicals have been covered by other Deputies and Senators.  It is a serious issue as there is a huge number of deep wells across the region.  People depend on such wells for their supply of drinking water, as well as water for animals and domestic use, etc.  This development would have a huge effect.  I have seen seepage from silage pits destroy deep wells perhaps half or three quarters of a mile away.  One well had to be closed for ten or 12 years.  It had to be pumped out and various chemicals used to get it right again but only for slop water.  It was never used to supply drinking water again.</p> <p>  Fracking, or gas exploration, involves the bursting of rock.  When we start to interfere with the bowels of the earth, we do not know what damage we will cause, even several miles away.  I have a genuine interest in this issue, as do people to whom I talk.  It is important that we avoid the cultural and landscape rape of rural areas, given that there is a tourism product being developed in the mid-west and across the midlands.  We do not want to see industrial waste sites being developed.</p> <p>  As was said, there are so many restrictions on people who wish to build their homes, including once-off housing, in the west.  This is contradicted by what is happening in this instance.  When Mr. Lynott was replying to Deputy Michael Colreavy, he spoke about the involvement in the planning process of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the EPA, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, etc., but he did not mention a role for the local authority.  Will there be a role for the local authority in the planning process?</p> <p>  What is needed is an independent review before anything commences.  There are a lot of ifs and buts because I know what is taking place is a desk study of the region.  Other Deputies have dealt with the issue of CDM Smith.  Will it share the results of the study with fracking interests?</p> <p>  I would like to know what the role of Achilles Procurement is in the entire process.  Does it have any link or working relationship with fracking interests?  Who decided on its role in the project?  Is there not a possible conflict of interest?  I understand Achilles Procurement has been retained by the EPA on a framework contract to provide services in advance and that it has been facilitated in the tender process and so on.  Is that true?</p><p>Will Achilles Procurement be involved in the review of study results on an ongoing basis?  Will it also be involved in reviewing CDM Smith's work or <i>vice versa</i>?</p></speech>

Agencies like the EPA hire scientists, physicists and chemists who are not experts in the complicated area of procurement.  We have seen situations where procurement has gone wrong with the taxpayer paying the bill where it was not prepared.</p> <p>  In a general sense, Achilles Procurement - we list this in our annual report - is one of the many contractors or consultants that an agency like the EPA would use to help it go through all the intricacies and complexities of procurement.</p> <p>  As regards this particular project, we probably would have sought-----</p></speech>

It has no actual role in terms of the project itself, so it does not advise on the scope of work but on when one should tender, how long one should leave the tender out there, how one should evaluate the tenders in terms of length of time, how one should inform people who are successful or unsuccessful and how one should communicate all that kind of technical detail.  I think I have answered most of those questions.  There were two or three questions on Achilles Procurement.</p> <p>  Local authorities develop regional and local planning guidelines.  Within those guidelines, they obviously have a role because anyone seeking planning permission must abide by regional and national planning guidance.  I am not a planning expert so I am not sure whether a project like this would go to a local authority first and then An Bord Plean&aacute;la, or whether it would be seen as a strategic piece of infrastructure and go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I really do not have any expertise in that area.</p> <p>  As regards this research, there is no fracking contained in it.  No fracking activity will happen until this research is concluded and there is no guarantee that any fracking will ever happen in Ireland following on from this research.  In terms of an independent review prior to a decision on fracking, this research is on a parallel track in that it will go through its own peer review as all our research does.  It will stand on its own two feet.  As I said earlier, in terms of science, once it is out there it will be up to anyone to form an opinion on whether it got it right or wrong and whether it is biased or unbiased.  At the moment, however, none of that information is out.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the geology is fairly specific to a diagonal line from Clare to Leitrim, into Fermanagh and on into Scotland.  It is part of the old Appalachian Trail where it used to join onto America.  Therefore, it is defined by the geology and I do not think that geology goes into the mid-west.</p></speech>

First, the EPA is driving this project; I did not know who was driving the train.  Second, the EPA study does not incorporate a health impact assessment.  I was unclear about that as well.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  The field trials or tests are to be carried out next year.  Could the results of those be used by energy companies to get a firm fix on whether gas exists there, the levels of extraction, or the volume of gas there?</p> <p>  In hindsight, does Mr. Lynott think it would have been wiser not to seek expressions of interest until the project the EPA is working on now had been concluded and studied?  Would the seeking and receipt of expressions of interest not raise the expectations of energy companies that there was going to be a result to the work they are doing?  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-02a.588" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dara Lynott" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015120200002#AA02600"><p>The answer to the first question is "No".  This study will not determine how much gas is there, where it is, or its viability whatsoever.  Any of the drilling is solely to do with the depth, quality, direction and flow of the water.  In terms of seismology, it will determine how stable or unstable the rock is there.  Therefore, this will not provide any information to any potential extractor of gas about the viability or otherwise of the gas there.</p> <p>  In answer to the Deputy's second question, we believe the primary way to get an Irish-specific answer to the science that is needed here as part of this research project is to put in wells and test results.  The issue is broader than this because if the manner of fracking never happens and is never taken on board in Ireland, we will have groundwater wells that will form part of a larger picture of what Irish groundwater quality is.</p> <p>  Irish groundwater is in pretty good condition.  About 70% of our waters are in pretty good condition, so that makes the barrier much harder for anyone to come in with activities that seek to introduce contaminants into groundwater or surface water.  Groundwater wells are part of that.</p> <p>  Earlier I mentioned Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran but I meant to say Philip Lee Solicitors.  That was a mistake on my part.  In case people think otherwise, I would like to correct that.</p></speech>
