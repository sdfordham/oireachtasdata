As a nation, we have a strong affinity not just with racing but also with the social scene at its core.</p><p> One of the overarching objectives of the Government is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve maximum potential and, in so doing, contribute to economic and social development across a wide geographic swathe of the country.  Successive Governments have staunchly supported these industries through legislation and policy initiatives over a long period.  The horse and greyhound racing industries have a huge geographic spread and they deliver to the local economy like few others.</p><p> These industries receive financial support from the State through the horse and greyhound racing fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  In the period 2001 to date, a total of &euro;1.12 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund provided under the relevant regulations has, therefore, been reached.  Exchequer funding provided from the fund is pivotal to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  To give effect to the provisions of budget 2018, this cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation.</p><p> The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2018, include an allocation of &euro;80 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  This will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80% or &euro;64 million going to Horse Racing Ireland and 20% or &euro;16 million going to Bord na gCon.  To allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2018, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirements under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the horse and greyhound racing fund by &euro;80 million to &euro;1.2 billion.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to the committee today.  The aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund was increased in this manner in 2004 and in 2009 to 2016, inclusive.</p><p> The recent Deloitte report commissioned by HRI indicates that the total direct and stimulated expenditure of the Irish breeding and racing industry is estimated at &euro;1.84 billion in 2016.  The report indicates the core industry comprises &euro;914 million of this with secondary expenditure making up the remaining &euro;927 million.  In addition, an estimated 15,200 jobs are at the core of the racing and breeding industry or in directly related industries.</p><p> The achievements of Irish-bred and Irish-trained horses abroad and the enduring influence of Irish-born jockeys and stable staff underscore Ireland's global prominence.  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is competitive at a global level despite other major racing nations having far larger populations and economies.  The horse and greyhound racing fund has been pivotal in shaping the destiny of this dynamic industry.  It is noteworthy that the Irish thoroughbred breeding industry has developed from an essentially amateur cottage industry pre-1969 to a position in which Ireland now is one of the leading bloodstock producing nations in the world.  The industry produces close to half of all thoroughbreds in Europe.  We hold the distinguished position of being the third-highest producer of foals coupled with having the third-highest number of active brood mares in the world.</p><p> Government funding is crucial to maintain and build on our position as one of the world's leading breeding and racing nations.  Government funding of this industry is an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for this investment leading to a flow of income right through the economy.  Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for our society and economy.</p><p> The greyhound industry is a significant industry for Ireland.  It has been embedded in Irish society for decades and is an important activity from an economic, social and cultural perspective.  It provides and supports considerable employment directly and indirectly throughout the country.  The Irish greyhound sector has come through challenging times during the economic recession but it continues to make a significant economic and financial contribution to the Irish economy, especially at local level.  The Bord na gCon annual reports indicate that, despite a severe recession, the industry is recovering and showed an increase in operating surplus in 2015 and 2016.  The industry remains significant for the economy and has the potential to grow with the necessary investment in facilities and support infrastructure.  Funds generated from racing are re-invested in the industry through contributions to prize money and grants to various bodies involved in the greyhound racing and breeding sector, as well as promotion of greyhound welfare and the regulation of the industry.  The funding provided to the greyhound racing sector helps to sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of our country.  This funding underpins economic activity in what are, in many instances, less affluent regions of the country.  It has also contributed significantly to the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks throughout Ireland.  Greyhound racing is an activity that is inextricably linked to the farming community.  While it is undoubtedly part of the fabric of rural Ireland, it also enjoys a strong urban base.</p><p> The advent of new technologies and business models has challenged the Government to re-evaluate the funding mechanisms for the industry.  As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government has addressed, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and online betting operators were outside the tax net.  The Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 came into force on 15 April 2015.  The Act brings betting exchanges and Internet and mobile betting providers within the scope of the existing licensing regime and extends the existing 1% turnover tax on land-based bookmaking activities to online and mobile bookmakers.  The Act also means that a 15% commission tax for betting exchanges has been implemented.  These measures have had a positive effect on revenue streams with significant increases being realised.  It is worth noting that betting tax has increased from a total of &euro;31 million for 2015 to &euro;51 million in 2016.</p><p> The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016, which gives effect to the recommendations in the Indecon report, came into force on 8 February 2016 with certain sections commenced on 9 March 2016 and January 2017.  The Act introduced a range of improvements in governance and accountability arrangements, many of which derive from recommendations made by Indecon International Economic Consultants following a review of the sector.  Indecon International Economic Consultants was also commissioned to conduct a review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon to assess the suitability of the legal, governance and regulatory framework supporting the greyhound industry and to identify opportunities to maximise its commercial income.</p><p> In response to the recommendations made in the Indecon and Morris reports, as well as in the report prepared by this committee, chaired at the time by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle, I have introduced a draft general scheme of the greyhound industry Bill.  The Bill will address the governance of Bord na gCon.  It will strengthen regulatory controls in the industry.  It will modernise sanctions and improve integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector.  As members are aware, the draft general scheme has progressed through the pre-legislative scrutiny phase and a memorandum will go to Government in the coming weeks requesting approval to publish the updated general scheme and to submit it to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  In this regard, I wish to extend my thanks to the members of the committee for their thorough and thoughtful deliberations during the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I believe the Bill will bolster the Irish greyhound industry, enable it to deal with existing challenges and maximise its future potential.</p><p> I am sure we are all in agreement that more balanced regional economic growth is desirable and this is a key priority for Government.  In this context, these industries should be given recognition for the considerable contribution they make to rural economic activity and employment.  Their activities are spread throughout rural areas and can be credited with enhancing the social fabric of rural Ireland.  Local stadia are a focal point for supporting economic, social and cultural needs.  Point-to-point meetings take place at 70 locations throughout the island, contributing significantly to many rural communities.</p><p> Horse and greyhound racing compete in a number of different economic arenas, including sport and hospitality and in a diverse betting arena.  Therefore, their collective reach throughout the economy is extensive and significant, reaching almost every county.  The important contribution made by the horse and greyhound racing fund since its inception in 2001 has been vital to ensuring that these industries can continue to invest in infrastructure, whether through continuing the programme of capital investment in racecourses, ensuring prize money remains competitive or education and development of their skilled workforces.</p><p> Section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provides that a draft of these regulations be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft be passed by each House before the regulations are made by the Minister.  Accordingly, I seek the support of all committee members to ensure that Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2018 and that the important role played by these industries, as well as the economic activity generated by them, are sustained in future.</p><p> I acknowledge the contribution that members of this committee have made to the debate on the future of these critically important industries.  I commend these regulations to the committee and I look forward to discussing any matters arising.</p></speech>

Senator Paul Daly was the first to indicate.  I will then call Deputies McConalogue and Cahill in that order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017112100002#P00300"><p>I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and thank him for his report.  It is well known that I am chairman of Kilbeggan Racecourse, which is one of the small racecourses.  As I am heavily involved, I am very much aware of how important this fund is for the sustainability of the smaller tracks and training yards that generate employment and create income in rural areas.  The Minister states that one must speculate to accumulate.  The investment of &euro;80 million in the industry returns to the State almost threefold.  With that in mind, I would be touting for an increase in what is being spent on the industries in order to drive them forward and bring them on to the next level.  There is an old saying that the day one stops going forward is the day that one starts going back.</p> <p>  The Minister also referred to the betting tax and the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015.  The gap was almost bridged by a &euro;51 million intake in 2016 as opposed to an output of &euro;80 million.  I would like to know why the rates of turnover tax for offshore and online betting were not considered in the 2017 budget.  This would bring us up to - and would probably surpass - the &euro;80 million and the additional moneys could be reinvested in the industry as per the provisions of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  I know that the tax rate in France is far higher and that all the money taken in is reinvested in the industry at no net cost to the state.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the possibility of bridging the gap and increasing the spend through increased taxation.</p> <p>  Horse racing comes under agriculture, hence the Minister's presence this evening.  I would like to hear the Minister's opinions, if possible, on the aspects of horse racing that do not fall under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I refer to a number of ongoing issues, namely, those relating to employment law and the rates revaluation.  Employment in horse racing is categorised as not relating to agriculture.  Where does the agricultural designation of horse racing stop and start?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017112100002#P00400"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming before the committee to discuss this issue.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party will be supporting the regulations and we believe it is important to provide this financial support and stimulus to the horse racing and greyhound sectors.  Both have reaped the dividends in the past years.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, our horse racing and horse breeding industry here is among the best in the world.  What has been done since the late 1960s in terms of how the industry has been transformed is a story that goes beyond what anyone could have expected.  Funding is central to continuing development.  I think that is important and we will certainly support what is being done.  As the Minister indicated, the recent report conducted by Deloitte on behalf of Horse Racing Ireland outlines how the sector and the industry benefit the economy as a whole.  What is important is that the benefits are spread throughout the regions.  Those benefits are an important to rural areas.  It is often forgotten that the majority of breeders run small operations.</p> <p>  Likewise, funding for the greyhound industry is very important.  The Minister referred to the greyhound industry Bill.  It is important that this Bill is expedited.  Will he provide an update on the timeline relating to it?</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly touched on the issue of the betting tax.  I would be interested in further feedback on the assessment from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Finance on the impact the extension of the tax to online betting has had.  Is all online betting being taxed?  This is primarily a matter for the Department of Finance.  However, I would like to hear the Minister's views on his engagement with that Department as to how matters might proceed.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly also referred to how labour is treated in the horse racing sector in particular.  It is important that work done in the sector should be regarded as agricultural activity.  It is also important that there be flexibility in work practices in order to ensure that the type work done in training yards is included in such activity.  I know that is an issue and I would like to hear the Minister's comments on it.</p> <p>  There has been a tradition of harness racing in Ireland but it has not been as popular here in recent years as has been the case in countries such as France, where it is very significant part of the horse racing industry.  This matter was discussed by the committee in 2015 and, following on from that, Indecon was commissioned to conduct a report to establish the potential for expanding and supporting harness racing in Ireland.  Indecon made certain recommendations in its report.  Will the Minister expand on how those recommendations have been progressed?  I am of the view that work in this regard has been much too slow.  It is important that the Indecon recommendations be considered.</p> <p>  Representatives from the Irish Harness Racing Association have met most members to discuss the Indecon recommendations.  One of these is to the effect that seed funding be provided to the Irish Harness Racing Association in order to enable it to act on the recommendations and develop the sector.  In order to facilitate the latter, the report suggests that the association establish a race track.  There are important timelines involved in the context of enabling the sector to grow.  Will the Minister outline where he wishes to bring harness racing and provide a commitment to the effect that the recommendations will be acted upon and that seed funding will be made available in order to facilitate development?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017112100002#P00500"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation  I would like to declare a personal interest.  I am a director of a privately-owned greyhound stadium.</p> <p>  These two industries are very important to the Irish economy.  We had the unprecedented achievement in the past couple of week of three Irish-trained horses finishing first, second and third in the Melbourne Cup, which is known as "the race that stops a nation".  That Ireland could bring three horses to Australia and that they would fill the first three places is a major achievement and a significant advertisement for our industry.</p> <p>  Those involved in greyhound racing and horse racing were disappointed that no increase in funding was announced in the budget.  In light of the increased revenue from taxation of both industries, they are of the view that there is a valid argument for an increase in funding.  We have met representatives from both industries and they put forward very valid arguments in respect of where the extra money could be invested for the benefit of the horse racing and greyhound industries.  Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon have very ambitious plans to advance their industries.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly outlined the potential on the taxation side and questioned whether we are capturing all of the revenue from the taxes that apply.  I wish to make a case for those in one sector of the industry that are under extreme pressure, namely, track bookmakers.  These individuals are definitely voting with their feet because the number of them involved in the sector is growing progressively smaller.</p><p>Unless we do something on the taxation side to give them an incentive, track bookmakers will become an extinct species.  Track bookmakers are vitally important to the social aspect and the whole concept of Irish racing.  I refer to the atmosphere in the ring.  The track bookmakers are a huge part of that environment.  Bookmakers make the point to me that the track bookmakers are using exchanges to try and boost their turnover.  Their view is that the level of tax that is being charged to the large corporations should not apply to track bookmakers, and if there was exemption for those under a certain turnover and the level of tax on betting exchanges was reduced, that would be a very significant incentive for track bookmakers and would allow them to try to stay in business.  There has been significant growth in the yield from taxation but the amount of money that is being taken off track bookmakers in taxation is small.  Unless we do something concrete for them, I fear for their survival.  As I stated, they are a significant part of the sector and it would be a sad day if they disappeared off the scene.  A monopoly would not be in anyone's interest.</p><p> The Minister mentioned the draft general scheme of the greyhound industry Bill.  That has gone through the committee here.  The proposed Bill is urgently needed.  The sooner it can become legislation the better.  I suppose there has been much adverse publicity for the sector.  The sector needs the mechanics of this Bill in order to deal with the issues it currently faces.  Issues are dragging on for far too long and they are not being dealt with promptly enough.  Talking to members of the sector, their hands are tied as regards advancing those issues quickly.  The proposed Bill could tighten up a lot of the legislation.  When an offence is committed, we need to intervene and bring it to a conclusion a lot more quickly and not have it dragging on for six or 12 months, as is the case in some of the occurrences in the recent past.</p><p> Point-to-points were mentioned.  I attended my local point-to-point on Sunday last.  It was held in Thurles and there was a fair crowd.  It brought home to me the value of it to the local economy that the small man can start off there with his horse at minimal expense and get it into a shop window.  If one is lucky enough to have a horse that is good enough to win, even at a local point-to-point like that, the big buyers are there and the opportunity is there to get a worthwhile return on a shoestring budget.  I had occasion to see a local horse winning on Sunday and there was a knock-on benefit in the form of a queue of people who were trying to purchase a horse that looked to be promising.  Everyone who has a horse lives for that dream, namely, that he or she will have one that can go out and win and give a significant return.  Thankfully, Ireland's reputation as the producer of top-class horses is greatly adding to the economical benefit of producing those young horses.</p><p> Senator Paul Daly made a couple of points about the definition of agriculture and the way employment law and rates are being interpreted by different Departments.  On the employment side, there has to be recognition that if we change the categorisation, it will make it impractical for stables to operate.  Unfortunately, long days are the norm.  If one has a horse going to a sales or a race meeting, the person who is handling that horse will have an extremely long day.  In agriculture, we are used to peaks and troughs.  At harvesting time, long days are accepted.  A re-classification of the horse-breeding sector to non-agricultural is not practical and will not work in the future.  That issue must be addressed.  On the rates side, it is agriculture and it should be rated as such.</p><p> As Deputy McConalogue stated, we as a party are glad to support the motion.  We see the benefits of this fund for the two sectors.  There are very ambitious plans by both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon and the fund has a huge part to play in that.  We have two sectors that we can be justifiably proud of and anything we can do here for the development of these sectors must be welcomed.</p><p> On the harness racing mentioned by Deputy McConalogue, everyone here has been lobbied.  It is in an infant stage.  They have had trial racing at Dundalk track and it has gone well for them.  They have had connections with the French sector where harness racing is extremely big.  They see very significant potential in this sport.  They want to try and develop a race track for themselves.  What they have proposed to us does not involve a huge amount of money.  It is dealing with a different type of horse.  There is very significant potential for us to develop this sector.  As regards the seed capital they are looking for, the Department should try to look favourably on this, give them a leg-up on the ladder and see how far they can go.  Up to now, they have achieved everything they stated they would do, including getting French sponsorship.  They are at a crossroads.  Everything has been done on a voluntary basis up to now.  They need to put a structure in place if they are to develop this sector further.  It would be regrettable if we were not in position to give harness racing the chance to fulfil the potential those involved in the sector strongly believe exists.  It will be a specialised sport but it can have a niche market.  It is one we should try to develop.</p></speech>

It is true to say that the Indecon report, which now charts the blueprint and the roadmap for the sector, was probably conceived in these committee rooms in the context of the Horse Racing Ireland legislation.  As the committee will be aware, that report was commissioned and the Department published it in October.  Historically, it is also true to say, as Deputy Cahill alluded to, that this is a sector which, in the not-too-distant past, almost had predominance as the equine sector that attracted the greatest levels of public support.  It has, however, for one reason or another, fallen significantly in the intervening period.  It has significant potential to re-establish itself.  Recently, I met informally representatives of the sector post the publication of Indecon.  As a Department, we see a public gain to be had from working with the sector.  There are issues the public at large wants to see addressed and from my engagement with the Irish Harness Racing Association, it is an appropriate vehicle and is interested in working with the Department to address some of the issues in the areas of public concern, apart altogether from the economic potential of the sector.</p> <p>  Indecon made five key recommendations.  One was to recognise the Irish Harness Racing Association as the appropriate governing body.  It also stated that the corporate governance of the sector needed to improve.  It talked about developing a five-year plan in terms of where the sector should go.  I cannot recall all five recommendations.  One was that the Department should continue to fund the pilot project on horse welfare and education with which it has been involved in that area.  It also spoke about a financial plan for the sector.  That is the blueprint.  The sector now needs to reflect, and probably not to respond in haste but to lay a solid foundation.  If it is a solid foundation, this Department will work with the sector in terms of achieving its potential.</p><p>I appreciate the point about Dundalk.  I have been working with French harness racing interests which have shown the potential that is there.  It is a sector with a wide geographical spread.  In my own county, and in west Cork especially, there is a particularly strong interest in it, and it is a long established tradition.  We want to work with the sector.  At a recent meeting, I told them that our budgets for 2018 are already published.  It will take the Irish Harness Racing Association time to digest and construct the appropriate responses outlined in the Indecon report.  When it does that, it will not find the Department wanting in terms of working with it.  There are issues around unstructured harness racing on public roadways which is the subject of adverse comment in the media and there are significant animal welfare concerns around it. This is an area where we would like the Irish Harness Racing Association and the Department to work together and bring about a public gain.  We also hope that the two working together would enable the Irish Harness Racing Association would enable it to achieve the sector's potential.  It has an international dimension and is something that can benefit the economy but we have the Indecon report and now our challenge is to build on it.  Having met representatives of the sector, I know they recognise that too.  </p><p> A number of other points lend themselves to quick responses.  I hope to take the greyhound Bill to Cabinet before Christmas and publish it afterwards.  </p><p> Senator Paul Daly spoke of the betting tax and referred to international comparisons with the funding available, I think he mentioned France.  I am conscious that while &euro;80 million is a lot of money, it is not in comparison with the support available in our competitor countries, a term I use advisedly because it is a very mobile industry which, if the policy framework was not right here could relocate in a substantial way.  The funding available in other countries far exceeds the amount we are in a position to put into the sector, not only in France but elsewhere.  We must keep an open mind on these matters.  Primarily the betting tax is an issue for the Department of Finance but we need to ensure that we make continual progress in funding the sector.  This year, the fund remains the same as last year but in the exceptionally difficult three preceding years, there was a &euro;6 million increase year on year for three years and then this year, in a very difficult year, we held the fund at &euro;80 million.  I take the Senator's point that when one stands still, it is like going backwards and certainly, I would like to revisit the fund next year, but in the context of a very difficult budget with many competing interests, it was not an insignificant achievement given what occurred in the three proceeding years.</p><p> I am very conscious of the point to which the Senator alluded, although he was not specific, regarding the WRC issue.  I do not wish to trespass on the area while it is before the WRC but it is one on which we keep a very anxious eye.  We are very conscious of the implications it could have on the industry and especially for smaller players.  We will not comment further until there has been an outcome as it would not be fair to do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017112100002#R00300"><p>I share Deputy Cahill's view that tracks, whether greyhound or horse racing, would be far poorer places and less colourful without the presence of course bookmakers.  I do not think that anyone wants a situation where the only option available is the tote.  It is an issue that Horse Racing Ireland has been considering and there has been engagement with bookmakers on the matter and I hope a resolution is imminent.  I encourage both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon to be conscious that these people bring colour to race meetings generally and that the race meeting environment would be much poorer without them.  I understand that there is significant competition for pitches especially in horse racing, but we must ensure that they can survive and whatever steps that need to be taken by both bodies should be considered in a fashion that ensures this.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill also raised point to point racing.  It is something I was very conscious of on my appointment.  We have a huge international reputation - Deputy Cahill referred to the Melbourne Cup which was a staggeringly good shop window for us, for Irish trained horses to take the first three places is unprecedented - but that is built on a foundation often laid in local communities, with small owners and breeding establishments.  Point-to-point races are the critical shop window for them and there is no point in saying otherwise.  The organisers of point to points were under tremendous pressure in recent years to continue to provide that service.  Happily, last year we succeeded in significantly addressing the financial concerns of the organisers and addressed the available prize money for races.  I am confident that will continue to be built upon.  That is the critical foundation for the industry which we showcase internationally and is something I am exceptionally proud of.  Significantly increasing prize money and grant aid to the committees organising point-to-points, I believe it was from &euro;4,000 to &euro;6,000 last year, was important and was recognition of the critical service that they provide.  </p> <p>  I think I have dealt with everything.</p></speech>

Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn is next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017112100002#R00500"><p>I am glad that when the Minister responded to the issues around the funding of the Irish Harness Racing Association, he acknowledged that the 2015 meeting of the agriculture committee discussion of a motion similar to the matter before us here was the genesis of the Indecon report.  My understanding is that a number of Deputies present had said they could not support the funding that was proposed in the motion unless a serious commitment was given to address the Irish Harness Racing Association.  This report was commissioned on the back of that.  The Department has had this report since May and it took five or six months for the report to be published.  My concern is that in this industry, people acting in good faith have built relationships internationally and are paying their own way to travel to international events and conferences to build an industry in Ireland.  They have done tremendous work.  The Indecon report clearly endorses that and believes in the sector's potential.  However, there are things that frustrate me.  The Department has allocated &euro;500,000 to Horse Racing Ireland which was also the subject of an Indecon report, published in May this year.  Why did this Indecon report into the potential of harness racing, whose publication is way over due, have to wait for six months?  The Minister says that money is allocated for 2018 but he is coming before the committee with a motion for money to be allocated to other sectors.  That is fair enough but the harness racers are looking for seed funding.  The Minister refers to the corporate challenges they face, but they are stepping up to them.  Like others here, I have met with them and am immensely impressed by them.</p><p>They have provided initial training to board members and further training is under way.  The size of the board has been expanded.  There are five subcommittees.  A core five-year strategy is being prepared and will be ready in mid-December.  The board will outline its plans to the committee in January.  The board needs seed funding to cover implementation.  The Minister has said he wants to address some of the issues in INDECON.  INDECON has clearly recommended that seed funding should be allocated to the IHRA to enable it to move on and address matters.  It is understandable that the Government needs reassurances about a five-year plan, the corporate structure and oversight in the industry, the sector, the animals and so on.</p><p> Two years ago this committee took a stand about the following.  Personally speaking, having considered this situation, I believe it is deeply unfair that the publication of the report was delayed by six months and post the budget allocation for 2018.  The association has made huge sacrifices.  It has reached a critical moment in terms of its future.  As one can see from the report the association does not have a huge amount of financial resources but anyone can see that it has a huge amount of ability and commitment.  It needs the Government to step in and act as its partner.  A significant investment will come from France over a number of years, which demonstrates that the sector has immense potential and international friends.  People have asked why they should invest in the area forever if its own Government or State will not do so.</p><p> I appreciate the comments the Minister has made today.  Clearly, he supports the IHRA and has met them recently so I have no gripe with him.  I know from what he has said that he is supportive and open to the association.  Everything he has said has been encouraging.  He acknowledged at the outset that the committee took a stand on this issue a number of years ago.  Through no fault of the association the report was delayed by five or six months.  If the report had been released on time and the association had received seed funding it would now be in a much stronger position.  The association does not just need seed funding but capital funding.  If it can secure a particular racing track soon it will prove very beneficial.  It is a huge opportunity that must not be missed.  We have a group of people here who have made considerable personal and financial sacrifices.  They have real enthusiasm for the sector.  They have been pretty much endorsed and vindicated by an independent report.  However, they need some financial assistance to implement some of the structures, improve organisational structures and appoint key staff.  As the Minister will know, the association does not have any staff.  I urge him to consider providing a portion of what he has recommended today: it is a relatively small amount of money.</p><p> In terms of the Minister asking the committee to support the motion for funding to be provided for the two sectors, I am saying there is money available.  In terms of the request for seed funding, I ask that the Department engages with the IHRA to ensure that it has the assurances that it needs.  This is a critical moment for the association.  It is unfair of the Minister and his Department to say there is no funding for 2018 because publication of the report was delayed by his Department.</p></speech>

I understand that the Department had the report in May but it was not published for six months, which is deeply unfair.  I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider providing seed funding subject to the standard assurances being supplied to the Department.

There seems to be considerable opportunity to develop the sport.  I support the calls for the Department to provide seed funding if at all possible.  I know it is not easy for the Minister to provide everything that people want.  I have witnessed a rise in the number of sulky racers on roads in my area and, therefore, believe it would be worthwhile to investigate the potential of the industry.  There is great opportunity to advance the sector, particularly in rural areas. </p> <p>  In terms of greyhound racing, everyone has confessed their connections to the sector.  I wish to confirm that my father kept greyhounds years ago.  It was always a pursuit that we loved as children.  We walked the dogs and brought them to the bog for a walk.  Unfortunately, my Dad did not enjoy great success with them but his children immensely enjoyed caring for the dogs.  Let us not forget the family aspect of keeping greyhounds, particularly in rural Ireland.  I support the calls to increase funding to the sector.</p> <p>  In terms of betting tax, I was a member of the Oireachtas joint committee on justice when we conducted pre-legislative scrutiny concerning the matter.  I wish the Minister well with trying to get the Department of Finance to ring-fence anything because I know it is not an easy thing to do.  I have discovered a new term "hypothecation."</p></speech>

I wish the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine well with trying to get the Department of Finance to ring-fence anything for the sector.  It would be marvellous if he succeeds.</p> <p>  In terms of a betting tax on online betting, at the time there was talk that a great amount of funds would be generated.  There is potential for an extra &euro;20 million per year to be generated, which is not to be sniffed at, and the amount will only increase.</p> <p>  Horse racing is hugely important to the economy.  I was lucky enough to watch a marvellous film that I am sure will be of interest to this committee.  The film "Against the Odds - Racing with Gordon Lord Byron" was made by a young man, Nicholas Ryan-Purcell from Cloughjordan, County Tipperary.  The film tells a fantastic story about the owners of the horse, the Cahalan family, who literally started off racing the horse at point-to-point races.  Sadly, the horse broke its pelvis.  The horse was due to be put down but the family decided to work on him with his trainer, Tom Hogan.  Thankfully, the horse has gone from strength to strength and now is internationally successful.  I recommend everybody should watch the film as it gives an insight into how important the sector is to rural communities.  It is amazing to realise how many people work in the sector.  The film also showcases the joy of winning and the passion that goes into preparing horses for racing.  The sector is incredibly important and we need to continue investing in the sector.  I support the Minister in anything he wants to do to support the sector as the sector is so crucial to rural Ireland.  I hope the Chairman will forgive me for mentioning the film but anyone who watches it will gain a great insight into the sector.</p> <p>  I shall return to discussing hypothecation.  Will the Minister pursue hypothecation?  It would be marvellous if he could ring-fence funding.</p></speech>

I can confirm that they are very committed and hardworking.  Their project is going places but they need seed capital to make things happen.</p> <p>  I am struck by the fact that the IHRA seems to be the poor relation to the other sectors that are so well funded and affluent, which is an issue that concerns my party.</p><p> I have spoken to the harness racers about their little projects to discourage people in the Traveller community, in the inner city and elsewhere from sulky racing on the roads and to direct what could be quite a dangerous activity into something which is properly regulated and properly done and has potential and a future.  There is tremendous effort on their part to try to do that and I wholly support anything that could be done to put a seed fund in place for them.  It would be more than disappointing if Horse Racing Ireland and the other sectors were to get such a huge amount of funding while the IHRA is left out again.  That would be just unacceptable.  I understand that it is looking for an initial sum of &euro;600,000 or &euro;700,000 as seed capital to get up and running and going.  It would reflect society's sense of responsibility to people who are doing the right thing to allow them get themselves going and to ensure they are regulated properly.</p><p> We have had Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon in here before this committee.  We have had rows with them, generally over how things are run and operated.  I know that the Minister and others have acknowledged the difficulties, to put it mildly, that exist in these organisations.  Situations like the one we saw recently involving the doping of dogs keep coming up all of the time.  There is a sense of despair.  I spoke to a number of people in that industry the other day and they were still of the view that little is changing.  It is to be hoped the Bill will go some considerable way towards regulating and putting some kind of shape on matters.  Many people are very fearful, however, and I look for the Minister's reassurance that the greyhound Bill will bring a very firm hand to this when it goes through.  People are at their wits' end and the organisation has really fallen into disrepute.  We need to take a grip of this situation and handle it properly.</p></speech>

If, as our information suggests, the Department had this report in May, why did it only come out six months later?</p> <p>  I understand that the IHRA, is looking for seed funding of approximately &euro;770,000.  Can a commitment be made to give it that money?  As the Minister has mentioned himself, it is clear, going through everything that we have seen here, that the IHRA has made a fair effort and even addressed many of the governance issues flagged in the Indecon report.  There is a premises in Portmarnock, as the Minister is probably aware, that is currently in receivership and will be sold shortly, and this is an opportunity for the IHRA to move forward.  Is there a commitment to solve this?</p> <p>  With regard to horse racing in Ireland, all of us who come from rural Ireland are aware of the benefits of having racing tracks at Galway or wherever else.  We can all see what it does for communities when people buy young horses and then have luck with them on the road and the same is true of greyhound racing.  I support this but I ask the Minister to confirm that money will be given to the harness racing body to get it up and running because it is clear from the figures we have seen that this would end up as a money-spinner.  There has been a lot of betting in other countries, in France for example, on races that have taken place here.  As the Minister said, this sport was big years ago and now seems to be making a comeback.  There is an opportunity here but when it comes to getting funding harness racing seems to be seen as the bad relation.  It would be wrong if one organisation were to be much better looked after than another, particularly if that other organisation might develop into a very good thing further down the road.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017112100002#T00300"><p>I will take up the comments on harness racing.  The point has been made that the Department delayed or had some mischievous intent to delay the publication of the report.  This was not the case.  We commissioned the report in good faith and we recognise the potential of the IHRA to become the kind of body with which we can engage in a structured way and into which we confidently invest taxpayers' money.  The clear inference here, however, is that the IHRA is not currently that kind of body.  The Indecon report states that its identification of a seed funding requirement of &euro;770,000 is conditional on the IHRA delivering on a number of matters, including a five-year strategic plan, which has not been received, and a costed programme identifying the specific target areas for expenditure and what the return would be on that investment.  What the Department is saying here is that we have a fund and a document on which we can make progress.  In all honesty, however, I cannot at this point commit taxpayers' money to an organisation that Indecon has clearly indicated is not one we could work with, at least not in its current manifestation.  The IHRA people I met recognised, in fairness to them, that they still have a journey ahead.  If the association can move and deliver on all of these conditions very quickly, we will have to assess at that point if is fit for purpose.</p> <p>  What we are open to doing, however, is engaging with them.  We, too, see public gain in the issues raised by the members, particularly when it comes to welfare, and as a signal of good faith we are in fact committing to continuing and to expanding the funding we already make available in the areas of harness racing, horse welfare, and the involvement of the Traveller community.  We are signalling good faith but we are also acknowledging, and it would be remiss of us to do otherwise, the fact that Indecon has said that the Irish Harness Racing Association is not fit for purpose in its current form.  The IHRA has itself recognised that and recognised that it has a journey before it when it comes to corporate governance, drawing up a five-year plan, and so on.  There is an open door to this in the Department.  I have met representatives of the IHRA already and we have officials ready to engage with them to reach the point where we can have confidence in committing public funds.</p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn referred to the Horse Sport Ireland, HSI, to the Indecon report, and to the additional funding of less than &euro;500,000 that HSI received this year.  We need to be aware, however, that HSI is a State body that has been in existence for more than ten years.  Specific deliverables are required to draw down that funding and we have clearly stated that that additional funding is contingent on the implementation of the reform outlined in the Indecon report for HSI.  We are using the same yardstick here.  I acknowledge the potential of the harness racing sector and we have the basis on which to proceed.  The enthusiasm of the people I met is infectious.  They are very committed and I appreciate that they have been putting their own resources into this.  We must equally acknowledge, however, that if we are to commit substantial public funds to the initial request for &euro;770,000, we have to be sure that we have a structure in which we can have confidence.  Our only requirement is that the IHRA now deliver on the Indecon requirements.</p></speech>

It would not have been possible for them to have come up with a five-year plan in three weeks.  This might have been an issue had the association got the report three months ago.</p></speech>

I would much prefer that they now reflect and build the structure appropriately rather than rushing headlong into something that will not stand up to scrutiny.  The Department and its officials are available to engage and work with them to get them to that point.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that we cannot commit public funds without having that work done.</p></speech>

We need to work with the IHRA now to get it to the point where we can have confidence in it as a body.  It is not that anything that they have done to date reflects poorly on them - not at all.</p><p>Far from it.  As I said, the enthusiasm of the association is infectious.  It has been running this to the best of its ability but we need to have more confidence in the structure to provide the substantial amounts of public funding the Deputy is talking about.  The Indecon report provides for that so we have that basis on which to proceed.</p></speech>

There needs to be seed funding to enable it to take on that work.  While it may not be prudent, in the Minister's view, to give substantial funding at this stage, it is important to provide initial seed funding to enable it to work with the Minister.  Given the potential for the sector and for harness racing to grow, it is important to support it in doing so and for the Minister not to give it a massive amount of work to do without any resources, staffing or backup to do it.  If the Minister could engage with the association, provide some initial funding and give targets to indicate what the funding for is for, it would enable the association to grow, respond and take the sector forward.</p></speech>

Five months later, through no fault of IHRA, this was published after the budget.  The Minister can see the recommendations.  Indecon has rightly recommended that a number of corporate management issues be addressed in its five recommendations.  It also clearly states that State seed funding could be provided on a pilot basis and its impact could be evaluated before any further funding is considered.  I would be uncomfortable, considering this report was delayed by five months-----</p></speech>

The Department had to conduct its own evaluation and was then in contact with the association.  We had to evaluate it.  It was not simply a case of getting a report one day and acting on it the next.  There was no undue delay.</p></speech>

I appreciate everything the Minister has said about the people and the potential.  However, he has not acknowledged that the association was waiting a long time for this report and it was submitted to his Department on 25 May.  The first chance the association had to address the issues in the report and comply with the Department's funding requirements and the report's recommendations was five months post-budget.  As Deputy Martin Kenny said, how on earth, with all the immense resources the Department has, could it take five months for it to go through this report?  How can the Minister expect a group of very determined and resourceful but voluntary people to comply with his Department's requirements?  It is completely unfair.</p></speech>

I would be deeply uncomfortable supporting this motion today without some commitment that, subject to the five year plan being received and a number of corporate management issues being addressed, which I think are well under way at this stage, the Minister's Department will provide seed funding and commit to capital funding, subject to those protections.  My understanding is that the association is well on the way to addressing the requirements and conditions, which is a miracle to me.  The problem is that the Minister is asking us to support a motion that commits funding to a number of related industries and we have no commitments-----</p></speech>

We are entitled to discuss it.  I cannot, in good conscience, support this motion today, and hopefully my colleagues will feel the same, without some assurance that seed funding will be given to this organisation.  I appreciate that it can address the recommendations in this report.  It wants to meet every recommendation in this report and to comply with all the corporate management and regulatory requirements of the Department.  The association wants to do it but needs financial assistance.  It is only fair-----</p></speech>

The committee does not have the power to approve or amend them.  That is just to clarify where we are.  We have had a good discussion and I think we are all on the same page.  I gather that the Minister supports the Irish Harness Racing Association.  While I do not want to get bogged down on the matter, I ask the Minister to give his final reply.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the commitment to this among committee members.  We did not delay but bear in mind that Indecon clearly states the funding the Senator is asking me to commit to the association is not something that I should offer as an inducement to comply with the Indecon recommendations.  The report states that the funding the Senator is asking me to commit is conditional on the association meeting the recommendations.  As a signal of good faith, we are committing in the region of &euro;50,000 to the Irish Harness Racing Association for 2018 as a continuation and expansion of the pilot project.  It is a prerequisite that the other five critical recommendations in the report are complied with before we could countenance seed funding but we are, as a signal of good faith, committing in the region of &euro;50,000 to an expansion of the pilot project.</p></speech>

This is immensely unfair to it because it was not given any time whatsoever.  This was published after the budget and the association was given no opportunity.  I think every member here is convinced that if the association had been given the opportunity and a reasonable timeframe, it would have complied with the Minister's Department's requirements and the requirements of this report, and it would have been able to avail of the funding it needs in 2018.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to intervene because the association is left blowing in the wind due to a delay by the Minister's Department in publishing the report.  The association needs a significant Government commitment on paper for it to draw down the other international funding to survive moving forward.  The association is on very thin ice through no fault of its own and despite everything it has done.  The Minister should own this and his Department should have published the report long ago, not after the budget, five months after receiving it.</p></speech>

The Indecon report provides for the potential of a long-term strategic relationship between the Department and Irish Harness Racing Association.  It is my personal belief that if the report had been published the day after we received it, any serious five-year strategic plan for the sector would have taken approximately that length of time to put together the appropriate documentation that we require to convince us that this is an organisation with which we can have a long-term strategic relationship.  It cannot be written in a week or three weeks and it slightly worries me that there is now a headlong rush to say that we can do it in a condensed and short period of time without having the appropriate reflection or the level of professional input into compiling a five-year strategic plan for the industry, which is a serious document and not something that can be magically made in weeks.  That is a strategic document that will take months to compile.</p><p>What we are offering here is the opportunity to engage with us because we can see that a public good can flow from this.  We want to have that relationship with them.</p><p> There was no attempt to withhold the publication for any type of devious motivation.  I genuinely urge the members and the harness racing association to view this document as the beginning.  It is the first chapter of what can be a long relationship with the Department, one that would be mutually beneficial.  One will not compile a five-year strategic plan in the period of time since that publication.  It would be a challenge to do it in the number of months that have passed since the Department got the report.  That is the type of document we are examining.  It is a serious piece of work.  If it is done properly it will lay a very solid foundation on which to build and to get to a point where we can replicate the potential that this industry is achieving in other jurisdictions, particularly in France.  However, it is necessary to make haste slowly and to do it right.  I have every confidence, given the enthusiasm of the people I have met and their business acumen, that they know a five-year strategic plan is not something that can be magicked up in a short space of time.  What we are discussing here is the chance to open up a meaningful relationship.  My officials and I are open to working with them in that context.</p></speech>

This issue hit the public airwaves again recently.  I will preface my comments by pointing out that it is not useful to dwell on an individual case.  We have an interest in ensuring integrity.  That is at the core of the legislation we are discussing.  There are issues around what appropriate levels of drug residue should be in the public domain where it has an adverse or beneficial impact on performance.  Those are issues for professional, competent officials.  My overwhelming objective is to ensure that the proper legislative framework is in place to deal with integrity matters.  I believe we will have that in the legislation that is imminent.</p></speech>

Television coverage and web streaming of the meeting can also be adversely affected.</p><p>No. 5 on the agenda is engagement with a number of stakeholders on the ongoing reform of the leaving certificate curriculum.  There is always much debate and discussion on this topic.  In the words of Vere Foster who was a great philanthropist and educator and the first president of the Irish National Teachers Organisation in the late 1800s, &quot;A nation's greatness depends upon the education of its people.&quot;  Obviously, we are talking about the education of the youth, not just towards examination results.</p><p>On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth; Mr. John Doran, a guidance counsellor at Patrician secondary school in Newbridge; Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc, director of the Teaching Council, who is accompanied by Ms Carmel Kearns, head of teachers, learning and research; Mr. Tony Donohoe, head of education and social policy at IBEC, who is not a stranger to the committee and whom it is good to see again; Ms Sorcha N&iacute; Chonghaile from Oifig na Gaeilge who is representing the Irish Second-Level Students Union; Mr. Geoff Browne, president of the National Parents Council Post-Primary, who is accompanied by Mr. Ross MacMahon, communications director; Mr. Eamonn Moran, principal officer at the Department of Education and Skills, who is accompanied by Ms Ruth Richards from the inspectorate; Mr. Aidan Farrell, CEO of the State Examinations Commission, who is accompanied by Mr. Hugh McManus, assistant head of examinations and assessment; and Mr. John Hammond, CEO of the National Council for Curiculum and Assessment, who is accompanied by Mr. John Halbert, director of curriculum and assessment.</p><p>The format of the meeting is as follows.  I will invite all of the delegates to make a brief opening statement of about five minutes' duration.  They can share time, if they so wish.  The opening statements will be followed by engagement with members of the committee.  Everybody will then have the opportunity to respond to questions or comments from members.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by me as Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise that any opening statement made to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting, with the submissions received.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now ask Dr. O'Sullivan to make her oral submission.</p></speech>

Throughout my career in research I have developed an understanding of the challenges students and teachers face within the current system.  I have also gathered a wealth of information on how education policy can impact on those who are most marginalised in the community.  When I was invited to answer the committee's questions, I decided to call on my existing relationships with teachers working in a variety of schools.  I surveyed 40 teachers using the questions the committee had provided.  The views which emerged were similar to my own and formed the basis of my submission.  They spoke to two key points, the first of which was the value of the leaving certificate applied programme as it stood.  The second theme was that moving towards a skilled based curriculum which focused primarily on employability was important but that it should be approached with caution.  I also contacted Dr. Delma Byrne who has worked extensively in researching the leaving certificate curriculum.  She added her views on the leaving certificate applied programme which were included in my submission.</p> <p>  In considering the issue of reform I ask committee members to reflect on what they see as the purpose of education.  Is it a means through which young people gain the necessary skills and knowledge to perform in a changing economy, or is it the tool we use to develop engaged, enquiring, creative minds empowered to live lives they deem to be valuable?  For me, education should focus on the latter and the former will follow automatically.  The reason I ask this question is that it speaks directly to the question the committee posed about preparing students for employment and the idea of partnering with business to ensure the skill sets which emerge from the curriculum match those needed in the modern workforce.</p> <p>  I have worked in this area for a number of years researching the impact a 21st century model of teaching and learning has on student skill development.  I have published many papers on the subject and my work has shown that, with the correct supports, there is real potential for the leaving certificate curriculum to include a 21st century model of skills which will produce more reflective, collaborative and technologically savvy students.  However, it must be approached with caution.  When we invite businesses into the classroom, we run the risk of allowing marketisation to direct curriculum content.  This has been seen in the United States where large corporations now "sponsor" schools, the students in which are seen as part of a conveyor belt for their industries.</p> <p>  When considering this shift, we must also ensure all teachers and schools will be empowered to implement the same curriculum.  My research has shown great variability in the schools that can and cannot adjust to a changing curriculum.  It has also shown that schools with more concentrated levels of disadvantage are less likely to adjust their teaching practices to incorporate 21st century teaching and learning models.</p><p>This is not because teachers do not want to change or that they place less value on change.  It is because they lack the resources to make the adjustments.  These resources include availability of time, including time to train and time away from discipline issues, in DEIS schools particularly.  It also includes access to modern technology and support to implement these changes in line with the overemphasis on the terminal exams, or what has been called the teaching to the test mentality.  This issue is already being reflected in the schools which are taking up the new coding course for leaving certificate.  Early numbers reveal that affluent schools are the most likely to run this new option, resulting in a growing digital divide with more affluent students being prepared for the coding world while the student attending DEIS schools or coming from socioeconomic disadvantaged backgrounds being left behind.</p><p> Based on my work in this area I will make the following recommendations to the committee.  The curriculum should include courses aimed at addressing the ever-changing skill sets required by businesses, but these courses should be viable for all schools to implement, not just some schools.  Extra provisions should be provided for DEIS schools to implement these courses, including the new leaving certificate coding course, and these provisions should relate specifically to adequate continuous professional development, CPD, offerings, availability of technology, and teaching hours.  The leaving certificate curriculum should embed these skills within and across the whole curriculum and not limit access to these experiences to the years that are considered less important years, for example, for first year and transition year students.  This is what is currently happening in schools that want to reform the curriculum.  </p><p> I move now to the leaving certificate applied, LCA.  I have worked with excellent teachers in DEIS schools who see the LCA as an integral part of their school structure and in some ways it is the saving grace for those students at risk of leaving school early.  However, the LCA, in its current form, is letting down the students who have been sold on the idea of a vocational journey through school.  A recent report from Byrne and McCoy on the outcomes of LCA students and work from the ESRI show consistently that students who take the LCA are having worse outcomes than those who stay on an academic track in school, even a lower academic track.  They are less likely to gain employment within a year of finishing school and never progress onto higher education.  It has been suggested that only 4.6% of students currently taking the leaving certificate are on an LCA track, but looking at the numbers, 25% of DEIS school students will take LCA, which means 25% of those students in DEIS schools will end up unemployed or unemployable.  Social class, gender and household employment consistently influence LCA, with unskilled manual groups being more likely to be on this track.  This is also true of males relative to females and those in work-poor relative to work-rich households.  The formalisation of LCA in the mid-2000s actually lead to an increase in uptake of children from semi-skilled, manual backgrounds, who were previously more likely engage in an academic track-----</p></speech>

My point is that the LCA, in its current offering, is actually very positive.  The students really enjoy the social and skills-focused elements of the LCA.  Teachers talk about how the programmes are really important for certain students.  However, there is no consistency across the offerings and across school types, with affluent schools never offering the LCA.  Based on this work I recommend that the content is adjusted to support students to progress onto further education and higher education.  I recommend that LCA includes a math and language element to it so that students can actually access further education, and that higher education and further education programmes are asked to consider LCA in their entry requirements.  I recommend a change to the grading structure of LCA, with students' work being assessed rather than graded by attendance only.  I recommend that higher education institutes, HEIs, and further education institutes, FEIs, are encouraged to consider LCA as a path into their institutions.</p> <p>  In a time where there is a call for a skills focused curriculum it would seem that the LCA content could be utilised and adapted to inform the current academic track.  I recommend that the leaving certificate as it stands explores the models of LCA which are</p> <p>currently working in terms of moving some students into employment and adapt that content to the current curriculum.</p></speech>

Before doing so I consulted with a number of colleagues, including management, principals, deputies principals and colleagues.</p> <p>  "The future is important to me, Sir; it&rsquo;s where I intend to spend the majority of my time."  That future is not what it was - the world is changing, and it is within that context that I would like to address the issue of ongoing leaving certificate reform.</p> <p>Let me tell you about Michael, a sixth year student with a sister, Sarah, in sixth class in primary school.  Before his 50th birthday he will see Brazil, Russia and China rule the world economically.  He has just seen China become the number one English speaking country in the world.  The Chinese economy will overtake the United States before he is 40.  In the time it has taken me to read this sentence, 66 babies have been born in America, 250 in China and 350 in India.  He considers email to be old hat and never uses it.  It is old fashioned.  It is for old fogees like us, because he runs a social network site with thousands of people participating.  He creates his own content on his own YouTube channel.  He does not watch TV.   He is more likely to be TV. </p> <p>  To reach a million users it took radio 38 years.  It took television 13 years.  It took the Internet four years.  However, Facebook had 100 million users in nine months.  That is the accelerated pace of change in Michael's world.  The world's biggest seller of books does not publish books, the world's biggest taxi service does not own any taxis, and the world's biggest distributor of music produces no music.  In this rapidly changing world, the only thing we can be certain of is that the pace of change will never be slower than yesterday, and will never be as slow again as it is today.  As a consequence, schools cannot begin to hope to keep pace with the rate of change, so we have to move our thinking into an area beyond a definitive set of skills to an ability to learn, to unlearn, to re-learn, to problem solve, to adapt to change and to think critically. </p> <p>  Like half the teenage population in America, he can text with his eyes closed.  On his 50th birthday he will be given a cheap laptop that will be more powerful than the combined brainpower of the human race.  He is going to live on average until he is 95. He is going to be running around a beach well into his 80s powered by body parts imported from abroad.  If he leaves school at 18 he will probably have between 70 and 80 jobs.  If he goes to university he will probably have between 18 and 20 jobs.  He is a minimalist, keeping it light.  He needs a mobile phone, a laptop, a change of clothes and a passport, and he is good to go.  Unlike his parents he does not want to own a piece of the world , he just wants to visit it.  He will not talk in terms of a job for life, rather a job for the life of the contract.  He will most likely take his children to a museum.  What will they see?  Paper, pens, desks, blackboards, whiteboards, and perhaps the odd stuffed teacher.  All the information he will need in his life can be fitted onto a 2 in. square tablet.  The pool of employees he is in now is five times greater than it was ten years ago.  That is great news for employers, but it is terrible news for Michael.  He is a democrat, he is passionate about social justice, and is fully aware that education is the great equaliser, the only weapon he has to make his way in the world. </p> <p>  He has a couple of questions for us in terms of leaving certificate reform.  Are we preparing students for a life of tests or for the tests of life?  Are we about teaching them or helping them to become independent self-directed learners with an enhanced ability for independent thought, creative capacity, and critical thinking?  Are we attempting to shoehorn them into an antiquated educational system or fitting the system to them and their evolving needs?  Is the leaving certificate prioritising cognitive ability or multiple intelligences?  Are we about valuing their heads or building their resilient heart muscle?  Is our attention on content or life skills, and as a consequence are we delivering shallow or profound learning?</p> <p>  The answer to those questions will shape the future of Michael's world and his generation.  The stakes are high, but if we get it right, nothing has more scope than education to disrupt poverty and fulfil dreams.  That is worth going to the ramparts for, and brings me here today.  Indeed, it is with a profound sense of humility that I do so, being one of countless colleagues at the coal face, in the greatest and most important profession in the world - serving young people.</p><p>I am also acutely aware that there are many more qualified and more knowledgeable people to come before the committee than I, but I do so, in the interests of a profession that I love, a school, the Patrician secondary, that I am proud to represent, and colleagues I have the highest regard for.</p><p> The best definition of education I have heard is that it is a conversation between one generation and another about what is really important in life.  In my view, there is nothing more important to us as educators or parents than the well-being in the fullest sense of the word, and the educational attainment, of our young people, and their ongoing development as life long learners.  Enhancing their capacity to learn, unlearn and relearn should be central to the reform process, mindful that as parents and educators we are custodians of Ireland's most precious resource: our young people.</p><p> Our collective endeavour and shared vision being to fashion an educational model at senior level that is fit for purpose for the changing needs of the 21st century.  As part of that process we should be scaling up the emotional capacity of young people to cope with tough times and the challenge of change.  The celebrated educationalist Michael Fullan is quoted as saying that change is mandatory, but growth is optional.  Resilience, stress management and emotional intelligence are vital tools and skills to empower young people to not just survive, but thrive in school and in life and to make the most of the myriad of opportunities that are available to this generation of young people and those who will follow in the years to come.</p></speech>

Before I comment on the questions posed by the committee, I would like to explain briefly what the council is and what we do.  The Teaching Council is the statutory professional standards body for teaching in Ireland.  We are responsible for promoting and regulating the profession of teaching under the Teaching Council Acts 2001 to 2015.  Our functions include: advising the Minister for Education and Skills on entry criteria for programmes of initial teacher education, ITE; reviewing and accrediting, as appropriate, all programmes of ITE in the State; induction and probation of newly qualified teachers; maintaining the largest register of professionals in the State.  There are just over 97,000 teachers on the register; vetting of teachers; teachers&rsquo; learning, or continuous professional development, CPD; investigating complaints against teachers under the council&rsquo;s fitness to teach remit; and commissioning research to inform our work and support a research-informed teaching profession.</p> <p>  In the context of those functions, it is worth noting at the outset of our statement that not all the questions posed in the committee&rsquo;s letter of 8 November are equally pertinent to the council&rsquo;s remit.  For that reason, we have decided to respond in broad terms under a number of key headings, which I hope the committee will find helpful.  These are: teachers will play a lead role in curricular reform; reforms of teacher education over the past six years overseen by the Teaching Council are enhancing teachers&rsquo; capacity to engage in, and lead, curricular reform; the ongoing reform of leaving certificate will have implications for teacher education which we in the council and all stakeholders will need to take account of; it will be important to ensure that teachers have sufficient space and time to engage in professional learning that will fully support them in teaching the new curricula and subject specifications that will emerge over time.  </p> <p>  I will come to the first heading in terms of teachers playing a lead role in curricular reform.  Teaching and learning are complex endeavours which take place in an evolving and dynamic context.  Recent decades have seen new understandings and insights emerge in a range of areas, including pedagogy, curriculum, assessment, human learning, early childhood education and teacher education.  In parallel, teachers have found themselves facing a range of new challenges and opportunities in the classroom.  This complexity is intensified by the fact that teaching takes place in a multiplicity of contexts, thereby resulting in a diverse range of needs.  Given these realities, it stands to reason that significant decisions in regard to teaching and learning should be made by teachers, as professionals, who are closest to the site of action and who are committed to the best interests of their pupils and students.</p> <p>  At the same time, it must be acknowledged that teachers are proud of the high quality education system which we have in Ireland, as we all are.  We will need to be reassured that any changes will maintain and enhance the quality of teaching and learning.  In our experience of education reform in the Teaching Council, the challenge is to strike and maintain an appropriate balance between maximising the scope for innovation and professional autonomy on the one hand at the local level, and on the other ensuring that robust and reliable standards continue to underpin the quality of learning experience which all learners experience in our schools and centres of education.  Teachers will be as vigilant as anybody else in that endeavour.</p> <p>  The Teaching Council, therefore, believes that teachers, as leaders of learning, will play a lead role in processes of curricular reform, including the reform of leaving certificate.  Simply put, it is teachers who will teach the syllabi or subject specifications that will emerge through reform of the leaving certificate.  It will be of the utmost importance that their voices are heard, in all their diversity, in ongoing consultation so as to ensure that the shared vision underpinning reform is fully realised.  In terms of the reforms of teacher education reforms that we have overseen over the past six years, they have seen significant change in the quality of education received by teachers in this State.  Under the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; literacy and numeracy strategy, and the council&rsquo;s criteria and guidelines for programmes of ITE, the qualification required to become a teacher was extended to four years at undergraduate level and two years at postgraduate level.</p> <p>  In line with the accreditation criteria established by the council in 2011, all programmes of initial teacher education have also been reconceptualised to allow for a number of innovations, including extended school placement and an increased emphasis on reflective practice and research and inquiry-based learning.  The enhanced programmes which are now in place will support enhanced capacity to develop and adapt curricula and assessment practices in schools.  It is noteworthy, for example, that foundation studies are now a mandatory area of all programmes of initial teacher education, and that "through macro curriculum studies, these areas develop students&rsquo; understanding of, and capacity to critically engage with, curriculum aims, design, policy, reform, pedagogy and assessment."</p></speech>

Business and educators have a shared objective of developing young minds with an appetite for learning and the ability to adapt to what can be an unpredictable future.  Translating these shared aspirations into something more tangible is the major challenge.  Seven years ago, I presented evidence to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on reform of the junior cycle.  At the time, I said:</p><blockquote>IBEC believes that radical reform of junior cycle teaching methods and curriculum content could have a profound impact on education outcomes including the development of critical thinkingand moving away from the dominance of rote learning.  Therefore it should be regarded as a priority area for policy attention and investment. </blockquote> <p>I am telling the committee this for two reasons.  The development of key skills at all levels of the education system has been a priority of business for many years.  Moving from a content based to a more skills based learning model at an early stage is more likely to equip students with 21st century skills we have been hearing about.  I am also highlighting this because it also provides a useful example of how long it takes to implement reform.  The much diluted reforms of the new junior cycle programme will not be finished until autumn 2021, which is a quarter of a century after the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment started its review of the curriculum and assessment methods.  While we welcome the commitments in the action plan for education to review senior cycle programmes, we cannot afford to wait until half way through this century to see the outcomes of this review implemented.<br/><br/>I make this point while acknowledging that education reform necessarily is incremental and necessarily proceeds at a relatively slow pace.  If business brings a new product or service to market and it fails, it can go back to the drawing board.  If an education reform fails, young people&rsquo;s lives are profoundly affected.  However, the need for an innate conservatism should not be used as an excuse for prevarication or the protection of self-interest.  Hopefully, this is a more propitious time for considering reform.  There is a growing acceptance that the dominance of the leaving certificate and the so-called &quot;points race&quot; poses a challenge in terms of what provides the best education experience for all of our young people.<br/><br/>Employers are less concerned about the qualification level than the relevance of job applicants&rsquo; skills.  These can be developed at all levels of education.  Traditionally, Irish society has placed too much value on the traditional academic model of attainment which does not serve all young people well.  People learn in different ways and at different stages of their life.  Therefore, we need a system that provides multiple progression routes and values experiential learning.We have provided the committee with a more detailed submission and responses to some of its questions, as well as some of our initial thinking on the review of the senior cycle programmes.</p><p>We acknowledge some of the recent developments such as the introduction of computer science for the leaving certificate and new specifications for biology, physics and chemistry.  However we need a much more extensive review across all programmes.</p><p> There is much to be learned from our experience with the junior cycle reforms.  The new curriculum, even within its current limitations, sets out to embrace the kind of modern teaching, learning and assessment methods which are overwhelmingly supported by educationalists.  Its key skills and statements of learning are also based on concepts that employers recognise and value.  The success of any reform ultimately depends on what happens in the classroom.  Therefore we recommend an independent review of the implementation challenges encountered during the two most significant, recent, curriculum reform programmes, the new junior cycle and Project Maths.</p><p> I will finish by making a more general comment on the so-called 21st century skills that we have heard about.  In fact, with the possible exception of the most recent information technology development, they existed well before the 21st century and our ancestors have been using them for centuries.  They have become more critical because a greater proportion of the jobs of the present and future rely on them than ever before.  There does not need to be a trade-off between these skills and high-value academic outcomes which I confidently predict will be at the centre of debates around a reformed senior cycle, and this has been touched on in earlier opening statements.  It is possible to teach maths through problem solving or to teach history through critical thinking, and these are the skills that business is looking for.  Standardised tests can be used effectively in conjunction with other assessment methods.  However, in systems such as the leaving certificate, where a few exams can have such as dramatic effect on an individual's educational opportunities and subsequent job prospects, there is not much space for critical thinking or creativity.  For a significant cohort of our young people, this high stakes exam culture also kills the appetite for ongoing learning.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here and look forward to answering its questions.</p></speech>

My name is Sorcha N&iacute; Chonghaile and I am the Oifigeach na Gaeilge with the Irish Second-Level Students&rsquo; Union, ISSU.  The ISSU is the umbrella body for second level students in Ireland.  It raises the concerns of students and campaigns for better quality of education and access.  Students are one of the main stakeholders in education and we work to ensure that the student voice is heard on matters that concern us.<br/><br/>On curriculum reform, it is vital that each subject is reviewed individually.  Subjects like the Irish language in particular require consultation with various partners, including those in sectors that are working in the Irish medium.  Some subjects require urgent reforms, such as the leaving certificate art curriculum which has not been revised since 1972.  The leaving certificate has also become too predictable and, as a result, there is a heavy focus on rote learning. <br/><br/><b></b>On assessment and examination timelines, the ISSU believes that many subjects do not provide enough continuous assessment opportunities and the focus on an end of year exam after a two-year period causes students, teachers and school staff extraordinary stress and anxiety.  Many students suffer from ill health as a result of the workload and stress associated with the course.  The examination timeline is almost cruel as students are assessed on two years' worth of learning in the space of two weeks at the very end.  In the case of illness or family bereavement, there are no opportunities to repeat examinations for a further 12 months.<br/><br/>Our members feel there is a stigma attached to the leaving certificate applied course.  The uptake is extremely low<b><i>.  </i></b>According to the State Examinations Commission the uptake of leaving certificate applied is decreasing, at only 4.7% or 2,773 students in 2017, down from 5% in 2015.  This is a clear indication that the leaving certificate applied does not cater to the needs of our students.  It was imagined as a course that would also support student retention, but how the programme is recognised, credited and valued has proved an issue and, as such, the participation remains low.  This is a shame as there are potentially particular communities where young people are involved in the fishing, agricultural or equine industry that would benefit greatly from a reform of this course.<br/><br/>On learning environments and learning support, a student&rsquo;s success in the leaving certificate often depends on the school in which they are enrolled.  Equity of access to learning support and a high quality learning environment is crucial for a successful leaving certificate result.  Some schools struggle to provide basic elements like access to computers, high-speed broadband or other resources to support a student&rsquo;s learning.  Personal development opportunities should be made available to teachers on digital education to support the increase of technology in the classroom, and schools need to be supported and funded efficiently if there are to be any reforms in the use of technology for the senior cycle course.<br/><br/>On examiners, recruitment and teacher assessments, the ISSU is aware of concerns among teachers that they will be required to assess their own students.  However, for the well-being of second level students in Ireland, there must be a better balance between continuous assessment and exams throughout the two years.  We are also aware of the issues in recruiting examiners. We suggest that graduates of specific subjects be given upskilling opportunities to become examiners to meet the shortages in this sector.  Short courses for graduates of languages, science, etc. could be made available to qualify those who meet the criteria.  This could be a similar model to the Tefl English course which is available online or in part-time learning modules.  Upskilling in this area could also support the development of a regional panel of examiners which could address the issues with recruitment and provide external examiners throughout the year to support teachers with continuous assessments and providing detailed feedback on students&rsquo; performance.<br/><br/>The ISSU believes that a student's health supersedes any grades or points.  Unfortunately, we are in a situation where stories of students falling to ill health, especially mental health, as a result of exam stresses are not uncommon. The fact that many people still experience so-called leaving cert dreams years on is a clue to how traumatic the experience can be.</p></speech>

A module or course on basic life skills is essential.<br/><br/>Trades and apprenticeships should be catered for.  Just 2% of school leavers take up apprenticeships.  Introducing a work-based learning model as a subject to the leaving certificate curriculum can attract more students to these alternative progression pathways.<br/><br/><b></b>There are issues around home-schooled students and distance learning support.  The ISSU believes, however, that the level of support for families that opt to home-school is not sufficient.  Leaving certificate reforms will need to consider the needs of home-schooled students and students who can no longer attend school and provide further online and distance learning support.<br/><br/>There are issues around progression from the junior cycle.  In September 2018, the first group of students from the new junior cycle course will transfer to the senior cycle curriculum.  These pupils must be catered for.<br/><br/>Other issues are the results from PISA, the question of league tables and evaluating our success.  We need to modernise for the 21st century and deal with the over-emphasis in STEM.  The range of foreign language courses available does not equate to the opportunities for students to study their desired language and is completely dependent on the availability of teachers and classroom space.  Native speakers are also at a disadvantage as there are few language courses that meet their needs, particularly with the Irish language.  Language subjects should be taught more for practical use, such as professions in the domains of education, law, and politics.  We need to cater and protect the arts, creative arts and design, languages and philosophy.  To echo the words of our Uachtar&aacute;n, Michael D Higgins, we need to introduce philosophy and ethical reflection to our learning, practising fair argument and respect for differences in our society.</p></speech>

It is only I who will speak.  The National Parents' Council Post-Primary is a voluntary representative body of parents of children in second level education.  I will refer to us as NPCPP.  We are grateful for the committee's invitation and the opportunity to be involved in these discussions on the ongoing reform of the leaving certificate curriculum.  The NPCPP strongly advocates reform of the leaving certificate and welcomes ongoing efforts to evaluate and adjust current practice in assessment methods within the education system in Ireland to prepare students, or perhaps I should say our children, better for further education and their future lives and careers.</p><p>We also recognise the integrity of the leaving certificate examination and the work of the State Examinations Commission in ensuring fairness.</p><p> The NPCPP recognises the success of the revised points system, which has been introduced recently, which is evident even at this early stage of the scheme.  While acknowledging that our education system has produced a broadly better educated population than existed in Ireland some generations ago, the relevance and results of our current methods of delivery and assessment have been called into question.  Many informed commentators highlight the emphasis that the current system has on the requirement to recall information during the course of a single terminal examination.  They suggest that this method is completely inadequate for assessing a pupil's actual knowledge and understanding of a subject.  The methods of delivery and assessment currently used therefore can promote rote learning rather than the acquisition of real knowledge.  Only a small part of the student's overall intellectual ability is tested instead of an assessment of their true depth of knowledge and ability.</p><p> The curriculum should encourage exploration, enable students to discover their own talents and then enable them to develop their strengths in areas of genuine interest.  This would then promote spontaneous growth in their knowledge and enhance their ability to contribute towards these areas in their future lives.  We must heed the concerns of our third level educators and Irish business leaders when they tell us that students exiting the post-primary schools, following completion of the leaving certificate, are poorly prepared for further education and entry into the workforce.  We must also listen to the health professionals.  We must remember that our children are not just fodder for third level institutions or industry.  Along with developing the desire and ability to analyse critically, solve problems and make decisions, we must  teach our children the essential life skills and social values required to function as self-confident and mutually respectful citizens in our society and the multicultural world in which we live today.</p><p> Given the emphasis placed on one single examination at the end of the course, the leaving certificate and the current points system apply significant stress during what are already difficult years in our teenagers' lives.  Through focusing on the development of a student's ability and interests, our education system can create self-motivated thinkers who learn and enjoy the benefits of discovery through research and evaluation in an environment that they can enjoy.</p><p> The leaving certificate curriculum should provide the facility and stimuli to promote curiosity, interest, analysis and critical thought.  It should have a focus on studying to learn for the sake of knowledge itself.  This will broaden the mind of students and empower them to progress in their own lives and will better prepare them for the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p> The National Parents Council Post-Primary, NPCPP, acknowledges that some changes have been made to facilitate students better in the way in which they learn and the relevancy of the curriculum.  The leaving certificate applied and Project Maths are examples of this.  The recent development of computer science as a subject is also welcome.  While welcoming changes made to suit students better we have received many calls relating to these changes which indicate concern that once introduced, these new courses or subjects have been left to flounder without any real ongoing evaluation.  When changes are made, ongoing monitoring and evaluation must form part of their introduction and implementation.  This must be undertaken with a core focus on the students and how we can best serve their learning process.</p><p> Concerns about the leaving certificate have been raised and discussed for more than a decade.  In 2011, following years of consultation with all stakeholders, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, introduced its original proposals to begin the reform of secondary education with the introduction of the junior cycle.  This change was very broadly welcomed, but that happened six years ago - a complete post-primary school cycle for a child - and we are still awaiting full roll-out of the same.  All constituents in the education system, Government, parents, teachers and schools, must work together to provide the education required to prepare children properly for their future lives.  It is our collective responsibility and we are currently falling short in that duty.  We all need to address this matter with the level of urgency and co-operation it demands.  We look forward to continuing to participate in this process and we are committed to assisting as best we can to ensure that we have an education system that is fully fit for purpose and best serves our children.</p></speech>

The Department of Education and Skills, together with colleagues from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, have provided a joint written submission to the committee.  We felt it appropriate to make a single opening statement, but my colleagues from SEC and the NCCA will be happy to speak separately, answering any questions that are raised.</p> <p>  I thank the contributors who have spoken for expressing their views, as this has provided some very useful information to inform our thinking in this matter.  Our submission sets out developments in reforms at senior cycle level, otherwise known as the leaving certificate, including developments in the area of assessment, as well as providing views on a number of particular issues that the committee asked us to consider.  I therefore will make only a short opening statement.</p> <p>  Reform activity in the leaving certificate can be seen as having three strands, covering the short term and moving to the longer-term spectrum.  There has been the process of reviewing the existing subject specifications to take account, for example, of the need to update various elements of these specifications to reflect developments since they were first introduced.</p> <p>  Alternatively, revisions may take place to introduce new assessment components for subjects.  Our written submission provides details of these revisions.  Specifications for some new subjects are also being prioritised for development.  This helps to ensure that curriculum development continues to respond to the changing needs of learners, society and the economy and also increases subject choice for students.  Such examples include the new politics and society subject which has been in the process of being implemented in schools on a phased basis from September 2016.  A contributor mentioned the new computer science subject, which is being progressed for phased implementation from September 2018, while a new examinable syllabus for leaving certificate physical education will also be rolled out to schools.  In parallel, a non-examinable physical education framework will also be rolled out.</p> <p>  In the longer term, the NCCA has recently commenced an overall review of senior cycle programmes.  This review includes the leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, the leaving certificate applied as well as vocational pathways in the senior cycle.  The review will seek to build on the strengths of the current system towards a senior cycle where greater emphasis is placed on the balance between the acquisition of skills and knowledge, on learners taking more responsibility for their own learning, and on enhancing the learning culture and environment in schools.  A public discussion and consultation process will take place as part of this review during 2018.</p> <p>  Implementing these various elements of reform activity must take account of the needs of schools to continue to deliver a senior cycle programme to the existing student cohorts and of the overall capacity of schools and the wider education system to manage the impact of change.  There is a significant change agenda ongoing in the education system.</p> <p>  The process of senior cycle reform has identified a number of challenges and opportunities for the Department, the NCCA, the SEC and other education partners, including those present today.  That needs to be addressed as the journey of reform continues.  There are many stakeholders in the education system and this is one of the reasons that reform comes dropping more slowly than what people ideally want.  Some of the challenges and opportunities that arose are included in the issues that have been set out by members of the committee today, which we sought to address in our written submission.  We are happy to discuss these further today.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I was aware of that.  The officials will have an opportunity to respond afterwards.</p> <p>  I need not have been as strict about allowing each speaker five minutes, so I apologise to the speakers who I interrupted.  I became befuddled by the large number of people in the room.</p><p>We will go to the members now but I thank everybody for their opening statements and submissions.  There are certainly some common themes.  We acknowledge that teachers are the agents of change but it is important to have student input without a shadow of a doubt.  Skills are the global currency of the 21st century and we undoubtedly need to develop the whole area of critical thinking and problem-solving skills among our young people.  It is interesting to note the request for the possibility of being able to repeat the leaving certificate for those who have suffered bereavement or illness.  This is certainly an important issue.  The Committee on Public Petitions recently received a petition that another 30 minutes should be added on to the leaving certificate English exam.  I wanted to mention that as this committee also received correspondence on it.</p><p> I call Deputy Thomas Byrne.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#J00200"><p>An incredible range of views has been put forward by the various witnesses appearing here from a wide range of sectors and it is very helpful to the work we do.  I may not go into everybody's individual contribution, but there are a number of common threads.  One is that we must emphasise skills-based rather than knowledge-based learning.  Do the witnesses have views on the fact that the acquisition of knowledge is also important in itself?  Are we at times losing sight of this and putting too much emphasis on the acquisition of skills?  I know that we can all get to access to knowledge ourselves and that we can get the skills to access that knowledge.  Is it important still that a bedrock of knowledge is  imparted to our children, despite all the talk of skills and showing people how to make their way in the modern world?  I would be interested to hear contrarian views on this.</p> <p>  I would like to ask Mr. O'Rourke some questions about the Teaching Council.  What impact is the current teacher shortage having on the curricula and on the leaving certificate?  I am hearing, for example, that it is actually becoming very difficult to keep Irish as a compulsory subject due to a severe lack of teachers.  Is there a problem there that will impact on the curriculum generally but particularly with regard to the leaving certificate?  At present, we do not currently have a match between the requirements in certain subjects and the teachers we are educating.  It seems quite random in that anyone with a degree can go on to do the teaching qualification without reference to any requirements that the State might have for a large number of science teachers or Irish teachers.  What is happening is that there are too few teachers in some areas and too many in others.  How is that affecting the curriculum and the leaving certificate at present?</p> <p>  I thank Ms Sorcha N&iacute; Chonghaile for raising an exceptionally wide range of issues.  The Chairman has already noted her point on repeat exams.  She also mentioned broadband.  Do any other witnesses, particularly those from the Department, have any comments to make on the impact of the lack of broadband?  I know that there was a programme to give second level schools access to broadband, but is this a problem the Department sees at primary level?  It is a major problem all around rural Ireland.</p> <p>  I agree with the points made about the teaching of philosophy and this is something that Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann has also highlighted as very important.  Philosophy is a compulsory subject in the European baccalaureate, but it is not on the Irish leaving certificate.  Have any of the witnesses looked at the European baccalaureate?  I would be interested to hear any views as to whether we should or should not be looking to it for inspiration or guidance as we undertake reform.</p> <p>  Issues have been raised in the media recently about the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  Without going into specific allegations, it has been suggested that there are difficulties in that organisation that are affecting its work and affecting curriculum development.  I would like to check with the Chairman if I can ask questions about whether-----</p></speech>

It is 30 years since I did my leaving certificate but I still remember it very clearly.  I am not sure if the matric is still there but it was certainly there when I did my leaving certificate.  We had the leaving certificate and then we had the matric immediately afterwards.  Stress was not such a big issue in my day, but it is for students now.  Schools are themselves under pressure to get the right exam results and this consequently goes onto the children and the parents.  What can we do in a general way to help reduce the stress on students?  How can we help them realise that it is not the end of the world if they do not get the results they want and there is life after the leaving certificate?</p> <p>  Regarding the leaving certificate applied, Ms N&iacute; Chonghaile raised an important issue here about the uptake of this exam and the content of its modules.  Deputy Byrne mentioned the NCAA in a different context.  I know that it is carrying out a review on this matter, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is compiling a discussion paper which will inform a review of the senior cycle system and will look at some of these issues.  I would also like to ask about bonus points for subjects like maths.  Has this actually encouraged students to take up the subject?  If this is the case, could we use it to incentivise students to take up other subjects?  Could we consider it for other subjects?  Could we also consider incorporating global trends, for example, east Asian economics or languages in the leaving certificate?  I did a degree in languages myself before I did law and I know that we are very short in this country on foreign language speakers.  This is something I would like to see addressed more proactively in schools, so perhaps one of the witnesses could talk about this.</p></speech>

I would like to talk about this in general and perhaps pick up first on the point made by Mr. Donohoe and others about the slow pace of change.  This is a real concern for me.  Obviously, I have experience of trying to deal with the slow pace of change and I spent many hours sitting across the table from education stakeholders.  I am absolutely convinced that we need to change and move to things like classroom-based assessment and skills-based learning.  We need to assess young people on the basis of something other than a three-hour exam in each subject after a two-year cycle.  We need systems that match the modern world and match higher education.  How can we now move on?  When it comes to junior cycle reform, the train has already left the station and teachers are now working on different forms of assessment other than simply memorising and regurgitating material in written exams.  This is very welcome.</p> <p>  My next question is a general one for whoever would like to answer it, particularly the representatives from the Department, the NCCA and perhaps the ISSI.  Ms N&iacute; Chonghaile pointed out in her statement that learning models in the senior cycle will need to complement the learning modules experienced in the junior cycle.  How do we move it on?  We have made a start in the junior cycle and I think it inevitable that this will translate up into senior cycle.  How do make it speedier?  The curriculum reforms mentioned in computer science and in politics and society, for example, have been in gestation for several years now.  I have not been on this committee for very long so I do not know whether it is planned to bring in the teaching unions and management bodies on this issue, but they are essential to progress and to moving on the agenda.  Everybody in this room is agreed that we need to move towards the reforms outlined here, but making it actually happen is what really concerns me.</p><p>I am interested in hearing from any of the delegates who has a view on how we can make reform of the leaving certificate cycle quicker and how we can bring others along with us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#K00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their statements and submissions.  My first question is for the departmental officials.  </p> <p>  While I welcome the reform, changes and new developments in respect of physical education, I have questions.  This is not the first time I have raised the matter at the committee.  There are schools which do not have a PE hall, including one in my constituency which has not had one for 37 years.  I do not know, therefore, how the manner in which the rolling out of that subject as part of the leaving certificate programme will be fair and equitable.  It is like saying to students taking music as a subject to leaving certificate level that all of the necessary resources will be provided but that when it rains, they will not have access to instruments, that they will not be able to play music and that they will not have music manuscripts.  I do not know how that could be considered fair.  Every school should have the same facilities and all students should have equal access.</p> <p>  It has come to my attention that there are schools in which there are more students who are exempt from taking Irish in the leaving certificate examinations - up to 32 in one classroom -  than who are who taking it.  What are the guidelines in that regard as it is not fair on either teacher or students?  There can be a range of academic abilities in a class comprising 32 students, some of whom may have a requirement for special needs assistance which is not available because assistance is being provided in the classroom in which Irish is being taught.  A teacher can be dealing with students ranging from A level to those with special needs to those coping with a language barrier and need assistance.  Are there plans to address these issues in the leaving certificate reform programme? </p> <p>  There is a worrying trend with respect to the leaving certificate applied programme.  Schools are opting out of offering the programme because it is not considered to be as attractive as the leaving certificate programme and also because it is not considered to attract the right type of student.  How does the Department intend to tackle that issue?  It must be brought to attention that on the day the leaving certificate examination results are issued students who have completed the leaving certificate applied programme are often overlooked and not interviewed.  No spotlight is put on students who have spent two years doing their utmost to do well in aiming to achieve the distinction of passing the leaving certificate applied examinations.</p> <p>  Why will the review of the leaving certificate applied programme only include English and communications, mathematical applications and ICT?  What about the subjects of music, the arts, languages, leisure and recreation and hotel and catering?  Why are not they not included?  Is it only the module descriptor that is included?  Does that mean that there will still be key assignments to be completed?  At the end of sixth year, as the departmental officials and, I am sure, everyone here know, the teachers are told to hold on to the key assignments completed until the end of September.  How often have they been inspected?  I know of a school in which never once have the key assignments completed by any child been inspected and this provision has been in place since the mid-1990s.  With the module descriptor, there is a tendency for the teacher and the child to move to the key assignments and make sure they are completed, sometimes without critical thinking, and tick the appropriate box.  One may find a few students have done the exact same work in the key assignments.  It is a question of getting over the line.  What about the practical achievements which are key elements of the leaving certificate applied programme?  Why is that matter not being reviewed by the NCCA?</p> <p>  What information is given to students on the leaving certificate applied programme when it comes to choosing it?  What information on and encouragement to participate in apprencticeships are given to students?  Is it sporadic and does it depend on the career guidance teacher or the school?  The statistic which shows that there has been a 2% take-up is frightening.  </p> <p>  My final question is for the Department or the parent' council. Those students who have followed the new junior cycle programme have followed a different type of course as part of which they have embraced critical thinking, but to take English as an example, they will now move to learn by rote.  What supports are in place for them?  It is a leap into a different type of learning process because the reforms will not be implemented in time for them.  In 2018 what supports will be in place for them to make the transition?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hammond" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#K00400"><p>I join Mr. Moran in welcoming the various contributions that have been made.  They are extremely rich and valuable in looking at the broad question of senior cycle reform and the advent of a review.  I might pick up on two or three of the issues which have been raised.  So many issues have been raised that I would love to spend the entire evening going through some of them.</p> <p>  On the leaving certificate applied programme, as has been indicated, we have commenced some work on specific modules.  The reason is they are regarded as having priority as particular difficulties have arisen, particularly as regards modernisation.  It is not the case, as has been suggested, that there are other aspects of the leaving certificate applied programme that do not need review; it is simply a starting point.  However, we argue that the main focus of attention should be on the review of the broader senior cycle programme, part of which would end up looking at the various senior cycle programmes and how well they fit together.  There is no doubt, as we have heard, that the leaving certificate applied programme has had great successes.  It meets a need and seems to work extremely well.  It is a good quality programme.  According to the ESRI which has done some work for us on it, the teaching associated with it and the learning experiences of students seem to have been well received.  There is also a very good focus on skills and competencies.  The weaknesses seem to be in the outcomes on leaving school, given that students sometimes have a pattern of unemployment in the labour market.  There has always been a question with the leaving certificate applied programme and it is one that will have to be examined in the senior cycle review as to whether it should be ringfenced.  There is also the question as to whether it is essentially a stand-alone programme which ends up reproducing social inequality and a stereotyping of leaving certificate applied programme students, to which a number of people have referred.  The senior cycle review will have to look at the successes and the weaknesses and make some decisions on the future focus of the leaving certificate applied programme.</p> <p>  I mention in passing the senior cycle review, to which my colleague has referred.  It represents an ideal basis for the work of the committee to find a voice and expression.  The main areas on which it will focus are the overall identity and purposes of the senior cycle education programme.  We know, as have heard this afternoon, that the senior cycle programme has many strengths, but we also know that it needs to be radically improved for those students whom it currently does not serve well.</p><p> There is the big question, and it has been raised this afternoon, of the degree to which a reformed senior cycle should establish continuity and progression with the kinds of reforms and changes that have taken place at junior cycle.  It needs to examine the range of learning programmes and pathways available currently within senior cycle and whether we should look more closely at vocationally orientated pathways within the senior cycle programme for those students who are less academically orientated.  The question of flexibility and choice for schools, and autonomy for schools and for students in terms of the choices they make, and the alignment of key skills with the needs of students are major questions that will emerge within the senior cycle review.  We have been generating and commissioning international research to look at what is happening in other countries in regard to their upper secondary education systems.  That paper will be the basis of a conference early in the new year, which will represent a starting point from the NCCA's perspective for real discussion around senior cycle review.</p><p> The last point I might take up at this stage is the one about pace in terms of the question of reform and the perceived lack of speed regarding reform.  It is important to mention that when we talk about educational change, there are different elements to it.  There is a developmental phase in which bodies like the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, are directly involved.  There is the introduction of the change within the system which involves a wider audience.  The longest phase of all is the actual realisation of the change within the classroom.  When people talk about a 20 or 30 year period, it sounds like an incredibly long time, and it is, but the developmental phase might have taken two or three years.  The implementation of it might have taken four or five years and it is generally reckoned that for a curriculum innovation to embed effectively within the system in terms of the teaching and learning students experience in the classroom that it can take up to seven or eight years.  It is important to bear in mind that all of those points and issues feed into the whole question of pace.</p><p> We had an experience recently of significant reform at a significant level in the junior cycle.  One of the things we have learned is the importance of communication in terms of getting buy-in from parents and stakeholders regarding the nature and purpose of the change and the commitment to that change.</p><p> In terms of the question of capacity building, many people say, when they look at the junior cycle reforms now, that we might have needed a capacity building phase before introducing the reforms.  That is certainly something that could be looked at in a senior cycle context.  There are many questions surrounding implementation arrangements and the involvement of the stakeholders.  One of the Deputies has already referred to the need to bring each of the stakeholders on board for the kind of change involved in order for the change to be introduced smoothly.  They are among the factors that are involved in what is a very complex process of generating curriculum change and ensuring that it is actually experienced at the level of the child.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#L00300"><p>I want to respond to the question about stress.  It would be my view, and I think other people said it, that reducing the emphasis on the terminal examination after two years would be the ideal way to reduce stress and move to a process where we have examinations and continuous assessment that are assessed throughout the senior cycle or prior to it.</p> <p>  We talk about the outcomes of the leaving certificate applied.  The positive outcome of the leaving certificate applied is that the students are less stressed.  The negative outcome is that they are not employable but the positive outcome is that they are less stressed.  The students are in a curriculum that is focused on development skills and that is pre-vocational so there is some learning to be had from the ESRI report in terms of the content of the curriculum, how it is delivered in the leaving certificate applied and how that can be transferred over to the leaving certificate academic track.  Stress can be reduced by including a skills-based focus.</p> <p>  The other response I wanted to make was on the question of whether knowledge is out the window, so to speak, now.  Knowledge and skills go well together and if teachers are given the opportunity to develop the curriculum they are currently delivering and are supported to do that in a creative way we can keep the knowledge our education system is renowned for and deliver it in ways that make students more skilled and suitable for the employment market into which they are moving.  I would be an advocate of knowledge but knowledge and skills can mesh very well together.  There are excellent models being employed in Ireland and internationally where there is a combination of knowledge and skills.  It is about resource and support across the education system.  Teachers we have worked with in the project I have worked on want a change.  There is a desire to change but when it is imposed upon them and there is lack of support in terms of broadband, technology and time away from the classroom to immerse themselves in this change, it will be challenging.  Knowledge and skills are one, and it should remain that way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Donohoe" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#L00400"><p>I was going to take that question from Deputy Thomas Byrne but Dr. O'Sullivan has described it very well.  It is not that we are emphasising one over the other.  It is just that the system as it stands puts a huge emphasis on recall of knowledge.  There is an old truism in education policy about the assessment tail wagging the curriculum dog, and that is what tends to happen.  It has an influence on teaching practice and what is valued in the classroom.</p> <p>  In terms of the baccalaureates, I have not seen any objective assessments of it but I have heard within higher education that people who have come through the baccalaureates perform well.  They are more liable to be strong, independent learners than people who might have gone to cramming schools in particular and might have performed well on the points but struggle when they get into higher education, whereas the baccalaureates provides a more rounded educational experience.</p> <p>  I will take some of Deputy Madigan's questions.  On whether bonus points for mathematics worked, it definitely worked up to a point as it has almost doubled the percentage of people opting for the higher level paper.  Has it improved mathematics standards?  Probably not, and it was never designed to do that.  Approximately 15% of young people take the higher level mathematics papers.  By way of comparison, for English it is nearer to 70%, so there was a perception that mathematics was very difficult.  It probably is but it was to incentivise people to take up the subject and also to compensate them for the huge amount of work that went into it.  Those of us who advocated for this did not believe it would improve standards.  Teaching and curriculum, like all education policies, is down to two fairly simple elements, namely, what we teach and how we teach it.  It was around improving the competency of mathematics teachers, many of whom were out of field, in other words, they might have done mathematics as an element of another subject such as commerce, so it is important to develop their skills on which there was a lot of work.</p> <p>  There was also Project Maths, which was a very ambitious curriculum reform.</p><p>It will be formally evaluated now; it has just gone through the complete cycle.  From a business point of view, it was conceptually the right way to go because it located maths in context.  Project maths puts a huge emphasis on problem-solving.</p><p> At all levels of the education system, I find languages to be the most intractable education policy challenge.  I cannot think of anything that is more difficult to address.  Ireland is an anglophone country.  We will have to address the issue for a lot of reasons.  We have never really developed an indigenous business sector and have tended to rely on foreign direct investment.  That is because businesses tended not to look too far beyond the UK when it came to exporting.  Brexit could change that.  It will not change it overnight but we will have to diversify markets and language acquisition and cultural awareness will be an important part of that.  We have been waiting years for a languages strategy from the Department.  We tend to look at languages in a very piecemeal way.  The committee asked what languages we should be learning.  That is always an issue.  I remember about 30 years ago trying to persuade the Government that we should be teaching Japanese.  It was put on the curriculum.  The Japanese economy went down the tubes at the time but it is still on the curriculum.  I have included in my submission some of the considerations that might inform the choice of languages.  The important point is to look at the connections between languages.  There is an idea that if one learns a language, it is easier to learn a second.  There are missed opportunities regarding Irish.  We could have another debate about Irish and its place on the curriculum.  There is a missed opportunity there.  The way we teach languages is not optimal.  It is a challenge with which every English-speaking country struggles.</p></speech>

On Tuesday, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, released the So, How Was School Today? report.  The levels of acute anxiety among girls is at 79% and among boys it is 67%.  We need to put a focus on well-being.  The chief of staff of the OECD, Gabriela Ramos, recently said if one feels good, one learns better and that there is a crucial connection between well-being, belonging and achievement.  It is something of a concern.</p> <p>  I have consulted colleagues on the issue of languages and they are of the view there are huge difficulties with procuring teachers to teach languages.  There was a concern that introducing more languages at upper secondary level was not appropriate and that we should be beginning earlier in the system.  How we go about teaching those languages is also an issue.</p> <p>  They were the two issues that were coming up.  I echo the concerns about the levels of anxiety.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#M00300"><p>Mr. Doran will be pleased to hear that in the next part of our meeting we will be dealing with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and the So, How Was School Today? report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sorcha N&iacute; Chonghaile" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#M00400"><p>I will address a number of issues.  First is the issue of knowledge-based learning.  To learn, one requires the skills to absorb the knowledge and use it correctly.  We cannot say that we need to have loads of knowledge but then have zero ability to problem-solve.  What is the point of the knowledge without the skills to apply it?</p> <p>  Broadband is the second issue.  I appreciate that the committee has acknowledged the difficulties, even in primary schools.  A lot more secondary schools are now rolling out the use of iPads in the junior cycle and we would prefer if they were also available for the leaving certificate cycle.  The issue is if schools do not have access to broadband, what use is the iPad or the use of a laptop or computer room?</p> <p>  The next issue is philosophy.  As a subject, philosophy would be ideal because it would encourage ethical reflection and greater diversity among students.  There are elements of it covered within the exam religion course but the level of take-up is severely low.  I know many students who sat it but it is not a widely rolled out subject.  Not many schools offer it.  Offering a subject entirely based on philosophy and ethical reflection would be ideal.</p> <p>  Bonus points are a great incentive for students.  There are students who take up higher maths just to pass it to get the extra points.  It is helpful.  It is a nice incentive because the course is extremely difficult and arduous.  It might be an option to introduce it to other subjects that have a very high workload.</p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to junior certificate English students who will be entering the rote-based leaving certificate English course.  They will not be prepared for it because they have not come from a rote-learning background.  That needs to be addressed urgently because they will have to sit the leaving certificate in 2019 or 2020.  They will really struggle through it.  They will be coming into fifth year next year with all of these books in front of them and they will be given the information, told to learn it and regurgitate it in an exam.  They will have to face that.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin mentioned that there are more exemptions from studying Irish than students taking the course.  It also needs to be understood that within a classroom of perhaps 30 students who are studying the Irish language curriculum, there are students who are fluent and students with only very basic Irish.  That needs to be addressed.  It would be ideal if the committee would take a further look at the matter.</p> <p>  A question was asked about what information we are given regarding leaving certificate applied in schools.  It varies from school to school.  There is no one answer to that question.  Some schools will offer the leaving certificate applied course and their guidance counsellor will be brilliant at giving that information.  Some schools will offer the course but their guidance counsellors will not give us much information.  There are also schools that do not offer the leaving certificate applied course.  However, the guidance counsellor, principal, deputy principal or teachers could be telling students to go and sit it elsewhere.  There is evidence of that happening in Dublin.  There are students who are moving school to sit the leaving certificate applied course.  There are also schools that do not offer it and do not tell their students it is an option elsewhere because they do not want to lose students.  The other thing that was mentioned was that it does not make the school look attractive.  No student chooses to go to a particular school.  It is up to parents to choose the school and if the school had a wider range of areas to study, including the leaving certificate applied, leaving certificate vocational programme, and also the established leaving certificate, it would be a lot more welcoming to students and parents.  We need to give the information to students.  There is an issue with guidance counselling and the fact there is no direct information being offered.</p> <p>  Somebody mentioned physical education.  Some schools do not have gym halls.  In some of our member schools, students are walking ten or 15 minutes to get to another school for physical education.  If the committee is looking at offering it as a subject in a revised leaving certificate setting, every school will have to have the facilities.  Students will want to sit the exam but they cannot if there is no way for them to do so.</p> <p>  All leaving certificate change requires that subjects to be offered to students.  There is no point in saying we should offer 101 subjects but not make them available to students.</p></speech>

Four witnesses have indicated that they want to contribute.  They should be brief in their contributions.  We will be going back to members for questions and there will be an opportunity to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Moran" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#M00600"><p>I will be very brief.  Mr. Doran has already spoken about the leaving certificate applied so I will not refer to it.  On the bonus points for maths, as colleagues mentioned, the percentage taking higher level maths in the 2017 leaving certificate is 30%, which is almost a doubling of what it was a number of years ago and which meets the targets set in the literacy and numeracy strategy.  To that extent, it has been a success.</p><p> After what Mr. Donohoe said about Japanese, I am nearly afraid to say it but the foreign languages strategy, which is to be published shortly, will see the introduction of Mandarin Chinese as a leaving certificate subject.  I hope the Chinese economy does not go down the tubes as a result.  The languages strategy will contain a number of other measures to try to increase the uptake of languages in classrooms.  It will also contain measures to address the acknowledged issue on the number of teachers.  We also propose to introduce a number of other curricular language subjects at leaving certificate level.</p><p> Within the next few weeks, the new STEM policy statement for education will also be introduced.  This will seek to identify a number of measures to improve the uptake of STEM subjects in schools, particularly by girls, which is identified as a problem.</p><p> I will make a general point on the concerns expressed about an excess focus on skills or marketisation in our reforms at senior cycle.  The Department and the education partners in general are cognisant of the need to avoid producing students who will just go into the city or even leave the city.  It is important to mention that the development in recent years of specifications for leaving certificate subjects requires the identification of a number of skills areas.  The specification must cover a number of skills areas.  Students must be literate and able to manage themselves and stay well.  They must be able to manage information and thinking and they must be numerate, creative and able to work with others and communicate.  That broad range of skills was identified by a range of education partners as the essential skills for developing students with a rounded education following senior cycles and the views of business interests and educationalists on these skills were congruent.  It was recognised that generic skills such as those mentioned should be prioritised over more specific employment-related or business-related skills.  That is an important point to make.</p><p> On school facilities and access to broadband, it is acknowledged that not all schools have the same facilities as others.  The Department makes grants available to schools to assist them in developing their infrastructure.  The digital strategy for schools has a fund of &euro;420 million which schools can access.  The Department is not suggesting it is a panacea for all.  However, it is recognised that some schools need those resources.  One of the issues to be examined in terms of the introduction of leaving certificate physical education, PE, relates to ensuring that adequate infrastructure is in place for schools to provide the subject.  </p><p> I do not know the full detail of it but the issue of Irish exemptions is currently being examined in the Department.  The issues that were identified are some of those that are being examined.</p></speech>

In the reform of the leaving certificate, we cannot continue with a one-size-fits-all approach.  We need to serve all our students.  The leaving certificate applied needs to be reformed but it can be brilliant.  Some students excel in it.  It suits them.  To avoid a  one-size-fits-all approach, has the Department considered making it compulsory that all schools would offer the leaving certificate applied?</p></speech>

However, it is felt that the leaving certificate applied's future will be more adequately and appropriately addressed in the context of the wider reforms of the senior cycle.  No one is suggesting that there is not a place for a programme such as the leaving certificate applied.  While the numbers are low, they are steady.  It is offered by approximately one third of schools and schools are encouraged to offer it.  It is being looked at in the context of the wider review.  However, there is no suggestion that there is no place for the leaving certificate applied.</p></speech>

No one is saying that there is not a place for the leaving certificate applied.  The problem is that due to league tables, certain schools are not offering it to their students because they feel they can shed them to other schools.  It is definitely an epidemic in Dublin.  Schools are recommending to students to go to a school down the road which offers the leaving certificate applied because it would suit their needs because they are concentrating on the league tables and how they can excel and have that published in the national newspapers.  This not fair on students.  With respect, I encourage the Department to consider making it compulsory in order to stop that trend because that is where the stigma lies.  As it stands, we are allowing schools to not offer that subject and therefore not serve all students equally.</p></speech>

It would also be interesting to see if there is a correlation between that approach and the attrition rate after first year in third level universities and colleges.</p> <p>  It has also been mentioned to us on a number of occasions that rechecks of leaving certificate papers can often be as late as October or November, which is too late for students intending to go on to third level.  It would be good to see if we could prioritise the checking of papers of those who were only a couple of points off getting their first or second preference in university.  Rechecks are often carried out where people have got their first preference and those could be put further down the priority list.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin spoke about the day on which the leaving certificate results come out.  I have also often thought that it glorifies those who have achieved high points but it ignores all the other areas of achievement where schools and their students have been successful.  The points do not highlight or measure that a school may have worked miracles by giving a child the confidence he or she needed to go out in the world.  The points system and progression to third level do not highlight these or, as has been touched on a number of times, the number of children doing the leaving certificate applied and those who go on to do apprenticeships and post-leaving certificate courses.  These are equally valuable avenues in career development. </p> <p>  It was interesting that the area of broadband was raised, which does highlight the digital divide that occurs.  It was mentioned here in the context of schools but it is equally a problem for families in their houses, especially in rural areas of Ireland.  It is not just about the school having access to broadband.  For example, I live in a rural area of County Donegal where I get a speed of 500 Kbps yet my elderly mother, who lives in Donegal town, gets 50 Mbps.  There is a digital divide.</p></speech>

I call Mr. Farrell from the State Examinations Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Farrell" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#N00900"><p>We have had a really interesting debate this afternoon on knowledge acquisition, skill development etc.  in terms of the leaving certificate.  Phrases such as "rote learning", "memorisation" and so on have been used and they are used regularly when discussing the leaving certificate.  When one considers the leaving certificate examination, its core purpose is to assess in the individual examinations the extent to which each and every student has met the objectives of the particular subject.  There is a range of elements in every curriculum which must be tested in the examination system.  The most basic of those is knowledge.  After a three-year programme of study at junior cycle or a two-year programme of study at senior cycle, students will have engaged with a subject and it is quite reasonable to expect that they will have acquired a body of knowledge in respect of that particular area of study.</p><p>In and of itself, it is important but also in terms of actually looking at the other requirements of the particular syllabus because without a body of knowledge to start with, it is very difficult to ask students to show that they understand it, can apply it or can bring analytical thinking or synthesis skills to it.  One needs it in the first instance to be able to show that one has acquired some knowledge and then to be able to apply it.</p><p> It is probably fair to say that it is a poor enough examination if it rewards students who can learn off reams of material beforehand which can simply be replicated on the day of the exam.  It is not a great examination if students do really well as a result of doing that.  In the leaving certificate examination, however, the questions are framed in such a way as to force students to show that they understand, can apply and bring the higher order skills to bear.  I am saying that based on some independent research that was undertaken a number of years ago by the University of Oxford and Queen's University in Belfast.  Researchers reviewed the syllabi for six subjects in depth.  They looked at the syllabi, the examination papers over a period of ten years in a row and the exam materials, that is, the scripts completed by candidates in those six subjects in one year.  They then did something which had not been done internationally previously.  They engaged with over 1,000 students and then with focus groups of both teachers and students to find out how they prepared for the exams, how that preparation matched up with what happened in the exam hall and ultimately, what the results were like.  The researchers found that students who focused too narrowly in terms of preparing for the exam, in other words, those who believed they knew what would come up in the exam and that they could ignore elements of the syllabus completely, did less well.  The research also showed that our teachers believe that it is not possible for students to achieve very high marks in the leaving certificate without showing the higher order thinking skills that everybody is talking about and which are considered very important in the modern world.  The research team concluded that predictability in the leaving certificate is not a problem.  </p><p> The leaving certificate is an important examination and nobody can gainsay that.  It is important in and of itself because students are obviously completing their second level education at that point but it is also important in terms of selection for third level.  That makes it the ultimate high stakes examination.  Students, their teachers and their parents will focus really strategically in terms of preparing for the examination.  Students will, quite rightly, use the material that is available to them.  They will look at past papers, marking schemes, sample answers and so on, in the course of their preparation.  That is a perfectly rational and understandable thing to do.  Anyone who has ever gone for a job interview or for promotion will prepare for it in advance.  Students are asked in the examination for that mix of knowledge, which is an important building block in any subject, and the associated higher order skills which are also important in a modern economy.  The report itself is testimony to the strengths of the leaving certificate system.  </p><p> I might just pick up on one point made by another contributors this afternoon with regard to students progressing from the new junior cycle English programme on to the leaving certificate.  Undoubtedly, this is something that was in the minds of the NCCA when the programme itself was being designed and also, in terms of ourselves when the assessment for junior cycle was being designed.  I am in absolutely no doubt that the space for progression is there.  Our sense is that across all of the assessment modalities that exist in junior cycle English, between the classroom based assessments, the feedback from teachers, other assessments at school level and the examination itself, students who perform at the top end of the higher level junior cycle examination are well fit to progress to higher level English at leaving certificate.  I might also add that English was one of the subjects that the independent researchers looked at when they were looking at the predictability issue but they did not identify any problem around English.  As independent reviewers of our system, they did not believe that rote learning or inappropriate learning are at the core of studying leaving certificate English or in the actual examination.</p></speech>

I understand that up to 17% of pupils in our schools are new Irish.  Many of these students, as we know from our involvement in seminars with Maynooth University, are trying to fit into the Irish education system.  We are trying to measure how they go through the Irish system but that system has one of the biggest infusions of new thinking and new ideas, whether that be Arabic, Latvian, Estonian or Polish culture and we should be looking at that very carefully to ensure that we do not try to just fit them in.  We should be looking at this in the wider context because this is an opportunity for us, as an island, to reach out and we should be looking at our curriculum in that context.</p> <p>  The second point I would like to make relates to the speed of change which was referred to earlier.  Everyone is agreed on the speed of change but we in the NPC would be very much aware that when we go through periods of change, we seem to come up against innumerable blockages, whether they are based on discussions around remuneration or other issues.  I am not going to get into that now but I would point out that it is a major block to progress and it is our students, our children, who are the ones who cannot move through.  We are trying to benchmark internationally and that is not good for Ireland.</p> <p>  My final point is on eclectic education.  While there should be an emphasis on STEM, when we look at why software is good in this country, it can also be connected to language skills.  STEM is very good and it is great to see diversity and women coming through in that area but we must not neglect the arts.</p></speech>

I read through Mr. Doran's statement before the meeting.  His vision is exactly what we need in terms of our education system, particularly with regard to self belief and resilience.  If students are not in the right frame of mind or are not feeling confident in themselves, they will never learn.  In such circumstances, it does not matter how many grinds they can access.  There is so much anxiety, low self esteem and mental health difficulties among pupils at both primary and secondary level.  Difficulties can start at a very young age and the main problem is the one size fits all approach.  I hated every day of secondary school.  I literally counted down the days and could not wait to get out.  We need to move away from that.  I am somewhat fearful, however, that some of the changes being proposed or made are just tokenistic.  The introduction of an examination for PE or the idea that we might change one or two things is not enough.  We need to completely reform the system.  We need to have a lot more continuous assessment.  We also need to do exactly what Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair suggested in terms of life skills.  We need to be teaching basic things like nutrition, cooking, how to change a tyre on a car and so forth.  People should be able to do those kinds of things and I really liked the way the witness phrased it - #adulting.  So many people, even in here, could do with learning some of those life skills.  That is what we need to do.  We need to be far more open minded and far less academic.  Extra curricular activities need to count too.</p><p>That is the approach we need to be taking at both primary and secondary levels.  The focus should be on confidence and building up self-belief because these are key to everything.  We often talk about mental health and childhood obesity but if one teaches skills on how to mind one's mental health and have good nutrition, for example, one will have them for life, no matter what one does.</p><p> This is linked to the debate on the leaving certificate applied.  It is nearly tokenistic in that it is kind of a gesture, on the basis that it might suit some students.  A considerable number of schools will not offer it, however.  There is a stigma; that is the reality.  There has always been a stigma, as far as I can see, in regard to the leaving certificate applied.  If we were to reform our education system so it would become much more broad and inclusive, we would not necessarily need to have a leaving certificate applied programme.  The same system should apply to everybody.  I hope this is the approach we are taking and that many of the points made, particularly by Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan, Mr. John Doran and Ms Sorcha N&iacute; Chonghaile, are taken on board by the Department.  This is key.  If we are reforming now, we have a chance to achieve what I describe.</p><p> It is 18 years since I did my leaving certificate examination.  I do not believe it has changed very much since then.  To this day, I believe it was the worst experience I have had.  Going through election campaigns and losing elections were far easier than doing the leaving certificate examination.  We have to move away from that.  The system is completely inequitable.  If one can afford to pay for grinds, one might be able to get a pass in mathematics to get into college.  If, however, one cannot afford to pay for grinds, one will not be able to do that.  That is just one example of how unfair the system currently is.  When talking about reform, we really need to consider radical reform, not just make minor changes here and there.  We need to look far more at continuous assessment.  This relates to the point Ms Sorcha N&iacute; Chonghaile made on illness.  People could be extremely sick on the day of an exam or completely panic about it.  With continuous assessment, there is some backup.  It is not just based on one exam.  What I propose would reflect not just two years of work but a whole six years, in addition to one's work in primary school before that.  I hope the Department is taking on board some of the points that have been made because they are really good.</p></speech>

We are all agreed that the leaving certificate needs reform.  If we learned anything from this afternoon's contributions, it is the scale of the task involved.  Ms N&iacute; Chonghaile mentioned the stress of the examination itself, as did others.  In many cases, people have nightmares when they think about their examinations and what happened or did not happen.</p> <p>  A few questions spring to mind.  People talk about the timescale and the delay in implementing change.  In light of the journey we have travelled with junior certificate reform, is there anything we have learned that we could implement to fast-track the process of leaving certificate reform?  I realise that is a very broad subject.</p> <p>  Reference was made to how fast of a world we move in.  I acknowledge that it is a major undertaking to reform the leaving certificate programme, that there are so many stakeholders involved and that it takes time but, as was outlined, time is important.  We are living in a fast-changing world and we need to keep that in mind as we proceed.</p> <p>  When we talk about mental well-being, we talk about physical well-being and skills for life.  Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan alluded to changing the wheel of a car, or whatever the case may be.  Is it possible to have a subject that encapsulates all this?  It would be beneficial for every student, regardless of where he or she ends up.  It is not just about shaping people for the workplace, although that is very important; if we do not end up at the end of process with a well-rounded individual, we will have more problems on our hands.  Is it possible to have a subject that encapsulates all that?  What would the timeframe be for getting that subject on the curriculum?  Nowadays, young people &mdash; we are blessed with a few in the audience this afternoon &ndash; are under more pressure than ever before.  We have to be cognisant of that.</p> <p>  We talked about the challenges that exist and broadband.  No later than yesterday, I received an email from a school principal in Monaghan stating he cannot get fibre broadband, which is causing a serious problem for himself, the teaching staff and the pupils in the school.  Mr. Geoff Browne talked about the issue of broadband in schools.  Also arising is the significant issue of broadband at home.</p> <p>  The NCCA comprises approximately 25 members.  Is the size of the body an impediment to change?  Is the group too large to develop curriculums in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1384" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#P00300"><p>I thank all the speakers.  As some of what I wanted to ask was covered already, I will not go back over it.  I agree with Deputy Funchion on continuous assessment.  It has to be brought in somewhere.  When I studied for the leaving certificate examinations, one read everything and everything was put up on the board.  One learned it and took it down.  Those days have changed.</p> <p>  On Ms N&iacute; Chonghaile's statements, I have highlighted here the life skills training and preparation for the working world.  This ties in with what Mr. Tony Donohoe from IBEC said.  IBEC's statement claims the development of key skills at all levels of the education system has been a priority of business for many years.  That has to be brought back to education.  There is now an effort to introduce skills or training for transition year, for example, but perhaps it needs to be considered for the leaving certificate also.  Much more emphasis is being put on apprenticeships, skills and training now.  Perhaps some sort of complementary programme needs to be introduced at second level.</p> <p>  On the STEM subjects, Ms N&iacute; Chonghaile said there may be too much emphasis.  Where I am from, Limerick, they are finding there are not enough pupils taking up the STEM subjects.  We have many engineering companies that are very anxious for people to train.  They need people to do the STEM courses.  There has to be a balance.  I would like to hear how the Department will encourage people to take up the STEM subjects.</p> <p>  One of the speakers said the subject of art has not been reviewed since the 1970s.  It is a very popular subject.  It opens many doors in terms of creativity, including in fashion design.  It is a subject that needs to be revamped.</p></speech>

There was a lot in them.  I heard many speakers today.  This is one of the debates in which I wished I was on the delegates' side making a submission because it is an area about which I am very passionate.  Many years ago, I heard the statement that the leaving certificate examination treats all pupils equally.  I believe that was the most ridiculous statement I heard in my life.  There is nothing just, equal or fair about the leaving certificate.  One has only to consider the resources available to the pupils who have to sit the examination to note that the moment they go through the school gate, inequality already exists.  It has a bearing on how well they will do in the examinations, on access to grinds, on access to adequate teaching, on access to classrooms in which teachers are not teaching foundation students and higher-level students at the same time.  I refer also to teachers who teach honours-level subjects to students and who are gearing subjects in this direction because they do not know how to teach at the required ordinary standard.  These are just a few examples.  It is not a fair system.  If I had my way, I would scrap the leaving certificate examination completely and have full, continuous assessment throughout the year.</p> <p>  I am reminded of doing my degree in Trinity College Dublin.  One of the delegates reminded me of a philosophy of time module I once took.  There was 60% continuous assessment.  When students enter third level, there is much more room for continuous assessment but they are not examined in that way anywhere else.</p><p>There is much more room for continuous assessment and we are not examined in that way anywhere else.</p><p> There was a lot of information here today but I was not persuaded to thinking there were any solid suggestions on what we need to do and what reforms are required.  There have been general statements but what are the key points on what we need to do?  Dr. O'Sullivan spoke about the impact of the leaving certificate applied, LCA, on students.  It is wrong to say that has been a success simply because students have enjoyed the course given that they are jobless.  They are not considered for access to higher education.  The witnesses can please correct me if I am wrong but my understanding is that they cannot even get into access programmes.  Does that not reinforce inequality when one cannot even get into the programme designed to address inequality?  That is a real failure in terms of many groups of children in this country.  Perhaps Dr. O'Sullivan would speak a little more about the impact of the LCA on poorer children.</p><p> I have a question for all the witnesses.  If one forgets the bureaucracy and the people who will block change in this area, and apart from the resources and support we know is needed, if there was a magic wand what would be the one thing they would change and how can we push forward to address that and change it?  It is not good enough for people to have to wait a quarter of a century for change.  We expect students to squeeze in two years of learning in two weeks and it takes us a quarter of a century to implement any reform.  That does not match up.  I would like the witnesses to indicate what is the one thing we can act on and change.  The leaving certificate was changed years ago in terms of the history project, which was very welcome.  I know children have benefitted greatly by being able to do the history project as part of their leaving certificate so if that is already in place for history what are the obstacles to rolling that out in the other exams, such as English and maths?  Why has that element only been introduced for history?</p><p> I have one more question for all the witnesses.  Given the proliferation of fake news, highly partisan media commentary and the increased fragmentation of politics around the world, how can we best incorporate the training of a highly informed and critical thinking Irish citizens within the reformed leaving certificate?  The introduction of philosophy would help in the creation of critical thinkers and citizens who can actively engage with the level of information out there and to be able to work through fake news and to be able to find their way in the world.  Do the witnesses agree that philosophy would provide that for students?  Some school subjects do not really provide anything in terms of long-term achievements and progressing goals.</p></speech>

I wish to address two aspects.  One is the speed of change and allied to that is the scale of the task.  We have been here for a couple of hours and we have some sense of the divergence of views and the pressures on the system when it sets about changing.</p> <p>  I understand Senator Gallagher asked about the junior cycle and if we have learned something form that.  Yes, we have learned the lesson that if someone says there is a simple answer they are wrong.  There is no simple answer.  All of the views that have been expressed here are valid and the perspectives are valid and one can hear them coming from a real sense of personal experience.  That is the real story here.  Whether it is form Ms N&iacute; Chonghaile or anybody else, people are experiencing or have experienced this and we owe a responsibility to be aware of that depth of experience when we undertake reform.  We must be careful that we do not respond in any kind of knee-jerk capacity to individual experiences.  We must look at the system as a whole.</p> <p>  There are no simple solutions and there is no quick response.  We have learned many things from the experience of the junior cycle.  One of them is the need to establish a shared idea of what it the outcome might be and how it might look different.  That is a serious issue for us as curricular developers and also for the committee members who are education partners and public representatives.</p> <p>  With regard to the idea that continuous assessment or any system is inherently fair, the system of education and curriculum reflects very often the society in which we live.  If we have a societal change on our minds then it is certain that curriculum and assessment have a role.  That is undoubted, but it cannot be seen as a replacement for a large societal change.  That is a facile interpretation in many ways.  I do not suggest anyone here has that interpretation but it will not work in a linear fashion.  The notion that, for example, there is no ongoing assessment currently in the leaving certificate is wrong.  Some 20 of the 34 subjects that are available in the leaving certificate currently have a second assessment component of some sort.  It is not a case of changing everything to continuous assessment and we will solve our problems.  It takes a deeper reflection than that.</p> <p>  I know you are under pressure, Chairman, so I will make one final comment on the notion of transition from junior cycle to senior cycle and the idea that the change that has taken place at junior cycle will somehow impede learning at senior cycle.  I contest that.  A child who travels through the junior cycle in its new format is a better learner.  People mentioned a reflective learner and the term "mutual respect" was used.  That is exactly the kind of learner that the junior cycle is seeking to encourage.  When the child reaches senior cycle he or she will encounter a different kind of learning until such time as the senior cycle reform has taken place.  As a better learner, having completed the junior cycle he or she will be in a better position to adapt to any kind of learning demands that are made on him or her.</p> <p>  It has been said that we cannot take as a given that a particular syllabus at leaving certificate promotes rote learning.  Teachers of English, which was mentioned, would feel in some way disrespected by that contention.  The people who teach English do not set out to teach it in a manner that promotes rote learning, rather they set out to teach it in a manner that is true to the nature of their learning.  That must be recognised.</p></speech>

I have a brief comment on well-being but I am conscious of time.  Like Deputy Byrne's question, there are two planks to the answer on teacher supply.  Teacher supply in and of itself does impact on the system's capacity to implement and lead curricular reform, but there is an issue of wider capacity in the profession more broadly that I referred to in my opening remarks.</p> <p>  In terms of teacher supply, our remit is to advise the Department under the Teaching Council Act.  We have produced two reports on it, an interim report in 2015 and a final report, Striking the Balance, in 2017.  Based on a representative sample, about 70 post-primary schools, approximately 10% of such schools, it appears there is an imbalance in certain key subject areas and in terms of the supply from the professional master of education, PME, in the concurrent programmes, on the one hand, and the demand from schools on the other.  That would be borne out and reinforced by data we have received from management bodies in terms of shortages in subjects such as home economics, Irish, languages and STEM subjects.  The council convened a representative forum on teacher supply of all the stakeholders which met on 5 October and we are planning to reconvene in May.  We are also engaging with the Department on an ongoing basis on this matter.  If one does not have teachers in classes to teach subjects, whether they are new, revised or otherwise that clearly does impact on a system's capacity but it is an issue on which we are working with all stakeholders.</p> <p>  That should not take away from the point I made in my opening statement about the capacity of the profession more broadly, beyond subjects, to lead curricular reform.  We are seeing that transformation.  Every year at F&Eacute;ILTE, the festival of education in learning and teaching excellence, we see an incredible amount of innovation and great work being done by teachers in schools of all types to innovate their practice with students.  That is happening already.  When one looks at the enhanced capacity for research that we are leading through Cro&iacute;, collaboration and research for ongoing innovation, there is an incredible thirst and hunger among teachers for research that is accessible and meaningful to them and there are many teachers conducting that research.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher asked about well-being.  We are part of the well-being for teachers and learners group with the Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, the Children&rsquo;s Ombudsman and the National Parents Council Primary.  We held a conference last Saturday in Croke Park.  While I understand there is a specific well-being provision in the junior cycle, there is also a clear learning from schools that showcased what they are doing now in terms of well-being for teachers and learners to the effect that a holistic whole-school culture and approach to well-being is vital.</p><p>We were really impressed by the quality of practice among schools in that area, which they demonstrated at Croke Park last Saturday.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#R00200"><p>On Senator Ruane's question as to how the leaving certificate applied lets down working class students or students from disadvantaged backgrounds, the general leaving certificate programme is letting down a whole section of society because of the availability of resources such as access to grinds, family situations, resources in schools, pressure on time and on teachers.<br/><br/>The leaving certificate applied is selling a dream that is not real to students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  I have had conversations with many teachers who teach in affluent schools who have asked me to try to convince their schools to take on the leaving certificate applied.  I am afraid to speak my mind openly in case I am not invited back here.  However, there is a catch.  To ensure school-finishing statistics remain high, these schools tend not to take it on and will not offer it.<br/><br/>It is well known in education spheres that low-income students are the ones most likely to end up on the vocational track.  The problem is not that the leaving certificate applied is there.  There should be vocational options available.  It is the fact that no actual set curriculum is followed is the problem.  The curriculum may be there but how it is implemented is optional.  Forty teachers responded to the survey I sent to them and there is diversity across schools.  The schools with fewer resources are offering a weaker curriculum.  Those students end up unable to find work and deflated by the experience.  Recently, a school in Inchicore was showcased on the news on how it had been pitched the leaving certificate applied but did not know students who did it could not get into college or access programmes as a result.  It is selling a dream that is not actually real.<br/><br/>The view around the leaving certificate in general is that it is not equal.  It has a rote-learning element to it.  I accept many of us succeed in that.  On the two-year mark, if I was asked to prepare for an interview for two years, it would be a legal or human resources issue.  I am not saying continuous assessment does not happen.  The length of time between starting the leaving certificate and assessment after two years is too long.  Were there examinations across that time and were the emphasis on that two-week period of examinations at the end of the cycle reduced, it might reduce the stress.<br/><br/>The mentality of teaching to the test, whereby schools compete for kudos in <i>The Irish Times</i>league tables, is actually causing significant difficulties in schools that want to support students and reform the system.  We have to find a way of removing this final terminal examination on which students, schools and teachers are assessed.  Senator Ruane asked for one suggestion in this regard.  We need a skills focus and more continuous assessment.  For me, whatever curriculum change happens, all schools should be empowered and supported to have equal opportunity to change their curricula and offer them to all students.  If we do not, we will end up with an unequal society where those who have get ahead while those who do not continue to remain unemployed and in the same situation.</p></speech>

In the Teaching Council when we refer to teachers' learning, we see it as much more complex.  It is about knowledge, skills and competences.  It is also about attitudes, values and dispositions.  It is equally the case with students' learning.  Building on what Mr. Aidan Farrell from the State Examinations Commission spoke about, it is probably not so much we should have the focus on those nouns such as "knowledge", "skills", "competences", "attitudes", "values" and "dispositions" but on the verbs we put with them.  It is not just about acquiring knowledge but reflecting on that knowledge, discussing it, sharing and shaping it.  Most importantly, it is about students and teachers working together as co-creators of knowledge.</p></speech>

You are all welcome.  I apologise for the first two parts of our meeting going on so long.  We appreciate your patience.  The purpose of this part of the meeting is to discuss with the delegates of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g the findings of the 2015 D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g delegate report and to examine the findings of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g survey entitled, &quot;So, how was school today?&quot;  The survey was referenced in our previous session and we took great delight in telling the witnesses that we would have first-hand experience from discussing the matter with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g delegates this evening.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I wish to welcome Kate Lehane, Kate Lancaster-Ryan, Hugh O'Reilly-Fitzgerald, Niamh Bakker, Craig Smith, Brigid O'Sullivan and Olive McGovern, who is the principal officer from the youth reform and citizen participation unit of the Department.  When I was a member of Kildare County Council and mayor of the county I had considerable engagement with Kildare Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  It was always enjoyable and interesting.  I am looking forward to the engagement.  I will give everyone an opportunity to speak for a minute.  You can say your name, where you are from and a little about your experience before we go to Ms McGovern.  Then we will have the opportunity to speak to the members.  The members may have some questions, which you can then respond to.</p><p>Before we continue, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  If you are directed by myself, as Chairman, to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statements that you give to us, including the two we have received, will be published on our committee website after the meeting.</p></speech>

In each D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g an independent report writer produces a report of the deliberations and findings of the young people.  Following each D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g, the Department establishes a steering committee of the relevant adult policy-makers to support the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g executive to implement the recommendations of the young people as reported in the D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g delegate report.  The process for the 2015 D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g report and all previous sessions was the same as the process we will have next month for 2017.</p> <p>  Since the theme was education in this instance, the following committee members were brought to work with the Department: Professor Dympna Devine, from UCD; Dr. Paul Downes from UCD, Clive Byrne from the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals; Jacqueline N&iacute; Fhearghusa from the Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate; Carmel Corrigan, independent research; and Carmel Duggan, independent research.  The committee also involved young people from the national executive along with staff from our Department and the participation team.</p><p> That group works as a steering committee to provide guidance and support to the young people on the national executive to give expert advice and get buy-in from relevant organisations where necessary and to attend meetings and answer questions raised by the national executive if required.  That is by way of responding to the queries in correspondence from the committee regarding structures and systems which the Department has in place to support the young people on an ongoing basis.  The rest of the time this evening is for the young people themselves.</p></speech>

Comhairle na n&Oacute;g is a network of local councils for children and young people aged 12 to 17 years to give them a voice on issues which affect them.  The Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national executive has one representative from each of the 31 groups around the country.  They work on recommendations from D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and make changes for people in those areas.  We meet monthly and have a two-year term of office.</p> <p>  I am joined by Ms Niamh Bakker from Laois, Ms Kate Lehane from Fingal, Ms Kate Lancaster-Ryan from Sligo, and Mr. Craig Smith and Ms Brigid O'Sullivan from the Comhairle in Waterford and County Cork who will discuss the results of the survey.</p> <p>  They will present the results of a survey that is unprecedented in size in its field.  It was undertaken by some 3,242 people around the country.  It is not possible to present all the data today but we will give its most important findings.  My colleagues will highlight some of the findings which we felt was most significant about how young people are taught and how they learn in the classroom but members should be aware that there is much more data available.  The survey asked 59 questions and the responses were analysed by gender, school year and the type of school.  We urge all committee members to read the full report which was officially launched on 6 November at Firhouse Community College by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone.      </p> <p>  I will now hand over to Ms Bakker who will discuss the first part of the survey.</p></speech>

The findings of our survey was published recently as a report entitled "So how was school today?".  It is important that the committee understands background to this research and where it came from.  In 2014, at the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national showcase, 500 young people voted that the areas of their lives in which they least had a say were school and education.  As a result, school and education became the theme for D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g in 2015, where delegates voted that what happens in the classroom should be the priority question to be dealt with by the national executive.  During the executive's two-year term, it developed a survey to explore how students are taught and how they learn in the classroom.  It was assisted by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills, researchers from the School of Education in UCD and a steering committee of educational experts.  The survey was completed by 3,242 young people at the 31 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g AGMs in late 2016.  This is a huge number of respondents and is one of the most significant surveys carried out to date on young people's educational experiences.  Ms Kate Lehane will now discuss the results from section 1, which looks at pupils' experience of teaching and learning in schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Lehane" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#T00500"><p>My name is Kate Lehane and I am the Fingal representative on the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national executive.  Our survey asked students about their experience of teaching and learning in school.  One student from County Waterford asked, "Have teachers been more energetic, enthusiastic and less monotone?", although this only applies to certain teachers because some teachers already do this and make learning easier.  Some 76% of students feel that other students get more attention than them.  This is worrying as only 24% of students are satisfied with the attention distributed around the classroom.  One student from Monaghan said: "Not all students are the same.  One size does not fit all."  This sums up perfectly the fact that less than 50% of students say they learn best when they read from text books and only 30% of students say that teachers make learning interesting and fun.</p> <p>  Another issue arising from the survey is that only 36% of students agree that teachers allow students to explain themselves without conflict.  Our survey asked students if they could change the teaching of three subjects in their school, which three would they pick.  Maths came out as number one, followed by Irish and then English.  This is a concerning but very important finding as they are the core subjects taught in Irish schools.  However, not all the findings were negative.  One first year student from County Cork said: "The teachers in my school are brilliant."  This shows that there are teachers doing it right with positive results, but we need to make it more widespread.  </p> <p>  Kate Lancaster-Ryan will now discuss section 2 on feelings about school.</p></speech>

Two thirds of students think there is too much emphasis on exams.  This is a worryingly high figure.  However, 42% think that exams are the best way to test learning.  One student from County Clare said: "There should be less emphasis on exams.  Students' progress should be individual and not compared to others."  Some 64% of students wish there was more project work, something we all feel could be improved on, perhaps by the addition of more project work in the curriculum.</p> <p>  Unsurprisingly, exams were the biggest source of stress for students.  Over half think that exams take over their lives in schools.  Exams are particularly stressful for third, fifth and sixth year students.  Of those who indicated a preference when asked, "Do students have a say in schools?", responses were split evenly between "Yes" and "No", which shows that some schools are getting it right while others still have changes to make.  Finally, a transition year student from County Cork said: "I think teachers should take our opinions on board because as young people our ideas are often new, relevant and innovative when it comes to things that affect us.  We are, after all, the students."</p> <p>  Ms Bakker will now discuss section 3 on young people's views on services and IT in schools.</p></speech>

I will first discuss levels of satisfaction for support services in schools which looks at matters such as the availability of career guidance, the availability and quality of counselling services and mental health supports and the amount and quality of learning support services.  Overall, boys are more satisfied than girls with support services in schools.  However, only 41% of students are satisfied with the quality of counselling and mental health support.</p> <p>  On IT, we looked at IT facilities, teachers' ability to use IT in the classroom and whether IT helped students to learn.  Some 88% of respondents think that IT in the classroom is not a waste of time, while 66% think IT helps them to learn.  On the availability of these services, one student in County Dublin said: "We need more access to computers and online learning resources."  This suggests that an increase in funding for IT and technology-based support in schools will make learning more enjoyable and more effective for students.</p> <p>  On behalf of all the students who took part in this survey, we hope that the committee will consider our findings when making any further decisions which directly affect us.  I thank the committee for listening.</p></speech>

We had a huge response rate, from 3,242 young people, but we want to go further.  We want our voice to make a difference in the classroom.  We want the key messages from the research to be listened to and taken on board by schools and teachers, to make an impact beyond the survey and contribute to a broader discussion about the education system in Ireland.  We are delighted that several positive developments have followed from the report of the survey, including the ongoing co-operation between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills to include the voice of children in the school inspection process.  Another exciting opportunity is that members of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national executive have been invited to present at the inspectors' conference in early 2018.  A letter and infographic poster has been sent to all participating schools summarising the report's key findings.  We will have the opportunity to report the work on this survey and show the video of the launch to delegates at D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g on 6 December.</p> <p>  I thank everyone here for listening and I urge them to read the full report which contains additional information about the experience of young people in Irish classrooms and schools.</p><p>We ask members to take note of the key findings of our research and to look for ways to bring them into their decision-making processes.  The report is currently available on the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g website and we hope members will all join us in spreading the word by linking with us on social media and using the hashtag #HowWasSchool.

I wish that some of the adults we have in here would take the same approach to making a presentation and sticking to a good timeline.  They have done very well.</p> <p>  I hope our witnesses had the opportunity to listen to our earlier discussion, which was about the possible reform of the leaving certificate.  A lot of what they addressed in their presentations reflected issues that we were discussing.  This is absolutely incredible work.  I will now ask the members if they wish to ask questions or make comments.  </p></speech>

I congratulate all the witnesses, including Ms Olive McGovern.  It is great to see young people getting involved.  There are too many passengers in school who just sit there and do not try to contribute, so it is great to see our witnesses' civic-mindedness coming out.  They are all going to make great politicians some day.  It is great to see the contribution they are making.</p> <p>  I was curious about the 59 questions that were asked.  How did Comhairle na n&Oacute;g come up with those questions?  It is good to hear Mr. Hugh Fitzgerald talking about the departmental co-operation between the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills.  It is very important that the views of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g are listened to and obviously this committee will do so.  I welcome the news of the presentation that Comhairle na n&Oacute;g will be making to the inspectors' conference and of the video on 6 December.  There is no point in doing surveys, with all the attendant work for the witnesses and D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g, unless they are actually going to go somewhere.  The Chair of this committee is mindful of that and will encourage this committee to help in bringing forward Comhairle na n&Oacute;g's views.  I thank the witnesses very much for coming in and giving their contribution.  They are all extremely articulate and very accomplished.  </p></speech>

They waited a very long time to give it.  It is interesting that they appeared after the discussion on the possible reform of the leaving certificate.  I completely agree with some of the points made about project work or continuous assessment.  We need to see far more of that in our secondary school system.  Some of the findings in the report concerned very high anxiety levels, particularly among female students suffering from exam stress.  Apart from reforming the leaving certificate system, what would the witnesses like to see regarding the availability of counselling in schools?  What are their ideas around mental health and how we can be better at that at secondary school level?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#U00500"><p>Like my colleagues, I commend the witnesses.  They are fine ambassadors for the youth of our country.  Our country is in good hands with them coming along.  I wish to raise one or two questions.  Regarding the well-being of our students, I alert our witnesses to the fact that last September this committee published a report on promoting positive mental health in our schools, which contained some key recommendations.  We have forwarded that on to the Minister for his consideration.</p> <p>  Comhairle na n&Oacute;g's report shows that less than half of students are satisfied with counselling and career guidance services at their schools.  Was that due to the reduction in career guidance or the standard of services that was available?  Apart from career guidance, is there a need for a completely separate counsellor in schools to deal with students' well being and mental health?</p> <p>  I am curious as to whether the witnesses have noticed any change in teaching techniques in their own experience of schools from, say, first to sixth year.  Is there more active learning as inspections are looking for that from teachers?  Alternatively, is it a generational thing, whereby the new generation of teachers is very much focused on active learning?  Finally, I am interested in the witnesses' thoughts on inspections.  At the moment it is just a questionnaire that some years fill out, or that parents of some students fill out.  I refer to the management leadership learning inspection, MLL.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on what they would like students' contribution to inspections to be?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#U00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.   I agreed with everything they said but there was one point that triggered a thought of my own struggles in schools with teachers and the experience of my daughters.  She can correct me if I have picked this up wrongly but I believe Ms Kate Lehane referred to a conflict with teachers when students try to explain, to contribute or to question.  Can Ms Lehane speak a little bit more about that question and what it is about?  In a school system it is usually frustrating when teachers are too afraid to leave the curriculum, even for a moment, to have dialogue and conversation.  I know how I learn.  It is through participation and conversation and there was never much room for that in school.  This always caused great conflict, with teachers telling students to be quiet or perceiving them to be disruptive because they wanted to engage in a conversation.  The witnesses might speak a little more about the issue of conflict.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#U00700"><p>Before I hand back to the witnesses, I would like to ask about one point.  This committee has submitted a number of reports and recommendations to the Minister regarding different aspects of education.  Deputy Catherine Martin referred to our report on positive mental health.  We recently heard from witnesses on healthy eating and managing a healthy life in schools.  As part of that, we discussed the presence of vending machines in schools, and the fact that they contain chocolate, crisps and things like that.  We also discussed the availability of drinking water in schools and how important that is.  If that came up at any stage in Comhairle na n&Oacute;g's research, it would be interesting to hear a little bit about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Fitzgerald" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#U00800"><p>The first question came from Deputy Madigan, and concerned about the 59 questions and from where they came.  Those questions were formulated over the course of about a year via what Comhairle na n&Oacute;g might call its own method of sourcing ideas.  We would use placemats, that is, students attending a conference would write on the entire tablecloth.  As such, students might not have been actively speaking but they were still actively writing.  Those tablecloths were sent off for analysis, and from that analysis we noticed recurring ideas.  Certain questions, on gender or types of school, for example, were obligatory.  However, the core questions on the fleshy subject matter that is education came from those placemats and from the mandate we got from the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.188" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Bakker" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#U00900"><p>There was a question about the availability of counselling and mental health supports.  The rate of people who were satisfied with the availability of mental health supports was quite low.  To us, the solution is to put extra money into having a counsellor in a school.  In many schools we have spoken to through our national executive members and our own comhairl&iacute;, counsellors are only present one or twice a week, which is not sufficient for a whole school with 1,000 students.  Having a counsellor there constantly would be much more beneficial and the rate of satisfaction would go through the roof if people had more access to counselling and mental health support.  Staffing is the main issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Brigid O'Sullivan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#U01000"><p>I also wish to speak about mental health supports because it is something that is raised a lot in my own school and comhairle and with people of my own age.  People are talking about it, especially if they go to the guidance counsellor in their own school.  As well as that, awareness of what is out there is important.  In the case of people who are not satisfied with the support services in their own school, some of that is attributable to simple things.  A student may not get along with his or her guidance counsellor, for example, as their personalities just do not match.  However, there are lots of support services outside school and schools should be making more of an effort to make people aware of those mental health supports and how to go about getting them.</p><p>From talking to people and on the basis of the guidance counselling provided in my school, I am aware that it is sometimes about the quality of support people receive or the days on which guidance counsellors might be in school.  As Niamh mentioned, some counsellors might only be in schools for half the week.  Some of it is just about simple personality clashes because it is being dealt with on a one-to-one basis and it is really important that people know about all the support services.</p></speech>

A lot of teachers in my school are using the Magenta active learning principles in the classroom.  We noticed that they are changing the desks in their classrooms into small groups and everyone can see the board as a result.  Teachers are also using something called Kahoot!, which is a quiz platform whereby a teacher can make up a quiz on the computer and it will produce a code for the quiz.  We can join in on our smartphones and answer the questions.  Personally, I have noticed changes in teaching techniques and methods in my six years in secondary school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Lehane" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017112100002#V00400"><p>I think it is a generational thing.  I have seen changes but it is mainly with younger teachers.  I recognise that some of the older or more seasoned teachers try new things but they are not entirely comfortable with it.  Their usual method is to say "Learn this".  I have young teachers who try something new every week.  I have one teacher who asks us what we want to learn at the start of every week.  We all feel that we enjoy that a lot better than being told what we are going to learn.  It helps me and the other students enjoy the classroom more.  I see it more with younger teachers, those that are new to the profession, whereas with older teachers it is very much a case of "Learn this off by heart" and "Do this" or "Do that".  I see a change but mainly through younger teachers.</p></speech>

However, I think the curriculum is very much focused on rote learning for exams and then the younger teachers get really stressed out.  We stop the new things and just start learning things by heart.  I think teachers try but it is restricted by the way the curriculum is set up.  Of course, that is my personal opinion.</p></speech>

On the flip side, I also have seen an increase in teachers understanding that they are supposed to be implementing active learning but also I have definitely seen a push-back in that regard.  When an inspector visits the school, I would come in and notice that all of the tables were arranged, as Craig has said, in groups of four - two facing two.  When the inspector leaves, they are promptly put back.  Essentially, what I am trying to get across is that perhaps there would be a generation of old-school teachers, as Kate Lehane pointed out, who are not entirely willing to change.  It is difficult, without surprise inspections, to see whether any change is actually being made, unfortunately.</p></speech>

In junior certificate, I found that my teachers made much more effort toward active learning and doing projects.  This was especially the case with history, where we did a lot of projects to understand topic better.  We are a great deal more restricted at leaving certificate.  The junior certificate course runs from first year to third year but with the leaving certificate is covered in bulk over fifth and sixth year.  It is a lot more rote learning and we are really restricted by the curriculum.  I feel it is really not possible to do the same with both cycles.  The curriculum would have to change because during junior certificate cycle we had a lot more time to delve into projects and things like that.  For leaving certificate cycle, it is lot of learning, doing tests and then more learning.</p></speech>

No. I thank all of the witnesses.  It was interesting and insightful to listen to them describe the work they have done.  It is incredible that they received so many responses.  That is great credit to them, as is the fact that they are not going to let it rest there and that they are looking at so many other ways to engage other students.  On behalf of the committee, I want to thank them for their time and energy and wish them well.  They should keep up the good work.  We look forward to hearing about their future patterns of work.</p></speech>

The delegation is jointly led by me and Councillor Bobby O'Connell.  I am a member of Longford County Council and Vice-President of the Association of Irish Local Government.  Councillor Bobby O&rsquo;Connell is the General Secretary of the Local Authority Members Association and a member of Kerry County Council.  Both of the associations thank the committee Chairman and members for giving us an opportunity to discuss the Bill with them and the implications that the Bill will have for elected members at local authority level. </p> <p>  First, we wish to clarify with the committee that neither association held meetings with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the Bill, as has been referenced previously by the Department of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Bill was referenced at meetings, in general terms, that the AILG had with officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Bill was mentioned in the context of the AILG's elected members' training programme and the possibility of providing further training in the area of ethics and governance for elected members.</p><p>However, at no stage was the Bill or its contents and possible implications discussed in detail by officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with either representative body.  Indeed, we would not expect it to be as the Department did not propose the Bill.  Therefore, we welcome the opportunity to highlight our concerns about the Bill.  We wish to confirm that we are available to meet the officials from the government reform unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss our concerns if they so wish. </p><p> It is important to state that while both associations have some concerns with certain aspects of the draft Bill, and that while we welcome any measures to strengthen the standards that the public rightfully expect from people in public office, we reiterate that the vast majority of the 949 local councillors across the country are hardworking men and women whose only interest is to serve the communities that have elected them.  We welcome a robust and transparent system for the declaration of assets and business interests for public representatives.  However, we feel that some of the measures in the Bill may place additional extensive and onerous obligations and responsibilities on our members.  </p><p> We would like to make some specific points about some provisions in the Bill and their possible implications for our members.  At this stage I would like to apologise on behalf of the president of the AILG, Mr. Damien Geoghegan.  Unfortunately, he was unable to attend today.  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Bobby O'Connell, Chairman of the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-21a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bobby O'Connell" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017112100002#D00200"><p>I wish to refer to section 5 of the Bill on categories of public official.  We are concerned about local authority members being classified as a category A public official.</p> <p>  We note that there is a proposal in section 5 for local authority members to be classified as category A public officials along with Oireachtas Members, special advisers, chairpersons and CEOs of public bodies, and those on remuneration at deputy secretary level and above in the public sector.</p> <p>  Category A public officials will also have the highest level of obligations under the Bill.  Category B public officials are classified as those on remuneration between principal officer level and deputy secretary in the public sector, and will also include a member of the board of a public body, excluding the chairperson.  Category C public officials will be classified as being all other public officials.  We would question the requirement to class our members as category A public officials and place them in the same category and level as Oireachtas Members and CEOs of public bodies given the powers, responsibilities and resources available that our members have at local level.  We contend that local authority members should be equated with members of a board of a public body.  Therefore, we suggest that local authority members should be classed as category B public officials at most. </p> <p>  An additional implication for being classified as category A public officials is the obligation to submit all declarations to the Commissioner of their interests during the relevant declaration period.  If our members were re-classified as category B public officials, which we are now, the requirement would be to submit all declarations to the relevant public body as is the current requirement under the various Ethics and Local Government Act. </p> <p>  Section 8 refers to private declarable interests.  We have concerns about private declarations and income from an employment.  Both the AILG and LAMA have grave concerns about some of the proposals about the private declarations in section 8 of the draft Bill on declarable interests.  For instance, while we accept and understand the requirement to make a public declaration on a member's employment, profession, business and directorship status, we absolutely fail to understand the reasoning one needs to make a private declaration about the amount of his or her remuneration, particularly a PAYE employment.</p><p>We would argue that if an elected member has a conflict of interest on a local authority as a result of his or her employment, the amount of their remuneration is irrelevant as the conflict of interest already exists by virtue of their employment and they should recuse themselves from the matter in their role as an elected member.  We would also contend that the requirement to declare a member&rsquo;s private income from an employment, trade or profession would be a data protection issue.</p><p> Section 8 concerns private declarations and declarations of assets.  Again, under section 8 of the draft Bill, both associations have grave concerns in relation to the proposed requirement for category A officials to make a private declaration of liabilities and assets over &euro;50,000, excluding pensions or a charge on the family home.  We feel that this is an excessive requirement and indeed a potential invasion of privacy for our members, particularly on financial assets over &euro;50,000 that they will now be requested to declare.  For example, we fail to see the reasoning whereby an elected member who is left financial assets of over &euro;50,000 in a family will, due to a bereavement, has to declare it even in a private capacity and why such an example like this would affect their role as an elected member.</p><p> Section 8 also relates to private declarable interests, private declarations and the declaration of gifts not connected to official function.  Both associations question the requirement for category A officials to make a private declaration on receipt of gifts and travel of between &euro;200 and &euro;600, received from a person not related, when it is not connected to a function in our member's capacity as an elected member.  Again, our members feel these instances may be of a personal nature and if it is unconnected to their capacity and function as an elected member, there should be no requirement for a declaration.  We would contend that declarations in general should only be required where the gift or travel is received where it is connected to a function and we welcome the provision in the draft Bill under section 11 of the requirement and obligation for public officials to refuse such gifts in the first instance and notify the commissioner of same.</p></speech>

Under the proposed provisions contained within section 16 of the draft Bill, we would request that the period for production of a tax clearance certificate should be increased to 12 months, from the current six-month requirement, following enactment of the Bill.  We would also request that where members cannot produce a tax clearance certificate but have confirmation from the Revenue Commissioners that they are in the process and engaging with Revenue to bring their tax affairs up to date, this confirmation will suffice until such time as the Revenue Commissioners issue a tax clearance certificate to the member.  We would also contend that this proposed provision should be extended on an annual basis for the requirement to furnish an annual tax clearance certificate by the 30 April of each year.  We note the provisions contained in section 18 and section 19 in relation to evidence of subsequent compliance and an application statement for a tax clearance certificate, but we feel that providing for the above in relation to the production of a tax clearance certificate would be appropriate.</p> <p>  On section 33, both the AILG and LAMA have serious concerns in relation to the powers of the new commissioner, proposed under section 33 of the draft Bill, to accept written complaints from any person.  The original general scheme of the Bill set out that any complainant has up to 12 months from the date on which evidence sufficient to justify the complaint comes to such person&rsquo;s knowledge, and not later than five years from the date on which the alleged contravention was committed, to make a complaint against a public official.  Upon receipt of a complaint, the commissioner may dismiss the complaint, deal with it by issuing advice, refer it to the relevant public body, or cause a preliminary inquiry of the complaint to be carried out.  However, the Bill only specifies that a complaint must be based on evidence sufficient to justify the making of the complaint.  Both representative bodies would contend that the yardstick for measuring sufficient evidence needs to be set at the higher end to combat malicious, vexatious or repetitious complaints.</p><p>For all public representatives, the threat of a malicious complaint with no basis can be detrimental to an elected member&rsquo;s political career and we feel that further safeguards should be put into the Bill to ensure that our members are protected from any malicious and vexatious complaints.</p></speech>

Our final concern with the draft Bill is the potential onerous administrative obligations that compliance with the Bill will place on our members, particularly if our members are classed as category A officials with the highest level of obligations.  Our members serve at local authority level with minimal secretarial and administrative backup.  The obligation to make declarations three times per annum if their circumstances have changed and the obligation, in certain circumstances, to retain statements for up to a 15-year period will undoubtedly place serious administrative problems on our members and we would request that this be taken into consideration in determining the classification for our elected members at local authority level.</p> <p>  In conclusion, the Association of Irish Local Government and the Local Authority Members Association endeavour to bring to the fore the voices of elected members who are rooted in their own communities and work for their communities on a daily basis.  We acknowledge the work of this important committee and pledge that we will play our part on behalf of all elected members to work alongside the committee and we look forward to continuing to contribute its work.  We thank the Chairman and the committee members for listening to our submission and will be glad to take questions that the members may have. </p></speech>

I had thought the Chairman and I were the only people who had concerns about this legislation because every time we engaged with the Department, we were told there was no feedback from elected councillors on it.  Mr. McEntire said there was no formal consultation but has any of the organisations received any correspondence or any invitation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to comment on the legislation since last April?</p></speech>

We held a number of meetings with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as part of the ongoing training programme we give to elected members, and we gave a module on governance and ethics in early 2015.  This was part one and we were due to do part two later in 2015 and in 2016.  We spoke to officials in the Department who oversee our training and they said we should wait until further ethics legislation was concluded, as a draft Bill was running through the Houses of the Oireachtas at that time, before we carried out any further training.</p> <p>  The seriousness of the Bill was first brought to our attention around April of this year and I received emails from one or two delegates, as well as from Members of the Oireachtas who wanted to bring it to the attention of elected members that the proposals in the Bill would have serious implications for them.  I prepared a briefing document in April on the proposed Bill and brought it to our executive committee at our April-May meeting and it was published on our website.  On 11 May, we got an email from the government reform unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with a letter from the Minister attached, explaining the Bill and bringing its contents to our notice.</p><p>I will quote from the end of it.  It stated: "Furthermore, officials of my Department are available to discuss any issues which might arise."  According to the letter, regular meetings were held between officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government.  It also notes that the Bill was published in December 2015 and completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 20 January 2016.  I refute the statement that we had detailed discussions with the Department.</p></speech>

On 12 June 2017 I replied to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who sent the original letter.  In my letter I outlined in general terms our concerns about the Bill and indicated that the Association of Irish Local Government would be available for a meeting, if the Department wished.  The general points I made in our reply are the same as those set out in our submission.</p> <p>  It was also highlighted at meetings of the executive committee in May and June that the Bill had reached Committee Stage and that 89 amendments had been tabled.  We decided to contact the joint committee later in the autumn to seek to make representations on the fact that the Bill had progressed to such a late stage.  This decision to make contact was taken at our executive meeting in early September and I subsequently wrote to the Chairman on the matter.</p></speech>

It argues that the purpose of the Bill is to tidy up matters, but the AILG clearly begs to differ.  Does the Bill have the potential to frighten people away from running for local office?</p></speech>

We also have a major deficit in female representation in local government.  The position is that PAYE earnings must be declarable, which gives rise to a data protection issue.  Local authority members are not in any category, but we are more or less category B officials.  The Bill proposes that we be designated as category A officials.  This provision is a major turn-off for people involved in private business because the amount one pays one's employees is commercially sensitive information.  If people are required to publish details of what they pay their employees, this information could be used against their companies as other companies will be able to see precisely how much their staff are being paid.  The decision to designate local authority members as category A officials is a nonsense and our purpose in attending the meeting is to deal with this issue.  We fall within category B, more or less, and contend that while requiring local authority members to publish details of their PAYE incomes in the fashion proposed may not frighten people off from entering local politics, it will certainly dissuade them from doing so.  Both associations regard this proposal as totally wrong.</p></speech>

If a person's tax affairs are in order, surely they will also be in order within either six or 12 months?  Is this proposal causing practical difficulties?  Is the purpose of the request for an extension to give people time to get their tax affairs in order when they should be in order in any case?</p></speech>

Much of this will be new to members of local authorities and the provisions will be brought to their attention once the Bill has been enacted.  In cases where they cannot produce a tax clearance certificate, having a 12-month period following enactment to allow them to produce a tax clearance certificate would provide some leeway, provided they can show they are engaging with the Revenue Commissioners.  The production of a tax clearance certificate is a new requirement with which local authority members will have to comply and we are simply seeking a little leeway by extending the period within which they will have to do so from six to 12 months after the enactment of the Bill.</p></speech>

I was very happy when I was in the organisation.  I thank the Chairman for being helpful as always.</p> <p>  Much of the discussion on the Bill in this committee has taken place in private session.  Senators were not privy to the discussions on the Bill in the select committee, although I read the transcripts of the relevant meetings.  There is publicly declarable and privately declarable information.  The issue is that privately declarable information could be subject to data protection and could be leaked or whatever.  All of this information should be declarable.  It is declarable to the Revenue Commissioners and privately.  If the Revenue wishes to investigate anybody, it has, as one of my former lecturers on tax once stated, more powers than garda&iacute; involved in a murder hunt have.  That has always been the case.</p> <p>  I do not get the reason the Standards in Public Office Commission or the body that succeeds it needs to know whether an individual in the public sector, specifically a category A official, has a cash balance of more than &euro;50,000 or any asset other than the family home worth more than &euro;50,000.  As Councillor O'Reilly stated, we are trying to convince people to enter and stay in local politics.  This proposal will create an administrative burden.  Most councillors do not have secretaries.  They are one-person operations and answer all their emails and take all their telephone calls.  Now they are to be asked to report every three or four months on whether there has been a material change to their circumstances.  The definition of "material change" in this context is a major issue as it will have a significantly different meaning for different people.  An additional &euro;1 million in income may not be a material change for some leading business people, whereas a much lower sum would be a material change for most of us.  The term "material change" is vague.</p> <p>  I take Mr. Moylan's point about the declaration of income and category A versus category B requirements.  Although income will be privately rather than publicly declared, if it is all being recorded and declared to the Revenue, I do not understand the reason it must be declared to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The same applies to details regarding assets of a value of &euro;50,000 or more.  The requirements regarding gifts and travel create another administrative burden and the limits appear to be set at a low level.</p> <p>  Once the system for tax clearance certificates is up and running, it probably will be fine.  However, I agree that a lead-in period is required to allow leeway to people who may not be familiar with the process.  Many of the 949 local councillors will have no issue with the proposed requirement, either because their entire income comes from the public purse and they do not have other sources of income or because they are privately employed and may have obtained a tax clearance certificate for other reasons, such as doing work for a local authority or public body.  The issue here is the additional administrative burden being placed on local councillors.  They must already make a donation statement in January and an ethical declaration in February and they soon will be required to make quarterly reports on all travel connected with various bodies.  I am not sure how many people will have to do this but it is another burden.  Councillors must also submit various conference reports and other information.  These requirements create another burden.  What will happen if something goes slightly wrong or a councillor forgets something?  Are councillors supposed to count the money in their wallet or pockets because everything above a value of &euro;50,000 must be declared?  Are they supposed to count and declare every cent in every bank account they may have and get land or fields valued every quarter?</p> <p>  The witnesses did not refer to head 10, which proposes to prohibit local representatives whose outside role primarily involves the sale or development of land from dealing with that land during their term of office and for two years afterwards where their local authority has changed the development plan or zoning and they have been involved with the decision.</p><p>This has major implications for auctioneers, solicitors, quantity surveyors, architects, engineers and everyone else involved in the construction sector, let alone those who might be involved in farming or have done something with their land.  This matter was not referenced significantly in the witnesses' document, but they have discussed it among themselves.  Have they thoughts on this part of the Bill?  It is the bit we have not teased out so far today.</p></speech>

Our members have told us that to comply with development plans and national guidelines on the zoning of land, many local authorities have dezoned land over the past six or seven years.  Future zoning did not enter our discussions significantly because much of that work had been done and there is probably enough land zoned in local authority areas to meet population trends over the next ten to 20 years.  The matter has not figured into our deliberations.</p></speech>

They cannot even declare it and then deal with it.  People might not have realised this.</p></speech>

For example, if a solicitor represents the family involved, he or she should recuse himself or herself from any discussion.  That would be the correct course to take in that person's role as a local authority member.  The same applies to auctioneers and other professionals who might have dealings with the land at any point.  They must recuse themselves when the local authority makes a decision on it.  Those were the general terms of the conversation that we had with our elected members, but this point has not figured predominantly in our discussions because we feel that elected members should recuse themselves if they believe that they will have a future role.</p></speech>

That is certainly the case in my local authority.  However, this is more about an auctioneer, solicitor or architect who, when he or she is rezoning a field, does not know what will happen in the future.  Some counties are large.  I happened to be a representative in the geographically smallest local authority in the country.  It was 8 miles long and 5 miles wide.  In large counties, however, a councillor who is an architect or quantity surveyor could be rezoning land a long way from where he or she lives only to be asked in a year's time to submit a tender.  The councillor would not have known of any future involvement.  People need to be aware of this.</p> <p>  It is important that we acknowledge that this Bill is being introduced on foot of many issues, but people have not copped how administratively burdensome it will be for certain people in some types of industry through no fault of their own.  They were elected.  The only people who can zone land are councillors.  I sat through three development plans while I was a member of my local authority.  It is what they do.  People might decide that they do not want to be councillors anymore because it will impact on their professions if, for example, they are civil engineers, quantity surveyors or the like.  People need to be cognisant of this.</p> <p>  If someone is involved with land or owns land or if family members or other connected persons own land, of course that should be declared in advance and the councillor should remove himself or herself from the chamber.  Technology has moved on.  In the old days, people left the chamber and did not know what happened in the room afterwards.  Now, most chambers are being webcast.  All people need to do is watch on their phones or look into the next room to see what is happening at the meeting.  So be it.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for attending but, on the administrative side, the Department does not even appreciate the additional reporting we all were obliged to do from 2014 on in terms of travel.</p><p>If, as I used to be, one happens to be a member of the AILG, a regional authority or assembly and a health forum, one has to declare the meetings one attends, even those for which one is not paid.  A councillor cannot claim for theatre boards or drug task forces, but he or she still has to recuse himself or herself.  The minute a councillor leaves something out, he or she could be caught.  It might not be done deliberately.  It might just be an administrative mistake, the councillor forgot about a meeting or a note of it did not go into his or her diary.</p><p> The level of administration and the amount of changing required every quarter if the material changes need to be appreciated by the Department and those who drafted the Bill.  Most councillors are one-person operations.  If they do not do it, it does not get done.  There is a lot of work involved.</p><p> The process should be streamlined to make it easier.  I do not understand why people have to declare assets themselves.  If a councillor has a large loan, someone might say that he or she has debts of &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million and could be susceptible, although that is not guaranteed.  That people have to count all of their assets constantly and tell SIPO what they have when Revenue, presumably, has access to most of that data seems burdensome.  It is only privately declarable in any event, so what is the point?</p></speech>

Having been a county councillor for a number of years, I understand the usual challenges as well as those that this Bill will pose in terms of the workload.</p> <p>  I wish to address the issue of PAYE salaries.  Realistically, everyone will have to have a source of income other than his or her remuneration as a county councillor, which I worked out for myself as being less than &euro;1 per hour while covering a constituency 100 miles long.  I know the challenges in that regard.  Are the witnesses worried that information on PAYE salaries could be used against public representatives?  Would making information available, just not publicly, be a way around that?  A data protection issue was mentioned.  Has the AILG received legal advice to the effect that this would contravene data protection legislation?</p></speech>

We respect that, under a public declaration, local authority members must declare their employment status, be that PAYE, self-employed, a profession or a consultancy business.  It is the private declarations that we fail to understand.  If I work for a company that has come into conflict with the local authority, I should declare my interest as an employee of that company regardless of whether I am working for the minimum wage or on &euro;100,000 a year.  To us, the conflict stems from one's employment.  The question of why a private declaration is needed on top of that is a principled matter for our members.</p> <p>  Deputy Calleary referred to how the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in his discussions with it, stated that this would not place additional requirements on people and that the Bill is just pulling a number of Acts together.  However, the private declarations are new in terms of what our members must report.  If the Department made that point, I do not agree with it.</p> <p>  A PAYE worker gets a P60 at the end of the year but not a tax clearance certificate.  The onus will now be on that worker to go to the Revenue Commissioners and seek a tax clearance certificate or statement saying that he or she is tax compliant even though he or she already has a P60.  When we were drafting our submission, a question was raised about whether a P60, as opposed to a tax clearance certificate, would suffice.  For a PAYE worker, a P60 is his or her tax clearance certificate.</p><p>Once again, it is about barriers.  To us, participation in local government is only good if it involves a cross-section of people from all walks of life - young, old, male, female, working and non-working, PAYE workers and the self-employed - who are willing to put their names forward to represent communities at a local level.  These are just further barriers to getting people to put their names on the ballot paper, something we want to encourage.</p></speech>

Deputy Dara Calleary asked if it would dissuade people from running for local office.  The Senator was a councillor for a long time and represented the people very well.  Not alone would this measure dissuade people from running in the local elections but, as Mr. Moylan pointed out, there must also be a balance in the council chamber.  The Senator is aware - a number of Senators present were councillors - that in a place of employment people must be employed who understand what is going, there must be a gender balance and so on.  Local government in Ireland is starting to become a place for those who are self-employed or retired, which is not fair.</p> <p>  Every year there is more and more red tape and bureaucracy for councillors.  Senator Gerry Horkan has spoken about the increased burden imposed by administration.  We would have no issue with the extra administration if we were given a few pounds to cover it, but once again councillors are being targeted as full-time, paid employees of county councils.  They are not; they are office holders.  They are, however, designated in the Bill as being in category A which includes Oireachtas Members and other full-time representatives.  They are not full-time but part-time and serve their communities as best they can.  Committee members are correct that councillors all have another place of employment to ensure they can support their families financially.  Further remuneration was announced last week, but it equates to &euro;520 per year or &euro;10 per week.  While we are very excited about whatever remuneration we receive as local councillors, once again we are bearing the brunt of further legislation that will be especially prohibitive for those who want to run for local office.  We ask that councillors remain in category B because including them in category A is actually bringing them to a stage where they will be full-time, paid employees.  If the legislators want to put us in category A, let them pay us as individuals included in that category.  That is where I am coming from in this debate and I am sure everyone around the table agrees with me.  The administration burden put on councillors is absolutely chronic and onerous.</p></speech>

I also agree with him on the diversity needed within the council chamber.  When I was a member of Mayo County Council, it amazed me that more than 50% of its elected representatives were auctioneers.  It worried me that there was such a concentration of auctioneers on the council.  There is an issue with reporting, land ownership, zoning and planning and one's responsibilities as a councillor.  I do not see how these provisions will address that issue.</p> <p>  I want to ask the delegates about gifts.  I cannot imagine how the provisions will work.  It is very important that gifts not be given to elected representatives that could in some way influence the decision-making process.  How do the councillors see that issue being resolved?  It would be very easy for an elected representative to say something was a personal gift, even though it was in some way connected to a decision.  Do the delegates have suggestions to make on how this issue might be resolved?</p></speech>

No declaration is required if it is from a relative and there is no limit in receiving a gift as long as it is not connected to a function.  That is right because they are private and personal.</p><p>We believe that if gifts are received from a third party, there will be a requirement for category A public officials to make private declarations once it goes over a certain limit, even though the gifts are not connected with the function.  We would distinguish between accepting a gift that is connected with a function and accepting one that is not connected with a function.  We welcome the provision under section 11 of the Bill where if a person tries to give a gift that is connected with his or her function to an elected member or category A public representative or any official, the obligation is on the public official to refuse the gift.  There is an additional obligation to notify the SIPO commissioner.  We welcome this provision.  If, however, it is not connected to their functions and with the limits set at over &euro;600, our members at local authority level would feel that some of these gifts could be of a personal nature, even from a person who is not connected to the representative.  Members might ask why a private declaration would have to be made for that.  In the context of the proof needed on whether the gift was or was not connected to a function, it comes down to somebody making a complaint and the ensuing investigation process.  A public official may be able to genuinely state that it was not connected with a function but if it is, then we would have issues with it.</p></speech>

This issue was touched upon in the announcement last week on additional support.  What was announced, however, is very restrictive in the context of whether our members can avail of that extra secretarial and administrative support.  Some of the records and statements must be kept for up to 15 years and it will be an additional burden, especially if declarations have to be updated every four months.  There is no mention in the Bill regarding the material change in councillors' circumstances that would warrant a new declaration.  This is also very subjective and it could lead to additional administration.  Councillors have no full-time or even part-time secretarial or administrative back-up.</p></speech>

The original scheme of the Bill sets out that the complainant has up to 12 months from the date on which evidence sufficient to justify the complaint comes to such a person's knowledge, and not later than five years from that date.  The Bill, however, does not actually clarify what the sufficient evidence is in order to bring that complaint.  A threat of a malicious complaint that has no basis can end the political career of a public representative just like that.  The Bill's proposal in this regard is damning towards anybody in public office.  Somebody can make an erroneous complaint about a public representative and this can hang over him or her for a period of five years.  This is crazy stuff.  The evidence should be defined, there should be specific provision as to what complaints can be allowed and it should be dealt with in a short and sharp manner.  It is as simple as that.  What is proposed in the Bill is extremely frightening.</p></speech>

If I could make a final point, I do not think I saw anything in the general scheme of the Bill in terms of sanctions for someone making a malicious complaint.  There are plenty of sanctions for the public officials if they are in contravention of the legislation such as fixed-payment notices and further prosecution.  However, if someone is found to have made a malicious complaint that had no basis there is no sanction for him or her.  Perhaps that is something that could deter anybody from making a malicious complaint.  The issue could be addressed on Committee Stage.  I have looked through the Bill and I am having another quick look to make sure I am correct in that regard.  It would be helpful to have a deterrent to someone making a malicious complaint.</p></speech>

Concerns were raised about the content of the Bill when the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, attended the committee.  There was some ambiguity surrounding what is currently required from local representatives and what is outlined in the Bill.  It seemed there was no understanding that there would be an increase in capacity in some areas.</p> <p>  I have no specific question but I wish to make two or three points on the Bill about areas on which I am concerned.  I would welcome comments from the councillors.  I worked as an employee for an accountancy practice and I was a councillor.  That would come under the scope of section 8.  As a councillor and an employee in an office environment, one's salary would become declarable.  As a member of Chartered Accountants Ireland I know that I have to make a self declaration every year but it is not based on figures that would disclose commercially sensitive information from competitor to competitor.  In essence, if I was going to audit a client the travel expenses for the two or three weeks on that job would become declarable under the Act.  That would present a difficulty to any employer or individual doing audits or who is seconded for work.  That is ironic when one considers the content of the Bill.  It would provide a significant problem.</p> <p>  If someone in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is doing a farm inspection does he or she have to disclose travel expenses?  Where does the buck stop in that regard?  I am most concerned about that measure.  There is an onus on public representatives in terms of transparency when dealing with sensitive issues such as land zoning but I cannot see the logic in somebody holding down an ordinary job in the private sector being required to disclose the salary and the associated expenses.  If a rep is going around selling tyres who is getting genuine travel expenses that are approved by the Revenue in terms of that private sector company's return it is beyond me why they would become declarable.  The committee needs to bring those concerns to the Minister.</p><p>It makes it very difficult for politics to attract the best people.  In terms of attracting good people, when I became a councillor eight or ten years ago it might have been very difficult for me to run for election while working in the private sector given that all the information relating to the firm I work for would be in the public domain.  That would probably not be allowable from my perspective.  The issue is very serious.</p></speech>

This is a very important Bill which will have significant consequences for councillors not just for the foreseeable future but in the long term.  I totally agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputies Calleary and Peter Burke and the Senators who have spoken.  The two organisations will have to take a close look at the Bill.  Some expertise will be required in order to assist them and give advice.  They can draft amendments and give them to the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  As Deputy Burke outlined in his case, this has consequences for every person that is employed who wants to be a public representative as well.</p> <p>  If the Bill was introduced in its present form it would take a considerable amount of time to train the 900 or so councillors throughout the country.  How do the witnesses envisage that would be done?  Would it be entirely up to the Department to do it or would it be the role of the local authorities?  As has been said, any member of the public could make a complaint and ignorance of the legislation on the part of a public representative will not be a defence.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh said she got a shock when she went to Mayo County Council and saw the number of auctioneers in it.  That could well be the case, but as she can imagine, given a councillor's workload one would probably need to have another job and auctioneering was probably a neat fit.  However, that is not the case at the moment because one must be qualified to be an auctioneer and there are educational attainments one must have.  It is a completely different scenario now.</p> <p>  In the case of a material contravention or a rezoning under the Bill a meeting might not be able to take place at all because of the presence of a solicitor, auctioneer or landowner from a particular area and if they all declared an interest in it, that they might have an interest in the future or that it might affect them in the future, as the Bill specifies, there might not be any councillors present to pass a material change to a plan.  The Bill has very serious consequences for public representatives.  It needs very close scrutiny by experts and for amendments to be drafted to it.</p></speech>

I have a serious concern with the way the Department is treating councillors and their representative bodies.  Do you intend to bring in the Department to clarify some of the issues raised in terms of meetings and consultations with the representative bodies?  Some of the things that have emerged are shocking and how the Department has dressed up its meetings with various representative bodies and councillors.  As we have heard, there has been little to no consultation with them.  That has really opened my eyes.  Fair play to you, Chairman, for airing this matter today.</p> <p>  There seems to be a serious disconnect between the Department and the reality of councillors' lives.  Currently, councillors are paid less than cleaners or service attendants in the Civil Service.  They are grouped in the same section as Secretaries General and CEOs, who earn salaries of between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000 per annum.</p><p>There is a serious disconnect in where they fit in along the system here.  The witnesses, Mr. O'Connell in LAMA and Mr. McEntire, Mr. O'Reilly and Mr. Connor-Scarteen in the AILG, might clarify from their experience where they this see in relation to turning people away from entering politics.  I refer to the new regulation in regard to pay and expenses, secretarial supports etc.</p></speech>

I am in local politics now since 1985, which is 32 years and quite a long time.  It is becoming more and more restrictive.  When a Bill like this comes before us the implications are severe.  At the moment local authorities are haemorrhaging young councillors.  Local authorities and communities need young vibrant councillors.  All these restrictions being put in by the Department make it complicit in this.  They are trying to put a bush in every gap.  Everywhere one turns there are more regulations.  We get an average of &euro;16,000 a year before tax.  One will not feed oneself nor a family on that without another job.  I cannot understand why it is being entertained in the Oireachtas.  Most if not all in this room has probably come up through council level.  The people in the Department know nothing about local government or what is involved.  We have to be adjudicated on every five years when we go before the people.  If we are not up to scratch, or even if we are doing a good job, we can be thrown out.  I think that is the best barometer of all.  Ninety-eight percent of councillors are compliant.  We have to fill declaration form after declaration form every year.  It is time that someone inside here in this big house just cried stop.  These are draconian measures to us.  We cannot afford it.  We do not have the administrative backup to fill out all these forms.  Members hardly have it themselves here in the Oireachtas.  It is completely prohibitive for young councillors to come in.  They come into every council chamber in Ireland to represent their communities.  We need some support to support our communities.  There is a lot in this Bill that is simply not going to work.</p></speech>

I am slightly longer in politics.  I am in it for 38 years.  When I entered politics first there was no money in it.  It is back to that again.  What Senator Burke has said is true.  I worked at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I kept the two jobs going.  I cannot see now that would suffice.  If I was out working with farmers and receiving representations from them I do not think that would be allowed now.  I can tell Senator Conway-Walsh that she need not worry about too much money or handouts coming into councillors' pockets any more.  That day is long and truly gone.

We could have a scenario where people who are retired and people who are wealthy enter politics.  Younger people who might be well educated and involved in their community, with great intentions, will be discouraged.  Many people are not entering it for money.  When one is starting on a basic of &euro;16,000, with some little add-ons, it does not amount to much.</p><p>We might end up with only single people entering politics.  People with families could not survive on a councillor's wage.  We have to make declarations every January and everything is put down on paper by us.  As my colleague said, we go before the people every five years.  If they do not think we are up to scratch, they can dump us out.  With all due respect to the Members, who made some very valid points, many councillors work as hard as any Senator or Deputy.  That is a fact.</p></speech>

However, what we are in effect being asked to do in this Bill is to engage in a crystal ball syndrome.  How we can be asked as local authority members to foresee the future in two years is absolutely beyond me.  That is what we are being asked to do in this Bill and it makes absolutely no sense.  Senator Davitt asked where we see ourselves without secretarial support etc.  I refer back to an article in one of the national newspapers last week when the announcement was made by the Department regarding vouched and unvouched expenses for councillors as well as the new municipal district grant.  The headline stated "&euro;5,000 windfall for local councillors".  It is not.  It is absolutely not.  However, the public thinks that we as councillors are on this massive gravy train and that we are getting massive amounts of money.  There would those who wonder, if we are getting all this money, why are we fighting about a bit more scrutiny over the issues we need to report and declarable interests etc.</p> <p>  It is often lost in the debate that we as councillors pay PRSI and USC.  It was not up until a few months ago that we were entitled to the State pension.  Prior to that we were not.  We have had many councillors who have given more than 40 years service, and when they retired after putting on a stamp for all those years, they were entitled to nothing.  Mr. O'Connell hit the nail on the head.  We are asking the Oireachtas Members to cry stop.  There is not much more we can take as councillors.  That is being totally and utterly honest.  I have no doubt that the Members have been doing their best.  However, today we are here once again with another raft of nonsense that is being put on our shoulders as councillors.  To be fair, Senator Conway-Walsh asked whether it will prohibit diversity.  Diversity is going very fast.  Mr. O'Connell has spoken of a haemorrhaging of people out of our councils.  It is happening day in, day out.</p></speech>

If the points that we made in our submission were to be drafted into proposed specific amendments, we would have no problem sending them in and getting that done.  Again, we would take the Members' advice on whether they can accept any more amendments and depending on how far it has gone.</p> <p>  In regard to the training of members on this new Bill, the AILG has a training remit under the 2014 local government reforms.</p><p>The representative body took on a training remit with our members.  As I stated, we had a module on ethics and governance for our local authority members in 2015.  We are to follow that up with another module once this legislation goes through.  That is what we tentatively agreed with our line Department, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p> Local authorities have a training remit in respect of their elected members.  If, however, our members are to be classified as category A public officials, their return will be straight to the commissioner.  I envisage local authorities saying they have no role if the return is made straight to the commissioner and that, if one wants training or knowledge, one should talk to the commissioner.  The local authorities might say they have no obligation.  At present, returns are made to the local authority so help and support exist for elected members in making those returns.  If our members were reclassified as category B public officials, the returns would still be to their body, which is their local authority.  There would be internal help.</p><p> Senator Davitt referred to consultation.  The first official correspondence we got from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was on 11 May 2017.  We responded to that in a letter.  I sent the details to the Chairman in September.  We are very grateful for the opportunity to appear here today.  I thank the Chairman and members for this.</p><p> The report was published in 2015.  The first official correspondence we got was on 11 May 2017.  I believe that was because the committee asked the Department officials directly whether they had consulted the councillors' representative bodies or the elected members themselves.  At that stage, they said, "No".  That is what we got our first correspondence on.  We will follow up on the discussion today and send our submission to the officials.  If amendment is required in following up, we will take the committee's advice on whether it is appropriate or still possible.</p></speech>

Officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were before us.  The Department did a public sector standards briefing on the Bill in the audiovisual room.  I was the only member of the Oireachtas present.  At the time, there did not seem to be that much concern.  Only for the Chairman, me and a number of other members of this committee saying it was not going any further until we had a response, there would have been a different outcome.  We were told by the Department that it wrote to the delegates and that they did not respond.  That is what we heard although it is clear the delegates sent us the submissions they made.  We do not know where they went, therefore.  They went into the Department but the Minister says he never got them or saw them.  There was no reaction and everything was regarded as fine.  The legislation was approved just before the last general election so many of us were not Members at the time.  It is deeply flawed in how it is put together and how it will work in practice.  I refer to declaring everything one owns every three or four months and having to record all one's assets, with the possibility of having to go before some kind of investigation or tribunal, through no fault of one&rsquo;s own, if one accidentally leaves something out.  One could end up being prosecuted and in jail.  Of course there should be sanctions for genuine wrongdoing and the abuse of one's position.  When the Revenue Commissioners have access to all the information anyway and one declares it all to them when calculating one's income tax, why the involvement of SIPO, or whatever it will be named in the future?  If it were not for the Chairman and many members of the committee saying there was to be no further progress further until they heard a response, the delegates would not have been brought in.  Neither AILG nor LAMA would be here.  I commend the Chairman in this regard.  I commend all the members who sat diligently with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who said all was fine, that everyone was happy, that there is no issue with the legislation and that everyone wanted to get it through as fast as they could.  There is a huge administrative burden for people who are trying to engage in local government, most with another job.  Who can live and raise a family on &euro;16,000 a year before paying PRSI and the universal social charge?  As stated, the PRSI class, involving a payment rate of 4%, gave nothing.  In fact, the only people in the entire public service who do not get pensions are councillors.  People sometimes need to remember that.</p> <p>  It is important to note that submissions were sent in by the delegates.  They were mislaid or lost somewhere.  We now have the delegates' input and we can go back to the Department with it and say people are not happy and that we need a more streamlined, easy method with an explanation as to why work needs to be duplicated or triplicated.</p><p>I thank all the delegates for attending.  None of them is being paid to be here.  I thank the four councillors who are here, Mr. Tom Moylan and Mr. Liam Kenny for all their work.</p></speech>

I spent 25 years in local government from 1979.  I served half the time with my father.  Councillor McEntire met him over the years.  I have a deep understanding of local government and the commitment people make to improve their communities.  However, in the context of the Bill, this is a national issue.  Councillors from all over the country will, therefore, rely heavily on the two bodies that represent them.  I wish to put that in context because this House has changed dramatically over the years and the responsibility of the national representative bodies, inside or outside politics, has become far more important than it used to be, particularly in the context of influencing legislation such as the Bill under discussion.  On a Tuesday or Wednesday, one could meet a lobbyist from any quarter in this building.  Lobbyists are constantly making efforts to change Bills, insert provisions in them and make them better for their own sector.  The delegates' organisations have to be far more vigilant in this regard.  I say that constructively and in the context of how this Bill was developed and came before us.</p> <p>  There are measures in this Bill that I believe the delegates have not addressed.  They need to be addressed.  Senator Paddy Burke stated there is a need for the delegates to examine the Bill in the context of suggesting amendments or improvements.  The Bill does not just affect local authorities but also all of us in these Houses.  The Bill is about the office of a public sector standards commissioner.  One can say what one likes about SIPO but it has been helpful in its interpretation of matters and one can speak to its officials.  The proposed body is a different office.  A range of powers are to be given to the commissioner that are way above and beyond those of SIPO.  One needs to understand that.  The delegates highlighted in their contributions how this Bill affects them practically but they should examine the strength and powers of the commissioner also because, regardless of our discussion, this legislation will be implemented in some shape or form.  All of us in the room acknowledge the reasons it has to be implemented.</p> <p>  The delegates stated income in excess of &euro;2,600 is a declarable interest.  They referred to the source of any income related to a consultant or adviser and to contracts and interests of public officials.  The legislation sets out the incomes in excess of which one has to file a report.  The legislation refers to shares, bonds and holdings, in addition to public and private information.  The body of the Bill refers to any interest being an interest of the spouse or child of the public official concerned.</p><p>The person is being asked not only to account for themselves but for others who may not want to be accountable to them.  That is a fact.  It further suggests the values and what they exceed and how they should be reported.  It refers to <i>ad hoc</i>arrangements if a person wants to make a declaration in the course of the year.  That only draws attention to something that can be interpreted as something the person did wrong.  I do not understand why it cannot be a year on year declaration when there is an understanding within the Bill of the problems that can be caused, whether by mischief or otherwise or the interpretation of the press or otherwise.  None of that seems to be understood in the Bill.  It seems to be a case that we are all guilty of something or other because of the sins of the past, not because of what we are doing today.  <br/><br/>To highlight what I regard as the extreme parts of the Bill, it refers to examining the interests of people other than a person's immediate family, a brother or a sister.  I know what mine would tell me.  Part of the Bill which we have questioned involves a disclosure on legal or medical services, including psychiatric and psychological services.  It goes on to deal with the powers of the commissioner.<br/><br/>This meeting is the start of a process.  There is much more in the Bill that the delegates have not had time to examine and that will have a serious impact on their members and the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I want to disclose.  I want to comply with the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, but I do not want someone to peer into aspects of my life such as bank balances and current accounts.  There is a limit to all of this.  Members of the Houses must examine it, but the delegates' organisations must examine it in far more detail and come back with their suggestions, amendments or appropriate commentary on its overall direction.<br/><br/>Time is important because there is urgency on the part of the Minister and others in the House to bring the Bill to a conclusion.  It is a start of the examination.  We will send the Official Report on proceedings at this meeting to the Department and the Minister and the delegates' first go at their submission, but we will say they may come back with more information.  Each political party will be encouraged to examine the Bill and put forward its amendments. <br/><br/>I acknowledge the work councillors do.  It is underrated and not appreciated.  The method the Oireachtas has come at during the tenure of successive Governments is not fair in respect of how they are remunerated and their expenses offset.  It should be far more clear andtransparent and show more appreciation of the work councillors do.  That should be reflected in how they are paid.  The more democracy has developed at local and national level the greater the onus has been on local government members to comply with all of this stuff.  We need to recognise the cost of that compliance and the onerous task it now is.</p></speech>

We make declarations every year, although my circumstances do not change from year to year.  I would love to see a simple form that asks whether anything has changed in a person's circumstances from the commencement of their time as a councillor.  That would be logical.  If a person has bought or sold land, for example, he or she should include that information, but he or she should not have to go through the whole rigmarole and get a peace commissioner to sign it.</p><p>It would be good if we could bring about some change in that regard because we are inundated with paper and do the same thing every year when I respond with the same information.  There has been no change from five years ago and I am sure it is the same for councillors.  If a councillor has a house, a piece of ground or a business, that information is declared.</p><p> The delegates and their organisations are very influential.  I ask them to, please, simplify things and cut out the nonsense because the information is declared on the first day a person is elected to the county council for a five-year term.  If he or she is asked each year whether there has been a change in his or her circumstances and he or she says "No" when there has been a change, he or she could be in difficulty if something is unearthed.  Only a small amount of housekeeping is needed.  This also applies to Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Next January I will go through the same things again, giving every little detail which has to be signed by a peace commissioner, but what is the point? </p></speech>

We want to comply, but we need to make it simple.  The Department needs to come back to us on this point, but let us simplify it and have a copy of the form that might be used.  My concern about legislation is that it is like county development plans; it is passed with honest intent and sincere objectives, but its interpretation can cause difficulties.  Alongside the legislation we would need to see the simplified version of the document that would be used to make the return.</p> <p>  On that note we will conclude.  I thank each and every one of the delegates for coming and making a constructive contribution.</p></speech>

I will address the progress the Department is making with the objectives and actions that have been set out in respect of Irish language and bilingual services throughout the Civil Service.  I am grateful to the Chair for her understanding of the fact that my level of Irish is not sufficiently developed to speak in Irish this afternoon.  I will speak in English for that reason.</p> <p>  Irish language use is a core Government policy objective.  The availability of staff with Irish language proficiency in the Civil Service continues to be an important component of that policy.  The questionnaire sent to all Departments by this committee last December was returned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in January of this year.  I can confirm that the Department reviews the level of demand for the provision of its services through the Irish language by monitoring the number of queries and requests received through Irish.  As the committee will be aware, the Department's principal customers are the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister of State, the Government and the Oireachtas, through which it serves the public and its elected representatives.  The Department also engages with other Departments and serving and retired staff in the public service.</p> <p>  In formulating its advice, the Department must have regard to the views of a wide range of interests, including the social partners, business and sectoral representatives, research forums and institutions and EU and international bodies.  It must also consider the views and expectations of society at large.  The nature of its functions and work means the Department does not have a high level of direct contact with, or provide schemes and services directly to, individual members of the general public.  The number of Irish speakers available in the Department and its offices now stands at seven, ranging in grade from clerical officer to assistant principal.  They are willing to provide services to the public through the medium of Irish.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for the Irish language in the Civil Service.  While the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility for the Irish language in the Civil Service, each Department is ultimately responsible for identifying and addressing its Irish language needs, particularly with regard to the provision of public services in Gaeltacht areas.  I do not intend to speak about the history of the Irish language in the Civil Service, other than to say the current arrangements were introduced in October 2013 following consideration of the award of bonus marks in competitions.  The intention of this change was to increase the cohort of functional bilinguals in the Civil Service to reflect a more competency-based approach to recruitment and, where appropriate, promotion competitions.  Reviews have been initiated by various Ministers with responsibility for Irish, the Gaeltacht and the islands.</p> <p>  Following concerns expressed about the current system of providing for functional bilinguals, the Government considered the matter in May of this year and agreed to publish an amending Bill to be called the official languages (amendment) Bill 2017.  This Bill, along with the main language Act, will seek to ensure effective supports are in place for people who wish to carry out their affairs with the State through the Irish language.  The main head in the Bill from the Department's perspective is head 9, the overall objectives of which are to ensure a certain percentage of new recruits to the public service are Irish speakers, to provide that all public offices in Gaeltacht areas operate through the medium of Irish and to increase the capacity of public bodies to provide public services through Irish.  As is standard with any Bill, the Government decision provides for consultation with other Departments.  This has taken place between officials in both Departments.</p> <p>  I want to mention an initiative that was taken by my Department and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2013 to improve the provision of language training proficiency for the Civil Service and certain public service organisations.  The Department put in place a service level agreement with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for the provision of language training proficiency testing for the Civil Service and certain public service organisations.  It is understood that Foras na Gaeilge has a contract in place with Gaelchult&uacute;r Teoranta for the provision of Irish language training to the public service.  I understand that since 2013, some 304 civil servants and 4,744 other public service employees have attended courses run by Gaelchult&uacute;r.  The purpose of the service level agreement was to support staff in developing their proficiency in the Irish language and to enhance the capacity of the Civil Service and other bodies to provide services to the public through Irish.  The agreement is particularly important in the context of the Official Languages Act 2003 and the 20 year strategy for the Irish language, which runs from 2010 to 2030.</p> <p>  One of the key elements of the new Civil Service learning and development model is a common suite of training programmes.  The suite contains 70 new training modules, two of which relate specifically to Irish language training.  Following a tender process, Gaelchult&uacute;r Teoranta was the successful tenderer for Irish language training.  The learning and development project team, along with other Irish language experts, has met Gaelchult&uacute;r's training specialists and has carried out an initial review of the existing accredited Irish language training programmes.  A more indepth review is ongoing to ensure the current accredited Irish language training programmes fully address business needs.</p><p>As I have mentioned, Gaelchult&uacute;r has an existing tender to deliver Irish language training to the public sector.  I understand this will expire in 2018.  The learning and development framework, which is complementary to this contract, is for civil servants only and not for the wider public sector.  This framework has a two-year duration up to 2019, with an option to extend for a further two years if necessary.</p><p> The new mobility scheme for clerical and executive officers, which was launched across the Civil Service last week, will not be fully operational until March 2018.  It will allow staff members to mention their Irish language skills on their applications.  It will be possible for people with such skills to be offered a mobility move out of sequence to an available position that requires a functional bilingual.  I am sure the committee will accept that genuine efforts are being made to increase the number of functional bilinguals in the Civil Service.  We do not suggest that the situation is ideal.  As the committee will be aware, Ireland is coming out of a difficult economic period.  Obviously, such issues have had some implications for our approach to recruitment, particularly with the surge in demand in recent years.   I welcome the opportunity to hear the views of the committee.  I will be happy to respond to questions and to provide more information and clarification.</p></speech>

It revoked the policy of awarding bonus marks for Irish language proficiency in Civil Service recruitment and promotion competitions.  It replaced the bonus marks policy with measures that sought to increase the cohort of functional bilinguals in the Civil Service.  This was done to reflect a more competency-based approach to recruitment and, where appropriate, promotion competitions.  There is an onus on individual Departments to identify skill sets across the board, including in the cases of positions that require proficiency in Irish.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would become aware of that in two ways, the first of which is the workforce planning process, which has been deployed throughout the Civil Service and has been reinforced through the people strategy that was approved recently.  It is intended that, over the course of a three-year horizon, we will identify the kinds of vacancies that require people with proficiency in Irish.  That, in essence, is what I understand is meant by functional bilinguals.</p> <p>  The second way in which we become aware of the needs in this area is through the Public Appointments Service, which is asked to manage recruitment of promotion competitions in which proficiency in Irish is a requirement.</p><p>We are also made aware of vacancies through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, which is requested to recruit people or to manage promotion competitions for positions in which proficiency in Irish is a requirement.  PAS originally used an organisation called Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge but in recent years it has devised its own assessment process, which it is satisfied is robust, to identify sufficient proficiency to fill vacancies in which Irish is required.  I need to be reminded----</p></speech>

I believe that responsibility has passed to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This Department's responsibility in the first instance has been discharged by the putting in place of the Gaelchult&uacute;r contract.  This allows Departments to draw on the expertise of that organisation to train up their people.  In the current circumstances, this Department's learning and development module is rolling out a learning and development scheme across the Civil Service.  Through a consultation process with the Departments a number of skills have been identified for the scheme.  One such skill is proficiency in the Irish language.  As I indicated to the Chair, the Department is in the course of putting in place a facility through Gaelchult&uacute;r Teoranta.  This organisation will provide Irish language training to the Civil Service up to a proficiency of honours leaving certificate.  Through a business partner process which helped build and develop the model, this level has been deemed by various Departments as sufficient for their Irish language requirements.</p></speech>

We can speak about individuals who have been specifically recruited for positions which require proficiency in the Irish language.  Some of my colleagues came directly into the Civil Service without being recruited through competitions which required proficiency in Irish and would be fluent Irish speakers.  It would be very difficult to establish.  We can give some indication by looking at those whom we have recruited in recent years into posts specifically requiring proficiency in Irish, but I have no idea in a wider sense.</p></speech>

The intention was that Departments would identify positions which required functional bilinguals in their workforce plans and we would seek to recruit such people either through promotion or through external recruitment.  We would use the good offices of the Public Appointments Service in that regard.  One of the supports my Department put in place with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht was an arrangement with Gaelchult&uacute;r Teoranta which provides Irish language training support, to be drawn upon by individual Departments as they saw fit.  It was not up to us to determine that.  That contract covers the Civil Service and the public service and is still extant.  As I said in my opening statement, it expires in 2018.</p> <p>  Right now the Civil Service is rolling out a new learning and development module which is centrally driven by my Department.  It is designed to meet the identified demands of other Departments.  Two of the 70 modules which have currently been identified relate to the Irish language and will be rolled out in the first quarter of 2018.  Gaelchult&uacute;r successfully tendered to provide those modules.  We are currently evaluating the standard on offer, but we expect to be able to sign off on a training programme which will provide language training for Irish speakers up to and including honours Irish standard.  The training module will be available to Departments but we cannot tell them to avail of it.  We can tell them that it is there and we would expect them, as part of their own training needs analysis or recruitment process, to avail of it as and when it is necessary.  The approach was designed in consultation with Departments who, through a business partner process, worked with my colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to identify the whole range of skills which needed learning and development interventions, one of which was the Irish language.  As I said, we are currently evaluating the standard, but the indications are that there will not be an issue with the organisation, with which we are very familiar.  I expect that training intervention will be available in the first quarter of 2018.</p></speech>

First of all, to understand current policy, it is not the case that we provide learning and development opportunities <i>per se</i>.  I am sorry, let me rephrase that.  As it stands, the recruitment process specifically directed at proficiency in Irish is based on an identified departmental or office need, that is, we are told the organisations need those individuals.  As I said, such people are recruited through competition, whether through internal promotion or through the Public Appointments Service, and their proficiency is tested to ensure they have the competency and skill for the job.  We are supporting that through a learning and development initiative which has been rolling out since September in respect of other skill sets and which will roll out in respect of Irish language training in the first quarter of 2018.  As I understand it, the Senators question was on the opportunities available for people who choose to learn Irish back in their Departments.  I can only speak for my own Department, where there is every opportunity.  For example, when we sought to identify people who would make themselves available to assist in translation, in answering telephones or indeed in assisting me in preparing for today, people had every opportunity to do so.  Their roles do not necessarily require the Irish language <i>per se</i>.  It is a case of them making themselves available or offering their expertise in circumstances where we need or have requested them.<br/><br/>However, it is not a prerequisite for the Gaelchult&uacute;r programme that one is to be proficient in Irish.  The course is available to civil servants through their own Departments.  It clearly makes sense for people who have proficiency in Irish to go on it if they wish to increase their proficiency, but there is no prohibition on individual civil servants who wish to improve their Irish language going on the Gaelchult&uacute;r programme, as and when it is approved.  That is a matter for individual Departments.  </p></speech>

It would, therefore, appear at this point in time that supply is greater than demand.  In terms of the 20%, we recognise that we are not attracting native Irish speakers to the extent that we would like and, at this stage, we have run two significant competitions.  They would normally be recruited at the clerical officer and executive officer level.  We have reviewed the way we run those competitions and, following the first review, we targeted media and various other outlets with which we felt Irish speakers would be familiar and increased the cadre of people who have proficiency in Irish.  As we seek to embed workforce planning in the Civil Service, the next iteration will be far more targeted on schools and colleges and will try to indicate the career possibilities individuals might have as and when they graduate from school or college.  That is the criticality in terms of the three year workforce plan.  We need to be able to say to people what possibilities will be there in 2019, 2020 or 2021.  We think that would significantly improve the uptake or the interest of people with Irish in roles in the Civil Service.</p></speech>

Anecdotally, I am aware of individuals in Gaeltacht areas where I holiday, ironically enough, who would see national school teaching as a more viable option in terms of career possibilities.  We need to ensure that the Civil Service is seen as an outlet for those with proficiency in Irish to develop their skills and advance their careers.  We know that we need to improve the way we market the Civil Service as an entity and there is considerable work going into that.  I do not think it is a case of a lack of will.</p></speech>

Those are the statistics that are in front of me.  The determination of the requirement of proficiency in Irish in other Departments is a matter for those other Departments.  It is up to us, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, to ensure that we can recruit to meet that demand and beyond due to an overarching objective of being quite inclusive.  We are satisfied that we can satisfy the existing demand for proficiency in Irish subject to the one or two exceptions I mentioned earlier where a particularly high proficiency is required.  I cannot say how the demand is assessed in other Departments.  I have some indication of how it is assessed in our own Department which is largely by the demand for the services.  I cannot speak for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners or other organisations, however.  They assess their own demand via their own workforce planning forces.</p></speech>

Our current policy is that the determination of what Departments require in terms of proficiency in Irish is a matter for themselves.  Our Department required individual Departments and offices to amend their workforce planning framework to include a section in all future workforce plans identifying posts or areas of work requiring functional bilinguals.  In this context, having regard to the implementation of the Gaeltacht Act 2012, Departments were asked about particular attention to posts located in or serving Gaeltacht areas.  The view at the time was, and still is, that the process would be central to ensuring future recruitment competitions to administrative grades would make sufficient provision for appointment to posts requiring functional bilinguals.  The aggregate data from this process would be used to assess the demand for functional bilinguals in recruitment campaigns to the Civil Service.  That demand is assessed by us and, as I said earlier, with one or two exceptions we have been able to meet it.  The Senator quoted a line from a film - "If you build it, he will come."  However, I cannot answer that particular question.  We respond to what is identified to us as a skill requirement or a proficiency requirement across the Civil Service.  The same applies in our own Department.</p> <p>  I would be grateful if I was reminded of the other questions.</p></speech>

In the past number of years, there has therefore been a surge in recruitment.  We would freely admit that we have been a lot more reactive than we would like to have been.  We would like to be a lot more strategic.  We have developed and are in the process of rolling out a people strategy for the Civil Service.  This places a particular focus on workforce planning, not just on an annual basis but over a three year period.  We want to see Departments and offices identifying what they believe will be the proficiency requirement over the rolling three years.  The reason is that we think it will enhance our ability to recruit what are termed functional bilinguals.  That is the term in the documentation I have seen.  One of our problems is that we do not market the Civil Service as effectively as we should.  We are in a better position to indicate over a three year horizon the possibilities that are available if individuals wish to have a career as Gaeilge.  It is anecdotal but I am aware from my own personal experience that, for example, a lot of fluent Irish speakers see national school teaching as an option before they will even consider the Civil Service.  We are trying to change that image by having a more bespoke approach to recruitment based on a rolling three year workforce plan.</p></speech>

All I can speak to today is the demand as conveyed to us across the Civil Service and our ability to meet that demand.  As I said, with one or two exceptions, we have been able to meet the demand.

Many organisations may well have achieved their disability targets.  There is a reluctance on people to declare that they are disabled and there are complications about running bespoke competitions for people with disabilities.  Our sense is that we should encourage people with disabilities to apply for all competitions, recognising that we have an obligation to take reasonable measures to accommodate them in terms of, first, the application process and, second, in Departments if they are successful.</p></speech>

The Department identifies its requirements and we try to ensure that we are efficient in terms of our recruitment processes, which is why the principle is to aggregate the individual demands.  Departments also have what are known as delegated sanctions.  The position the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform adopted a number of years ago where it could prescribe what should and should not happen has been relaxed by it by delegating sanctions to Departments up to certain levels to determine what their own resources should be and the composition of those resources.</p></speech>

This Department has put in place the mechanism by which Departments and offices can identify their requirements.  From our point of view, we would work with the Public Appointments Service to ensure as best we can that the requirement is met.  That is the key contribution.</p></speech>

We know we are not getting through to the market.  We believe we could be far more confident of recruiting Irish speakers.  There are a number of reasons for that.  We are not getting through to the schools and colleges in sufficient time to try to create a sense of opportunity when they graduate.  The Irish language is one of many areas in which this applies.  We are probably a little too conservative, or were until recently, in our use of social media to try to appeal to younger people, in particular.  We have taken a number of initiatives based on research within our own people.  It is focused on recruitment.  I appreciate that the Senator has asked a wider question that relates to assessing the extent to which the public would avail of services if they were made available through Irish.  I can take the question back to the Department.</p></speech>

I did some market research in a previous job.  If one wants to gauge the need for a service, one engages a company to take a sample of the population and ask a number of questions about the types of services people would like to use.  Potentially, one such question could be "would you use a service as Gaeilge if it was available?".  That would be a much more accurate measure of demand than asking the Departments to self-refer, as such.</p></speech>
