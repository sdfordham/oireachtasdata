Agreed.  There are no matters arising from the minutes.</p> <p>  We will deal with correspondence sent since 14 May.  Item 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  Item 3A.1, correspondence dated 14 May 2015 from the HSE, is a follow-up to the meeting on 23 April 2015 and it is to be noted and published.</p><p> Item 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 24 April 2015, from Mr. John Doyle, CEO, Credit Union Restructuring Board, which is a follow-up to our meeting of 11 December 2014.  This is to be noted.</p><p> Item 3A.3 is correspondence, dated 20 May 2015, from Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, regarding the PAC draft report on fisheries harbour centres, which is to be noted.  Having received the Department's update, we can now go ahead and prepare a final draft of the report for consideration by the committee.  We will do that at our next meeting.  The Dail is not sitting next week, so it will be after that.  In view of the discussion the committee has already had on this report, is there a need for another draft or will we just go to the final report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#B00200"><p>I have not gone through what is in the response from the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

We will then circulate a final draft arising from that, so the next step will be to publish the report.</p></speech>

That is to be noted and published.  That is a short letter in which he informs us that the overpayments or additional payments being made have now ended.  Did we get an explanation as to how those arose in the first place?</p></speech>

However, he is reporting the assurance of the president of UCC that the allowances have stopped.</p></speech>

Item 3A.5 is correspondence, dated 25 May 2015, from the HSE and is a follow-up to our meeting on 23 April 2015, which is to be noted and published.  This issue relates to the procurement of investigators and the use of former staff of the health services.  We are due to consider a report on this shortly.  Has that report been circulated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#B01000"><p>It has, yes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#B01200"><p>It is a short report but it is very strong.  The work the clerk has put into this is excellent.  The kernel of it boils down to chapter two and the recommendations at the end.  What we have discovered is that when it comes to individuals it is not possible to put a specific ban on former employees of the HSE.  However, the step that needs to be taken is that authority to appoint investigators should be taken away from the HSE.  That should be put to one side.  That is effectively where we have gone with this.  Therefore, even though one cannot ban former employees specifically on a personal basis, taking these investigations away from the HSE, particularly the ones that are extremely sensitive and actually involve potential conflict of interest, is probably the appropriate step.  I think that is what the Minister should consider.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  She is looking at this entire area, including the idea of putting panels together.  The work of her office is working in tandem with the report that we have put together.  There is an understanding that this area needs to be dealt with once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#B01300"><p>In line with that report, I wish to raise an issue that was brought to my attention by way of correspondence, although I do not have it with me.  An investigation took place concerning Kilkenny.  When the report arising from that investigation was sought, it was not released and neither were the details of the procurement process.  Before finalising the report, we might ask that question of the HSE and determine the details surrounding it.</p></speech>

We will publish it then.</p> <p>  Item 3A.6 is correspondence, dated 27 May 2015, from Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Foghlu, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, regarding the technological university designation process.   That is to be noted and published.  We will have a follow-up meeting on this with the Department, the HEA and Mr. Michael Kelly.  What is the date?</p></speech>

It is to be noted and published.  This correspondence is relevant to our meeting of 18 June 2015.</p> <p>  Item 3B concerns individual correspondence.  Item 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 1 May 2015, from Deputy Sean Fleming regarding wards of court.  This is to be noted.  We will consider this matter in the context of our upcoming report on wards of court.</p> <p>  It was interesting to hear on the radio this morning that they gave a complete breakdown of their activity and investments.  They gave lots of information on the radio, yet they could not give it to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was an interesting intervention at this point.  I am sure there was a press release with it, so we must get that and include it in our consideration when they attend.  It is funny how organisations like that get up to speed when they are mentioned at this committee.  They then head off to the radio to ensure they bypass the committee.</p></speech>

This is to be noted and forwarded to the OPW for a response on the matters raised.  This matter was raised through an advertisement in a magazine, which set out several issues and concerns.  We will note it but there is no harm in publishing it because it is already well published.  We are asking for a comprehensive response from the OPW.</p> <p>  Item 3B.6 is correspondence, from Mr. Joe O&rsquo;Brien, managing director, Medilink, regarding payment to the Order of Malta.  This is to be noted and published and forwarded to Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, for a note on the procurement issue arising. </p> <p>  Item 3B.7 is correspondence, dated 25 May 2015, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills regarding an update on issues in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.  These issues were brought to our attention by a whistleblower and the response from the Department is set out there.  The issues raised by the whistleblower, and the response, need to be dealt with in detail with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; when they come in.  One of the concerns I have is that the figures originally quoted, for example, in terms of the due diligence were somewhere in the region of &euro;200,000 and later it was disclosed that in fact it was far more than that.  Some of the figures put before us do not match from one piece of correspondence to another.  The matter needs to be clarified.  We will have to deal with this in far more detail.  While we have the correspondence, I do not accept the response to some of the points addressed.  We will deal with it when Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and the HEA come before us.</p> <p>  Item 3C is documents relating to today&rsquo;s meeting, which are the opening statements, 3C.1 and 3C.2, all to be noted and published. </p> <p>  Item 4 is reports and statements received since our meeting on 14 May.  There are three noted there.  On 4.3, the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown, attention is drawn to the fact that the required review by the institute of the effectiveness of the system of internal control for 2013 was carried out in June 2014, some ten months after the year end.

Deputy Jack Wall asked me to raise the issue of personal insurance and whether there is any mechanism whereby the Committee of Public Accounts could invite the Insurance Ombudsman or the Financial Services Ombudsman to explain how this operates.  There are allegations that because of the six-year rule if insurance companies offer products without fully divulging the payments, there is no recourse to chase them up after six years.  Is there any mechanism whereby the ombudsman can be brought in and asked about that issue?</p></speech>

The point I made earlier is that in one piece of correspondence it refers to due diligence at &euro;58,999 and in the Munster technical university project it refers to due diligence at &euro;350,185 and in the south east due diligence is at a cost of &euro;42,742.  When one sees the figures across the range of activities within that sector there is a huge difference.  The separate issues raised by a whistleblower in correspondence can be set out and it is clear there is an issue but the presentation of the letter from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; would lead one to believe there were no issues in this sector and I believe there are.  In the context of that meeting we should ask Mr. Kelly and Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; also to come in so that we can deal with matters beyond those dealt with there.  Are we agreed on our work programme?  We will probably launch the report the week after that.</p></speech>

Around two thirds of the expenditure was funded by the Exchequer, through the Vote for social protection, with one third funded by social insurance contributions.  An addendum to the appropriation account, which has been introduced for 2013, provides an analysis of the combined programme expenditure under the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund.  Figure 1, on screen for the members, shows how that programme spending is distributed between the broad programme areas.  As they can see, pensions account for &euro;6.5 billion of that total spend, while working age and income support amounts to  approximately &euro;5.5 billion.  Some &euro;3.4 billion goes on illness, disability and carer schemes and some &euro;2.3 billion to children.  Supplementary payments across various schemes amounted to approximately &euro;1 billion.  Taking account of payments between the fund and the Vote, the total cost of administration of the programmes in 2013 was around &euro;567 million, or 2.9% of the programme spend.</p> <p>  PRSI contributions are the main source of income for the Social Insurance Fund.  Since 2008, contributions received have been insufficient to meet the expenditure of the fund each year.  Accumulated surpluses were initially used to fund the annual deficit, but since 2010, the Exchequer has met the shortfall.  In 2013, the amount of subvention to the fund from the Vote was &euro;1.3 billion, a reduction of &euro;770 million from the 2012 figure.  The subvention for 2014 was lower again, at &euro;540 million.  During 2013, the fund also made use of a Central Fund advance facility to meet temporary cash flow shortfalls arising from the timing of PRSI receipts.  At year end, there was a balance of &euro;15 million owing to the central fund.  This amount was repaid in early 2014.</p> <p>  I have given a clear audit opinion on both the appropriation account of the Vote and the financial statements of the Social Insurance Fund.  However, I have drawn attention to certain matters in each certificate, including the issues reported on in the chapters that are before the committee this morning.  I have also drawn attention to the fact that the statement on internal financial control of the Vote discloses the occurrence in 2013 of instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules and the actions being taken by the Department to rectify them.</p> <p>  The level of irregular welfare scheme payments is referred to in the audit certificates of both the Vote and the fund.  Irregular payments arise where welfare recipients are paid benefits to which they are not entitled, or amounts that exceed their entitlements.  Such payments can arise as a result of deliberate fraud by claimants, from claimant errors or as a result of the manner in which claims are administered by Department staff.  Fraud and error surveys of welfare schemes carried out by the Department are intended to identify the types of cases where excess payments arise.  As I have reported previously, those surveys also provide a basis for estimating the underlying level of irregular payment.  The results of recent surveys suggest that there was a material level of payment in excess of entitlements in 2013 on both the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund. </p> <p>  Chapter 10 of my report reviews the results of the three most recent surveys in regard to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, rent supplement and for contributory pensions for widows, widowers and surviving civil partners.  The jobseekers&rsquo; survey estimated a level of fraud and error of a net 3.1% of the total amount in payment.  The result for rent supplement was 5% of the amount in payment.  For the widows', widowers' and surviving civil partners' contributory pension scheme, the level of payments found to be in excess of actual entitlements was lower, at around 0.7% of the total paid.  These results reflect the greater risk generally of excess payments occurring on social assistance schemes compared to social insurance schemes, where entitlement is usually more clear cut.  </p> <p>  The chapter notes that by the end of 2015, all schemes with annual expenditure over &euro;500 million will have been surveyed at least once, but it points out that for certain scheme areas the most recent surveys will be seven to ten years old by the time a new survey is scheduled to be carried out.  It also notes that only two of ten schemes in the &euro;100 million to &euro;500 million category have been surveyed.  Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the Department has committed to continue the programme of surveys over the medium term, and the improvements in the survey processes it has applied in recent years.  We have made some recommendations for further improvements in that process, most of which have been accepted by the Department. </p> <p>  Chapter 11 presents the results of an audit of the controls in place in regard to supplementary welfare allowances, which is designed as a "last-resort" scheme to assist those whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, or those of their dependants.  The scheme is unusual in that it has a number of different categories of payment, each with its own risks and claimant profiles.  These include weekly income support payments, weekly or monthly payments to provide support for specific ongoing needs, and one-off payments to meet specific, and often urgent, needs.  Total expenditure on supplementary welfare in 2013 amounted to &euro;611 million.</p><p>More than 90% was spent on basic supplementary welfare allowances, rent and mortgage interest supplement payments and exceptional or urgent needs payments.  Members of the committee will recall that responsibility for administration of the scheme transferred to the Department from the HSE in October 2011.  The scheme is administered mainly by the Department's community welfare service, CWS, which operates through a decentralised network in departmental local offices and local health centres.</p><p> Two cases of possible irregularities in supplementary welfare involving Department employees were identified in 2012.  These cases are under ongoing investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Consequently, apart from noting that the estimated loss to the Department for the two cases was &euro;1.2 million at the time we reported, their details are not included in the report.  Instead, the chapter focuses on the adequacy of the design and the operation of the key controls for the scheme.  We selected two community welfare offices to examine, one in Letterkenny and the other in Clondalkin.  For the record, these were not the offices affected by the two possible internal frauds.</p><p> Our examination found that there were significant issues with the operation of key controls.  Our findings were confirmed by internal audits and inspections undertaken by the Department's own staff in other offices.  We found that there was a significant backlog in the completion of management audits and a failure to carry out routine reviews of payments, controls that are particularly important in preventing and detecting internal fraud.  The audit also noted that procurement risks arose where the Department made direct payments to suppliers on behalf of claimants.  In some cases, the Department used single suppliers without carrying out a procurement process, resulting in a risk to the achievement of value for money and the favouring of certain suppliers.  The chapter includes a set of recommendations to strengthen the controls, which the Department has accepted.</p><p> Chapter 12 presents the results of an audit on the farm assist scheme, which provides income support for low-income farmers.  The scheme is part of the Department's activity in providing employment support for people of working age.  To qualify for the scheme, an applicant must be engaged in farming, be aged between 18 and 66 years and satisfy a means test.  Claimants must make annual declarations of ongoing entitlement and are obliged to notify the Department of any change in circumstances or means.  Expenditure on the scheme was &euro;99 million in 2013, down from &euro;108 million in 2012.  Farm assist is paid in respect of some 10,000 farmers, or approximately 7% of all farms.</p><p> The audit found that there was scope for improvement in terms of ensuring essential documentation was on file to support the payment of claims.  A high proportion of claims examined had been in payment for more than five years.  In two offices visited, required annual declarations were not on file for a significant proportion of cases and more than one third of cases examined across all offices visited had not been formally reviewed in the previous three years.  We recommended that the strategy for the review of farm assist cases and the annual declaration process should be improved.</p><p> Although the scheme has been in operation since 1999, there has to date been no formal evaluation of the extent to which the scheme is achieving its objectives of enabling claimants to continue farming and, thereby, helping to maintain the viability of rural communities.  The Department has pointed out that this is tied into rural development policy, which is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for allowing me to make a brief opening statement.  As well as examining the appropriation account for the Department of Social Protection and the Social Insurance Fund, SIF, statutory account for 2013, I understand that the committee wishes to examine the three chapters relevant to the Department that were in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2013.</p> <p>  As requested, last week I provided the committee with an update on the recommendations contained in the three chapters together with up-to-date expenditure figures, the provisional outturn for 2014 and estimates for 2015.  I also supplied a copy of our annual report 2014, the 2015-17 statement of strategy and the 2014 progress report on the compliance and anti-fraud strategy.  Overall, I hope that these documents indicate the scale and scope of the Department's work.</p> <p>  In summary, the work of the Department continues to focus on three key functions, those being, income support, activation of those of working age and control of fraud and abuse.  A long-standing primary objective of the social welfare system has been the provision of income supports.  Activation places a particular emphasis on measures to help long-term and young unemployed people to find a route back to employment.  The development of Intreo and active case management in particular play a vital part in ensuring that the Pathways to Work approach is a success.  In this regard, the Department is progressing a new initiative, JobPath, which is aimed at assisting those who are long-term unemployed in returning to the labour force.</p> <p>  Public confidence and trust in the welfare system requires us to be vigilant in tackling fraudulent activity.  However, let me be clear, in that the Department considers that the majority of people who are supported by the Department are exercising their legitimate rights and receiving their appropriate entitlements.</p> <p>  I will turn specifically to the chapters in the report.  Regarding the regularity of social welfare payments, the Department seeks to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is focused appropriately.  Fraud and error surveys play a key part in this activity.  The main objective in carrying out fraud and error surveys is to identify categories of cases on a particular scheme that present the highest risk of abuse.  Where necessary, control policies for all of the schemes that are surveyed are enhanced as a result of the findings to strengthen the controls that are in place.</p> <p>  The Department is completing two surveys of illness benefit and invalidity pension, each of which incorporates a medical eligibility element.  We expect to complete the surveys in mid-2015 and copies of the results will be forwarded to the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee.  In terms of future surveys, under the 2014-18 compliance and anti-fraud strategy, the Department is committed to undertaking at least two fraud and error surveys each year up to the end of 2017.  The Department is also developing predictive analytics models for three of its main working age schemes, those being, jobseeker's, one-parent family and disability allowance.  Existing customer information is being used to build analytics models with the aim of detecting more risky and non-compliant cases more efficiently.  The project will also assist in identifying trends and improving processes and controls across the Department.  The jobseeker's model will be rolled out in September.</p> <p>  Regarding the control of supplementary welfare allowances, these allowances are an important safety net within the overall welfare system.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to persons whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Since the transfer of the CWS to the Department, a more integrated approach to service delivery and control, particularly for working age payments, including supplementary welfare allowances, has been evident.  The restructuring of the CWS and the consolidation of smaller clinics into larger centres has allowed for greater uniformity in claims handling, better customer service and improved controls, transparency and consistency.</p> <p>  The Department is committed to strengthening controls in the administration of supplementary welfare allowances and the ongoing audit and inspection programmes undertaken by the Department's internal audit and internal control support units provide valuable support to the Department in this regard.  Learning from these audits and inspections has improved overall claims handling and compliance with procedures.  The integrated decisions teams operating in Intreo centres and the ongoing review of staff guidance in respect of supplementary welfare allowance schemes has further enhanced controls and consistency of application.  The Department is also committed to undertaking a fraud and error survey on basic supplementary welfare allowances during 2016.</p> <p>  Farm assist is an income support scheme for low-income farmers that was introduced in 1999.  The number of recipients under this scheme fell by approximately 5% from 2013 to 2014.  The falling numbers reflect the general rise in employment.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, as part of his recommendations on this chapter, suggested a review of the operation of key controls.  I am happy to report that the Department has reviewed and updated the main review and assessment forms used in the scheme.  It has also taken measures to improve the annual review process.  The Department plans to commence the fraud and error survey on the farm assist scheme in June 2015.  The survey will be used to identify the level of risk associated with the scheme with a view to designing review processes and control measures specifically targeted to minimise the level of future risk.</p> <p>  I wish to draw the committee's attention to a number of specific areas of current work, namely, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for 2015, the back to work family dividend, the rent supplement arrangements and the water conservation grant, which we are administering on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>We have arranged a departmental briefing on these areas for all Oireachtas Members on 11 June and we will send out notification of that shortly.</p><p> The staff of the Department are dealing with many demanding challenges to provide our customers with a professional service across the many schemes and programmes we deliver.  I am keen to acknowledge their support and co-operation as we all endeavour to deliver and continually improve our services.</p><p> I am happy to discuss any issues or proposals raised by the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#F00400"><p>Ms O'Donoghue and her officials are welcome.  I will start with the post office network and the Department's interactions and relationship with it.  This has received some media attention recently, specifically because the Department has begun writing to recipients of social welfare inviting them to consider a transfer directly to their bank accounts.  As Ms O'Donoghue is aware, there is a current political issue with regard to the post office network and the estimate of how many post offices will be shut down within the coming years.  As more social welfare payments are made electronically, the throughput reduces for post offices as does the associated financial bottom line.</p> <p>  Those of us on the committee are in a funny position.  I am asking Ms O'Donoghue about this, but it is really a balance.  Those of us on the committee are in a situation where we must ask and expect Departments to find cost cutting or savings within their budgets and value for money for all citizens.  At the same time, there is considerable political rhetoric when it comes to saving post offices, particularly in rural Ireland.  On the one hand, we are constantly trying to save money in an environment where there is not as much money going around as there was five or six years ago, but, at the same time, there is a constant campaign to preserve post offices throughout the country.</p> <p>  Having said all that, I have looked at the figures when it comes to cash payment versus the electronic payment.  The ratio is approximately 10:1.  I can understand why the Department would go down that route if it was simply based on finances alone and the cost savings involved.  Is there not a balance to be met, however, when it comes to Government, on the one hand, looking for those savings but, at the same time, having a responsibility to ensure that post offices are maintained and the network is maintained as much as possible, for obvious reasons?  I will start with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#F00500"><p>There is a balance to be struck.  The balance is to be struck in looking at the interests of all participants in the transaction.  This includes customer preference, the agencies through which we provide the service and the service delivery itself.  The Department has a long-standing relationship with An Post and the post office network.  It is a valued relationship and works remarkably well.</p> <p>  We signed a new contract with An Post at the beginning of 2014.  However, that contract had been tendered for and was advertised in the context of a Government and departmental payment strategy that very much reflected the tendency in customer preference and the need for greater efficiency in the economy of moving towards electronic payments.  In fact, the contract we have with An Post is predicated on envisaging a move towards electronic service delivery.  However, in a context where that also meets customer preference it has been our experience that, certainly for new entrants to schemes right across the board, where the customer has an option in respect of how to be paid, that option is predominantly exercised in favour of electronic payments rather than payments through An Post.</p> <p>  Of the payments we make, a sizeable proportion are made to a group of people who actually do not have an option.  In other words, for other purposes we demand that they exercise their payments receipt through the post office.  That is to do with control reasons as much as anything else.  That relates to a decision we made in 2009.  There was a windfall benefit to the post office system in terms of delivering that level of service on a mandatory basis.  However, in respect of any other payments we make it is very much on the basis of customer preference.  It is in a context where Government has recognised that there is security aspect, a safety aspect and a customer trend moving towards electronic payments, and we have to recognise that as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#F00600"><p>All that makes sense.  Again, it is logical from the cost savings.   However, someone from a post office or the Irish Postmasters Union might make the case that we all believe in choice but that an active campaign or system is under way within the Department to contact people on these schemes to remind them that there is this option.  The postmasters are asking whether we can slow it down until they can work something out with a new system they have proposed, because it is having quite an effect on the bottom line of post offices.</p> <p>  I understand where the Department is coming from as far as choice is concerned, but there is an active system within the Department to contact people.  I have before me a news report from March stating that 7,000 letters were sent out reminding people or pointing out that this new system of payment was available to them.  The spokesman said the Department would send out hundreds more letters.  This is going to continue.</p> <p>  Ms O'Donoghue has outlined the policy but I am unsure whether it deals with the public interest balance that we are trying to meet.  There is political rhetoric about saving a post office network while, understandably, at the same time there is a cost savings imperative on the part of the Department and the question of giving people a choice.  At the same time, it is concerning when it comes to the post office network.</p></speech>

The letters Deputy Deasy referred to were part of a small pilot.  Actually, only 2,800 letters were issued.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#F00800"><p>Okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.89" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#F00900"><p>The pilot was to try to establish what might be a better communication system with our customers.  Different forms of letters were used to see how customers would engage or would not engage with us.  It was very much about trying to inform our approach in a context where, as Deputy Deasy has said, An Post has gone to the market for a different type of payment solution.  That will be coming on-stream later in the year.  That, coupled with other measures we are taking, potentially gives us an opportunity to look again at offering options to people to whom, historically, we have not offered options.  It was very much to inform our communication strategy with our customer base and it was very limited.  There were 2,800 letters.  The actual response was low enough, in fairness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#F01000"><p>That is interesting.  Of the 2,800 letters, what was the take-up?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#F01100"><p>I can give the committee the actual figures.  The response to the trial was low, 14% responded to us.  Of the 14%, a total of 31% indicated a preference to migrate to electronic funds transfer.  We are talking about small numbers.  It was more to see what kind of communication would generate a response.  The critical aspect of this exercise is that nothing would happen to anyone who did not respond.  In other words, it was an entirely voluntary engagement with us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#F01200"><p>That is fine.  A total of 14% responded and of that figure 31% opted for the electronic payment system.</p></speech>

The second point I would make is that even in a context of Government having a payment strategy which rather looked at moving into the digital economy the Department went to the market for cash-based service delivery in 2013.  We contracted with An Post, recognising that there is an issue around retaining services of that type and meeting customer preference in that area.</p></speech>

Are there plans within the Department to expand on that at present?</p></speech>

It is in a context of when we have a look again at the service offerings available to us post the An Post developments.  I would say it is part of the An Post contract that we are moving in that direction and An Post is working with us to do that.</p></speech>

Is there any other area in which the Department could potentially work with An Post in the future to give it more business?  The Department is the big spend.  An Post was relying on those transfers.  Is the Department talking to An Post about anything else that is potentially coming out of the Department or is that it?</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy made what I would regard as quite a noble recommendation in his report on the farm assist scheme which was rejected.  He recommended that the Department should evaluate the extent to which the farm assist scheme is achieving its objectives in terms of assisting claimants to continue farming and helping the viability of rural communities.  I note this while we are on this vein.  The Department disagreed and made it clear that such a review would be outside its remit.  Can Ms O'Donoghue expand on that and provide the committee with a response as to why the Department came to that determination?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#G00800"><p>I can understand where the Comptroller and Auditor General is coming from on this.  Such an exercise would have value in the round in terms of looking at the agricultural economy.  What I need to be very careful about is estimating the Department's role in relation to this.  What we have been requested to do by government since the scheme was put in place has been to operate an income support process in certain defined circumstances to farmers.  In terms of how that impacts on their viability and how the agricultural sector can survive, there are many more variables that feed into the equation.  As such, the Department of Social Protection is not best placed to carry out such an evaluation.  Of course, we would be more than happy to contribute and play our role in it, but that it is a matter for other players to lead on who have greater expertise in that area.  To that end, we are involved in the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, which is looking at rural development and so have been playing a role in that space already.  CEDRA has not specifically looked at the farm assist scheme, but it may very well be on its agenda into the future.</p></speech>

It is a common sense one in my view.  Was he disappointed the Department said it did not feel it was in its remit?  Is there anyone else who could do this?</p></speech>

I accept certainly that it is a broader issue than just this particular scheme.  It fits into a set of schemes.

I know from my own office that it is taking a great deal of time.  The one we point to most is the invalidity payment.  These are people who have made contributions and worked and we estimate that in some cases it takes approximately 18 months from the time an application is made to payment.  It is too long.  Obviously, there are a range of waiting times for the different payments that the Department has figures on.  It knows the averages.  It is not getting much better in our opinion from our anecdotal experience in the office with regard to the people we deal with when it comes to applications, assessments and the wait to final payment.  It is something I have raised before but we have not seen any improvement.</p></speech>

It does not accord with what the data are telling us in the Department.  I would be very happy to explore the particular issues with the Deputy or to give him more detailed information on this rather than to take too much time on it.  I accept entirely that the figures here are average processing times, but on invalidity pension the average processing time currently is 10.7 weeks.  We should bear in mind that invalidity, in common with a number of other schemes where there is a medical component, has an additional processing time.  As the Deputy has correctly stated, invalidity is an insurance-based scheme and is based on a person having a contribution history but who also must meet the medical criteria.  Currently, 10.7 weeks is the average from application to what we call a "clean award".  What I mean by that is the first decision to award.  There is no doubt in relation to quite a number of medical schemes that initial decisions might be negative and reviews or appeals might then be looked at through which in most instances additional information is provided which, in turn, often allows for a positive decision to be reached.  There are many instances of that.  The experience of the Deputy seems to out-lie what the national figures are telling us and I would be very happy to look at it for him.</p></speech>

I am just saying it is not our experience.  I will collate the instances I have and give them to the Secretary General.  I understand what she is saying, which is that outside of the appeals process, it is two and a half months, whereas my estimate is a great deal longer.</p></speech>

In the last two and a half years, we have placed a huge focus on dealing with backlogs, which were very significant in a number of different scheme areas, including carer's allowance, disability allowance, invalidity pension and FIS.  We put a great deal of effort into trying to improve those processing times and made huge inroads.  Very significant inroads were made such that the level of service has improved dramatically from what I will be the first to admit was an unacceptable level.  If the Deputy's experience or the experience of the people he is hearing about constitute significant outliers to the figures I have mentioned, it means there is some issue at play.  It may be in relation to the information being provided, but I would be very happy to have a look at it and come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I understand 22 contracts to the value of &euro;2 million were not subject to competitive procurement within the Department.  Twenty-two contracts is quite a high number.  We dealt with the Health Service Executive, HSE, recently, which seems to be a really bad offender when it comes to sidelining the procurement process, but why were those contracts not awarded within the proper guidelines?</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that in 2012, the Department integrated a significant number of functions from other organisations, including the HSE, F&Aacute;S and other Government Departments.  In many instances there were contracts that expired or whatever and we just had not got to the point of regularising all the procurement rules in regard to moving some of these things.  I am very happy to report that we have managed that process down very significantly in the intervening period.</p> <p>  In regard to the 22 contracts, in 16 cases we have gone to tender and offered a new contract following a competitive procurement.  In one case, because of business continuity and so on, we have only just published a request for tender, RFT, on e-tenders.  In another case a request for tender has been drafted and will be issued subject to clearance by the Chief State Solicitor's office.  In two cases the requirements of the Department are currently under review in regard to whether we go to the market or not in this space.  In the remaining two cases the services are no longer required or else the services involved would be under the procurement thresholds that would require a tendering process.</p> <p>  Regarding the type of issues we are talking about, it was for various reasons.  It was issues such as business continuity, sole or limited supplier availability or multiple low value purchases, which racked up over a period and then went over the threshold.  We have put quite an effort into regularising our entire approach to procurement, creating a database where we keep value of all procurements and keep note on that and centralising through which procurement operates.  Already, we have seen significant improvement, even in regard to 2014, and we will continue that path of improvement in 2015.</p></speech>

Every now and then there is a news story about the Department tackling fraud and saving hundreds of millions of euro.  I believe that gives people an impression that there is a massive amount of fraud taking place but, to be clear, when we compare some of our schemes to the fraud levels in the United Kingdom rent supplement schemes it seems they are higher, not by much but they are higher.  Those are the figures I have seen.  How does Ms O'Donoghue respond generally to the notion that there is rampant fraud in the social welfare system?  She knows the corresponding figures for different jurisdictions.  Is it a fair statement to say there is rampant fraud in the social welfare schemes?  There will always be a certain percentage of it but is the fraud in some schemes worse than others?</p></speech>

It various from scheme to scheme depending on the nature and type of schemes involved.  One of the things we do in the Department is categorise schemes into high, low and medium risk, and the high risk schemes are the ones on which we wish to spend most attention but in terms of international comparisons, there is no evidence to suggest that the level of fraud in Ireland is out of kilter with the level of fraud anywhere else.  I refer back to my opening statement.  The evidence points to the fact that the vast majority of social welfare claimants are receiving the payments to which they are entitled, so fraud is not an issue.  What we are looking at is a very small number of people who are engaged in activity, and it is our job to try to minimise the opportunity for that.</p></speech>

The rent supplement survey established that cases paid directly to the client had an 18% rate of fraud and error while those paid to a nominated person, in other words, the landlord, had a 10% rate of fraud and error.  Has the Department considered making that payment directly to the landlord to minimise that differential as a condition of the scheme?</p></speech>

The rent agreement is between the claimant and the landlord, and it is only at the request of the claimant that we would directly make the payment to the landlord.  The real issue is a control issue for us in terms of following people through, getting communication in terms of change of circumstances or change of address, and tracking whether people are in particular locations or not.</p> <p>  Rent supplement was never intended to be a long-term scheme.  The intention is that, over time, people who have a long-term housing need will move, in the first instance, into the housing assistance payment, HAP system, which is now up and running, and then, prospectively, into other social housing if that is a better option for them.  That is an entirely different contractual arrangement and method of payment, which probably offers better security to the State.</p></speech>

Obviously, however, there is still publicity concerning people at risk of homelessness and calls for rent supplement ceilings to be improved or increased.

I read the definitions.  The specific difference, I suppose, is that where somebody provides information, it is deemed fraud if there is in the opinion of the Department an intention to provide false information.  Consider the customer error rates in the various categories.  With regard to the jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, customer error was identified in 119 of the cases assessed.  That is quite a large figure.  Fraud was suspected in 21 of the 987 cases assessed.  When it comes to rent supplement, that figure is down to 55.  Someone might play devil&rsquo;s advocate with regard to the Department's definitions and its interpretation of those definitions when it comes to the question of fraud versus customer error.  It is a fine line, in many respects, and the interpretation involves a judgment call by the actual social welfare officer.  Are there increases across the board in customer errors based on the Department&rsquo;s assessments?  Does the figure remain the same?  Are the ratios stagnant?</p></speech>

Thankfully, the proportion attributable to departmental error has been decreasing, which is also welcome.  Obviously, it is not something we can be complacent about.  The Deputy is absolutely right that it is a subjective judgment, but it is a judgment made by a deciding officer having regard to the entire set of circumstances by which something arises.  The level of previous engagement with or the case history of the individual concerned is also taken into account before the judgment is made.</p></speech>

In 2013, of the overpayments raised, 34% were considered to be attributable to customer error.  In 2014, it was 40%.  So far this year &mdash; this is very preliminary stuff to the end of April 2015 &mdash; it is 38%.</p> <p>  We have significantly improved our investment in the training of deciding officers, and we have also put in place a fairly sophisticated new system of debt recovery and assessment, which means we are raising overpayments in a much more timely way.  Decisions are being made much closer to an event occurring rather than at some time prospectively.  That probably improves the consistency with which things are defined.</p></speech>

That is based on a presumption that we will issue 3 million cards by the end of 2016.  To date, we have 1.4 million cards issued.  Obviously, this has been a progression in terms of ramping up our capacity to issue public service cards.  What has happened is that somewhere in the order of 62 cases of fraud have actually been identified through the face-matching software that is associated with the public service card.  Equally, the public service card has contributed very significantly by virtue of us engaging with customers and inviting them to come in to be registered-----</p></speech>

Very serious cases were identified that have gone through the courts, and custodial sentences have been handed down.  It also has a secondary effect.  We have been inviting people to come in, and we now have the legislative power to suspend or stop a payment if somebody does not engage with us.  On foot of that, somewhere over 200 payments have been stopped by virtue of people not attending, having gone through a whole range of natural justice processes to enable them to attend to be registered.  We really feel that it has contributed enormously on the fraud side, as well as the customer service side.  Close to 400,000 people now have a public service card with the free travel badge on it, which provides much greater security to transport providers in relation to providing a service to people who are actually entitled to it.</p></speech>

I could not quantify precisely the fraud impact but the evidence to date is significant.  The figure is certainly in the millions.  Obviously, it has an ongoing effect and a huge preventative role.  Since people have to go through the registration process, they may be less inclined to try to perpetuate identity fraud.  They may be less inclined to try to make multiple claims when they know we now have the infrastructure to check who they are.</p> <p>  Obviously, the card also has the potential to be of far greater use in a public service context.  We are working with a range of Government Departments and organisations to make sure that becomes a reality, too, particularly in terms of online services.  This is because we have the infrastructure to allow identity to be authenticated through the card.</p></speech>

I will go back to Deputy Deasy's line of questioning on the public services card.  I found the figures interesting.  There have been 1.4 million cards issued, so 62 cases is an extremely small number.  The anecdotal evidence is that identity fraud and cases of multiple claims by a single claimant, with people signing on, for example, in Galway, Roscommon, and Mayo, is something that is very common, but with the facial identification software, 62 cases identified out of 1.4 million is quite small.  Is the Department surprised by that figure or is it confident that the facial identification software is 100% accurate and is working as expected?</p></speech>

This is a proportion of registrations that have actually happened, and obviously those 62 cases were very serious cases of identity fraud.  I think in one specific case there were up to ten identities being used by one person.  We can see on an ongoing basis the role it is playing.  The Deputy should bear in mind that when something arises it has to be investigated and we then have to conclude.  At this stage in a process, when we have really only started to seriously roll out the card in the last 18 months, to have 62 instances in which we are very confident of a very solid case is pretty good going, bearing in mind that, in our view, the vast majority of people are getting the payments that they are entitled to and are not defrauding the system.</p></speech>

That is a rolling programme.  It has taken us some time to have complete coverage around the country in terms of putting the infrastructure in place.  One should bear in mind that this was happening at the same time as we were rolling out Intreo centres.  The logistics of putting in place the infrastructure for the public services cards meant that the project took longer than others.  We now have 94 locations with 150 stations and we are confident that within a very short number of months we have complete geographic coverage around the country.  One also has to take account of the flows in and out.  The 300,000 who might be in receipt of payment X today will not be the 300,000 who were in receipt of it two months ago or two weeks ago.  Approximately 75% of job seekers and about 70% of one-parent family payment recipients have a public services card.  As I have indicated already, about half of people entitled to the free travel scheme have a public services card at this stage.  Our initial target has always been to capture people who are in receipt of a social welfare payment, but obviously then we will broaden the scope, and we are looking to broaden the scope of the public services card as well.</p></speech>

What is the process for making sure someone does go in and get one?  Is there a timeline or a target set, where someone is written to and told that if they do not sign up for a public services card when they have the opportunity to do so their payment will cease?  Is that how it works?</p></speech>

We communicate with different segments of our customer base and invite them into a public services card centre if we feel that they are in a position to travel to a centre.  For a small proportion - or maybe a sizeable proportion - of those we consider as very low risk customers, where we have opportunities to validate information from other sources, we do what we call a reduced process.  For example, for certain cohorts of pensioners where we were confident they had gone through a passport application and we were able to access the information from the Passport Office and cross-reference it with the information we held, we offered them the possibility of a reduced process, so they did not have to physically present themselves face to face.  Up to now, for the vast majority of people it is by invitation.  We hope, before the end of summer 2015, to create an online appointments system whereby people who want to have a public services card can go online and make an appointment at a place of their choosing and come in and go through the registration process.  Obviously, the critical issue for people who are not social welfare customers is to have an incentive to do so or have an incentive for the card and, as I say, we are working with other Government Departments to do that.  It is a requirement for all new and existing job seekers to go through the registration process.  It is part of the application for the jobseeker scheme that one goes through the PSC process.  If a person is an existing beneficiary we will write and invite him or her over a period of time.</p></speech>

It breaks the social contract.  It breaks the deal whereby if one cannot get by one will be helped out and if one is making one's own way one pays one's own way.  The stories in the press would imply that the number of people reporting or identifying people who they believe to be defrauding the system has increased dramatically since the start of the recession a number of years ago.  Can Ms O'Donoghue inform me on how that has changed, the figures involved, and how her Department has reacted to the increased number of tip-offs and informers and that kind of thing?</p></speech>

When the recession hit, it increased significantly.  I think, on average, it had been certainly in the low thousands, and in 2011 it was up to nearly 17,000.  In 2012 it hit its peak, at 28,000.  It came down a little bit in 2013 to just under 25,000, and in 2014 it was 23,000.</p><p>It is still very high.  Anything that is reported to us, any information we receive, is investigated and followed up.  A significant number of reports must be looked at on different levels.  Have we got sufficient information to identify the person about whom a complaint is made?  In some instances, we may not have.  In other instances, somebody thinks that a person is involved in fraudulent activity whereas that person may be in receipt of a payment which allows him or her to engage in economic activity, so he or she is not necessarily defrauding the system.  He or she could be doing no more than he or she is entitled to.  People have a perception that if somebody is in receipt of social welfare, he or she should have no other engagement with the workforce but in quite a number of our schemes, there is a facility to do that in a significant way or in a limited way.</p></speech>

It is an inspectorate which specifically targets high risk or serious incidences or suspicion of fraud.  We were delighted to get co-operation from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the secondment of 20 garda&iacute; since the end of 2014.  They have added considerably to our ability to operate joint investigations and to use both Garda and social welfare powers in investigations.  I can provide the committee with different examples of investigations where there has been use of joint powers to bring things to an effective and speedy conclusion.  In quite a lot of prosecutions we might identify cases where we prosecute under the social welfare legislation, but we also identify cases where we ask the Garda to prosecute under other criminal justice legislation.  By working together, it allows for more speedy progression and completion of cases, which is important.</p></speech>

As with any effort to acquire more resources we made a business case for expanding the role and expanding the size of the SIU.  When the suggestion was made that we might look in this direction or to see if there was an opportunity to work more closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we had to make a case to justify it.  There is an expectation that by adding this resourceto the SIU, it will generate additional savings.  The SIU target in total is, I believe, &euro;75 million of savings this year.  The expectation is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will make a serious contribution to that.</p></speech>

Some of the figures for compliance with documentation - holding the right documentation and having the files in order, so they can be reviewed - are not inspiring.  Figure 11.5 looks at 57 cases of the take-on controls.  In only 21% of cases - 28% in Letterkenny - were no issues identified.  Therefore, 79% of files had something wrong with them.  This indicates a lack of adherence to requirements for filing, data collection and data keeping.  What is Ms O'Donoghue's reaction to these figures and what is being done in the Department to ensure better file keeping and better information keeping?</p></speech>

The Department took responsibility for its operation, formally, from the beginning of 2012.  Integration of the community welfare service into the Department is an ongoing process.  It has meant a radical shift in our business models, locations, processes and procedures.  It is disappointing to see the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As he highlighted, they were findings echoed in our own internal audit, or internal control support unit, ICSU, approaches.</p><p>However, we have made significant efforts to try to put in place new structures to improve training, increase the kind of reporting and risk assessment attached to this scheme, make sure the guidelines have been updated and are clear, provide training to the officers involved, improve the management controls in place and put in place the supports for officers in doing their jobs, which enables them to comply with the procedures that should be there in the first place.  I am confident that the efforts that have been made, particularly since the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit, will pay dividends.  We have stated already that we will look at supplementary welfare assistance in the context of a future fraud and error survey.  We expect that practices and the culture around the scheme will have changed by the time we carry out the survey. </p></speech>

Chapter 10, paragraph 10, states: "The extent of fraud and error in schemes that have never been surveyed and which account for a further &euro;2.6 billion of expenditure, is not known."  I assume this figure pertains to at least some of the schemes that will be subject to the fraud and error survey next year.  Which other schemes have never been surveyed and what plans are in place to carry out fraud and error surveys of them?</p></speech>

We have four surveys scheduled to start this year and I believe two or three of these would fall into that category.  As I do not want to mislead the Deputy, I will ask him to bear with me for a moment.  My advice is that this year we are talking about doing a fraud and error survey on the farm assist scheme, the free schemes such as the telephone, electricity and gas allowances - the household benefits - and carer's allowance, which is a bigger scheme but one which also falls within the parameters we talked about.  These surveys are planned for this year.  We are trying to mix and match to take account of the fact that some of the smaller schemes go unnoticed in a sense.</p></speech>

While they may be smaller schemes, expenditure on them exceeds &euro;100 million in each case.  For example, expenditure on the fuel allowance was &euro;228 million in 2013.</p></speech>

This means someone must have been eligible for a primary payment in the first instance.  Some of this will have come to light already, for example, in the case of the State pension, if memory serves, when we discovered that people had moved from a domiciliary setting into a nursing home.  In such cases, the actual overpayment is on the free schemes or living alone allowance or something like that.  In one sense, some of that has been captured through the fraud and error exercises on the primary schemes.  We also do data matching whenever it is available.  Data from the HSE on the fair deal scheme, for example, has enabled us to identify our target reviews in particular cases, having regard to those schemes.  It may not be a fraud and error survey but we are looking to see if there is any possibility of overpayment in those areas through other means as well.</p></speech>

The authorities in Galway are under severe pressure and yet the city does not have a tenancy sustainment protocol in place.  Has the flexibility available to social welfare officers in Dublin and Cork been extended to other areas to enable social welfare officers elsewhere to show flexibility to citizens in those areas?</p></speech>

There are certainly increases taking place in the level of rent supplement payments across the country.  In the west, including Galway, we have 28 instances where there have been increases in payment, having regard to the particular needs of individuals.  If the Deputy is asking whether community welfare officers are aware of that, the answer is "Yes".</p></speech>

It could be to do with health indicators for family members, the closeness to schools or something like that, as opposed to someone deciding he or she simply wants to live in a particular house.  One must bear in mind that there is quite a lot of movement in rent supplement.  People do not necessarily move into a house and stay in it for life.  They tend to move around.  If there are particular circumstances attached to the family composition or its need to be in a particular location, we will take those into account.</p></speech>

The rental market in the city is under severe pressure.  This is one of the issues that public representatives deal with all the time.  Is there a difference between the flexibility that is granted to the Galway, Waterford and Limerick offices and that offered to Cork and Dublin via the tenancy sustainment protocol?</p></speech>

There is, therefore, a range of different circumstances feeding into an assessment in these cities.  The flexibility exists, however.  If someone working in the community welfare service feels that this flexibility is required, having regard to the factors I and Ms Faughan mentioned, he or she is able to apply it.</p></speech>

The Department has undergone a radical change in recent years and, from personal experience, I believe it has dealt with much of it well.  Community welfare officers have, in effect, become Intreo officers and taken over responsibility for community employment schemes.  As such, they have acquired substantial functions in the area of job activation over and above making payments and doing administration.  Speaking to some staff in the service, it appears that much of this change has come about extremely quickly and caused a major shock.  The level of structural change in the past three or four years has been immense.  How are staff coping with these dramatic changes?  Is the process of assuming many additional functions working well?  Has this organisational change been managed and coped with to the best possible degree?</p></speech>

This is evident in the sheer volume of the increase in demand that has been coped with and the changes that have been made.  We have a whole different way of doing business and a whole new business entity has been introduced.  There has been willingness to engage with this and take on training and different roles.  We would not have been able to deliver the services we have delivered if staff had not worked with us to do that.  That is not to say that everybody is absolutely happy.  Of course, there are cases where people feel a little bruised by some of the changes that have been put in place or have been less willing adapters.  We have tried to work and communicate with staff.  We have instituted a range of different measures to try to support them and invested very heavily in putting in place a new range of training supports, which will, over time, lead to accredited qualifications for staff.  This will be extremely positive.</p> <p>  Bringing together and developing the Intreo service has allowed us to significantly improve the working environment for many staff.  We still have work to do in this regard but for many staff, the working environment is much better than it was three or four years ago, as is the nature of the engagement they have with customers.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that staff are predominantly focused on delivering a good service to customers and, provided we give them the supports to do that, they are very happy to do it.</p></speech>

I have to say that I do not see that flexibility in operation.  In fact, it is quite the opposite.  I have seen, through the work that comes through my constituency office, tenants who have been in rented accommodation getting into an argument over the level of rent now being asked for.  When agreement is not reached with the social welfare office on the payment of rent allowance, in terms of the level of the rent allowance, I have seen cases in which the families concerned have ended up in hotels.  The cost of the hotel is far greater than the cost the office would have had to pay if they had been left in the accommodation they were in.  It was not a case of "I want to live here," or "This is the type of house I want."  They were in the house.</p> <p>  Most of the members around this table will tell Ms O'Donoghue that in most locations it is not possible to get rental accommodation.  A person is lucky to get into the rental accommodation scheme or the rent allowance scheme if the landlord will take him or her.  Why is the Department so inflexible in those cases?  We have, for example, ten families living in a hotel in Kilkenny, who could perhaps have continued to be provided with accommodation by the existing landlord in the accommodation they had.  That is what is happening.  My experience has been that this is the case.  It is an awful waste of taxpayers' money that more effort is not made to understand the case of the individual family concerned and to attempt to keep them in their accommodation by way of agreement, rather than having them forced out so that they end up in a hotel at far greater cost.  It is extraordinary.  Whatever Ms O'Donoghue's analysis is telling her, I have to say that, within that analysis somewhere, these facts have to emerge, because they are facts.  I can give Ms O'Donoghue names and cases from my city of Kilkenny.  It is not working.  The flexibility is simply not there, to be honest.  When I heard Deputy Deasy talk earlier on, and Deputy Nolan continued that conversation with Ms O'Donoghue, I had to check against my experience, and my experience has been to the contrary.</p></speech>

The bottom line-----</p></speech>

The point is I can give Ms O'Donoghue specific cases.  Deputy Deasy said earlier on that he would give her specific cases.  I do not want to deal with specific cases.  I want Ms O'Donoghue to understand that what I am telling her happens through my constituency office.  Other members can tell her whether or not it happens through theirs, but that has been my experience.  As a result, I would suggest to Ms O'Donoghue that this message of being flexible and helping those to stay in the accommodation they have, if the reasons are reasonable, does not happen right around the country in the way she has explained.</p></speech>

That is a reasonably significant proportion.  Do I think that meets all needs?  No.  There is work to be done.  There are particular areas of the country where supply is a huge issue.  I agree with the Chairman.  I do not think it is in any way an objective or a good outcome that a family ends up in a hotel.  Quite apart from the cost factors, there are child protection and security factors and everything associated with it, which is why I know the local authorities equally are working extremely hard to try to deal with this, but supply is a huge issue.</p> <p>  The evidence is there for us, in the form of the 2,000 cases, that at least the flexibility is operating at a certain level.  Perhaps it is not at the level or not as apparent as one would like it to be, but that is the reality.  There are 2,000 cases enjoying a flexibility that the limits would not allow otherwise.  </p></speech>

I have to point her to the fact that there are others in hotel accommodation who have not been successful and that the flexibility simply is not there.  I am asking that some connection be made between her Department, whoever deals with it, and the local authority to insist that the flexibility be put in place.  It is costing the taxpayer more money for that accommodation than it would if an effort had been made to keep them in the accommodation they were in.</p></speech>

I do not doubt the Chairman at all if he is suggesting there are ten cases where, by virtue of discretion not being exercised in rent supplement terms, people have ended up in a hotel situation.  Absolutely, we will look at that and see why the kind of discretion available was not exercised.</p></speech>

They hardly have money to put diesel into the lawnmowers they are using to cut the grass, and they tell us that there is no money in the scheme.  There is something wrong with that model if that is the case.  I have no doubt, having spoken to these individuals as they cut the grass and tidy the place, as is their job within the scheme, when they tell us that they bring their own sweeping brushes and their own hand gear and all the rest of it, that there is something certainly wrong.

I will go back to the rent allowance issue, because it is really bugging me.  I object to Ms O'Donoghue's comment that people stay in a house because they want to live in that house.  She spoke about the criteria for the 2,000 who are getting special provision.  In my clinics in Athlone and Mullingar, nobody stays in a house because they choose to live in the house.  They stay in the house or they try to stay in the house because they are desperate to put a roof over their family's heads.</p><p>Has each social welfare office been informed that this is what it should do?  As the Chairman said, it is much more cost-effective to keep a family in a home than to pay hotel bills for their accommodation.  To what extent have individual offices been encouraged to do that?  It is not about how cost-effective it is, how much money is being saved or child protection issues; rather, it is about people's quality of life.  I am being parochial in saying that I do not know of anybody who has come into my constituency clinic in Mullingar or Athlone who is choosing to stay in a house because they like to live in that place.  They are desperate to keep a roof of the heads of their family members.  I object to that claim completely.  Will Ms O'Donoghue tell me specifically how each office has been encouraged to keep families in their homes?  Also, can she give me a breakdown of the numbers?</p><p> I have ask Ms O'Donoghue a few more questions and she can respond to them all together.  How many social welfare offices are there nationwide?  I ask that question in regard to the overtime that has been paid.  It is indicated on page 4 of our document that &euro;3.9 million has been spent on overtime for 2,113 departmental staff in 2013.  Of this number, 43 employees received overtime payments of &euro;10,000 or more.  One of the payments was for &euro;21,000.  I would like to know the breakdown of those overtime payments throughout the country.  In respect of how many offices nationwide was that &euro;3.9 million spent?  Would it not have been better to employ more people in those offices than to pay staff overtime, as that would have ensured there was continuity of work, that desks were being cleared of work and that the backlogs were being cleared?</p><p> On the issue of non-compliance with procurement plans, Ms O'Donoghue said that she was aware of the Department's obligations in that regard.  There was the integration of the different elements in 2012.  Am I led to believe that prior to 2012 there were was no non-compliance with national procurement plans because it was one unit and it complied completely?  Ms O'Donoghue said that 16 out of 22 contracts were new contracts.  Are they completely new providers?  What type of product or service do they cover?  She said that two out of 22 were no longer required.  What are those two that are no longer required?</p></speech>

One of the difficulties we face is that in some circumstances families might leave their accommodation before they tell us there is a problem or that their rent has been increased.  This is part of what we are trying to alert people to with respect to the local authorities - namely, that they should have early engagement with the community welfare service so that we can at least try to get in ahead of the problem rather than having to deal with it in retrospect.</p> <p>  In the area the Deputy represents, there have been about 120 cases in which uplifts of rent supplement have been provided.  We can give her a breakdown of those across the country.</p></speech>

We have about ten of what we call our headquarters buildings - buildings through which centralised schemes are provided, such as pensions in Sligo, child benefit in Letterkenny or the illness schemes in Longford, plus headquarter buildings.  We have a headcount of nearly 7,000 staff. The overtime bill is spread across all of our activities; it is not confined to one area of activity.</p> <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Department, in keeping with all other Government Departments, has had to operate within an employment control framework in which there has been a moratorium on recruitment.  As our activity might peak or demand might peak, we might feel that we would like to have additional staff, but within the entire public service network, we have to play our part in terms of reducing public service numbers as well.</p> <p>  There are particular reasons for the use of overtime.  In some instances it can be because of seasonal activity.  For example, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is covered by a very seasonal scheme.  We bring in a number of temporary staff to help us for the three or four months concerned, but equally overtime is involved as well to ensure that there is no disruption to the Department's other business during that period.  I do not have the precise information to hand but I know, as I would have inquired about this, that high overtime payments tend to arise in situations involving our IT support, where we may be confined in terms of the number of people involved and we require them to engage in on-call activity and all the rest of it in a specific timeframe because there is crucial piece of work to be done.  It can also arise in respect of our security people.  In different offices the opening times might require us to have people in work for longer than the normal working day in order to provide front-desk activity or security.  They would tend to be the people who are in receipt of the greater amount of overtime.  In most other cases it tends to be very seasonal or specific.  To round off that point, for the year in question, as I mentioned earlier, we put a specific focus on trying to address the backlogs in activity in our illness schemes in Longford with assistance from folks in Letterkenny.  Therefore, there would have been high overtime costs over a number of months while we were dealing with those.</p></speech>

Does everybody who is receipt of a benefit from the Department have a public service card, and has the Department now moved on issuing them to people who are in employment?  How does the Department decide who will be issued them in an area?</p><p>The term "invitation" is a bit loose.  I got one and it did not state, "You are cordially invited".  It stated, "Come in at 11.10 a.m. on Thursday."  I felt, no more than Deputy Nolan, that somebody might know something I do not know, and that I might need the card next year.  Anyway, I could not attend because the appointment was for 11.10 a.m. on a Thursday and I was here working.  A few people came into my office and told me they had been sent for, and that it was not an invitation but a request to attend at a particular time.  How did the Department decide who was being invited?  Was it working people or those on social welfare?  How was it done?</p></speech>

When the recession hit and there were concerns about issues such as the possibility of welfare tourism or whatever, the initial focus turned to people who were in receipt of jobseeker's payments.  There would have been two parallel processes.  As I explained to Deputy Nolan earlier, there was a group of people whom we felt comfortable about - they were low-risk and we had other information about them - and hence we could offer them a reduced process.  In parallel, we were inviting jobseekers to a face-to-face registration process and inviting pensioners to a reduced process.  That was and remains our core target in terms of trying to ensure coverage.  We were somewhat constrained in doing that, which is why we are only at 70% or 75%, by virtue of our ability to offer registration processes in all parts of the country.  I am now fairly confident that we are there or thereabouts, so that will no longer be a constraint.</p> <p>  In order to maximise our use of the registration capacity, we then started looking at wider customer groups.  I suspect it will be people who receive child benefit or illness benefit.  We have started a thread in that.  Much more recently, because we wanted to engage with all the non-governmental organisations involved - the National Disability Federation and all the rest - we are treading very carefully in our engagement with people who are in receipt of disability allowance or invalidity pension, because we know there are much greater sensitivities with regard to their ability to attend at an office or engage with us in a way that allows us to be satisfied on a matter.  We have started those processes but we are further back in terms of moving into that cohort than we are in regard to the jobseekers, lone parents or child benefit recipients.  It is precisely because we are now moving beyond the core base that we are looking at creating appointment systems and trying to facilitate registration in areas and at times that might be convenient to people who work.</p></speech>

The Chairman has made a good point about extrapolating the payments.  In terms of the average payments, that is a random selection at a particular point in time.  What would be the margin of error on those types of payment if the Department had a concern about them?  With the budget available to the Department, it would be difficult to do a random selection on the 453 different depots, but if we take the two different locations, it would indicate, as with any business, a figure of 1% or 2%.  It is like a poll.  What the Chairman has stated would be a fair assessment.</p><p>It is an indicator at a point in time, Deputy, there is no doubt.  We use it to learn what are the issues, what are the concerns, where is the evidence and how we can enhance scheme controls.</p></speech>

If the turnover of &euro;19 billion is divided by the anomalies of the turnover of control, does Mr. McCarthy have a calculation for what that percentage would be if one takes the extrapolated figures into the budget of &euro;19 billion?</p></speech>

There are two ways of looking at it.  The Department tends to look at savings over expenditure that is prevented as a result of the control activity.  With the fraud and error surveys we are trying to get at the baseline to identify how much payment in excess of entitlement there might be in the system.  I believe the fraud and error surveys can be used to give a picture.  If it is designed well enough, it should be representative of what the claim load is in the year, albeit that there is a lot of turnover in it.  When we did that exercise about three or four years ago, the figure was around the order of the figure that one calculates each year as being the savings as a result of control activity.  There is always a risk that there is going to be excess payment in the system or payments in error.  There is further scope to use the fraud and error survey to get at a figure of that underlying problem, which then puts the effectiveness of the control activity into context.</p></speech>

The Chairman has pointed out that in the extrapolated figures, the &euro;2 million a week is the level of discretion on the rent supplement.  It is a very good point because &euro;2 million a week is a lot of money.  People may be looking for an extra &euro;50 which is a lot of money in the context of benefits.  Reference was made to controls and the public services card, and multiplicity with people going in disguised, wearing glasses and reinventing themselves.  I understand some employers use the fingerprint system, which is a cheap, fool-proof technology where an index finger offers identification.  What is the Department spending on the ID card at the moment?</p></speech>

There is facial image collection as part of the card.  It is the facial matching that is identifying the fraudulent activity.  People cannot go in and fool the system wearing glasses or changing their appearance.  We have managed to establish 62 cases of serious fraud where people have claimed multiple identities.  There is very little difference in the context-----</p></speech>

At the moment, the MABS office is massively understaffed.  One must obviously consider its new role.  With regard to the element of rent supplement and the discretion in different counties, it is very important that the various organisations, MABS, the citizens information centres and the Intreo offices, be linked and that there be a one-stop shop.</p> <p>  Some &euro;550 million has been given out to carers.

It is a scheme that people have to apply for.  They have to provide a lot of evidence in order to qualify for a payment in the first instance.  People in receipt of the payments are subject to review and control elements as with any other scheme, so I am not sure where the Deputy's allegation is coming from.  I think I know what it is about.  It is actually about the regulation of care providers rather than the payment of the carer's allowance.</p></speech>

It is a scheme that has been in operation since July 2011.  Since its inception, there have been almost 40,000 internships.  Currently, we have about 6,000 jobseekers on the scheme.  There was an evaluation that indicated there is progression on immediate completion of internship of in the order of 36%.  When people's internships finish, approximately 36% move seamlessly into employment.  Within a very short time of completion, that actually increases to about 60%.  We will be looking at evaluating the scheme again just to see if that pattern has continued.  However, it is a scheme that is extremely successful and there obviously has been a high take-up.</p> <p>  An amended version of the scheme has become available under the Youth Guarantee and it affects the conditions of participation.  The length of time for which one had to be unemployed in order to access the scheme is reduced for people under 25.  There has been a lot of interest in the scheme among countries across Europe because they see it as something that has worked very well.</p></speech>

The real ambition is to try to keep as many people as possible close to the labour market or give them that experience.  If somebody is on a scheme for life, it is denying an opportunity to somebody else.  There are effectively two different aims to community employment.  One is obviously a community service aim but the other is actually to encourage people back to work.  It is not to give them employment for life.</p></speech>

It is a good organisation and I have no issues with it, but I have questions in terms of the make-up of these boards.  There is a board in every county.  Let us consider the costs of the board as against the administration costs.  This follows from a question I asked recently.  The cost of some boards as a percentage of the administration costs are run at 8% or 6%, while others run up as far as 20%, 30% and so on.  Who carries out the analysis of the costs in respect of each board?  There is a board membership of eight, nine or 11 members.  There seems to be a significant structure of boards around the MABS organisation.</p></speech>

Companies were set up and each service provider in MABS is a separate company which has its own board.  That is the structure of MABS and historically it has been the structure of MABS, albeit the services are funded through and report to the Citizens Information Board.  That changed probably four or five years ago.  Up to then, they had been funded through the Department.  However, the Comhairle legislation was amended to move responsibly for MABS to the CIB.</p> <p>  In fairness, this is something the Citizens Information Board is addressing - this applies to the outgoing board and prospectively the board that will be operating.  The whole issue of trying to streamline governance arrangements is very much on its agenda.  I am aware of work that has been under way - it has not yet got to the board - to look at a new governance model.  The idea is to preserve the local delivery of services but provide for far more streamlined arrangements in terms of governance of the MABS companies.  That is seriously advanced at this stage.  A proposal will probably come to the Citizens Information Board in due course on the matter.</p></speech>

I am looking at administrative costs for individual boards.  Some are in the single digits at 5%, 6% or 7%, while others, in small counties where one might not expect it, are running at 30% or 22%.  Should the Citizens Information Board answer that question?  This information came from Ms O'Donoghue's Department.  Is she  concerned that there is such a difference in some counties in terms of costs?</p></speech>

The Citizens Information Board is responsible for the operation of this service.  That is why the board is doing the work that it is doing at the moment in terms of looking at putting in place new governance arrangements.</p></speech>

The Department is the paymaster relative to these boards.  When we change the percentages into costs, it is clear there is a considerable cost in every board that is not getting down.  Do they need these boards?  Would that money be better spent on professionals to assist the clients rather than board expenses?</p></speech>

The Chairman has to recognise the historical context of the set-up of these companies.  These are independent companies that were made up of many volunteers who gave freely of their time and effort and so on to ensure that a service was provided locally.  There is no doubt that these boards represent a governance structure which is out of date in the sense of trying to provide a consistent and professional service throughout the country.  In fairness, the work that is being done through CIB is about trying to come up with a different model that can preserve and enhance service delivery but bring greater sense, if I can put it like that.</p></speech>

It is called the Pathfinder project where an external stakeholder was brought in to work with a group, including representatives from the local groups and the CIB, to come up with a different model.  They have identified a couple of different options.  They gave a progress report to the CIB at the end of March and there were some queries as a result of it.  Within the past week or two the membership of the board has been reconfirmed, so the board can be reconvened.  I imagine that very soon over the next number of months a report from the Pathfinder group will be made to the board.  When the board reaches a decision it will come to the Department for confirmation, but the decision, effectively, is the board's to make.</p></speech>

I want to follow up on the point Deputy Perry made earlier.  Like all public representatives, we are contacted by people who would love to do an extra year or two on a scheme and, obviously, the rules have tightened up quite a lot.  There are people who come to me at the ages of 62 and 63 who have been told that there are no more years for them.  The odds of them getting re-employment are next to none if they have no training or skills in an area.  Does the Department have any intention, as unemployment falls and perhaps it has extra money to spend, that people in that age category would be able to stay on a scheme until retirement age?  Are there any plans for that at the moment?</p></speech>

That would be a different policy choice for the Government to make if it was to make it.  The real issue is that we have funding and authority for a certain number of spaces and we have a requirement to try to use that to best effect.  There is no doubt but that CE schemes have contributed enormously to economies right across the country, to social economies and economic activity as well.  One of the difficulties is that the purpose of the scheme initially was as an employment progression scheme.  In some instances, it had turned into a social participation scheme.  We need to clearly recognise the distinction between both.  There are social engagement schemes and then there are schemes that are actually trying to equip people to move back into employment.  We have to try to be mindful of the fact that there are a couple of hundred thousand people on the live register and we have to try to keep the long-term unemployed in touch with the labour market.  We have to use the resources available to us to the most efficient effect in line with current Government thinking.  There has been no signal to me that it is changing at the moment.</p></speech>

Why does the process take so long?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.507" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015052800002#U00300"><p>It does not take so long.  We discussed this matter earlier.  The current waiting time for carer's allowance is approximately 14 weeks or slightly more than three months.  There are a couple of different elements to the process.  Carer's allowance is a complicated scheme because it has a means assessment element and we also need to satisfy ourselves that the applicant is required to give full-time care and attention to whomever the care recipient may be.  We need to have a medical case for the level of care.  While I am sure people in receipt of the benefit will not necessarily agree, relative to other social welfare payments, carer's allowance is a generous income support not alone because of the level of payment, but also because of the conditions that apply.  People can have earnings outside of their caring duties to quite a generous level compared to other social welfare payments.  From our point of view, we have to be careful that we are providing payments to people who meet the eligibility criteria.</p></speech>

In all the cases where I have helped with carer's allowance or where a person has raised the payment with me, the medical side has been the issue.  The strongest medical letters are provided by consultants and general practitioners.  Why is it taking so long to process applications?</p></speech>

Last Saturday, an individual informed me that an application for the payment would take 14 weeks to process.  The person in need of care does not want to enter full-time care but needs care at a specific time.  When people in such circumstances find someone who will provide help they find the application process for the carer's allowance and fair deal schemes takes a long time.  People who are at risk are being told it will take three months to deal with their cases.  Is it possible the Department could expedite the process?</p></speech>

When the community welfare service came to us from the HSE, that service was being operated from a huge number of locations, many of which were less than suitable.  From 2012 onwards, we have very significantly reduced the number of locations and surrendered leases.  It is only where the Department has sole service provision from a lease that we have the lease.  Otherwise, the HSE retains it.  Our objective over time is to reduce that to the minimum amount possible and to make sure that the accommodation involved is the better standard available.</p></speech>

This programme was negotiated with the EU two years ago.  It was a replacement for one of the oldest schemes of vouchers for items such as butter, which were given to the most deprived.  The scheme was put in place about 18 months ago.  European funding is coming to Ireland to the level of &euro;3.5 million.  To the best of my knowledge, the Department has not drawn down any of that money.  Is that true?</p></speech>

I am trying to tell the Deputy that the reason we are doing it is that we were assigned responsibility for this.  It was a new responsibility for the Department and we have to develop the infrastructure to do it.  We are in the process of doing so and we cannot draw down the funding until we have the systems developed.  We are working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.  My understanding is that there will be no loss to the State.  The money will be there and we will be able to draw it down and use it.</p></speech>

This is a new activity for the Department so there is a change in the infrastructural arrangements.  We are putting the mechanisms in place and will be drawing it down and working with the NGOs.  Ireland Inc. will not lose money because of this delay.  We will still get the money and be able to use it.</p></speech>

Our plan was one of the early ones accepted by the European Commission.  We have done a number of different things, such as developing the Intreo process to ensure earlier and more intensive engagement with young people, delivering additional opportunities to young people through education and training programmes, earmarking a quota of places and opportunities on employment schemes for young people, and varying the eligibility conditions for access to these schemes so that young people can access them at an earlier stage in unemployment than other people on the live register can.  We have expanded the number of opportunities availed of in the form of internships, subsidised private sector recruitment and supports for self-employment, and introduced new options for young unemployed people in the area of youth entrepreneurship and international work experience and training.  There has been an uptake of more than 25,000 across all of those different programmes.  A specially developed internship for the most disadvantaged and the provision of recruitment subsidies for young unemployed people were launched in quarter one of 2015.  Those are additional components of the Youth Guarantee.</p></speech>

There seems to be less and less discretion exercised by the community welfare officers.  There seems to be very little in clothing, back to school allowances or any of the services that might be useful for people.  Certainly, in a lot of areas in the inner city, I am hearing all the time that the community welfare officer has just one word, "No," to virtually everything.</p></speech>

The back to school clothing and footwear allowance was taken away and created almost as a separate scheme a number of years ago.  That is a separate arrangement which is actually not provided through the community welfare service <i>per se</i>.  The vast bulk of recipients of that particular payment receive it automatically from us, and a smaller proportion can apply and we will assess them.<br/><br/>In respect of other guidelines, I must be very clear that community welfare officers have continued to be allowed to exercise whatever discretion they need in any circumstance.  However-----</p></speech>

It was always the Department's view, when the operations of the community welfare service came into the Department, that it was a very valued piece of activity to be targeted at the most vulnerable and at very specific circumstances.  It was not to be constrained by the very procedural, statutory-based rules that apply in many other schemes.  However, what I would say is that from work done within the community welfare service itself by groups of people who were community welfare officers, in looking at the practices, procedures and expenditure patterns right across the service, it became very clear that there were great inconsistencies in terms of the level of discretion being applied in different circumstances.  There were guidelines produced, and those guidelines have been updated since, to give guidance as to what level of support might be provided in particular instances.  I cannot emphasise enough that the discretion still exists with the community welfare officers to go outside those guidelines if they feel the circumstances demand it.</p></speech>

They are guidelines under those kinds of heading, whether it be food, clothing, assistance with funeral expenses, kit-out of accommodation or travelling.  There are a whole range of different headings.</p></speech>

I am not sure what the guidelines are for them.  The system needs to be looked at.  There are certain undertakers that engage where the family is in need of a bereavement grant, and then there are others that do not.  The actual price of the funeral can vary enormously and, while the traditional bereavement grant may be quite adequate, another one will be totally inadequate to go any distance.  Is there not the opportunity for a link-up with undertakers or some system that is not just totally in limbo, where a bereavement grant may or may not be given without any reference to its context?</p></speech>

It is up to anybody to make a case to the community welfare officer and they have the discretion if they need it.  Assistance was provided to around 3,000 people in 2014 at a cost of &euro;4.6 million.  As of the end of April this year, more than 1,000 payments have been issued towards expenses, at a cost of &euro;1.8 million, with an average payment of about &euro;1,600.</p></speech>

Ms O'Donoghue mentioned that part of the reason there was no pension was that the CE schemes were operated by local companies.

I have a question about recovery of money that is deemed to be under the headings of fraud and error, customer error, departmental error or overpayment.  Ms O'Donoghue had a conversation with the Chairman earlier on.  He was talking about extrapolation of figures.  What I am trying to get at is this.  What percentage of the overpayments or the moneys that are due to fraud and error are recovered?  The Department has put in place systems in the past couple of years or has changed its systems when it comes to this recovery generally.  Firstly, what percentage of all of that money under those headings is recovered?  Has that improved when compared with previous years?</p></speech>

There is a fourth category, estate-related overpayment, which is something that comes to our attention after someone has died, when we are recovering from the estate of the individual rather than anyone else.  The Deputy is quite right.  We committed previously to redeveloping our overpayment recovery system, which we did.  However, it has only been live since the end of 2014.  That will allow us to give a definitive-----</p></speech>

The Deputy will remember as well that previously we were limited in the amount we could recover from payments.  I think it was &euro;2 a week.

If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You're directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank and IFSRA in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The bank inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will effect the questions asked and the answers that can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis, only such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room, for those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  The witnesses being directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, you have been furnished with booklets of the core documents.

I have an abbreviated version of the statement that I provided some weeks ago and I don't believe the ... either yourself or the members have it.  So, good morning again, Chairman, and members of the committee.  As the chairman has introduced me, I'm Patrick Neary.  I held the position of prudential director of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority from 1 May 2003 until 31 January 2006, after which I was appointed to the position of chief executive from 1 February 2006 until 31 January 2009.  Before I begin my statement, I would like to say that, with hindsight, the supervisory measures taken by the authority, which I will be outlining in this statement, were not sufficient to meet the challenges posed by the crisis and the recession that emerged.  I am deeply sorry about that.</p>  <p>  I'd like to describe the various regulatory actions and initiatives taken by the authority over the period up to end-2008 such as higher capital requirements, new liquidity requirements, new requirements for impaired loans, new fitness and probity tests, new consumer protection requirements for impaired loans, better regulation policy and oversight by the IMF and the OECD.  </p>  <p>         I would like to describe the various regulatory actions and initiatives taken by the authority over the period up to end-2008, such as higher capital requirements; new liquidity requirements, new requirements for impaired loans, new fitness and probity tests, new consumer protection requirements for impaired loans, better regulation policy and oversight by the IMF and the OECD.</p> <p> I will begin with the regime of prudential supervision.  The Central Bank Act 1971 first established the prudential supervision of banks in Ireland.  The primary purpose of prudential supervision is to safeguard, as far as possible, depositors in banks.  In fact, no prudential supervision of any entity involved in lending is required if that entity doesn't also take deposits.  The approach to supervision by the authority derived from EU banking supervision legal requirements.  The authority&rsquo;s approach, in the same way as that of other countries' banking supervisors, was subject to ongoing best practice review and external assessment by international bodies such as the IMF and the OECD.  These agencies benchmarked in detail the authority against a framework of principles entitled the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.  The conclusions of all these assessments by these independent expert bodies in relation to the authority were very favourable, such as would indicate that the approach of the authority was at least as good, if not better than other authorities reviewed by those agencies.  The five key constituents of the Basel core principles, which are fundamental to the prudential supervision of banks, are referred to as the CAMEL principles; which is an acronym of capital adequacy, asset quality, management and earnings and liquidity.</p> <p> A bank&rsquo;s capital is the ultimate protector of depositors and there are international rules setting minimum requirements for all banks which have been enshrined into EU and Irish law.  It provides the cushion to absorb losses that arise in the loans made by a bank.  EU law requires that an EU bank must hold a level of capital to a value of at least 8% of the value of its risk assets.  I would like to make the following observations.  All loans made by a bank have a risk weighting attached to them to determine its total risk assets.  Loans to EU governments attract a 0% weight, meaning, under EU law, a bank has to hold no capital whatsoever in respect of these loans.  Put differently, it is assumed by the law that these loans will not default and this practice continues today.  Loans to other EU banks with a maturity of less than one year attract a 20% weight, which may go some way to explaining the attraction to EU and international banks of funding the activities of Irish banks during the boom period.  Recognising that the EU legal requirements were minimum standards, the authority required the Irish banks to hold capital within a range of 8.5% to 11% of risk-weighted assets.</p> <p> On 1 January 2007, the capital requirements directive, commonly known as Basel II, came into effect.  This directive afforded supervisory authorities some discretion to tailor capital requirements to reflect national circumstances.  Using this discretion, the authority introduced a more stringent capital regime for property transactions to counter the growing exposure of Irish banks to the property sector.  I am not aware of any other instance where an EU banking supervisor imposed tougher requirements on their banks than the basic minimum requirements of Basel II.  At the requirement of the authority, the Irish banks were subject to much higher capital requirements than the EU demanded, for instance, Basel II assigned a risk weighting of 35% for residential mortgages, irrespective of the loan to value of those mortgages.  The authority set a 75% weighting for such loans by Irish banks having a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 75%.  For residential investment mortgages, Basel II also assigned a risk weighting of 35%.  The authority made the entire loan subject to a weighting of 75%.  Basel II allowed a 50% risk weighting for secured commercial real estate; the authority required 100%.  Basel II applied a 100% weighting to speculative real estate loans; the authority demanded 150%.</p> <p> Staying with residential property, the authority&rsquo;s decisions reflected the economic and growth forecasts from the Central Bank, which it was obliged to follow.  These predicted a soft landing and if that prediction had been fulfilled, there wouldn't have been a banking crisis.  In mid-2007, the authority introduced a number of additional supervisory requirements on the banks as a response to the strong appetite for credit for residential property purpose.  Stress testing of individual mortgage applications to gauge repayment ability at a level 2.75% above the ECB rate.  Introducing the consumer protection code with measures to address aggressive lending including suitability.  A ban on pre-approved credit and obligations to engage early with customers in arrears.  </p>  <p>         Eleven separate press campaigns were carried out in relation to debt as well as numerous interviews and published articles.  I have to stress that these were the minimum standards expected of banks.  The authority did not run the banks and these minimum standards did not excuse the boards from their duties to set appropriate policies.</p> <p> In July 2005, well before the crisis in financial markets began to take hold, the authority imposed new conditions on the licences of the Irish banks in relation to credit risk management policies and procedures which required each bank to have specified arrangements in place to monitor and control credit risk, with particular focus on impairments and provisions.  Each bank was obliged to comply with international financial reporting standards and was obliged to advise the authority of deterioration in the credit quality of its loans.  These reports formed part of the quarterly statutory returns submitted by each bank to the authority and never indicated deterioration in loan quality.</p> <p> In line with Basel supervisory best practice and corporate governance codes, the authority required that all appointments to the board of a bank and any of its subsidiaries should be subject to its approval.  This was to ensure that all directors of a bank, both executive and non-executive, and later, heads of all business critical functions, should be fit and proper persons with the necessary competence and experience in banking to contribute to the proper running of the bank.  A final framework was introduced by the authority in January 2007 and applied to all new appointments from that date.  Existing persons were "grandfathered" under the new arrangements.</p> <p> In January 2007, the authority imposed new liquidity rules by way of conditions on the licences of the Irish banks.  This made Ireland a leader in Europe in introducing a forward-looking system of liquidity management.  Ireland was the only EU country to have updated its liquidity requirements in advance of the liquidity crisis.  The reporting frequency was increased from monthly to weekly reporting in August 2007 to coincide with the onset of the international liquidity crunch.  In relation to all of the foregoing, I should mention that the OECD, in its Economic Survey of Ireland 2008, commented that the authority had introduced the new consumer code to limit the scope for predatory lending practices and introduced a forward-looking liquidity regime just before the international financial market turmoil struck.</p> <p> Just a few words, Chairman, about regulatory strategy.  The authority adopted a principles-led approach to supervision from its inception in 2003, which essentially placed boards and management of banks at the centre of responsibility for the prudent conduct of business.  The authority was legally obliged, at least three months before the beginning of each year, to prepare a strategic plan and submit this plan to the Minister for Finance.  The plan had to specify the objectives of the authority for the financial year concerned, the nature and scope of the activities to be undertaken and the strategies for achieving these objectives.  This principles-led approach to supervision was followed by all EU countries.  The strategy also set down the objectives of the authority.  One of its objectives was that its regulatory approach would facilitate innovation and competitiveness.  It is clear that both of these elements played an important part in the increased availability of credit in Ireland in the years before the crisis, through a combination of more banks entering the market and more innovative types of lending products being developed.</p> <p> In January 2004, a White Paper entitled Regulating Better was issued by Government to improve national competitiveness.  The paper called for wider consultation and more regulatory impact assessment on any new regulations.  This illustrates the context in which all supervisory initiatives of the authority required extensive consultation with a wide range of what are termed stakeholders - Government Departments, representative bodies and the industry and consumer panels, for example.  Detailed regulatory impact analysis was extensive.  In fact, the authority also put in place an arrangement with industry, called the stakeholder protocol, which enshrined time commitments by the authority to respond to industry requests for regulatory approvals, issuance of the findings of inspection reports, etc.  I can understand that initiatives such as this formed a perception of the authority as a can-do entity, willing to prioritise industry demands rather than appearing more detached and discerning.  This is something which I believe, in hindsight, both myself and the authority got wrong.</p> <p> The growth in private sector credit arose mainly from the appetite for property acquisition and associated construction activity.  This expansion in these areas was due to a number of factors, including strong economic growth, an increase in the level of household formation, very low interest rates, lower personal tax rates, a vast range of tax incentives for property investment, the desire of Irish people for property ownership, a feel-good element generated by increasing property values which quickly seasoned loan-to-value ratios, and all supported by readily available bank loans.  </p>  <p>           A further, and extremely important, factor was the consistent pattern of very positive economic commentary in relation to the performance and prospects for the economy and the property market from the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  In formulating its strategy, the authority always took full account of the output of these authoritative sources which predicted that the Irish economy would continue to show growth above the EU average and that the property market would experience a soft landing.  The authority relied on the Central Bank, which maintained an economic services division with 86 staff, including a dedicated financial stability department, to monitor and assess the overall health of the financial system.  Had these predictions held, there wouldn't have been a bailout.</p> <p> Questions have rightly been asked in relation to number, skillset and experience of resources devoted to the supervision of banks.  As mentioned in the Honohan report, staff numbers in the banking supervision department increased marginally from 44 at end 2005 to 48 at end 2008, and were allocated in teams to supervise portfolios of banks.  Apart from considerable day-to-day contact with their respective banks, staff in banking supervision carried out over 50 inspections of banks between 2003 and 2008.</p> <p> The authority had approved higher staff.  However, the HR department of the Central Bank, which performed recruitment activities on behalf of the authority, experienced difficulty in attracting persons with banking experience to the department.  This reflected constraints on salary levels available to public servants and very strong salary competition for such persons in a market operating at a high level of economic activity.  I agree with the conclusion in the Honohan report that the authority did not have the mix of skills necessary for a more intrusive style of supervision.  The difficulty in attracting new staff with good experience in banking, and the rapid pace of evolution of the new regulatory directives which had to be implemented, stretched existing staff to the limit, to both engage in ongoing supervision work, while at the same time having to maintain training programmes for newer staff transferring in from other departments in the authority.  There is little doubt that staff were stretched more thinly in banking supervision, and thus the capacity to foresee and react to the unfolding crisis was made more difficult.</p> <p> In July 2007 an MOU was put in place between the Central Bank, the authority and the Department of Finance to establish a committee called the domestic standing group to help in the management of financial stability issues and to prepare to handle the financial crisis.  Frequent and regular meetings of the group were held, and a number of work streams emerged dealing with emergency liquidity, deposit protection, draft legislation, as well as the updating of a manual to be used in the event of a crisis.  As the crisis deepened the Department of Finance retained consultants to assist in preparations to nationalise a bank or a building society, and work to determine to what extent there may have been a need for further capital injections to meet market expectations.  I see no reason to call the adequacy of the DSG process into question.  Its operations meant that many issues that could arise in a crisis were identified and examined, and several initiatives relating to emergency liquidity arrangements, draft bank legislation, and capitalisation of banks were undertaken.</p> <p> I will now address the bank guarantee decision.  On the evening of 29 September 2008 I accompanied the chairman of the authority to a meeting at the Department of the Taoiseach.  The meeting seemed to have only recently begun when we arrived and was in the process of discussing the serious liquidity position of Anglo, and what facilities could be made available to it to help it survive until the weekend.  Mention was also made of the fact that the two larger banks had sought a guarantee for the deposit holders from the Government earlier that afternoon.  The chairman and I advised the meeting, in relation to the solvency position of each bank, from the point of view of the authority.  We advised the meeting that on the basis of the information available to the authority, all banks were in compliance with their required capital ratios, were in a position to meet their obligations on a going concern basis, but liquidity was becoming a critical issue for them, especially Anglo.</p> <p> Both the chairman and I left this meeting after about an hour.  We were asked by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance to remain on in the offices of the Department in case our presence was required later.  We rejoined the meeting some hours later, possibly around 11 o'clock.  On our way back to the meeting room we were met by the Governor of the Central Bank who indicated that the discussions that had occurred since we had left the meeting had narrowed things down to two options, either nationalisation of Anglo coupled with a guarantee of the five remaining banks, or a guarantee of all the banks.  He suggested to us that our view was likely to be sought in relation to these options.  </p>  <p>         When we rejoined the meeting, the chairman and I raised a concern about whether there would be confusion in the minds of the market practitioners in the following morning as to who or was not guaranteed, and that making a distinction between nationalised banks and guaranteed banks ran the risk of being misinterpreted by the markets.  We raised a concern that this would either encourage the inflow of liquidity that would be expected to occur, nor would it stem outflows of deposits.  Questions would undoubtedly arise whether the nationalised bank was stronger or weaker than the guaranteed bank and in that situation, all banks would risk being adversely affected.  The chairman and I expressed the view that if a guarantee was going to be put in place, we would be inclined to favour it being extended to cover the depositors in all banks concerned in the same manner.  Some two weeks earlier, confusion had arisen in relation to the increase in the deposit guarantee scheme limit to &euro;100,000, especially as regards whose deposits it covered and the eligibility criteria.  The effects of the guarantee were evident immediately, the daily liquidity reports being submitted by the banks to the Central Bank showed inflows of both market and retail resources and an end to the pattern of outflows which had been occurring prior to the guarantee.  The guarantee was viewed positively by market commentators and was seen as addressing satisfactory the concerns of depositors and thus the funding and liquidity difficulties that had been affecting the banks.</p> <p> So just in summary Chairman, in this brief statement I have set out for you the authority's approach to prudential supervision of banks, as well as the various initiatives taken by it to strengthen its oversight of banks such as the higher capital requirements liquidity, impaired loans, fitness and probity, consumer code and the influence of the White Papers on regulatory policy.  I also acknowledge Chairman, with the benefit of hindsight, that the supervisory measures introduced by the authority were not sufficient to meet the challenges posed by the crisis and the recession that emerged and I regret that very deeply, Chairman.  So thank you, Chairman and members of the committee for your attention.</p></speech>

Mr. Neary, can I maybe just get two matters out of the way before we commence the full line of questioning?  In Mr. Hurley's evidence to the inquiry last week on 21 May 2, Mr. Hurley said "the Financial Regulator was established with its own responsibility and its own independence", "the Financial Regulator was accountable to its own board, it was not accountable to the Governor of the Central Bank".  Can I ask you is this accurate, were you independent and were you accountable to the Governor or the board or the Central Bank or anyone else?</p></speech>

The Central Bank, on the other ... the structure that was put in place meant that the authority had to use the services of the Central Bank, for activities such as HR and IT and economic services.  They were called central services, we shared those but the reporting line for those was into the Central Bank, into the board of the Central Bank.  When it came to ... when it came to systemic risk, if you will, or yes, I suppose, call it as systemic risk or financial stability, that was clearly in our view the responsibility of the Central Bank.  We were obliged to contribute to financial stability, in the Financial Regulator, by doing our job which was trying to maintain the financial soundness of the individual entities.</p></speech>

We have had a number of witnesses that have come to us during that period.  I would like to quote some of them to you.  Professor William Black told the inquiry on 5 February that extreme growth itself is something that should not be allowed by a regulator.  We have centuries of experience to tell us this is true and then he went on to say, &quot;The Irish crisis was one of the most easily preventable crises by either competent bankers or competent regulators.&quot;On 21 January, Mr. Klaus Regling told the inquiry:</p><blockquote>There was this light-touch approach to supervision, not very intrusive, not very assertive and therefore also imposing penalties just did not happen.  The rules which existed were applied very loosely.</blockquote>  <p>Professor Alan Ahearne, appearing before the committee on 4 March said:</p><blockquote>They [meaning the regulator] had a certain interpretation of principle-based regulation which meant that they really just looked at whether the banks had certain governance systems in place, including having an audit committee.  They put a lot of trust in the senior management of the banks.  That is the very opposite of intrusive, proper regulation and so the implementation of regulation failed dismally.</blockquote>  <p>  </p>  <p>               On the 11 October ... of February ... or sorry, 11 February, Professor John FitzGerald said:</p><blockquote>The build-up of the bubble could have been prevented by appropriate fiscal policy or by appropriate prudential action by the Central Bank and the regulator, or both.  Either one of these policy instruments, if appropriately deployed, could probably on its own have prevented the disaster.  Both together would have prevented [the] disaster.</blockquote> <p>And then, when Professor Honohan came before us, discussing his report and where he wrote about the options available to the Financial Regulator on moral suasion, in questions at the inquiry on 15 January, he said:</p><blockquote>[M]oral suasion is useful but is not enough if the regulated entity will not heed ... indication.  Moral suasion has nothing to do with morality.  It has to do with non-legally binding requests whereby one says, &quot;Please stop doing this, please stop doing that&quot; and if the banks know what is good for them, they say, &quot;Okay, let's behave differently&quot;.  However, if they do not respond, it has to be followed up with enforcement, strict directives and rules.  It in not principles versus rules, [it is] principles and rules.</blockquote> <p>Mr. Neary, the finger of responsibility would seem to be directly pointed at the office of the regulator in those accounts to the inquiry.  Would you care to comment?</p></speech>

Yes, I think you've set out a number of things there but, at the core of this, is the option chosen by the authority in relation to the way it carried out its business and it shows a principles-led regulatory approach.  Now, that meant that it was a combination of the statutory requirements, some of which I outlined already and we'll just go through them again: capital, proper capital, liquidity; making sure there were proper provisions made for bad debts, ensuring that there was fit and proper management in place etc. etc., we've gone through all of those but they were ... they're the key indicators of prudential soundness, capital and liquidity especially.  On top of that, the authority chose to build, if you like, a further layer of principles, which was directed at each bank and the directors of each bank and what they were obliged to do and I think actually it's set out there in the core documents, I'm sure we'll come to them later on.</p>  <p>  Now, I suppose that recognised ... the concept, I think, behind that in the mind of the authority was that, first of all, you had very ... should ... we had experienced directors in the banks that had been with them for a long time.  The banks had built up serious resources.  I mean, for example, in earlier testimony by one of the banks, they told the committee that they had 200 people in the risk management unit alone.  I mean, compared to our resources, that was a lot of people.  So, there was trust and reliance placed on the boards and management of the banks to conduct their affairs prudently and properly.  That was part of the model of supervision that was put in place by the authority and that clearly failed.  Now, I mean, it does stretch credibility, and there's no denying it, that what we were faced here with was a pretty straightforward, you know, lending crisis.  I mean, banks, I believe, with hindsight, should have known what they were doing.  They should have been able to, you know, grant loans and make sure they had them properly secured and make sure they were being repaid.  I mean, that's the very least you would expect them to do and I think that's what the principles-led approach to supervision expected.  And, you know, as part of our quality assurance process then, we had our reviews and our inspections which tried to assess the processes and the procedures they had put in place, the banks, to assess ... to monitor risk, control risk and make sure it was reported into the boards and that it defined and controlled the risk appetite.</p></speech>

There is no denying that, it's a fact.  In its defence, I would say it was the same system that was used throughout Europe and it is clear now that that whole system, throughout Europe, also failed.  </p>  <p>         Now, you have to put it in the context as well of ... of ... of the Basel ... of the CRD or the Basel II structure.  I mean, the way in which that was evolving was to, if you like, rubber stamp the whole approach ... principles-led regulatory approach going forward in Europe, whereby further responsibility was being transferred away from regulators to the boards and management of banks.  They could determine their own capital requirements, they could determine the add-ons for other risks, like operational risk and concentration risk and things like that.  And, it was ... it was grounded on ... on the premise - and this came from the Commission and it came after lots of consultation - that the capital requirements in Europe were too high, it was adding to the costs of financial services in Europe and that a way should be found to let banks have more say in the way they structure their businesses.  And that was ... that's the philosophy that was behind our principles-led supervision, and it clearly failed.  There is no denying that.</p></speech>

And I think we outlined some of those, where there was incredible demand in the economy, there was a growth, there was a lot of household formation, there seemed to be great appetite for property and it could be funded easily in a very low-cost and very liquid international market for funds.</p></speech>

What were ... what were ... what was the environment like at the time?  You had an economy which was growing, you had incredible demand for residential property which was serviced by property developers and builders.  It ... there was no sense whatsoever that there was any likelihood of an the increase in defaults or an increase in loan impairments.  I mean, we were monitoring that very carefully.  And, for almost a decade, the question of a bad debt in a bank was unheard of.  Now, that's the reality.  We have to ... we have to... I suppose, banking supervision people are mainly accountants.  We have to take the facts as they're presented to us.  We assess and look at the composition of the capital.  We look at the composition of the loan book from the point of view of looking for impairments and default.  And those just were not happening.  So, I mean, the growth within the economy and I think we're straying into .. excuse me ... Senator ... excuse me ... I think we're straying into a financial stability area and this is ... I think, fits comfortably where the Central Bank had a mandate to assess those risks that were out there and to alert the Financial Regulator to the threat posed by those risks.</p></speech>

Now ... sorry ... now, I could ... I wouldn't see a tit-for-tat exchange going on between ourselves and the Central Bank and any fighting over responsibilities.  I mean, we worked very closely with the Central Bank, and these discussions would have ... there was an internal committee called the financial stability committee.</p></speech>

That was long before the regulator was established.  Now, in fairness, there was continuity of sorts from the Central Bank to the regulator.  But we did have the financial stability committee and, you know, these issues were discussed and thrashed out there.  But from the point of view of an individual institution, from our point of view, if we saw growth, right, which would indicate, certainly, that it might put pressure on capital, it might put pressure on funding, it might put pressure on impairments, I mean, we satisfied ourselves that there was adequate capital in place.  There seemed to be no problem with the Irish banks raising new capital in the markets, and they all secured very high ratings, nor was there any problem with them raising funds in the market.  I mean, the Irish banks were a minnow in the European financial markets.  I mean, there was never any kind of concern that the financial markets would dry up and not be able to provide liquidity to the Irish banks as needed.  Now ... but it is a warning sign, and I think it is a warning sign that, from a financial stability viewpoint, if you see all the banks, collectively, expanding their balance sheets at a great rate, you start to worry.</p></speech>

One of the things that they did not have access to was the consolidated data, that that was a matter for your ... for the Financial Regulator.  And you had access to the information, which clearly showed, in particular, the commercial real estate sector was massively over-linked.  And what I'm saying to you is: why did you not use the powers that were available to you?  The question I'm asking you, to cool that sector, to slow it down ... did you see the evidence from Mr. Dan McLaughlin?</p></speech>

Mr. McLaughlin made the point about Anglo Irish Bank, a mono-line bank.  The figures that were given were 82% commercial real estate sector, 1% residential, 17% corporate lending.  And that bank had nothing to do ... had 1% residential, and yet that bank cost the taxpayers of this State &euro;30 billion or thereabouts.  What I'm asking you, Mr. Neary, is why, with the information that was available to you, sector specific, you had the powers to call ... to request the information on the top number of exposures per bank.  You could have cross-referenced that to see that the ... that some developers were cross-securitised, cross-collateralised with other institutions ... the institutions did not have that information available.</p></speech>

I mean, there's no doubt that if you look at any bank anywhere, you're going to find lumpy ... lumpy exposures in its balance sheet.  You're going to have a kind of ... a size ... you're going to have some large exposure, so you'd expect that in every single bank.  Now, there is a large exposures directive and .... it's law, so we all have to abide by that, and that permitted a bank to lend 25% of its own funds - in other words, a quarter of its capital - to any one individual.  That is the law.  They're permitted to do that, and, in fact, they can have ... if you add up all the 25s ... there's an upper limit of 800%.  So, essentially, they could have had 32 or 3 loans of that size in their balance sheet and be within the law.  I mean, that is a reality of it.  So let's not lose sight of that.  Now it's not ... I would never see it as the job of a regulator to tell a bank or a customer, you know, about their relationship.  </p>  <p>          I mean, a large customer is entitled to go into their bank, make their case; you expect the bank to assess the business proposition and the security and decide if they want to grant that loan or not.  That's not the business of the regulator, to ... to dictate to banks on their customers whether or not they can borrow or lend money.  I mean, that is a commercial transaction between mature borrowers and lenders that they have to decide for themselves but it's a very important point, I think, that we, we, we-----</p></speech>

There was a requirement, as set out in, I think, in the licensing supervision requirements of 1995.  And there was a requirement set out there that banks should not have exposures ...

In 1995, the percentage of personal indebtedness to the GDP of the nation was 71%; in 2006, it was 192%, according to the FSR reports; in 2007, the predicted figure, according to the FSR report, was 248% of GNP.  The original figures I quoted were GDP.  </p>  <p>               What was going to be the outcome, Mr. Neary, when a downturn came, for people when they were indebted to that extent?  When a downturn was going to occur, how were people going to be able to pay their bills?</p></speech>

I mean, this would be a sign.  I would expect that people who are, you know, trained and proficient in, in assessing, you know, economic threats would have raised an alarm about, but in some strange way, this transmitted into a message from the Central Bank that, notwithstanding all of these issues, that we were going to have a soft landing.</p></speech>

I regret that very much, there is no doubt, but the system did fail, and that the warnings from the Central Bank, that came out in the area of financial stability were certainly not strong enough.  Now, having said all that, I mean, just to defend the position of the Financial Regulator, not to defend it but to explain it, Senator, I mean, we ... we had a heightened awareness in relation to the level of residential mortgage growth, and, in fairness to some of my colleagues, and they were here yesterday, I think, they did outline some of the initiatives that were taken, and, you know, that were put forward by, by the former prudential director in relation to mortgage credit.  And also, on ... the authority took action on the consumer protection side, expecting banks to ... to carry out what they called a stress test to make sure that there was affordability at two and a half, 2.75% above the ECB rate, etc.  So we were doing our bit, in that sense, at an individual bank level, but ... you know, I take your point here that what was coming out in the FSR, despite all of these indicators, wasn't strong enough.</p></speech>

The promotion more or less took the form of public speaking engagements and that.  That's kind of how it was really put into practice.  I mean, on the ground, I think the relationship would be broadly the same but, you know, I'm certainly conscious of the fact that we would have been trying to project Ireland ... and this was in line with the stakeholder protocol, which I ... which I mentioned in my opening statement, that the authority wanted to be seen as a kind of a user-friendly, can-do kind of organisation, and, therefore, you know, be seen as, you know, to be a regulator in a location which was kind of friendly to financial services.</p></speech>

I think, you know, very few people would dispute that the style of regulation that the authority adopted did not address the situation that pertained in Ireland during the period before the crisis.  And I think very few people would dispute that a far more intrusive form of regulation was required.  And, I mean, you can see what is happening throughout Europe now, that everything has changed; the complete regulatory structure in Europe has changed.</p></speech>

I think we had powers to intervene, maybe not necessarily through the sectoral concentration limit, but I think we did have the power to set ratios.  And, you know, I would never try and defend ourselves by saying we didn't have the power.  I think we could have interpreted our powers.  I think, you know, if we ... if the authority was of the view that an intervention was necessary, we could have found a way.  Now, admittedly, I mean, and the argument would probably be, in the authority, that, you know, those rules are ... were more focussed on the affairs of an individual bank, that if somebody was kind of out of line compared with all the others, well, this is how you'd intervene, that you'd, you know, use your powers to deal with one bank.  But what was happening here was everybody was in the same boat, and, you know, it quickly, I think, this thing ... this thing moved ... shifted its boundary out of the micro area more into the macro area, and into the kind of financial stability dimension.</p></speech>

And on the issue of the concentration limits, for example, extensive correspondence was available between the Financial Regulator and the banks.  The concentration limits were breached in a number of cases, as you know.  There are letters on file from the banks, essentially stating their case that they felt the risks were acceptable, and asking the regulator to go away.  The summary that we have of the correspondence on sectoral limits: 2003, no conclusion in the documentation; 2004, no conclusion in the documentation; 2005, no conclusion in the documentation; 2006, no conclusion in the documentation.  There seems to have been a distinct lack of follow-up by the Financial Regulator in dealing with that issue of the banks lending too much money to property and construction, despite you having the explicit and direct tools to do so.</p></speech>

I saw ... that's in the core documents and, you know, there was a lot of correspondence.  I wouldn't have been aware that all of this correspondence was going on but that's beside the point.  It was going on.  Now, I think that serves to illustrate, I think, the difficulty that people had with the interpretation of the sectoral concentration limit, and that the arguments that were coming back and forth ... and, for example, I think in that correspondence, it illustrated, you know, some of the ways in which there was a way around the sectoral concentration limit.  </p>  <p>         I mean, banks who had their head offices somewhere else and had subsidiaries here could quite easily transfer the risk out of this jurisdiction back to head office by an internal risk transfer mechanism and get around it-----</p></speech>

I ... I think we ... I ... I have to say that we had an opportunity with that sectoral concentration limit.  Rather than letting it fall into abeyance and get into all this back-and-forth correspondence, we had an opportunity at least to look at that limit.  Now, it seemed to have been unworkable in the way it was expressed and the way in which it was interpreted but we could have at least, I think, taken the opportunity to ... to visit upon that guideline and to see was there ways in which we could segregate some of the riskier sectors out and put a limit on that.  We did not do that and that ... that ... I regret that.</p></speech>

You, you state in your opening statement that "the supervisory measures introduced by the authority were not sufficient to meet the challenges posed by the crisis and the recession that emerged."

I bought into ... I bought into that.  I think our ... our ... the authority, as well as regulatory authorities all over Europe, bought into that.  And I think we had great expectations that a combination of the ... the legal requirements, both capital and so forth, plus responsible behaviour from boards and management, would contribute to a stable financial system.  That clearly didn't happen.  So, with the benefit of hindsight, and seeing what ... what has happened throughout Europe, it was, I think, necessary to have a far more intrusive regime of supervision where we ... we, I think, were tough and, you know, adjudicated much ... much ... much more rigorously on what was happening in the banks.</p></speech>

And I would attend that committee and it would ... usually be accompanied by both the prudential director and the consumer director when we'd be meeting the committee on these matters because obviously they had to argue the case for their ... for their resources.  That year we came up with a figure for new staff of ... I think it was 77 people -70 something anyway, it was in the seventies - across the entire organisation, okay?

What happened was when we went up with the 77 to the budget and remuneration committee, I mean, they were kind of quite taken aback, I suppose, because, you know, this was a huge figure.  It seemed to be inconsistent with our ... the strategy ... that process that we had gone through not too long before ... so, where had the figure come from?  And there was a lot of argument and discussion.  </p>  <p>         It was a combination of new work that we had got and also vacancies and pressure on existing staff.  The long and short ... the long and short of it was that ... yes, sorry ... I'm sorry, I don't mean to use up your time.  The long and short of it was that the authority approved 25 staff, right, and they gave me some discretion about how that staff should be allocated.  Now, I think an extremely important fact in all of this is that the Central Bank ... the HR Department of the Central Bank recruited all our staff for us and, to be fair to them, they used recruiting agencies, they put ads in the paper, they had stuff up on the web, we could not get people to come to work in the Central Bank.  So much so, that every month during 2008, we had the deputy director general of the Central Bank who was responsible for providing recruitment services, coming and briefing the authority on his efforts.</p></speech>

She painted a picture of meetings on the seventh floor involving very senior people at the regulator with those bank executives which she said was a "cause of tension .. that, at its most benign, indicated a disconnect between banking supervision department and senior regulatory executives and it seemed to sap morale".

In the last few months before the crisis, there were regular meetings held with banks and the Governor organised a lot of those ... he led the meetings and at short notice, I could have been asked to attend those meetings and I would.  And in those circumstances, you know, I would have gone along and maybe not have notified anyone in the bank supervision department because I was called in at short notice but as a general rule, when banks were coming in on a prearranged visits to the regulator to deliver their annual results or whatever ... if I attended that meeting, I would certainly have been accompanied by the prudential director or somebody else and a briefing would be prepared.   But they would be the regular kind of contacts but in the exceptional contacts that took place towards the end of 2008, you know, I think maybe Mrs. Burke has a point but I wouldn't consider that that would be ... there was no, if you like, practice set out to do that or to go behind her back, I think.

For example, there is a book by Simon Carswell, <i>Anglo Republic</i>, which claims that some time around late September 2007, Mr. David Drumm met you at your office to tell you about Se&aacute;n Quinn's investment in Anglo Irish Bank and the concerns that Anglo's board had about it.  Did that happen, for example?</p></speech>

There's just a couple of matters I want to deal with before we take a break for coffee, Mr. Neary.  And I'm just going to bring a document up on the screen there.  It's from the evidence book, Vol .1 pages 43 to 50.  Basically, it's the memorandum of understanding that establishes the kind of ground rules between yourself and the Governor.  So the ... the memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator dealt with the responsibilities of both the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Could I maybe ask you, and it's particularly on item three there, where there is very specific sort of rules of engagement.  Was there clarity on what should be dealt with by the regulator-----</p></speech>

The, the way where we saw it was our job was to contribute to financial stability.  And I think this particular MOU was fairly clear that our job was micro, excuse me, micro-prudential supervision, that is, concentrating on the activities of each individual institution.  And also, we worked closely with the Central Bank then through the financial stability committee because they had a mandate for financial stability and we contributed a lot of information, facts, figures, views through the financial stability to ... to help the Central Bank manage their responsibilities.</p></speech>

I think we had a very good working ... it never came to quoting the law at each other.  I think there was very good co-operation from both sides and any request for information or data that we ever got from the financial stability committee was provided.  The Governor and the director general of the bank got ... every single piece of information that went to the authority was given to them.  And also, at the Central Bank board meeting, the minutes of the Financial Regulator were tabled for any of the members that wanted to take them.

So the strategy was quite detailed and had a number of principles in it and it had deliverables specified for each department and derived from that were deliverables that were specified for myself and agreed with myself and the chairman.  And they formed the basis of quarterly performance assessment by the authority of me, so every three months, I went to the authority and I had to present to them how we were ... how we were performing against the strategy and the deliverables that I had agreed with the authority as part of the strategy.</p></speech>

The system failed and I regret that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.1032" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052800002#U06800"><p>Thank you very much, Deputy.  Could I just ask one question, following Deputy O'Donnell's line of questioning with you, Mr. Neary, and that is, if the banks had lent &euro;440 billion and the Irish economy was worth &euro;160 billion, how do you think the banks had enough capital to withstand the property downturn?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.1033" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Neary" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052800002#U06900"><p>Well, the capital is a function ... is a function of the risk assets.  It's a mathematical calculation and also it's a function of the impaired loans and if you track back from 2008 back to 2002, you will find that there was practically a zero level of impairment.  Now, I mean, the regulatory approach that's used and that was used during that period, it's a point ... it's a point-in-time approach, compared to a ... compared to an approach which is far more intrusive and is trying to look at economic values in the portfolio and that.  Ours is an accounting approach and, the reality of it is, it takes account of the capital and the impairments which adjusts capital.</p></speech>

Did that not send off a flag to you, in your office, and others in the regulation office and in the Central Bank?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.1035" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Neary" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052800002#U07100"><p>Well, I think, the final part of your question touches on the issue.  Within the regulator's office, we were looking at the compliance with the capital and the other ratios that we talked about already.  </p>  <p>         We're now moving into the area of systemic risk and financial stability.  The size and the risks for the sector as a whole were the responsibility of the Central Bank.  There is no doubt about that and they would accept the responsibility for that.  But, the warnings that were coming from the Central Bank certainly did not create a concern that actions needed to be taken.  They were benign and the conclusion was that we had a soft landing and so were the commentaries from all the other bodies, including the OECD and the IMF.</p></speech>

I mean, we have testimony here that consistently, and I think Mary Burke gave it yesterday afternoon and others did, that by 2006, the game was over.  It didn't matte how many staff that she had in her office and so forth.  So, why were your office so late in coming to the table when credit growth had soared in all the years since 2002, with a very short disruption in 2001 and 2002?</p></speech>

It was focused very much on the capital and focused very much on the ... on the level of impairments that were emerging.  And we left the bigger picture to the Central Bank and it was within their analysis and their assessment which, I suppose, gave us comfort that we weren't in an extremely challenging position.</p></speech>

Good morning Mr. Neary.  I just wanted to ask you a couple of quick questions at the start.

And is ... it's that ... you'd ... essentially, it means that you don't show your hand or declare your intentions, that you want to be seen to give every bit of help short of assistance, and maintain that kind of opaque position in relation to any actions you might take.

That they might, they might assume for example, that liquidity assistance might be available from a central bank and constructive ambiguity, I think that, that concept allowed the Central Bank to keep all those options at the table, on the table, without committing to any of them.

No, as I say, I regret that Mrs. Burke has that impression.  I certainly can see how in the weeks and that ... as the crisis started to unfold and a lot of meetings were organised, mainly by the Governor, in relation to liquidity and ELA and things like that, and discussions with the banks, that at short notice, I could be asked to join those meetings and, literally, I ... because of that, wouldn't necessarily involve people from banking supervision.  But other than that, I cannot think of any occasions where that would have happened.  Now, there wouldn't have been that many meetings, I mean, where that could arise.  But all I can say is, you know, I regret that that perception persisted in the organisation.</p></speech>

Can I ask then, in reference to your ... your evidence earlier today where you spoke at length about the principles-led approach that existed in regulation at the time.  And this morning, you said:</p><blockquote>Trust and reliance was placed on the bank boards; banks should have known.  We believed that they were best placed to judge risk.  There was trust put in the banks to run their affairs prudently.</blockquote>  <p>If that was the case in terms of prudential matters rather than consumer matters, what was your job as regulator?</p></speech>

I think the ... the argument would have been made that they were best placed to assess the risks and run their business in according ... in accordance with the risks.</p></speech>

You said in relation to sectoral concentrations that it was a guideline - it was a useful one.  That was your ... a direct quote from this morning.  And then you furthermore went on later to say that it was allowed to fall into abeyance.  We've had evidence from several banks, including Mr. McCarthy, the former chief executive of Ulster Bank, to say that these guidelines were honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  Do you have an appreciation of the absolute anger that exists among the general public in terms of the &euro;64 billion that was pumped into financial institutions, in terms of retired people whose pensions have been wiped out because share prices have plummeted-----</p></speech>

I ... I mean, the point of your question is do I regret that, and I do.  But now ... just ... I think it's important just to get a bit of balance into my response.  I mean, there are two ... there are two cohorts of people involved here.  There are the depositors in the banks and there are the shareholders in the banks.  The shareholders, regrettably, they lost money.  They owned the banks.  It was their boards, their directors, that let them down.  Their ... their ... the boards of the banks had the primary obligation to the shareholders in the banks.  The primary obligation of the regulator was to the depositors of the banks, and thanks to the Government guarantee, the depositors' interests were saved.  And I accept that our regulation of the banks did not prevent that happening.</p></speech>

I think that it would still be a core methodology because capital would be still at the centre of banking supervision.  I think asset quality and earnings, liquidity, all of those factors would still remain at the centre of banking supervision, but I think the approach now is a far more rigorous and far more intrusive approach.</p></speech>

We don't have to bail out bicycle shops or dry cleaners; we do have to bail out banks, therefore, you should have said in response to Senator D'Arcy's question, you know, "You keep lending that much to property and you'll be calling upon me and my colleagues and the legislators in Leinster House for &euro;64 billion."</p></speech>

We have, first of all, the individual institutions and the focus on the key indicators of those, which over the years did not suggest that there was any major fault lines appearing in the loan portfolios.  There was no impairments or ... materialising.  That's on the one hand, at the micro-level.  I think then we step across into the wider context, the level at ... at system level, and that is where I think our colleagues in the Central Bank have to come into the equation.  And, like I've already said, I think their analysis and assessment of the situation was overly benign.</p></speech>

Chairman, could we go to Vol. 1 and page 104?  And that relates to 2004, Financial Regulator letter to a director of a large financial institution.  And just reading from here, Chairman.</p><blockquote>The letter refers to a meeting which took place in September 2003 and a follow up meeting in February 2004.  A period of 9 months had elapsed between the two meetings, though the following serious concerns had been raised in the first letter:<br /><br />[And the serious concerns were]<br /><br />- the inadequacy of Internal Audit,<br /><br />- a substantial increase in the commercial loan book<br /><br />- lack of progress in the review of commercial loan files, [and]<br /><br />- failure to segregate &quot;front&quot; and back office functions in Treasury.</blockquote>  <p>And then, &quot;The letter does not indicate that any regulatory action had been taken as a result of the findings.&quot;  So there's nine months between the two letters, and, presumably, an interval between the first letter and the ... the expression of the serious concerns, and nothing was happening.  I have to put that proposition to you, Mr. Neary.</p></speech>

Thank you, Senator.  In the case of that particular ... particular bank, the bank supervision department, at the end of that, if you like, exchange that I have just described, imposed an increase in the solvency ratio requirement of that institution and also got a firm of ... leading firm of accountants to carry out assessment of the commercial lending business of that particular entity.</p></speech>

"Bank of Ireland remains comfortable with the exposure in this category."  And it's the second line going into the third line in the last paragraph on that page 67.

And it was in relation to a letter that Mrs. Burke had sent out to the sectoral concentration framework that was coming under Basel.

I mean, it was the job of the regulator, certainly, the authority, the staff to challenge statements like that as to how they could take comfort from it and give us a similar assurance.  I don't see that any further correspondence mentioned here, but maybe it was followed up.  I don't know.</p></speech>

Was it appropriate that the financial institutions in the domestic market were regulated the same as those in the IFSC?  And could you tell us your experience in your regulation in the IFSC?</p></speech>

Because they have concern that a lesser regime that might apply to the international banks might be seen as in some way promoting the kind of the tax advantages of establishing in the IFSC, and in some way a less demanding regime on them, for that reason.</p></speech>

I think &euro;80 billion between those two.  Did you come across them in your auditing?</p></speech>

But the supervisory requirements that would have applied to Depfa would have been exactly the same as the requirements that applied to the domestic banks.  There was no reduction in the oversight of Depfa.</p></speech>

I suppose it's public utterances, because I think it was a public company.  It would be generally known that most of Depfa's exposure were sovereign debt exposures, requiring very little levels of capitalisation.  And I think they fell victim to the emerging difficulties in the international funding markets.</p></speech>

Thank you, Chairman.</p>  <p> When it was proposed that regulations should be done completely separately, it was very strongly resisted by the Central Bank who say in the last paragraph there, if we had it separate' ... and you would be, if you like, as the first Financial Regulator, out on your own as a separate institution, that would lead, "to loss of regulatory expertise; difficulty in establishing an international reputation [...]; and duplication of supervisory effort.''</p>  <p>  Isn't that exactly where we've ended up?

I suppose, if I understand you correctly, Senator, the question is did this structure that eventually emerged ... was that a factor in what happened?  I don't think you can blame the structure for that, I think the approach that was adopted by the authority was inherited from the Central Bank which was a principles-led approach and continued in the same vein.  And it's likely that if there was a separate agency that may have, that agency may have also done the same.  I don't know that, I had no involvement whatsoever in any of these arguments and happened way before I was appointed any senior position in the regulator.</p></speech>

And that this style of regulation is what the authority adopted; so, you were saying that because of resources, that this limited the potential, perhaps, to enforce these matters.  Who decided that, I mean, was there a proposal at the authority that, "Look, we're going to prioritise" or?</p></speech>

And the authority, and I think it might be somewhere in the minutes of the authority, accepted that ... the code should, sorry, the sanctions should first of all focus on ... on matters that were already in the code of conduct and directly on the protection of consumers-----</p></speech>

So that had to be, that had to be, first of all you had to define the behaviour, and then you had to see was that a prescribed contravention of that behaviour, whatever happened, and then you had to decide was there enough evidence to commence an inquiry, and then you had to have separate people doing the inquiry.

So it was endeavoured, as far as possible, to, that people should, on both sides of the house, Central Bank and regulator, be on the, the same salary scales, which replicated those in the Civil Service; we're essentially the same as the Civil Service in terms of-----</p></speech>

She also made reference to the fact that, in dealing with her duties in liaising with a bank, occasionally the bank personnel might say, &quot;Look, I'll be talking to so-and-so about that on the seventh floor&quot;.  Is this true, first of all, that there was this <i>ad hoc</i>, for want of a better expression, gazumping of the authority of people in bank supervision in favour of dealing with somebody on the seventh floor?  And, if it was, would you feel that this was a healthy environment to promote within the organisation?</p></speech>

Now, you have a question, the question arises that ... I mean, Mrs. Burke's area was a very complex area in terms of the move to Basel.  This was becoming a very complex environment, and she required, you know, skills, a skill set that had kind of accounting or banking or, you know, that type of financial expertise.  And it wasn't always necessary ... necessarily the case that there were people in other departments that could be easily transferred in to take up the running on what she wanted done.</p></speech>

So maybe just to get matters rolling in this regard, could you please describe the channel of communication between you and the Department of Finance during your tenure as CEO of the Financial Regulator; and how did this relationship then evolve; and how did you deal with the emerging material issues prior to the establishment of the domestic standing group in 2007?  So I'm talking about the relationship with these agencies now, before the DSG was put in place?</p></speech>

So he would be kept very well informed.  Then coming down there was relationships at various levels, depending -- and it was a kind of an issue driven relationship.  It would depend of what the subject matter was.  It could come to me; it could come to the head of banking supervision; it could go to any other head of function across the organisation, I think, really, depending what the issue was.  There was no really formalised relationships in place, but we knew one another and we had a cordial constructive relationship with colleagues in the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

He said he had a meeting with you at which you both discussed 100% mortgages and the worries around them.  And he said to you, he said "My reaction to him [that's you] was that he was wasting his time [talking about applying higher capital weightings to 100% mortgages]".  He said "to be helpful, I suggested to him that he immediately ban the provision of mortgages of more than 90%.  I told him ... I would come out and back him publicly.  [And] The reaction I got was it wasn't the role of the regulator to interfere in the market.  To which my response was, this is the very time the regulator should interfere in the market."</p></speech>

The meeting was that I went to Mr. Goggin to tell him that we were introducing the higher weighting on the mortgages.  Mr. Goggin's own business ... at that stage we were aware that, you know, he was ... they were well out there leading the pack in the market for 100% mortgages.  And I ... I certainly don't recall any strong argument from Mr. Goggin to have the ... the product withdrawn.  But in relation to the product itself, it was ... it was made clear very early on - in the early days of the Financial Regulator - I think the day of the launch of the Financial Regulator's first annual report, this question was posed in the ... in the press conference or the public conference launching the report: what about 100% mortgages, are you going to ban them?  And the then chief executive was quite emphatic that it was not the role of the regulator to be banning products; that it was in conflict with the ... the view of the regulator, that a full choice should be given to people and that the emphasis should be on the way in which they were sold to people rather than banning the choice.</p></speech>

You said, when you were giving evidence in relation to your meeting with Mr. Drumm, there were two meetings and, again, there were no minutes or no records of those meetings.  And I'm just wondering why would there not have been.  You explained that one of the meetings was of a personal nature, which was why there were no minutes.

On that particular ... it was more, I think, the way in which that particular meeting happened, that he dropped down to see me informally.

We've heard ... one could argue we've heard a view from a particular cohort of people, who ... the regulated community so far.  I think it's important for balance that the regulator should also try and give their sense of ... of what happened, the measures that they tried to take, albeit that they didn't work.  But I think that's important for balance.  That's why I took the opportunity in my opening statement to set out those measures, to inform the committee and I think we now have a ... have an opportunity here today to discuss the, the good things that we did and the bad things that we did or the things that we didn't do at all.</p></speech>

And to remind you you're under oath,  you're here for questioning and that this inquiry has two things to do: one is to find out what went wrong, and secondly is to prevent it from happening again.  What Senator O'Keeffe is asking you is that yes, there were a lot of actions taken by the ... by you and your office.  The question is ... is that there were series of things that happened and we ended up in the biggest financial crisis that this country ever faced.  For us to prevent that from happening in the future, we need to know what went wrong.  And Senator O'Keeffe is asking you what went wrong and we need to hear it from you.</p></speech>

Lots of people have been surmising about might and might not have happened.  You were central, you were there, as were your colleagues.  And yet, we are still no clearer, after being here for two and a half hours or whatever, we are no ... really no clearer as to what the mistakes were that were made and what errors were made------</p></speech>

I believe that in setting out my statement today that I should emphasise some of the actions taken by the authority because I believe comprehensive studies have been taken ... have been carried out by Professor Honohan and Professor Nyberg and ... Watson and Regling ... in those reports, that clearly cover the failings of the principles-based system, the failings of the regulator.  I mean, they are all set out for everybody to see and I felt that in my statement that I should just give the counter argument to those to get some balance into it.  That's all.  There is no ulterior motive and I'm sorry if you feel that, you know, I didn't give enough focus on the downside.</p></speech>

I think the source for that response has to be the Honohan report.  I think we adopted a principles-led based system of regulation that clearly failed.  It wasn't intrusive enough.  We didn't rigorously assess the controls and procedures and the risk assessments carried out by the banks over their business.  We allowed a concentration ratio guideline to fall into abeyance and not to actively, I think, follow that up and implement it and ... in that regard, I think the style and the approach to supervision that we chose to follow at the authority level was not the right one but it was the same as the approach taken in all the other European countries and it was ... it was ... it got a ringing endorsement from objective ... objective agencies like the IMF and the OECD.</p></speech>

I want to ask you in relation to ... just in relation to your actual principles-based approach and I put it to you and it could be suggested that not only did you implement and celebrate a principles-based approach but you went actually further than a principles-based approach because the rules that apply to that approach were not possible to be followed through, given all that we've heard early on in terms of resources.  And I want to put this quote to you that you gave in a speech in 2006 at the Regulation 360 Conference: "We feel a regulatory approach is good for business and that it is not overly rules-based and encourages good business practice by allowing each regulated financial service provider to determine for itself how best to abide by regulatory requirements."  Does that not mean that you were allowing the banks to regulate themselves, given the fact that you had no ability to follow up on sanctions during your term?</p></speech>

So, yes, I think with hindsight what you're saying there, I would accept.</p></speech>

Was there any other European jurisdiction that had a principles-based approach but that could not follow up on sanctions when the principles were breached?</p></speech>

I wouldn't have that in any detail of what administrative sanctions regimes applied in other countries for prudential supervision.  Certainly, I would be aware that for the consumer protection, especially in the UK, I think they had a pretty rigorous rule book and a sanctions regime affecting that but I don't know if they had it for the prudential supervision.  So, I'm unable to answer that.</p></speech>

That was the same and the running and the management of the risk management of the businesses was a matter for the boards and management, as I understood it in all other EU countries.  Whether or not, they were able to back that up with an administrative sanctions regime, I'm not sure of.</p></speech>

I'm putting to you that: is it the case that you were the only jurisdiction, to your knowledge, that was in that type of position ... that you had principles but nothing else, nothing to back it up?</p></speech>

Can I ask you, your predecessor of the CEO of the Financial Regulator made a comment for the purpose of the internal review of the crisis simulation exercise in 2005.  He said: "That in a crisis [and this is summarised] ... that in a crisis scenario, there is a limit to the type of information that can be provided by a principles-based regulator".  Can you comment on how ... on this and how this was reflected in the next exercise?</p></speech>

So, that would be the main source and then overlaid on top of that would be information that could be got at fairly short notice because of the relationships between the banking supervision people and the regulated entities.  So, if there was an information request, it would be sent out and got in fairly quickly.</p></speech>

We know from the Nyberg report that the top 20 customers in Anglo Irish Bank at May 2008 had 50% of the Irish loan book, which was &euro;41.7 billion at the time.  Now that's 20 borrowers in that bank had 50% of the loan book, that's more ... there's more people in this room than had 50% of the loan book of Anglo Irish Bank.  We know in terms of INBS that 25 customers represented 51% of the INBS commercial loan book.  Were these levels of loan concentration by borrower a cause of concern to you personally, as Financial Regulator, and did you have that information?</p></speech>

So, yes, that information would be available and would be circulated within the organisation but the point I was making earlier was that, from the point of view of the authority, all of those loans would have been in compliance with the large exposure directed, the legal requirements set out in that directive, so they were in compliance with the law------</p></speech>

That 51% ... at the time ... at the time that 51% of the commercial loan book of INBS resided in the hands of 25 individuals.  </p>  <p>               The question I am asking you is: what do you do in relation to that?  And you have pointed out - and I've not made the suggestion that it was against the law - but can I make this point: that the directive that was transposed by the Central Bank allowed ... allowed you to put additional sanctions there or additional requirements which you did do in terms of directors' loans and in terms of loans to shareholders, but you didn't in relation to concentration to borrower.  So can you answer the question: was this a concern to you that half of Anglo Irish Bank's loan book was in the hands of 20 individuals and what did you personally do as regulator?</p></speech>

These loans had ... had those loans exhibited any impairment, it would have been our ... our job to make sure that proper provisions were made and charges were made against the capital in assessing the capital position of each of those banks and that would have been our primary focus.  And in relation to whether or not that constituted a risk to the system, it was the focus of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Can I put to you that when the lawyer and academic, Bill Black, appeared before this committee, he was asked about these types of concentrations and he said and I'll quote:</p><blockquote>I have never seen a concentration that high at any financial institution of any size, anywhere in the world, at any time in history.  It is absolutely no question, no ifs, ands or buts, utterly unsafe and unsound.  And I would ... I would have begun efforts to stop it immediately.  At those levels we would have been gearing up for receivership.</blockquote>  <p>What is your views in relation to Bill Black's testimony to this committee?</p></speech>

It is up to the lender to make sure that when they are lending to a large borrower that they secure that borrowing, that they ensure there is capacity to repay it.  That assessment is theirs.  So when the loan is being negotiated and put on the books, there is no involvement by the Financial Regulator in that process.  The involvement by the Financial Regulator arises in the ... in the event that such a loan becomes non-performing or is impaired to make sure that there is proper provisions made against it.  We ... it ... it is inconceivable that the regulator can determine who or who doesn't get a credit from a bank as a customer of that bank.</p></speech>

The transposition of the directive actually does exactly what you are arguing that you should not be able to do.  It does put limits in relation to the type of loans that can be given by financial institutions in relation to their own resources to ... to large exposures.  You had the power to increase those levels beyond what is ... what was in that directive.  You didn't do that obviously, and you were completely aware that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide were lending to a small number of cohorts at a huge amount of their loan book.  The question I have to ask you again is: why did you do nothing, giving the risk to that institution of concentrating their loan book to a very small number of individuals, a power that was allowed to you by transposing the minimum requirements under the '95 EU directive.</p></speech>

I make this point.  When the Central Bank issued their notice to the banks, you actually state in it while it was minimum requirements, you have increased the requirements for directors and shareholders.  So I'm not sure if that was the same that happened right across Europe.  But you had the ability to increase the requirements in relation to concentration of borrowers.  Why did you not do it?  Regardless of what other jurisdictions did, you now knew that we had two institutions that were heavily concentrated to 45 individuals.  20 in Anglo, half the loan ...

I can't conceive of a situation where the regulator would intervene in a relationship between the bank and the client that has a contractual relationship and it's prescribed by the law and if the law allows that relationship to develop, well, you have to live with that.

Yes I do, indeed, Chairman.  What that event was about was the former chairman of the Financial Regulator, Mr. Patterson, had retired and in recognition of his retirement, there was a small function organised to, I suppose, to mark the occasion.  It was organised by the IBF, which was the bankers' federation and they issued invitations to people to attend the dinner to mark the occasion of Mr. Patterson's retirement.</p></speech>

I think it was a once-off event and, you know, with the benefit of hindsight, maybe it was misjudged, but I don't think that ... that impacted on the professionalism in the relationship between ourselves and the banks but the optics of it, with hindsight, were not good.</p></speech>

Mr. Bill Black, a former US regulator, referred to banks like Anglo Irish Bank growing like crazy based on property lending, turning out huge profits and then an inevitable disastrous crash.  The loans and advances extended from 1998 to 2008 amounted as ... the growth of those was as follows: Bank of Ireland 325%, which is huge; AIB 330%, which is huge, and Anglo, 1,950%, which is mega.  Mr. Neary, I want to put these concrete figures to you.  In 2002, Anglo Irish Bank had total loans out there of &euro;13.3 billion; in 2003, those loans increased by &euro;4 billion; 2004, by &euro;7 billion; 2005, by &euro;10 billion; 2006, by &euro;16 billion; and 2007, by &euro;17 billion.  Mr. Neary, did you notice this, to use Black's terms, "crazy" level of growth, and that this was largely for speculation and development in construction projects?</p></speech>

So that while there was growth, it did not transmit itself into defaults or bad debts or impairments.</p></speech>

And that is why I think it's important to oversee the risk control environment in the banks and to keep a very close eye on impairments and we were doing that.  But it was ... it is clear now, and I accept the argument, that that was not intrusive enough and that we should have taken more steps.  And, as we discussed this morning in relation to the concentration ratio, we should have taken more steps to halt the progress of that loan growth.</p></speech>

And even when confronted with evidence that the banks had insufficient info, the regulators failed to grasp the scale of the potential exposure.  Now, Mr. Neary, throughout the 2000s, this period we are talking about, the banks were showering loans like ticker tape-----</p></speech>

There's just two areas I want to touch on, if I may, before we conclude this session.  On page 11 of your opening statement you said that apart from considerable day-to-day contact with their respective banks, staff in banking supervision carried out over 50 inspections of banks between 2003 and 2008.  Are you presenting this as a positive?</p></speech>

I mean, the reality of it is that despite that level of oversight, intervention and engagement, we got to a ... to the unfortunate situation where we, we found ourselves at the end of 2008.</p></speech>

I can recall the value for money report that was done in 2007, and yes, the, the selection by the supervision staff for the inspections that they were to carry out I think derived from the internal risk rating programme that they had in banking supervision, which took in account of a wide range of factors.  There was an annual review that they did.  They had, they had a well-established procedure in banking supervision for determining the inspections.

I suppose, Mr. Neary, my point is ... or my question is in relation to the criticisms coming from the C &amp;amp; AG, about the level of inspections and the, the methodology being used in carrying out those inspections to evaluate the risk being taken by the banks and what your response was, as Financial Regulator, to those reports.</p></speech>

Those people then took ... took that on.

It is on page 41 of Vol. 3.  It is an e-mail. I won't say who it is from, but it is from someone in the Financial Regulator's office to one of the banks.  It is talking about one of the questions that the IMF wants to look at in particular, when they come to meet the banks to look at the stress testing that they have done themselves.  They want to know:</p><blockquote>How sensitive would specific provisions be to a large drop in house prices, given that the collateral behind the mortgage loan would have to be revalued.  We realize that the current level of specific provisions is a very low percentage of the loan reflecting very low default rates.</blockquote>  <p>So just to summarise, this is the IMF coming into Dublin to meet with the banks following the stress tests that they have conducted, the parameters set by the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  They too want a focus on a large drop in house prices and how resilient the banks would be to that.  Why?  How resilient the banks would be to a large drop in house prices.  My question is, why?</p></speech>

I want to move to wrap up by one final question and then it is Senator D'Arcy, Deputy McGrath and then we will break for lunch.  It comes back to the breaches we were discussing earlier this morning.  Mr. Neary to put the question to you, at what point did the breaches become so endemic that it became a financial stability issue and become a Central Bank issue, which would then mean the Governor should have followed up or discussed new legislation or powers that might have been requested from the Minister or the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

It had fallen into abeyance.  So I think the matter that would have informed a financial stability assessment would be the growth in the loan portfolios of the banks, irrespective of the limit being in place.</p></speech>

Mr. Neary you said that the principles-based system failed.  But there is no system without people.  Did the people within the principles-based system fail?</p></speech>

You see that at that particular time the system is in widespread use.  It is also embedded in the proposals that are coming down the road from Basel which actually devolves more autonomy if you will to the banks to determine their own capitalisation and their own internal controls.  So I can see how people, myself included, believed that the principles-led regulation may have been suitable.  We committed to making the system work but it did not work.</p></speech>

It was a failure, I think, a misjudgment of the risk by people that did not propel people to take decisions to use the powers.  I think if the assessment of the risk was judged to be a major threat I think that would have forced people to consider what actions.  I can't see that people would ignore the need to take actions if we had adjudicated on the risk properly but we did not adjudicate on the risk properly, so therefore it was not a matter of people being involved in dereliction.  It was people involved in misjudgment.</p></speech>

First of all, it was the over-concentration on property lending, which, in the year 2009, was decimated by the fall in the values of property but, before that, the solvency, liquidity issues were also a contributory factor.</p></speech>

I mean, for example, the 2007 report, published in November '07, financial stability report, concluded ... the overall conclusion is that "The Irish financial system's shock-absorption capacity remains robust and the system is well-placed to cope with emerging issues", November 2007.</p></speech>

Take, for example, the insurance department where we had the reinsurance directive and the Solvency II directive to be implemented, which was broadly equivalent to Basel II.  So, in circumstances like that, the ... those departments also had huge work demands on them and ... but I did have discretion that if there was a surplus in one area, to move to the other, but I just have to qualify that because it was a question of skillsets as well as available people.</p></speech>

Just to clarify one final point, Mr. Neary, and I think it's important from an evidential point of view, Mr. Horan's statement yesterday that he made formal proposals in August '05 for higher capital charges for high loan-to-value mortgages were not accepted as they were not considered by senior management in the CBFSAI to be necessary.  Subsequently, they were implemented, in 2006, but can you just clarify, they were not accepted by whom?</p></speech>

And it covered a range of topics, including having a look at a deposit protection scheme, legislation for nationalisation, etc., the tools that might be needed in the event that there was a crisis.

I think ... at ... it may have taken effect from 1 July, around that time, whereas there was monthly reporting done ... that ... it set out ... it set out a kind of a schedule of cashflows whereby you set out the cash in, the cash out, and you had to maintain a net balance in various maturity ... various maturities from out to a week, and then a month, and so forth.  That was more or less the kind of thinking.

The collateral that they had to offer wasn't in a form, I think, that was acceptable for the ECB to allow the Central Bank to provide liquidity to it.  That was my understanding, and I think there was historical reasons for that because most of the collateral that, I think, is acceptable to the ECB is essentially in the form of portfolios of mortgages, and there's a discount on those and they gave out the facilities on the back of that.  Now, when ... that requires that every mortgage document, to the best of my understanding, has to have a consent that the mortgage can be transferred from the originator of the mortgage to somebody else.  Hence the securitisation, and all this that goes on, is done with the consent of each individual mortgage.</p>  <p>  As I understood it at the time, the documentation in Nationwide, the individual mortgage documentation that they had, didn't have that facility.  So they couldn't be transferred.  So, therefore, it rendered it ineligible for the ECB direct assistance.  So they had to construct an arrangement with the Central Bank, an elaborate arrangement for ... to identify assets and construct an arrangement whereby the Central Bank could give them liquidity.  And I don't think that was done at the time.  It was recognising that issue and putting an arrangement in place for that particular institution, which was different to the others.</p></speech>

Based on the information available to us, which ... I've talked about it before, came in from the returns.  They came in from the institutions.  And also we had had Pricewaterhouse in in a couple of the institutions and also there was another corporate finance house which was advising one of the institutions, had also looked over the portfolio.  And based on all of those sources, there was no evidence that there was a solvency issue in any of the institutions on the night of the guarantee.</p></speech>

In fact, to the best of my recollection, Deputy, on the night of the guarantee, the ... if you were to calculate backwards from the risk assets in each of the banks, collectively the capital requirement was of the order of &euro;33 billion and there was actually &euro;36 billion in capital in the system.  So there was some surplus capital in the system on that night.</p></speech>

Each bank got, now I don't, I don't believe there were any high-priority items reported up along from those particular reports.  I don't think the, the, inspectors that carried out those classified any of the findings as high priority but there was some common threads like not getting net worth statements and things like that come to mind.  But every single one of the banks that was inspected, they received a letter setting out the findings and I can only assume that that letter set out some remedial actions that were expected.</p></speech>

At the meeting board minutes from AIB on 7 September suggest that, they quote "The funding profile of the institution was weak, and it was unlikely to be able to refinance funding that was maturing periodically over the ensuing year, commencing in December 2008."  It goes on to say, "The quality of loans was suspect and could require write-downs ranging from a benign 13% estimated by the [Financial Regulator], to 30%/50% estimated by Bank of Ireland".  The minutes record of the Financial Regulator asked AIB and Bank of Ireland to put &euro;2 billion each into Irish Nationwide.  Later on Mr. Sheehy told representatives from the Financial Regulator "It was his '[which was Mr. Sheehy] understanding that the institution's loan portfolio would required to be written-down substantially, and, accordingly, that if AIB acceded to the [Financial Regulator's] request, AIB would, in due course, probably have to incur ... write-downs ... of &euro;1bn [off] the funding line [they] provide." So the question I have to you is, this is AIB telling you that, or telling the Financial Regulator, that if they put &euro;2 billion into Irish Nationwide they were going to lose &euro;1 billion of it, did you concur with that view?</p></speech>

And ... as a precautionary measure to make sure that, the thinking at that time was that if there was a liquidity difficulty in one of the smaller organisations that could be addressed by the market, that we should try and favour that solution. </p></speech>

We said, &quot;We can't carry on this discussion&quot;.</blockquote>  <p>How can it be, given you were getting daily reports on liquidity, that Richie Boucher was shocked and shaken by the lack of information that the Central Bank had on the liquidity position of Nationwide?</p></speech>

A meeting was arranged, attended by the two large banks and Irish Nationwide.  If Irish Nationwide chose to be, how would you say, coy or restrictive about the information they provided, look I mean that, that may have happened.</p></speech>

Can you comment on the decision, on why the decision to nationalise Anglo was not taken on the night of the guarantee and what was your advice to Government or the Governor in this regard at the time and can you discuss if nationalisation of Anglo earlier would have sped up the resolution to the crisis?</p></speech>

We, the chairman and I ... when we revisited that meeting, the Governor had mentioned to us that the, the, the kind of choice that was being considered was a nationalisation of Anglo and a guarantee of the rest or a guarantee of everybody.  </p>  <p>         When we entered the meeting we were asked to give a kind of view on that.  We expressed a concern that if the guarantee wasn't very sharp and focused, and if it left questions out there about its extent or who it applied to or all the rest of it, there was a doubt about its ... we were worried about how it would be received and how effective it would be.  And the reason that we expressed that concern was that, earlier on in the month of September, the Minister had announced an increase in the deposit guarantee scheme and there was ... we were getting a lot of phone calls into our helpline, and into the consumer information office, about what was covered, and who was entitled to what, and all the rest of it.  So our concern that we expressed that night was grounded in that.</p></speech>

Mr. Neary, Dermot Gleeson gave evidence to the committee ... he was talking about a meeting, the meeting the night of the guarantee, and he says and I quote:</p><blockquote>During the course of the night we suggested to the authorities that a sentence in their draft statement about the guarantee, which said something like, quote, 'Financial Regulator has informed the Government that all the Irish banks were solvent', end of quote, was probably unnecessary and possibly dangerous in the sense that Anglo shares would be traded on foot of it, which could lead to complications for the Government.</blockquote>  <p>Now that was Mr. Gleeson; Eugene Sheehy of the AIB made his own notes of the meeting, these have been presented as evidence to the committee.  In them Mr. Sheehy said:</p><blockquote>There were also issues in the Government's draft which we were uneasy about relating to attestations by the FR [Financial Regulator] that the system was solvent and that all banks were solvent.  We felt there was clearly a risk in this statement if market participants purchased shares in companies once the guarantee was issued and it subsequently transpired that these companies were not as strong as contended.</blockquote>  <p>Did you make that suggestion, that that statement be included in the draft?</p></speech>

And I think, I now that this is a speculative point, I mean, if it had been put to us at the meeting, the chairman and I obviously would have discussed it.  But I would be pretty reluctant to agree to any statement like that - we don't give warranties as to soundness to anybody.</p></speech>

Mr. Neary, you appeared on "Prime Time" on 2 October 2008 to discuss the domestic Irish banking system and the Irish bank guarantee.  You said, and I'll quote it back to you, "The important thing is that risks emerge over the lifetime of the loan portfolio, and it's important that there is adequate capital put in there to absorb those risks, and by any estimate the Irish banks are so well capitalised compared to any banks, anywhere, across Europe, that I am confident that they can deal with any loans or any impairments that emerge in the ordinary course of business in the foreseeable future."</p></speech>

Not only were they in compliance with the ratios, but they had, as I just mentioned to you earlier, all the banks had some surplus capital as well.  Some weeks before that, I had seen a table that had been presented, prepared, I think, by some international college of regulators, I can't remember where it was, which showed me where our required ratio stood in relation to the other countries in Europe, and we were close to the top of that.</p></speech>

We have evidence, in this inquiry, from Bank of Ireland minutes, within days of you making this statement, that they were looking at an option of recapitalisation through the Irish Government.  We know as a fact now that &euro;10 billion was pledged by the Irish State within what, 70 days of you making this statement, that one bank was nationalised a number of days later.  This wasn't, you know, this wasn't a case of trying to see far off into the distant, distant future.  Within days of you making this statement, some of the major financial institutions in this State were coming knocking on the Government's door looking to be recapitalised.  The question is, you knew, above anybody else in this State, what was happening under the bonnet of these banks.  Do you still believe that the account that you gave was the best account, with all of the knowledge that you had at that time, in relation to the capital position of those banks-----</p></speech>

I mean, it was a bit more pragmatic than that, that when the DSG was set up, it was a question of who's going from, who's going to be the person that goes to that meeting, and represents the Financial Regulator?

Somebody could attend a meeting in their entirety as the person who has ultimate responsibility and deals with all engagements of that meeting, and walks out the door with there being no overhang whatsoever; and there are people who attend meetings on the behalf of an agency, an organisation or a group, who they then come back to and relate their activity on the domestic standing group, and that feeds into a line management level of responsibility and accountability.</p></speech>

And other jurisdictions started to ... to essentially maintain a higher tier 1 and total capital levels.  And it was something that, if you will, developed to satisfy the expectations of the market and as an indicator of financial strength, and it was in that context that the discussions started to centre around the need to demonstrate that the Irish banks could meet the higher capital requirements.  That's a separate matter.  That evolved subsequently and it was in response, I think, to market expectations.</p></speech>

There was a process where this institution looked at the other one to see if there was any possibility for merging the two and unifying the two.  And this kind of ... this discussion took place, I think, in the context of what I mentioned to you earlier about the ... the ... that particular report about the smaller institution and that it was seeking to engage with its creditors.  And we were asking everybody to look at everybody else, I mean.  And this ... this ... I also believe, right, that behind this ... the motivation from this letter was that this particular institution may have seen that there might have been a benefit to the way in which it was being perceived by the market, if it was seen to, in some way, strengthen the other institution by a merger, right?  I know that's a big convoluted but these people were saying if we ... if we take over the other, we'll be seen as white knights and it'll convince everybody that we're really much stronger than people are saying.  So, I think there was a bit of motivation behind this letter.</p></speech>

Now, at that stage, the Financial Regulator was not invited to participate in those discussions.  Those discussions took place ... the Central Bank were involved, the Minister and the Department officials were involved, but we weren't.

It's in Vol. 1, page 123 of the document.  Again, I'm not sure that it's one that can be publicly displayed, but I want to read the quote to you.  It's recorded at a board meeting of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority and it is as follows, "the underlying fundamentals of the residential property market appear to be strong and the current trend in prices would seem not to imply a significant correction.  The central scenario is, therefore, a soft landing."  This was the second half of 2007.  First of all, I want to ask you who conducted this research.  What was their, I suppose, qualifications to do so?  And were there any dissenting views expressed at that meeting that you recollect with the research, as produced?</p></speech>

I want to ask you, Mr. Neary, what advice was provided to Government on liquidity and solvency for Irish financial institutions?  Can you advise why it was the view of certain banks that two institutions could be allowed to fail as part of the options considered on that night in September 2008?</p></speech>

And I think that was their ... that was their overriding concern, to kind of "Guarantee us and, you know, don't worry so much about the depositors in the other institutions".  And, you know, I ... I won't ... I don't think I can be led by that view that they say "Guarantee us and forget about everybody else".  I mean, the assessment and the decision was grounded on what was considered to be the best thing to do on the night.  And it was grounded on giving a guarantee to the depositors in solvent institutions.  And, I think, while it wasn't there for the final ... the final,  if you like, discussion and getting things down to the point of guarantee, guarantee plus nationalisation or guarantee in total, I mean, the reality of it is that, you know, these ... these individual institutions just seem to be looking after their own interests.</p></speech>

And the authority expected me to make an appearance at those and I did seem to attend those.  It was part of my job to go those.  But ... other ... I can't recall anything else, I mean, if there's something there ... you have a specific, I'd be able to confirm it or not but nothing springs to mind.</p></speech>

Michael Casey, who is a retired economist with the Central Bank, publicly commented in October 2008 on the nature of close relationships between regulators and banks and I want to quote him again directly: "The close relationships between regulators and banks, difficult to avoid in a small country, will have to be ended."  How would you describe, yourself, the nature of the relationships between the domestic banks and you, as chief executive of the regulator, in the period that we're discussing?</p></speech>

I mean ... you know, it was professional and constructive.  I mean, it wasn't in any way destructive but that's really as far as I'd go.  I mean, it was just a normal business relationship between the regulator and the regulated institutions.</p></speech>

At the time, what was going through your mind when you were attending that particular gathering?  I'm not entering any value judgment.  I'm asking what he was thinking when you decided on that particular night, that it was appropriate for you, as the Financial Regulator, to attend a social event at which most of the bankers that your institution was regulating were attending and just six weeks after a blanket guarantee for those institutions had been entered into by the State?</p></speech>

This was to mark his retirement and I felt I'd like to attend that particular thing to mark the occasion of his retirement.  But, I mean, it's very difficult now, with the benefit of hindsight, to regard that anything other than ill-judged that it went ahead at all.</p></speech>

I, certainly, was involved in a crisis simulation exercise and various people ... members of staff were involved in the day-to-day work of the CSE.  It was a kind of a co-ordinating committee but its main function, as I recall, was in relation to crisis simulation and stuff like that.</p></speech>

I mean, what the crisis exercise was about, was how we'd react to a problem in an individual institution and I suppose in that context it bore very little comparison to what eventually emerged as a ... which became a systemic crisis, so it wasn't that something cropped up all of a sudden that nobody saw.  But it did, kind of, show that, you know, the kind of areas that would certainly be called upon in the event that a crisis emerged like, "Have you got your collateral ready?", you know, these kind of matters.  Have we got the information?  Have we got the right people available?, etc., etc.  So, it kind of ... the procedural issues would have come to light after the crisis ... crisis exercise.</p></speech>

I think the main benefit is that it kind of identified through ... it's a kind of a process of trial and error, Chairman, that it identified areas that needed to be examined and followed up ... like ... and I've just given you a couple of examples that just come to mind.  Like, the deposit protection guarantee scheme would have been one of them, the availability of proper titled collateral, things like that.

So, that would have been done anyway and I think, maybe, the crisis exercise identified some of that work and it was done maybe a bit earlier than otherwise.  But there was no real comparison between the crisis that emerged and the ... the deterioration in the liquidity position that occurred in the system and the kind of an exercise what we carried out.</p></speech>

In the great scheme of things, it would have been good if the outputs from the financial stability committee and the financial stability report had identified, you know, issues that should be followed up and probabilities of things going to happen etc.  I mean, for example, like the IMF were, you know, inclined to give a view, I think, in their assessments where, whereas the financial stability report carefully set out what they saw as the risks but never really kind of said, "Well, look, this risk is very likely to happen if we don't do something about it."  </p>  <p>         So in that sense, I suppose the stress tests and the way they fed into the financial stability reports probably failed to deliver their full potential.</p></speech>

I mean ... I don't want to get into any kind of nit-picking either.

I mean, there may or may not have been issues that we wanted to pursue, but if there were issues and if, say, the issues related to lack of control and oversight over, say, the management of the portfolio and sanctions weren't taken and that ... and that bad behaviour continued, well, then, of course, I'd agree with what you're suggesting, that it might have had a bearing on it.</p></speech>

Perhaps somebody else will come back to this line so.  But this is another question that I wanted to ask.  We are having difficulty in our questioning over the period of time, getting to the bottom of the origin and source of the no bank should fail consensus that everybody seems to know, but nobody seems to remember who said it.  Do you have any recollection or knowledge that you are able to underpin for us to say, well, it was the ECB, it was Brian Cowen, it was ... who was it that came up with the consensus that no bank should fail that everybody seems to know about, but nobody is prepared to underpin?</p></speech>

I think.  I can home in on one particular discussion that was held at the authority and I think it was around 16 September.  And the authority ... there was a special meeting of the authority to consider, you know, just to take stock of the situation and there had been developments in relation to one of the ... one of the smaller entities.  </p>  <p>         And the authority had a general discussion about the options available if that particular institution were to experience liquidity difficulties because at that time that followed on that famous declaration by that ratings agency, which was subsequently corrected, that there was difficulties with the institution.  And the authority's consensus at that particular time was in favour of a nationalisation of that entity.  Certainly, as we move closer ... there was this ... sense seemed to develop ... that, you know, nationalisation, you know, was less of an option and that the guarantee was more of an option because almost every institution was heading into extremely difficult circumstances.  So, while at one stage it was thought "Well we only have one maybe that's going to have this liquidity problem and we can deal with that separately", as time moved on, the challenge was getting bigger.  So, at some stage between the 16 September and the night of the guarantee-----</p></speech>

That was around the 18th I think, or 19 September, if my memory serves me right, because, in the text announcing that, the Minister had made some statement that, you know, the Government would support the ... I don't have exactly the text ... but around that time, when the deposit guarantee was being strengthened, there was an indication that depositors' funds would be secure or whatever, I can't remember exactly the phrase.

The key indicators were capital, the level of non-performing loans and the need for provisions and the liquidity situation.  And there was nothing emerging under any of those key indicators, certainly in relation to asset quality or capital, that caused immediate concern.  The liquidity situation was the one that was troubling everybody.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn had said that he had contracts for differences that he had ... the ones that he had in financial stocks that he had gone long in and I took that to mean that whatever contracts he had, he had converted them into shares and, I mean, if they were ... if they were in any way a material holding in Anglo it would have cropped up in the share register.  And if it was more than 5%, there would have been notification to us.  So, otherwise, I mean, I didn't probe Mr. Quinn's personal investments, that's a matter for him and, you know, that may sound surprising but, you know, an individual's private financial affairs I believe are his own business.</p></speech>

That ... he was suggesting there was rumours about CFDs.  Nothing - no facts or anything - emerged to support that.  This meeting took place.  There was nothing emerging from that meeting that ... other than, I think, looking back on it, what ... may have said to me at the time "Well, at least there's no truth in the David Drumm thing", because Mr. Quinn said that he was long in financials.  So, that to me was his assertion that he did not have CFDs in Anglo.</p></speech>

I think on 21 March you indicated that you found out the full extent of the CFDs.  How did that come to your attention?</p></speech>

It was ... it was a Good Friday.  The ... Anglo came down to a meeting in the Central Bank which was attended by the Governor, Director General, Con Horan and myself, and we were informed by the Anglo representatives that they had established that Mr. Quinn had this holding.</p></speech>

Anglo had lent just under &euro;2 billion to Mr. Quinn to fund margin costs associated with the contracts for difference?  How did you react to that when the full picture emerged?</p></speech>

I can't recall the timelines, I'll have to ... I'd have to go back and review records that weren't included in any of these packs, so I ... I really can't, with confidence, recall them now.  But, obviously, I mean, we were faced with a major problem.  A problem that, you know, was going to clearly call into question the ... how the ... these shares that would have been held as a hedge against the CFDs might affect the share price if they were shorted or speculated against or lent to shorters or whatever, and that, in turn ... and the real concern was that any ... any effect on the share price could be misinterpreted by the market and, say, indicate a lack of confidence by investors and that people would start withdrawing their funds ... if it could transmit itself into a liquidity problem very quickly.  And that was our main concern, how that would transmit itself into a liquidity problem.  And ... because a week or so before we learned about the contracts for difference we had, I think, imposed a ban on short selling of financial stocks, because ... because of rumours and because of ... there was the famous Patrick's weekend where there was a kind of a ... you know, a serious shock to the share price of the banks, and we believed that there was a lot of speculation going on, but it was a week later we found out, probably, why that was.</p></speech>

This is a while ago and I haven't looked at this for a long time.  As far as I remember, the ... conversation was, came about this in a, in a circuitous way and ... we, we touched on contracts for differences.   I didn't ask him outright, "is it true that you have got contracts for differences in Anglo?".

Now, at that time I failed to link the two, and have no reason why I didn't ask him, it just is the way it transpired and the way in which the discussion went, which was a very brief courtesy call on Mr. Quinn, and ... unannounced, unexpected.

The loans, as we understood it at that time - to the best of my recollection now, Deputy - was that the loans were for working capital in the Quinn Group, right, that was the client, now what the Quinn Group, in turn ... you know, I can only presume, they were replacing funds that had been lent to Mr. Quinn by funds drawn down by the group from Anglo.</p></speech>

We know what the final decision of the guarantee was, which was that it was a blanket guarantee to cover six institutions, and we know, from your testimony and other testimony that we have actually had, that there was a series of discussions and that those discussions moulded itself into a decision that ultimately became the six banks to be guaranteed.</p></speech>

In the earlier meeting there was a general ... just let me work through it in my mind.  The earlier meeting there was a general discussion of options and we talked about the capital position.  The second meeting was it had crystallised down into a choice between the two, so no, Chairman, I don't remember anybody coming in from the word go and saying, "We're guaranteeing everybody."  </p>  <p>               Fair enough.  If I can ask you ... if I can just bring up Vol. 1, page 123 and just go into some matters there as regards to the tone of the situation back in 2007, and the financial stability report as it was discussed then.  And if I can just come down to the end of the page 123 ... there we go, yes ... and just a ... just quote the following paragraph to you there, Mr. Neary:</p><blockquote>Following the presentations, there was a detailed discussion on the content of the draft Financial Stability Report.  The meeting considered that in the continuing turbulence and uncertainty in the financial markets since early August, the tone and comment in the Financial Stability Report will be of particular importance and sensitivity.  </blockquote> <p>Can I ask you to comment upon this?  Could this potentially have been an opportunity missed in not setting out key issues more starkly?  And what, and who, drove this decision, and what contribution did you make to the discussion in the way that there was a very measured set out in the financial stability report?</p></speech>

And, you know, I think at that stage when the financial stability report was being prepared, I mean, there may have been a consciousness in the minds of the boards about the sensitive situation in the international financial markets.  And it's ... I think ... I can understand that there may have been a note of caution that the emphasis should be on the strengths rather than the weaknesses, and that they wouldn't maybe spook the horses.</p></speech>

So, you were talking about scaring the horses, is this kind of an overstatement to make ... a kind of show a strength, but there wasn't really a degree of strength behind the statement?</p></speech>

It's not to overstate ... it's not to overstate the strength, but maybe, you know, to ... not to come out and, I suppose, overstate weaknesses either.  It's to strike the right balance and present ... to present the thing in a way in which, you know ... while there was risks and that as perceived in the financial stability report.</p></speech>

That discussion was reflected in a very, very significant slowdown in house purchases, because people were going to wait until the next budget to get clarity on that.  There was a massive significant slowdown in the construction sector.  We know that the construction sector was twice the size as to what it should have been; it was in an excess of 20% of the Irish economy, twice above what would be a sustainable rate.  And there were a lot of systemic consequences taking place outside of the banking sector as well.  In fact, something that will be drawn upon later when this inquiry moves into a different stage, in that when the bailout and everything else arrived, it wasn't just a banking crisis that the country was facing, there was a massive structural deficit as well that had to ... that required in adjustment of in and around &euro;30 billion, which ... and all those other signs are actually happening in around there and then.</p>  <p>   Can you say this afternoon that what was actually being put out in that financial stability report was fair and accurate and true reflection of what the books were actually demonstrating at that time?</p></speech>

And, you know, I think reading that now and looking back on it, I think the message coming out from that statement to me is don't spook the horses.  There's clearly that message there.</p></speech>

It's on your screen there.  In your statement to the joint committee, Mr. Neary, you stated that you were aware ... that you were &quot;unaware of any incidences where supervisory issues uncovered by statutory auditors were escalated to the Authority.&quot;  In the context of that statement, can you comment upon the three pieces of evidence noted below and I'll go through them, okay?</p><p>These are correspondence of statutory auditors to the IFSRA in respect of issues uncovered in financial institutions during the course of the statutory auditor ... audit between 2003 and 2004.  In 2003:</p><blockquote>In respect of institution X, following items were noted:- &quot;no detailed procedures manuals&quot; were in place<br /><br />- &quot;no formalised controls in place covering the introduction of new products&quot;<br /><br />- Inadequacies and the monitoring of &quot;moratorium accounts&quot;<br /><br />- Insufficient attendance at credit committee meetings<br /><br />- Lack of documentation [and] supporting provisions<br /><br />- Lack of overall review of credit portfolio.Again in 2003:<br /><br />In respect of institution Y following items were noted:- Errors in annual facility review processes<br /><br />- Errors in recent capital adequacy return<br /><br />-High pace of growth in institution implies &quot;management of resources and controls of this expanding environment is essential.&quot; And then in 2004 and that year ending 2003:<br /><br />In respect of institution X following items were noted:- &quot;understatement of non-performing assets&quot;<br /><br />- Error in Large Exposure Return for March 2003<br /><br />- Error in Large Exposure Return for September 2003<br /><br />- Large exposures to 2 particular sectors noted in sectoral return for 2003 </blockquote>  <p>Can you comment on whether, in your opinion, the response of the Financial Regulator to these issues was sufficiently robust?</p></speech>

So, there was, you know, in that sense, there was a penalty imposed on the institution.  For the other institution, as far as I have been able to assess, what happened was that there was a firm sent in to review that ... those findings, following up from the audit and that they were corrected.</p></speech>

And in respect of the risks highlighted in the financial stability reports and views expressed by internal and external contrarian economists, did the authority give sufficient consideration to the adequacy of its prudential supervision procedures and if it didn't, why didn't it do so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.1967" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Neary" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052800002#GGG00500"><p>Well, the contrarian views that emerged or that, I think, you are referring to, you know, they were considered, I think, within the financial stability, if you like, cohort in the Central Bank and they take account of all views, pro and con, in relation to the assessments.  Their view ... their prevailing view was that the economy was robust, it was growing, that there was no matter of immediate concern, the soft landing option was the emerging assessment for them.  We were bound to take their assessment ... to take their assessment on board so that's------</p></speech>

As I said, we heard about the tone and tenure of the 2007 financial stability reports and I assume these were discussed at board level, as we know.  To your knowledge, who was ultimately responsible for the tenor and tone of the financial stability reports?  Who had that editorial control as to this is the how the tenor and tone of the report would be presented?</p></speech>

And I think the Governor would have the final call on the ... he'd bring the thing together and it would be his final call and I think he would talk ownership of it at that stage.</p></speech>

So the ... the narrative and presentation of this document was set by the Governor.  So the optical position as to the financial health and well being of the country would be one that, ultimately, would be decided by the Governor; that the state of the nation as so it was, Mr. Governor gets the final say in that.</p></speech>

You have answered some of this previously, Mr. Neary, but I suppose I just want to scope the ... the last portion of it.  With particular reference to the final solution of a blanket guarantee and the reaching of that, what other options were considered?  You had representatives from AIB who thought there was a four-bank guarantee in place; Bank of Ireland, who were at the same briefing, understood there was a six-bank guarantee in place.  Could you offer your understanding in relation to how we got to that position of a six-bank guarantee?</p></speech>

And at the first meeting, the ... the focus was on trying to establish the position in relation to each of the banks.  And there was some discussion as well there the Governor had advised about or arrangements that had been put in place to support Anglo overnight the previous night and ... and whatever.  And there was a ... there was a brief kind of overview of the options that were available.  And nationalisation being one and the guarantee being the other.  But there was no ... when we were at that meeting, certainly no discussion as to preferred options or combinations of options or that, other than to just, if you like to describe the options that were available.  So this is ... this is the menu of options we have and it was left at that.  And when we came back, and this was several hours later - and I believe in the meantime there had been that meeting with the banks, the first of two meetings, I believe that did happen - the options had narrowed down to full guarantee or five and one.</p></speech>

I read a portion of a section 33AK protected document, it won't come up.  I'll read that portion again into the record Chairman:</p><blockquote>Irish banks share prices have continued to fall and have lost between 30% and 50% of their value since start of ['07].  [This document is dated November 2007]  Notwithstanding the posting of good results by [a bank] ...its share price fell by 6% that day, at one point falling 8%, perilously close to the 9% figure at which trading in a share is temporarily suspended.  The decrease in value of Irish bank shares has been greater than in other countries.  There is a general discount in the value of Irish banks as there is a perception internationally that they are exposed to property market - reinforced in a 7 November report from Merrill Lynch setting out a negative perspective in the Irish banking sector because of property exposures.</blockquote>  <p>Now, that was ten months before your interview with Mark Little.  Were you aware of that, that's the document, that Mr. Horan attended for the domestic standing group, were you aware of that?</p></speech>

I can't say that I would have had sight of a particular document prepared by Merrill Lynch and that was in Mr. Horan's possession.  But I mean ... I ... we had to rely on the facts, on the facts as we knew them.  And the facts as we knew them were that the solvency position was strong, the levels of non-performing were very low, there was essentially capital surplus to regulatory requirements in the system.  Those were the facts as I understood them.  I mean these kind of commentaries were certainly out there but they seemed to contradict the facts.  But this is all about confidence I suppose and do you know, it's about a view, and it was issued by brokers and that.  You know, I don't want to suggest for a moment that there is an ulterior motive but I think you've got to be nevertheless careful in reacting to these assessments because you don't know the motivation behind them.</p></speech>

Did you notice, around the 2002, 2003 period, when banks like Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland began to borrow very heavily on the bond markets, as opposed to relying on their deposits, which was the traditional thing in Irish banks up to then, did you notice this?  Did you attach any significance to this as being a massive change in the policy of the banks and particularly when it was being lent on for speculative purposes, construction purposes and property-related spending?</p></speech>

It may have been acted upon in banking supervision but I think what we're talk ... what we're talking about here was, was I made aware of it, and the answer is, "No."  But that doesn't mean that it wasn't acted upon or some, some, some follow-up action happened.</p></speech>

I understand this anecdotally from chatting to the Governor that the Governor of the Bank of England had mentioned to him that they were trying to organise some sort of a pool, a liquidity pool amongst the banks in London, to be ... to have a pool of liquidity available in case any of the smaller institutions required liquidity and that they could have a market solution to the liquidity problems.  And the Governor thought this was worth pursuing here.</p></speech>

Governor Hurley.  And we had this ... we did have a series of meetings essentially with the larger banks to see would they be prepared.  And, in principle, yes, they felt there was merit in it but at the end of the day they were saying, "Well, look, if we're going to commit to this we need them to have some form of backing from the Central Bank."  So it kind of ... it, it never really progressed.</p></speech>

I think what Governor Hurley was trying to do was to have, if you will, he wanted to avoid, I suppose, a commitment of public funds to any temporary liquidity situation.  If it could be solved by players in the market by having a pool which could support an institution with a temporary drop in liquidity, so be it.  It was a concept but it never really, because difficulties emerged and issues and we never pursued it any further.</p></speech>

And there were liquidity strains emerging and I suppose what the governor was trying to do was, well if we could have a fund that could be utilised to support a bank with a temporary liquidity problem, and you know, presumably they would be able post security and all the rest of it but we didn't get that far.

And I mean the payment of a dividend is an immediate hit on, on their cash, cash reserves.  And in fact I think that question may have been prompted by the fact that one of the, one of the large banks in the midst of the crisis did actually pay a dividend and I think some eyebrows were raised that the dividend was paid at the particular time it was.  Even though the dividend was declared and agreed some months earlier and I think the the assessment of the board in that particular institution was, you know, that it was important for them to-----</p></speech>

I mean, I think it's amazing that the Central Bank, without trying to pass a judgment, would be thinking that the Financial Regulator might seek to have this included in legislation that was being drafted at that time, by the domestic standing group for which you were responsible.  It ended up in a &euro;1.2 billion payout to shareholders, which the taxpayers then had to fund.</p></speech>

I can be corrected on that.  I would have contended that we would have had the powers to direct the bank not to pay a dividend before it was declared, and before it became a liability, so before they ever went near the AGM, and proposed the dividend, we could have, we could say to a bank, and we could put a direction on their licence, "You are not to pay dividends".</p></speech>

And this question wasn't addressed.  These banks declared their dividends, and paid their dividends.  With hindsight, I suppose, if we had any view that the liquidity situation was going to emerge as tight, as badly as it is, that is something we may have considered, but we didn't consider it.</p></speech>

And, at this point, the conclusion that John Hurley came to was to put a liquidity facility in place as soon as possible and then look at how to deal with the broader issues over the next week or so.  This was particularly in relation to Anglo.  Now, that never seems to have happened, I don't think, that a liquidity facility was put in place, and the broader ... or was it?</p></speech>

I think he was trying to explore with the banks where ... now that they had ... were in receipt of a Government guarantee, to what extent that could be built upon through - maybe consolidation of the banks and mergers, and whatever - and he was exploring those various options.

But I mean, I suppose the ranking of the players would have changed.  Certainly, the Department of Finance was the main driving force at that stage.  They were in charge, if you will, of the solution of the problem.  The Central Bank, being the people with the cheque book, were certainly up the rankings, and we would have ranked next, I think, in the pecking order in so far as, I suppose, our job was provide the information, the facts, the solvency, the liquidity information, and we were delivering that.  But, you know, it got to a stage where the Department of Finance was managing the situation, were driving the situation, and the Central Bank were trying to put the liquidity arrangements in place to see ... to determine liquidity solutions and that.</p></speech>

Like, what we have is a situation I ... when ... before you came to office, where somebody went down to get a mortgage, they had to put their income on the table, that was very heavily scrutinised, they were granted a mortgage on a ratio of maybe three times that, they had to come up with a 10% deposit on the property, they were expected to clear their mortgage within 20 years, and there was no such thing as 100% mortgage, and all the rest of it, and the house price was kind of somewhat within two to three times their income, and they would have it cleared in 20 years.</p></speech>

I mean, I think there were probably other influences in the market as well.  You know, there's two elements to what you are saying there, Chairman.  First of all, there's the credential element, and then there's the consumer choice element.  And I know an erstwhile colleague, the consumer director will be in talking to you in a couple of weeks and I think she'll be able to elaborate very well on the consumer dimension.  In relation to the prudential dimension, the requirement was imposed that for new mortgages, they should be stress tested at 2.75% above the ECB rate for affordability purposes.  So that was the prudential measure that was put in and also the increased risk rating was put in to increase the capital buffer. But the consumer dimension ... I mean, the former consumer director when she comes in, I think, will be far better, more eloquent at explaining the attitude of the authority to that.</p></speech>

It says - this is the point here:  "In the extreme stress case analysis the total writeoffs including loss of interest income would just deplete most of INBS reserves of &euro;1.8 billion."</p></speech>

In relation to Anglo Irish Bank, they say: "If one was to apply INBS stress case scenario [to] the writeoffs ... would [by] deplete ordinary shareholders in the lower category subordinated debt of &euro;7.5 billion".  Now, Anglo Irish Bank had about &euro;9.6 billion, &euro;9.7 billion of capital available at the time, so it would have depleted about what? ... about 80% of its capital and left it very close to insolvent.  Was that your assessment?</p></speech>

That seems to tie in with what he's saying.  No, that was not our assessment.  I don't know what the extreme stress case analysis that they referred to was, and whether they stood over it or whether they backed it up at that meeting.  It would appear to me that they must have backed off because otherwise the Secretary General would have taken a much tougher line, I think, in relation to what transpired.  In relation to the first of those institutions you mentioned, there was also another group of consultants that carried out an assessment because the ... that particular institution, part of its strategy in previous years was this was up for sale, and there was a number of people interested in buying it-----</p></speech>

Just a couple of quick ones at the end in relation to the fall in commercial property prices that took place from about September 2007 until September 2008 of 20% in value.

On that occasion, my introductory remarks focused on three main areas, namely, the macro-prudential measures on which the Central Bank of Ireland had just published a consultation paper; the transfer of ultimate responsibility for the micro-prudential supervision of the main banks to the single supervisory mechanism of the European Central Bank, which had just taken effect; and the level of mortgage interest rates, which was already attracting increasing attention from the Central Bank given its consumer protection mission.</p> <p>  In the intervening period, as members will be aware, the Central Bank concluded its macro-prudential consultation and introduced the calibrated loan-to-value and loan-to-income restrictions for mortgage lending.  We will continue to monitor the impact and effectiveness of these and we are not dissatisfied with subsequent developments in that market. </p> <p>  The European Central Bank's new micro-prudential regime for banks is settling in well.  The transition has been smooth, as has been exemplified by the results of the ECB's comprehensive assessment of the banks at entry, which confirmed the merits of the asset quality review previously conducted by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The modest additional capital requirement for Permanent TSB, which was triggered by the higher capital standard set in the European Central Bank's comprehensive assessment, has since been raised in the private market. </p> <p>  The concerns I expressed around the standard variable mortgage rate in November last foreshadowed a wider public focus on this issue, reflecting the widening spread between Irish mortgage rates and those in many other parts of the euro area.  The Central Bank has conducted a good deal of research on the topic, some of which it had previously published, and a summary of it was included in the document which was prepared at the request of the Minister for Finance and published last week. </p> <p>  Since the crisis, banks' standard variable rates have moved higher than previously, relative to their cost of funds and, arguably, higher than a fair-minded customer might have reasonably expected.  While this development was manifest in a number of eurozone countries, the divergence has become particularly large in Ireland.  Is this compliant with the contract that the customers signed?  Is it consistent with good business practice on the part of the banks for the long-term relationship?  Is it good for the overall recovery of the economy on which the banks depend for their long-term success? </p> <p>  Admittedly, it is essential for the survival of banks that they achieve a sufficient return on the investment of funds, including equity, much of which, in our case, is owned by the Government.  If not, they will not be able to achieve and maintain the growing requirement for capital adequacy in the years ahead.  The profitability goal has to take account of long-term considerations, including the risks involved in lending, especially the actual and prospective losses on non-performing mortgage loans.  Nonetheless, I would welcome a reduction in bank standard variable rates in current circumstances as a benefit to the economy at large.  If it were not for the firm conviction that the introduction of administrative control on interest rates would be bad for the country as a whole in the medium term, there could be a case for some Government intervention.  Why would intervention be bad for the country as a whole in the medium term?  The two notable reasons are that it would have a stultifying effect on bank efficiency and a chilling effect on the entry of other banks. </p> <p>  Let me say something about the standard variable rate type of contract, which was the mainstay of Irish mortgage lending for decades.  This type of contract had the advantage of being adjustable in response to changing conditions and, as such, insulated the lender from sharp rises in the cost of funding.  For example, it avoided the devastating squeeze on profitability that occurred in the United States, resulting in the insolvency of a large part of that country's savings and loans industry in the 1980s.  However, the wording of most standard variable rate contracts means that borrowers are vulnerable not only to changing funding costs, as they will recognise when they take out the mortgage, but to many other types of influence which the lender judges to warrant a change in rates.</p> <p>  The standard variable rate was increasingly replaced for new lending by the tracker mortgage, especially in the boom.  This much more tightly defined interest rate contract protected the borrower against any interest rate changes other than those occurring to the European Central Bank policy rate.  This is a rate at which the ECB lends a small amount of the funds required by euro area banks and which is adjusted to help ensure the ECB meets its monetary policy objectives, principally with regard to inflation in the euro area.  Whereas in the pre-crisis period the Irish banks were easily able to secure deposit and bond funding at close to the ECB policy rate, their ability to do so since the crisis has been constrained, to say the least, although it has been improving recently.</p><p> Arising from this constraint and inability to fund at close to the ECB policy rate and because the spreads they set above the ECB rate were too low to cover the loan losses that were to come, the tracker contract has been extremely costly for the State and the other shareholders of the banks.  For this reason, the banks stopped offering tracker mortgages.  Looking to the future, a different or new contractual arrangement that linked the floating rate on new mortgages to actual funding costs of the banks could be designed in such a way as to achieve the original aims of the tracker without retaining the vulnerability of the ECB policy-rate linked tracker.  Of course, the spread would have to cover the costs and risks of lending, which includes prospective losses, but such contracts are not currently offered.</p><p> Given the wording of the standard variable rate, SVR, contract, I assume that borrowers agreed to those terms largely because they trusted the banks to behave in a fair manner with regard to interest rate adjustments.  For decades, it seems that this trust was, by and large, not misplaced.  Is this still the case?  There is clearly justification for some of the increase that has occurred in the spread, which was too low in the past.  Relevant factors include the persistent drag on their viability from the combination of a large tracker book and the fact that funding costs are much higher than the ECB policy rate; the dramatic increase in non-performing mortgage loans and the need there has been to make large provisions against loan losses; and the sharply increased capital requirements on banks.  All of these have threatened the viability of mortgage lending for the banks.  In a general way, defenders of the banks can point to these factors as providing some justification for higher spreads on standard variable rates.  Still, such arguments are rather open-ended and, in the absence of a transparent, clear and quantified policy on the part of the banks, can be seen as excuses for charging whatever the market will bear rather than being a fair application of the contract consistent with a borrower&rsquo;s reasonable expectation.  Under these circumstances, the standard variable rate borrower&rsquo;s main protection is competition: the fact that, by setting its standard variable rate too high, any bank stands to lose business, whether new business or switchers, to competitors.  Whereas this protection was effective before the crisis, the level of competition currently is too low.  Ensuring that official policy does not inadvertently deter competition and entry of banks to the market is thus vital for the long-term health not only of banks, but of the economy.</p><p> The Central Bank wrote to each of the banks in February to ask for a clear statement of each bank&rsquo;s pricing behaviour around standard variable rates. In their responses, none of the banks has so far provided what I would regard as a clear and quantified statement of their policy with respect to adjustments of the standard variable  interest rate.  In my opinion, good business practice of the banks would demand that they make upward adjustments to standard variable rates only following clear and objective changes in prevailing business conditions and not only funding costs.  Good practice would also call on them to lower standard variable rates when the same conditions move in the opposite direction.  That is the implicit element of the contract.  To regain the trust of their customers, the banks should move to publishing a clear and quantified statement of their standard variable interest rate policy.  Since they do not seem to have such a policy, they will need to develop one.  If necessary, drawing on its legislative powers for consumer protection, the Central Bank will codify such a requirement formally but this should not be necessary.  I have spent some time on that contractual issue as it is a dimension that has not been sufficiently discussed.</p><p> Insisting on transparency may seem to be an insufficient official response to the manner in which the spread of standard variable rates has drifted up but I would insist on my words of caution against the enacting of legislation that would provide for officially administered lending rates.  Nothing could be more likely to curtail and discourage entry of new competitors into Irish banking, and without the possibility of such entry, I cannot see that banking can recover the operational efficiency and competitive pricing that is essential for Ireland in the long run.  For the sake of modestly lower SVRs for a few quarters, a much larger and quasi-permanent, albeit somewhat invisible loss, would be incurred by the customers of the banking system in Ireland.  Well-capitalised banks operating more competitively will, in the end, offer lower rates and better service.  Besides this, close administrative control of interest rates would not be easily compatible with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, which has underpinned the considerable increase in national prosperity over the past half century in Ireland, and which, of course, is enshrined in the European Union treaty.  This is not a matter to be taken lightly or opportunistically for what would clearly be at best a transitory advantage.</p><p> The health and ability of the banks to contribute to the needed services to the economy certainly requires them to operate on a profitable basis, and only then can they build and hold sufficient capital to be compliant with international regulations, to be fully financially autonomous and not dependent on an implicit backstop of the State, to have the resilience to deal with future shocks and to serve customers properly.  Their recent return to profitability is modest and significantly dependent on provision write-backs rather than normal business profitability.  I do not want to overstate that, and that should be seen and compared with the provisions that were there before.</p><p> The crisis continues to have serious legacy issues that cannot be resolved easily or painlessly.  To mention just one example, ensuring that borrowers whose loans have been sold to unregulated firms continue to obtain the consumer protections that they previously had is a concern which the Central Bank has been to the fore in advocating action.  I am very glad to see this being reflected in legislation on which the bank has actively advised currently being enacted by the Oireachtas.  Without detracting from the importance of what I have mostly been addressing today, the appropriate pricing on the SVR loans, I should not conclude without emphasising that delays and uncertainties surrounding the resolution of non-performing loans remain a much more acute problem.  The latter problem is one which we have discussed in this committee repeatedly and on which progress remains damagingly slow.</p></speech>

I will not get all of them done in ten minutes so I may have to come back a second time, depending on how many people wish to contribute.  Professor Honohan is saying we need competition as the main protection for the economy.  The idea is it is the best way to bring down rates and ensure we have a proper and satisfactory banking system to service the economy.  He is essentially saying that the banks we have in Ireland will not be adequate for a growing domestic economy.  Several times, he spoke about the need to get new competition and new banks into the system.  Implicit in that kind of remark, which he made on several occasions, must be his belief that the current banks will not be adequate.  Will Professor Honohan comment on that?</p> <p>  Part of what led to the financial crisis in Ireland was the very type of competition that Professor Honohan is now espousing.  Bank of Scotland came here to open as the Ryanair of banking, and other banks followed; the herd chased those banks.  If that is what Professor Honohan is espousing here as a solution - foreign banks coming in to bring more competition in the market - has he learned nothing?  I am surprised at the tone of some of his comments.  We have learned but I do not think others have learned.  I am concerned about that.</p> <p>  Professor Honohan spoke about several issues but I will try to keep on the same topic at the beginning.  He mentioned how profitability in the banks is modest and profitability in future will depend on the provision of write-backs.  Representatives of the banks mentioned this when they were here in the past few weeks.  They have all stated how bad were the loan books.</p><p>In fact, much of the profit the banks reported in the past year has comprised a write-back of money previously provided.</p><p> What Professor Honohan is actually saying is extraordinary.  He is saying a key component of the profitability of banks in the future will be an acknowledgement that they overstated how bad circumstances were in the past and over-provided.  By definition, by over-providing they had a bigger hole in their balance sheets which the taxpayer had to fill.  If Professor Honohan is now saying that the banks sold the taxpayer a pup in some regard and circumstances were not as bad as the banks informed him and this committee, why did he not challenge the banks on what he is now saying involves write-backs of over-provisions?  Professor Honohan presided over the over-provision.  I know he will say that this was a prudent approach at the time, but he is now acknowledging the write-backs that he probably insisted upon in general across the banking sector were too severe.  He is now saying a key element of profitability in the future will be writing back his over-provision.  I am just concerned about this area and the point to which Professor Honohan referred.</p><p> I have a question for the Governor on the new legislation he mentioned.  We dealt with it on Committee Stage last night.  Does the Governor agree that, when mortgages are sold off, the new owner should be regulated by the Central Bank?  There will be an intermediary or the service debt agreement, or whatever, and the intermediary will serve as the local agent interfacing with the customer and taking him to court, but the owner of the mortgage is the one with which I am concerned.  As the Governor knows, the legislation does not require the owner to be regulated by the Central Bank.  Does he believe it is satisfactory at this stage that the banks can still sell off bundles of mortgages, or thousands of mortgages, to institutions that do not have to be regulated, while the Central Bank just regulates the gormless, harmless agent that the institutions operate through in Ireland?  What are Professor Honohan's views on that?</p><p> Professor Honohan is very strongly against legislation to deal with rates because he believes the god of competition who caused the problem the last time will solve it for him.  He is saying the real answer to reducing rates in the longer term is to have more competition in Ireland.  We acknowledge competition brings an inherent risk, but Professor Honohan has not addressed this inherent risk in anything he has said.  He outlined in his statement that administrative controls of interest rates would not be readily compatible with the principle of having an open-market economy with free competition.  We do not have an open-market economy in the banks; we nationalised them all.  How could Professor Honohan even talk about our having open-market free competition in the banking sector?  He said somewhere else in his script that we own most of the banks.  We still own AIB and Permanent TSB and have a share in Bank of Ireland.  The list goes on.  Professor Honohan would throw out competition in every other sentence as a panacea, but he is not acknowledging it is not relevant in the market we are in.  The two main banks are controlling the market we are in.  Perhaps because of the level of control, there is a stronger case.  I agree that when we have five or six banks acting responsibility in the Irish mortgage market, there might be a case for some of what Professor Honohan says.</p><p> The last point on which I want the Governor to comment, and on which he might have commented the last day, is the issue of quantitative easing.  What led to the crisis here was over-lending and over-borrowing.  That is the essence of what quantitative easing is.  It concerns the banks that were making and lost all the money, and who want to get back to the old way of lending money right, left and centre.  How much money will quantitative easing provide in terms of additional borrowing on the backs of businesses and households?  Given that our economy is picking up and growing well, as everybody tells us and as every official report states, do we need a massive influx of extra lending in the system, with businesses and households taking on a massive amount of extra debt?</p></speech>

I like the way they are framing the situation.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that the system is very far from what one would imagine to be an open, competitive banking system.  We have a system that is not entirely Government-controlled because there are a number of other players.  The Government has only a small stake in Bank of Ireland but it would still be there in the background if all the provisions did not prove to be adequate.  I do not believe that is where we want to be because it is not healthy.  Even in electricity production, there are certain entities that are natural monopolies.  They just get so big because of the technology that there cannot be more than one of them.</p></speech>

In such circumstances, technology is such that there are only one or two players, and therefore there has to be regulation on pricing.  That is understood.  If we were satisfied with the current circumstances and said it would be satisfactory to have two banks, two and a half banks or three banks here, all largely State-controlled, into the indefinite future, we could start to design a system around that.  I do not believe that will work well, and I do not know of other countries where it has worked well.  I want us to return to circumstances where there are five or six players - the Deputy will probably not like the word "players" because of what it suggests - that are competing but not over-competing.</p> <p>  We all know finance is not like selling groceries; it actually involves making commitments for a period of time and taking decisions whose consequences will evolve only over time.  That is why there can be too much competition as well as too little.  I fully acknowledge that, and that it is part of the story.  At least some of the bankers of the past say, "Oh, well, somebody was eating my breakfast so I had to do something else like that".  It is only part of the story, and to some extent that is why one needs to have boards of directors and scrutiny of rating agencies, auditors and regulators.  We need to have a lot more competition than there is now, but that competition will be tempered by checking the prudence of what is being done.  By reducing the thinking to the slogan that competition is bad, one must ask what is good.  Monopoly is obviously not, so it is a question of having much more competition than we have now and of having that competition tempered by prudence.</p> <p>  We have a number of banks here, not just two.  Permanent TSB is not really a full-service bank.  We have foreign-owned banks here but some of them are more competitive than others.  There is not as much competition; nobody is going to deny that.  I am not saying it is particular banks that are insufficient but that we need to be open to entry.  When we are open to entry, perhaps a new bank will not come in.  Perhaps it will shape up a local bank against the threat of entry.  Owing to the European and international weaknesses in the banking system, there has not been much consolidation of banking worldwide.  Not many European or international banks are wondering where they will open next and considering Ireland in this regard.  This has not been happening.  One reason, which is pretty important for this committee to bear in mind and which members would hear on talking to any of the bankers here or abroad, concerns the mortgage arrears rate and very high number of non-performing loans.  The bankers will say they are not sure they want to get involved in a banking market in which it seems very difficult to recover on a "delinquent loan", as they would call it.  This is one significant reason we are not getting as much competition as we would have got had we had managed to sort out the arrears.  We need to keep paying attention to this.  There are all sorts of reasons to have the mortgage arrears problem fixed.</p></speech>

He mentioned a timeframe of a few quarters.  Does this mean that the Governor of the Central Bank envisages that after a few quarters, interest rates will go in a certain direction?</p></speech>

It is typical vagueness.  I do not want to be pinned down on a timeframe.  At the beginning of May, AIB lowered the rate relative to when all this conversation was ongoing.  There is some competitive pressure, and in the coming quarters we could see that kind of behaviour.  One of the great inhibitors for the banks in lowering the standard variable rate is the fact that they look around and see inertia on the part of the borrowers who could switch.  The Central Bank did a calculation and will probably publish something on it later on.  We looked to see who could benefit from switching, given that there are spreads of rates.  There is lots of information.  Are there people who could benefit from moving to a lower-cost provider, bearing in mind that switching involves some costs, such as legal costs?  Our people found that as many as 15,000 people could benefit a lot from the current rate.  I am not saying that the current rates are even the lowest wherever they are for different circumstances and different loan-to-value situations.  They are not particularly low, but even with the spreads that are there, there might be 15,000 people who, if they had the time to do the sums, could save a four-figure sum in a year.</p> <p>  I am not blaming anybody.  We all know that we suffer from inertia and are not sure what is going to happen.  It is the same with gas and electricity.  If people were more savvy, banks would be more on their toes and we might see the rates go down, so I would encourage that.  I am not in the blame game.  I am encouraging more competition - competition from borrowers as well as competition between lenders.  The lenders do not want to lower the rate if they do not see that they will get much new business from it.  At the same time, they must bring down the rate on all of their back book because it is the standard variable rate.  They have this huge back book, and they say: "Will we lower their rates?  We will get more borrowers.  Yes, that will be good."  From a profitability perspective, the calculation is not as favourable as it would be in other circumstances.</p></speech>

The Central Bank provided background information but we were not involved in the discussions.  Some of the banks are offering a fixed rate for a few years.  I do not think any of them offer a fixed rate for a 30-year mortgage, so it must be borne in mind that those rates would revert to whatever the standard variable rate is, probably at the end of the contract.  One must look at each individual case.  Sometimes, this would be an advantageous move for a borrower.  For the banks to offer a contract like that, which is not a standard variable rate contract, one can see that they are not burdened by the back book in that case.  They can decide that perhaps they could offer a reasonably good deal on a fixed-rate mortgage because they are not damaging their back book.  That is why I am quite concerned about the transparency of the pricing on the SVRs.  There might be some good deals out there for moving to a new type of contract, but I want to make sure and we will make sure that this is not done in such a way as to disadvantage SVR borrowers who, say, have very high loan-to-value ratios and are not in a position to switch their contract.  We will see what they offer.  I do not know what they are going to offer.  I am not privy to their business plans in this area in detail.</p></speech>

Now I see a tiny element of skill or see turning a hole in the ground into a building.   We have gone through all the planning and procurement step by step.  I am sure the people do so as well.  We had some delays early on in getting those issues right.  We have had no hiccups, hitches or decision-making delays.  I am as amazed as the Deputy that it takes so long.  The main contract is signed and the builders are there with their boots and shovels.  If they need cranes, which I suppose they do, they will be there.  It is still expected that we will be moving in before the end of 2016, so that is still the schedule.  I cannot say anything more than that.</p> <p>  I must admit that it does amaze me.  It is probably for another committee to scrutinise.  People talk about the new regulations and the way each step of the building process must be checked and signed off on by some inspector before we move to another stage.  I am never sure to what extent this is just special pleading by particular professionals or whether there is substance in this kind of the explanation for the delay, because it is not my area.</p></speech>

He has arguably swapped places with Deputy Rabbitte.  I wish to follow up on the question because, frankly, I am perplexed at Professor Honohan's belief in and commitment to competition as the way to sort out some of the issues that confront us.  He has not really made the case for it.  For example, he rails against administrative control of interest rates, that is, the State setting interest rates - even though he seems to suggest that they should be reduced and that there is an element of profiteering going on.  However, he says we should not really have administrative control because that would impact on competition and the reason we must not impact on competition is just that we need competition, but without any real argument to sustain that.  It was precisely the dynamic of competition that led to the bubble, uncontrolled lending and the crash that followed, so I really am quite perplexed.</p> <p>  It is not just in the area of interest rates that the argument does not stack up.  Professor Honohan finished his contribution by saying that the banks have been damagingly slow in resolving the mortgage arrears crisis.  That is a good case for administrative control, as are variable interest rates and what is happening in the whole property area.  I would also like to hear Professor Honohan's comments on that.  It is extremely worrying that property prices are going out of control, as that was such a big contributory factor to the crash.  We had property prices going out of control, and people with low incomes were borrowing money they really could not afford, while chasing property whose prices were going through the roof.  That also led to the crash.  I do not see, therefore, how Professor Honohan can support his argument that, faced with these serious challenges and problems and the experience that we have just been through, the answer we have to get back to is competition.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett might have a different perspective about ways of organising the economy in general, so we can obviously agree to differ on that.  I am subject to the treaty, so I am thinking in terms of an economy in which one has multiple service providers that operate in a competitive manner and price control is limited to cases in which there are clear reasons for market failure.  There are clear reasons for market failure in banking.  We do control a lot of stuff in banking.  For example, on the Deputy's particular point about property prices, the way things were going and bubbles, our interventions on loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios - unpopular though they were, in some quarters anyway - are a good example of working in an environment in which the banks did not like what we were doing.  All of the banks wrote in to say they did not like it, that they hated it and that it was unnecessary, etc., etc.  However, they sort of knew that this was par for the course and that they could and would be constrained in what they could lend, having shown that they had in the past loaned too much to people who could not afford to service their debts.</p> <p>  The control of retail interest rates in the banking system is a kind of Rubicon, though.  There were times, perhaps in the 1960s, when that was very prevalent.  To come out as a country in the middle of this and say, "We're going to be the country that controls interest rates", has a signalling value far in excess of what one might think in terms of causing a retreat of service providers.  That is my perception of it.</p></speech>

If we decided as a nation that we wanted to work with just two or three banks that would be specialised and would jump on the instruction of some Government Departments, that is an entirely different way.  Such systems have shown themselves to be very dysfunctional around the world, so I am certainly not going to encourage somebody to go in that direction.</p> <p>  The worst of all would be a halfway house in which we pretend that we are in one system and not in the other.  One might say: "It cannot do much harm.  You get reasonable people in the Central Bank.  They can set a reasonable rate and that will be all right."  First of all, however, that is not the way it will be perceived.  Second, in committees such as this or in the political system in general, where will the advocacy for higher interests rates come from?  It will not be there, so once one starts down this road it will be very difficult to convince anybody that they will ever be allowed to make a reasonable return on their investment. </p></speech>

To be honest, however, everything he is saying points in the direction of greater administrative control and planning in the economy as a whole, rather than letting the market rip.  It all points in that direction.  I am not really quite sure how Professor Honohan can act or intervene.  In some ways, he is saying that we are pretty powerless here.</p></speech>

We require them to hold more capital, we have the macro-prudential loan-to-value ratios, and all sorts of restrictions on the way they behave to consumers, which they regard as very burdensome.  I want to get away from the idea that the Central Bank is trying to protect the banks rather than the consumer.  It is the other way around.  We want to protect consumers in the long run against a mistaken attempt to help them by damaging a mechanism which is not working well but could work better.</p></speech>

All the provisioning in the world will not help.  Similarly, we have a major problem with access to affordable housing.</p> <p>  I have a question about the mandates of central banks, given that Professor Honohan is coming to the end of his term.  Does he not think that we should be looking, at a European level, at banks having a mandate?  The European Central Bank does not have a mandate that extends to such things as access to affordable housing, as against, for example, the US Federal Reserve.  What does Professor Honohan think of that?  The issue of property was at the centre of the previous crisis and it is coming into view again.</p> <p>  As time is running out, I have a final question about the issue of non-tax revenue coming in to the Government, which was in the statement that Professor Honohan put out in the last few days.</p></speech>

Can Professor Honohan quantify how much that is?  It would be useful for people to know how much has been coming to the Government in that form.  What will happen now?  Will we see a big drop in that revenue as the banks move back into private ownership and we come to the end of the bailout?</p></speech>

I will start with the money one which the Deputy raised at the end.  The Central Bank made a profit of &euro;2.1 billion last year and it transferred 80% of that to the Government.  It holds the rest in reserves.  That &euro;1.7 billion goes across to the Government.  Some of it is treated as a capital gain, which is a new statistical approach from the Government, so it goes towards reducing the Government's debt, not its deficit.  It is of real benefit to the Irish people.  That is coming from the income on the portfolio of assets that the Central Bank is allowed to hold because it is part of the euro system and matches the currency issue.</p> <p>  Correspondingly, the Central Bank has investments, mainly in Irish Government securities and foreign government securities internationally.  It makes interest on that and because the Central Bank is charged internally at the ECB's policy rate, the profit component of that is now very large.</p><p>That is part of our profit.  Another very large part of it, however, comes from the fallout of the IBRC or Anglo Irish Bank liquidation.  The Central Bank ended up holding Government promissory notes which in a complicated transaction were transformed into Government bonds with very long maturity.  This ensured a stream of very large profits for a number of years at the Central Bank which can be accelerated and advanced, especially as interest rates are lower and the conditions for selling the bonds into the market are more favourable.  This actually increases and accelerates the profits.  Last year's profits were at record levels and this will continue to be the case for some time I expect.  This is a significant claw-back indirectly through very complicated accounting arrangements of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Subject to achieving that mandate, the ECB - I will not get the wording right - is mandated to support the economic policies of the European Union.  This can cover a great deal of the ground mentioned by the Deputy.  Of course, the Americans have an explicit dual mandate on unemployment and price stability.  However, it is not price stability and access to cheap housing; it is unemployment and inflation, whereas price stability has priority in Europe in supporting the economic policies of the Union.  As such, supporting its economic policies is part of the ECB's mandate.</p> <p>  One must think carefully about the issue.  These days central banks are extremely powerful because of the crisis.  They needed to move away from normal operations and have taken control.  We already had banking supervision to some extent, but now it is at European level.  One needs to be careful about giving too much power to an entity that must balance issues which should be balanced politically, not by appointed persons.  I often laugh to myself when I hear people say the Central Bank is not doing this or that.  I am thinking, "We are already really doing a lot of things".  While these things are very much supported by the political system, for example, trying to have the issue of mortgage arrears fixed, whatever one says about how we have done it, we are doing a number of things that would be considered to be very much on the outskirts and the extreme edge of our mandate.</p></speech>

We recently extracted from some of the banks the fact that their working capital provisions were down to approximately 10% of what they had been at the height of the boom.  One could derive from that statistic that there is not a great deal of construction going on or site finance.  If one was to be cynical about it, is there an attempt to control the market for property - supply and demand - and, ultimately, repair their balance sheets?  Is there anything the Central Bank can do to ensure a typical bank licensed by the State through the Central Bank will make provision for the marketplace to ensure supply comes on stream?</p></speech>

It did.  While I do not dispute the fact that one might imagine a squeeze to drive up property prices temporarily and that the banks might state that while people want property, they will not let builders gain access to credit, this is unlikely to have a long-term effect of the type to which the Deputy referred.  I am not sure, therefore, that I buy the story.  There may not be that much competition, but there is no collusion either in their reluctance to provide finance for builders.</p></speech>

It is not being done by the Central Bank but public agencies are involved.  That is definitely the way to go.  While builders will not enjoy surrendering the equity and they will not like its cost, that is the safe way.  Bank finance should not be providing the equity component.</p></speech>

It is, however, still a constraint and goes back to the net question as to why the banks are at a figure of 10% and whether there is a role for the Central Bank to play.  I remember the Central Bank reports we had to produce on the percentage of business in agriculture, the percentage in industry, etc., when I was working in the banking sector.  The Central Bank has all of that data.  The amount of new money available for site finance and building houses has been compressed enormously.</p></speech>

That is the reality.  It will be one of the long-lasting legacies.  Anybody coming into the Irish market will consider going into the Netherlands or somewhere else to recover on the loan if it is not performing easily and quickly and the loan losses will be small.  In going into Ireland, they will need to make an allowance for future loan losses.  That is one element.</p> <p>  I will mention another element.  When we make cross-country comparisons, as we have done in our paper, they are never perfect.  In some countries in Europe most loans have a compulsory insurance element at a cost of perhaps 1 percentage point on top of the interest rate.  We do not see this in the chart.  Therefore, the comparisons are a little misleading.  However, when one sees the movement that has happened recently, one sees that it is not sustainable.

Then the negotiation will really happen and a deal will be done.  However, the legal process is so drawn out that that dialogue is still not happening in many cases.

It is my considered opinion that in the time he has been on the governing council - I do not make a causal link - the power of the ECB has increased significantly in real terms.  In terms of the role it has played in the crisis, this unelected institution has dictated policies to a range of countries, including Ireland.  Coming to the current situation where it is at its sharpest, does the Governor agree that in reality the ECB has played a political role in its decisions on the situation in Greece, in particular the withdrawal of the waiver that allowed Greek Government bonds to be used as collateral against ECB loans?  Was that a political decision driven by the fact that Greece had elected a government led by Syriza that was committed to breaking with the policies of austerity?</p></speech>

While there are different perceptions in different places, irrespective of the perception, the views of all those whose views I understand, given what has happened in the past few years is to try to ensure our decisions are removed from the political process.  The Deputy might say, "That is ridiculous.  How could you say that because there are certain consequences?"  However, if it is considered in a more granular way, with various decisions being taken at various deadlines, at some point the ECB is governed by law.  The Deputy says it has a lot of power, but it is also governed by law, as well as by a mandate.  The law constrains it in what it can do.  It cannot lend without sufficient collateral.  It is in a situation where it deemed Greek Government bonds to be eligible collateral, only on the grounds that the Greek Government was committed to a programme that would get it safely, financially, out of the situation in which it found itself.  That was the decision taken back - I cannot remember the date - in 2010.  It was then in a tight legal situation because this guarantee was no longer in place; therefore, what was it to do?  Without going into the details because I cannot remember the ins and outs of it, the decision taken was that the safest decision politically, in other words non-politically, was to cut it at that point rather than become tangled in a negotiation that involved saying, "Maybe the ECB will pull it if you don't behave yourselves tomorrow.  Just say 'No'".  The decision of the Government has been clear.  It made statements.</p></speech>

It is not seen in terms of policy.  If Greece is forced out of the euro, the most likely impetus will be the withdrawal of emergency liquidity assistance from the Greek banks, the collapse of the Greek banking system and the forcing of the Greek Government into a decision to print money, nationalise the banks, etc.  It will, therefore, be the ECB's decision that will force Greece out.</p></speech>

The other word used by Deputy Boyd Barrett was "profiteering".  It is quite interesting.  It is true that in a competitive market new entrants unburdened by the past compete with each other and offer lower interest rates.  I am sure they could do it.  Are the banks "profiteering"?  It is hard to say this when one sees that the level of profits is very modest.  Up to now it was almost non-existent and previously it was negative.  If it is profiteering, who is getting the profit?  If one stops to think about this, there are all sorts of winners and losers in this terrible crisis we are still coming out of and it is not obvious that there are profiteers.  Where are the profits coming?  They are hardly profits at all.  The banks are rebuilding capital.  To the extent that profits are being made, they are not paying dividends on their equity.  All in all, if one starts doing a fairness analysis of what has happened in this massively unfair situation, it is not exactly clear.  Who are the shareholders of the banks?  Are they profiteering?  No; they own nothing of the banks now.  Their shareholding was written down by 99%.</p></speech>

It got additional cash from the new shareholders.  They provided more cash.  PTSB has an additional liability on its book, which is equity, and it has more cash.  If one looks at its assets compared to its liabilities other than equity, it has a bigger cushion.  There is no smoke and mirrors.  It is a real increase in its capital.  It was not something chosen by PTSB; it was something mandated for it by the ECB.  The ECB is demanding higher capital standards for all of its banks, and the other banks already had enough of a cushion so they did not need it.  It is a real addition of capital.</p></speech>

The Central Bank looks for a rate of inflation below but close to 2%.  Prices falling are not good and neither are prices rising.  We want to get somewhere in the middle.  The reason quantitative easing has been adopted is that the way things were going, including oil price rises and the weak demand in the euro area, prospective inflation was getting lower and lower and expectations of future inflation were getting lower and lower.  People were beginning to not believe that even on a medium-term horizon the ECB could get back to 2% but that, instead, it would be bouncing around 0% or negative.  Step-by-step additional actions were taken, and quantitative easing, which involves the purchase of large quantities of Government bonds from throughout Europe, is a tool which has been reasonably effective in the US, Britain and Japan, so why would we not use it?  Not using it would make it seem as though the ECB did not really care, so we definitely had to use this tool.  Does it risk pushing things in the other direction?  If one has been pushing and pushing and not getting there and then one uses a very strong tool, I suppose there could be some risk of this type, but this would emerge not so much as an overshoot of price inflation, but as a risk that people might take excessive gambles with money that is almost free.</p> <p>  What is the benefit to Ireland and when we have seen the problems caused by money that is almost free?  Fortunately - we have spoken about this - money is not free for standard variable rate mortgage holders, so they should not worry about it.  That is just to be facetious.  In Ireland, where this is really having an effect is not in the availability of borrowing for builders or home owners but in the low cost of refinancing the Government's debt.  The NTMA has already refinanced loans from the IMF, which were yielding more than 5%, to a very low interest rate.  It has an effect on the channelling of the profits of the Central Bank, which is a very large sum of money, and will continue over a number of years.  This really strong benefit to the public finances has been a boon to Ireland, where over-indebtedness of public finances is a burden.</p> <p>  In addition, tracker mortgage holders have seen this come through immediately.  Many people in Ireland are paying approximately 1%, and sometimes even lower than 1%, on their tracker mortgages.  These include people who borrowed at the height of the boom, and probably borrowed more than they ever should have, and it is certainly easing their budget.  They will not go out and buy another house.  They will find it possible to do things they were not able to do because they were scrimping and saving to pay.  The ECB did not do it for an over-indebted economy.  It did it to generate additional demand and make sure prices came back to the 2% target, but it has been an unmitigated plus for the Irish economy.</p></speech>

Professor Honohan spoke about the banks' cost of funds.  All of the banks have come before the committee and we have gone through the shenanigans of listening to them justify why the variable rate is higher than the European norm.  All of the answers we have received are to do with the cost of funds and historic debt.  It is quite refreshing that Professor Honohan has been reasonably honest in saying it is higher than a fair-minded customer might reasonably expect.  The interesting point was that Professor Honohan stated that ultimately the answer to this difficulty may lie with the Central Bank, in terms of openness, transparency and consumer protection, and that it might codify a requirement that banks be more open and transparent as to how they set their variable interest rates.  How quickly could the Central Bank act in putting in such a requirement?  Four banks have come before the committee, and the discussions certainly were not open and transparent to the people sitting in the committee.</p> <p>  My other observations relate to mortgage arrears, on which I echo the comments made by others.  I am saddened that we will not have our regular six-monthly meeting with Professor Honohan.  Much has happened in the time the committee has been sitting at an historic point for our country.  Perhaps the issue which has most dominated all of our discussions has been mortgage arrears.  The most recent country-specific recommendations highlight how difficult the situation in Irish banking remains, with the historically high levels of debt and rates of mortgage arrears.  What in Professor Honohan's opinion is the fundamental problem that remains in resolving this very difficult issue?</p><p> It is troubling to see that at the moment, with most of the banks that have come before this committee, legal action is the option taken in about 40% of the cases where arrears are greater than 90 days, and certainly where they are greater than 720 days.  There is a real issue in terms of the whole thing escalating into the legal system.  That is one observation we made from our engagement.  That has changed significantly over the past 18 months.  My last question to Professor Honohan is this: from his point of view, with his stewardship of the Central Bank, how would he rate the Central Bank's performance on the issue of mortgage arrears?</p></speech>

It is fairly new territory.  We cannot say we will simply do the same as they do in England.  I am hoping - I have not seen it yet - that the banks will come up to the line on this.  It is better if they design something that makes business sense but is transparent.  If we try to design it from a distance, we may start with something that is clunky and needs to be revised.  I am not saying I have this in the back pocket and am going to do it next week.  It will take months, because any of these codes of conduct must go through consultation processes, legal considerations and so on, so it is complicated.  We wrote to the banks in February.  I expected more from them, but when has that not been the case?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2588" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Patrick Honohan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015052800002#K00400"><p>Why is the process regarding mortgage arrears moving so slowly?  This is a multifaceted issue.  I do not think anybody in Ireland wanted to see mass evictions and repossessions resulting from this crisis.  That would have been the quick way to do it and that is how they did it in America.  They had many repossessions.  We started with moratoriums on that in 2009 and so forth.  We warned about doing anything rashly.  Then we moved to engagement and so forth.  I am glad we have not had that huge wave of repossessions and that there has been time for the economy to make this recovery, for property prices to bounce back from their nadir and for people to start getting jobs again.  There is a definite plus there relative to a quick resolution, which would have been a harsh resolution.  That would have been socially damaging.</p> <p>  The banks remained over-optimistic all along and are still over-optimistic regarding what they can recover.  That speaks to what Deputy Fleming has been asking regarding write-back provisions.  I am not an enthusiast of the banks' writing back provisions.  I am no longer in charge of this, because the ECB will be looking at that, but our staff were very much involved in it.  There will be a temptation for banks to write-back provisions on the basis of optimism that everything is going to be all right.  That optimism has caused them to be slow to do anything because, for example, establishing a split mortgage would be a hassle and although the split would allow them to recover if things improved, they would not see the need to do that and would just leave the person on interest-only for a few months.</p> <p>  In addition, some of the work we did to provide massive amounts of very cheap liquidity to the banks took the pressure off.  That is part of what the ECB was doing when it came to us in 2010 and 2011 telling us our banks needed to downsize and to deal with these loans.  We said we would still provide them with liquidity, even though it would remove the incentive for them to deal with this quickly.  It is quite easy for the banks to decide to just spin this along.  The customer may not be paying any interest, but then the bank is not paying much interest either.  That is another reason this has been slow: there has not been a tight budget constraint on the banks because we in the Central Bank have arranged that.  However, that should not have removed their responsibility to deal with the situation.</p> <p>  There is a legal system.  Some 50% or 60% of the cases are going into legal proceedings, which can be extremely drawn out.  Deputy Rabbitte talked about construction being extremely drawn out.  Our legal procedures are also very slow.  That gives time for compromises, but it may give so much time that people do not bother making a deal in the hope that something will crop up.</p> <p>  The efficiency of the banks can always be improved, but it is much better than it was when we first looked at it, in 2011, thinking that they could not do this.  We had a deeper crisis than most of the others, which is why we are still dealing with it.  A certain amount of Irish society is reflected in how we have handled this.  It does not leave us with a healthy banking system, but it has allowed us to avoid doing some damage at the expense of not fixing situations and leaving people with a huge debt burden.  They do not know where it is going to go.  How have we done on it?  The committee is used to my coming here and saying we are not doing well enough.  Superficially, our number of non-performing loans appears high, but people who know what we are doing and have scrutinised it are saying we have some good procedures in place now.  It is not for me to say, but we look worse on the headline numbers than on our processes.  It is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  Is that not what A. J. Chopra said when he did not realise what he was saying?</p></speech>

He has said that because we had such a high national debt the benefit of quantitative easing in Ireland has gone to the Government and the NTMA, dealing substantially with the national debt.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015052800002#K01100"><p>Exactly.  That is because of the debt.  He is saying that because of our national debt, aside from the tracker people, it was the Government that benefited from quantitative easing, rather than the real economy, the people, the citizens and the businesses, whereas in other countries where the debt-to-GDP ratio was 60% to 70% lower than ours, that same benefit did not have to be commandeered at Government level and at the equivalent to NTMA level, and it worked its way straight into the economy.  Professor Honohan has implied that because of our debt, the Government grabbed the benefit of the quantitative easing and less of it has trickled into the real economy than would otherwise have been the case.  I know the tracker people benefited, but it was almost by accident because of the level of debt.  Why was some of the benefit of quantitative easing not directed to what Professor Honohan said was the biggest problem, namely, the non-performing loans?  He should have been able to focus some of it there.  It seems we have not benefited fully from that.</p> <p>  I do not agree with the ECB rationale that 2% inflation is a good thing.  I know Professor Honohan said we did not want negative inflation, but we do not want it to run away either.  Can he explain to us why we should not have it at 1%?  The biggest single problem with the EU is that there is a closed-shop mentality.</p><p>We even see it in people trying to cross the Mediterranean.  They do it in every walk of life when it comes to financial matters.  They look at themselves as a closed shop, but they forget that they are in a global economy.  If an annual cumulative interest rate of 2% is being promoted over a ten year period, after ten years the cost base of operating in the European Union will be 25% higher than the cost base of operating in other economies that do not have policies involving such levels of inflation.  If we continue to make Europe a less attractive place for global investment, investors will head to economies that do not have a policy of incrementally increasing costs each year.  I do not understand why Professor Honohan thinks 2% is the right rate.  That is my question on quantitative easing.</p><p> Professor Honohan mentioned that the IBRC promissorys note went to being Government bonds.  He has said the Central Bank will make fabulous profits out of the new arrangement because it will be able to sell the Government bonds earlier and thereby reduce the debt.  He might tell us what his actual projections are.  If he does not have his figures with him - I do not see him with a big folder - he can send them to the committee at a later stage by way of correspondence.  What are his projections for the benefit to the Central Bank from the system as designed, over the period in which the change resulted, compared to how he now sees it unfolding in the next few years?  He might send us a note on the improvement that will be made in the profit of the Central Bank.</p><p> I would like to conclude by asking a question about the benefit of the note.  Is it required under EUROSTAT rules to go against the national debt, or can any of it work its way into the Government's current account?  Professor Honohan can come back to us in writing, if necessary.</p></speech>

Did I understand correctly that Professor John FitzGerald was saying in the article he had written, which I intended to read more carefully, that some &euro;9 billion was likely to be saved by the Exchequer in the relevant period?  Off the top of my head, I cannot think of anybody other than his late father who would have forensically examined Note 15 to the 2014 report of the Central Bank.  The man on the barstool has divided the &euro;64 billion fiasco into roughly two halves.  He understands that as we prepare for the privatisation of our shares, there is now the prospect to recover the money put in on the recapitalisation side.  He believes the money put into Anglo Irish Bank is gone, dead; that it is finished, over and kaputt.  Is it the same as saying the &euro;9 billion saving is actually &euro;9 billion that will not go up in smoke?</p></speech>

We will obviously hear what Professor Honohan has to say, but it strikes me that we are being told the money will be given back, but only after A, B, C, D and E have been done.  It is similar to the Greek situation.  It seems that a great deal of pain will have to be inflicted on many people in order to ensure this money is given back.  That is just a comment.</p> <p>  I would like to ask a question about the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015, with which we dealt yesterday.  Can Professor Honohan see any purpose, value or positive contribution vulture funds have in having a well functioning financial sector in this or any other economy?  I cannot see that there is.  We are now seeking to regulate them to some extent, but there are question marks over whether we are doing it well enough.  I wonder whether we should be regulating them out of business completely.  I do not see what value they add to anything.  We can set aside ideological differences we might have about whether banking should be public or private and so on.  That is one debate.  These vulture funds do not have a long-term commitment to a market, customers or anything else.  Given that Professor Honohan has said his objective is to have a well functioning financial sector - that should be the objective of any central bank - does he agree that we should be regulating vulture funds completely out of business?</p></speech>

I should not be talking about this at all, given that we are in the quiet period before the monetary policy meeting that will take place next Tuesday and Wednesday.  While I will make an exception, I will not talk about current monetary policy decisions, rather I will talk about quantitative easing in general terms.  I hope that will be acceptable.  </p> <p>  There is a clear answer to the question asked by Deputy Sean Fleming about the 2% rate.  The measurement of inflation is not very good at taking account of quality improvements and new goods.  There have been studies of this in the past 20 or 30 years, particularly in the United States where there is quite a body of evidence and the data are super.  The US authorities asked how much of a difference it would make if they could take proper account of new goods and quality improvements.  They came up with the conclusion that it was the driver of the figure of 2%.  I do not remember exactly what it was, but they more or less said that if one year was taken over the next, the rate was probably 2%.  The real rate of inflation is 0% when the rate is 2%, if members know what I mean, when quality improvements are taken into account.  We do not need to worry about competitors because the Americans, the British and the Japanese are aiming for a figure of approximately 2%, while some other countries are aiming for much higher rates.  All of this will be sorted with exchange rates.</p> <p>  An interesting question was asked about the distributional impact of quantitative easing.  We discuss it frequently.  It is simplistic to suggest the people who sell the bonds to the Central Bank will surely make the profit.  That is an overly simplistic approach.  As the effects of quantitative easing pass through the economy, they generate greater activity, profits in some areas, new jobs for people who do not have jobs and higher wages.  They pass through the economy and the issue is being studied.  I know from the recent INET conference I attended in Paris that some left-thinking people have been discussing whether there are better ways of engaging in quantitative easing.  Consideration is being given to approaches that could result in a better distributional effect.  There is a broad distributional impact, but perhaps it could be done better.</p> <p>  As Deputy Arthur Spring said, we did not come to this until a certain point in time.  Other countries had done it at an earlier stage.  Yes, there are different interests.  Some governors and members of the governing council perceive some issues as having greater prominence than others.  Countries in which the saving constituency is very dominant are not clear that they like quantitative easing at all, with zero interest rates on their savings.  Many considerations, including legal issues and the question of compliance with the treaty, were widely discussed.  We tried all sorts of other tools.  It was easier in a single country jurisdiction for the Americans to buy Federal Government guaranteed securities, for the Bank of England to buy many British Government securities or for the Bank of Japan to buy many Japanese Government bonds.</p><p>People were looking at the monetary financing of Governments and wondering if they could really do this.  There were a lot of legal considerations and concerns.  We got there, and that is important.  </p></speech>

Also, Deputy Fleming said the Government had grabbed all this.  The Government grabs, but it gives back.  It gives back in the services which otherwise have to be more squeezed and the benefits it pays.  The Government organises how it does it, but it obviously goes back into the economy in one way or another.</p> <p>  On the profits of the Central Bank, first of all, from a quantitative perspective, we show in the annual report the value of the unrealised capital gains at that moment of the remaining assets in its portfolio.  That was more than &euro;9 billion.  We had already made more than &euro;1 billion on this IBRC portfolio since the liquidation.  The sum of &euro;1 billion and then some plus &euro;9 billion is &euro;10 billion and then some.  However, the &euro;9 billion is not in the bag.  If interest rates were to go up again, the capital gain would be smaller.  Gradually, we will recover some of it.  I did the calculations the day before we published our annual report in preparation for this meeting.  At that moment, when the interest rates were at their very lowest, the unrealised capital gain was &euro;13 billion.  One might say, "Wow", but that alerts one to the fact that it can move around a lot.  We should not think the &euro;9 billion is in the bag, but, still, things are going well on that front.  </p> <p>  Is it really some clawback of part of the cost of IBRC?  The answer is "Yes" and "No".  There is a better way to think about it.  When the Government put that promissory note into the IBRC, it was at the highest interest rate.  It was a really high, bad interest rate time to do it.  It was not quite the highest, but it was a bad interest rate time to do it.  That is what happens.  When in trouble, a high interest rate will have to be paid.  What we have managed to achieve is, basically, to refinance - sorry, I should rephrase that because the Central Bank does other things.  What the Government has managed to achieve is a refinancing of that cost at these extremely low interest rates.  The capitalised value of that refinancing is the &euro;9 billion or &euro;10 billion sum.  That is why it is so difficult, given that we are talking about many years and different financing schemes.  Did IBRC still cost us &euro;35 billion adding all the things together?  Yes, but now it has been refinanced in such a way that, actually, the Government will only have to borrow maybe, in the end, &euro;10 billion less, because the bond is there and the bond is now worth more.</p></speech>

There is a lot of things to complain about in respect of some of the behaviour of certain funds, but they have become an ingredient which is increasingly important.  That is for various reasons, but one of the reasons is the considerable regulation of banks.  Squeeze that part of the balloon and something else emerges.  Many of the funds are serious intermediaries which are providing facilities to pension funds.  Where are we going to invest our pension money?  Let us go to this investment fund, because it knows about how to do these things.  These types of funds are doing it on a scale of billions.  They can economise.  They are buying Government securities and equities in reputable companies and so on and so forth.  A vast bulk of that business is reputable, well run and, if one looked under the bonnet and kicked around it, one would think it is actually all right.  There are then some more aggressive funds with which one might not wish to do business.  Some of them are regulated.  Some entities are not regulated.  We would want to be very dubious about those ones.</p></speech>

I genuinely believe this meeting is very significant and represents a valuable opportunity to identify a limited number of feasible opportunities that can help deliver the best possible health outcomes for all people, irrespective of background or means.</p> <p>  The committee met several health service representative organisations on Tuesday informally to help identify a limited number of areas where opportunities exist for greater cross-Border co-operation.  It was an insightful and productive meeting, and no doubt it will inform our discussion with the Minister today.</p> <p>  Before the discussion begins I would like members to note that this meeting is confined solely to identifying opportunities to enhance health service provision through North-South co-operation.  Specific issues and concerns regarding the health service or individual hospitals in the Republic are not relevant to this meeting, and I ask members to respect this ruling when asking the Minister questions.  I invite the Minister to make his statement.</p></speech>

At the North South Ministerial Council, NSMC, health and food safety sectoral meeting in Altnagelvin last month, I said that cross-Border co-operation on health was one of the unsung successes of the Good Friday Agreement.  There are several very good examples of co-operation in health, such as in radiotherapy services in Derry for all of west Ulster, the paediatric congenital cardiac service for the island, which will be based in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, health promotion, e-health and food safety.  We are an island of just over 6 million people and it makes sense to pool our resources to provide better health care for all our citizens, regardless of politics.</p> <p>  In Ireland, North and South, there is a growing interest in cross-Border all-island health and social care services co-operation where mutual advantage can be demonstrated.  That was not always the case in the past, but I am very glad that it is now.  That reflected the complexity of health and social care services and the many barriers which may be encountered in attempting to put cross-jurisdictional arrangements in place, including a lack of development funding, different systems for assessing eligibility and a situation in which each jurisdiction is Exchequer-funded only to provide for its own population catchment.  There have been several significant cross-Border and all-island initiatives over the past 20 years, with the early experience gained through local and regional pilot projects in the Border area, building the confidence to put more permanent collaborative arrangements in place.  Today, there are many examples which illustrate that co-operation between North and South in health makes sense.  The challenges facing health and social care providers, planners and policy makers on both parts of the island are similar.  There is no doubt that patient benefits will accrue from pooling expertise and resources and exchanging good practice.  I am committed to strengthening and increasing North-South health co-operation.</p> <p>  North-South co-operation on health matters takes place through the NSMC as well as joint departmental projects.  Taking its place within the broad spectrum of public agencies involved in facilitating North-South co-operation is the Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, partnership, which has played a significant role over the past 20 years in promoting cross-Border health and social care co-operation, particularly in the Border area.  CAWT is delivering the health element of the EU initiative for inter-regional co-operation, INTERREG IV, programme, comprising 12 projects with a strong focus on improving access to services, promoting health and well-being, reducing health inequalities and promoting social inclusion.  The numbers of patients and clients who have benefited from services is in excess of 53,000 as of March 2015.  The new INTERREG V programme has been agreed and I understand a call in the health area will issue in the coming months.  There is an increase in the funding available for the new programme, which will continue to deliver tangible benefits to citizens in both jurisdictions. </p> <p>  I will outline some areas of specific co-operation in health.  The committee is aware of the development of new radiotherapy facilities at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry.  I recently had the opportunity to see at first hand the progress in the development of the new radiotherapy unit.  The previous Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland, Jim Wells, and I visited the site where construction of the radiotherapy unit started in July of last year.  I was impressed and enthused by the dedication of the people I met.  This is an exciting cross-Border project that will significantly improve access to radiation oncology services right across the west Ulster region, on both sides of the Border.  Among the beneficiaries are people living in County Donegal and surrounding areas.  It will provide high-quality services on their doorstep on a par with those provided in the Northern Ireland Cancer Centre in Belfast and in our special centres in Dublin and Galway.  The Government has committed capital funding of &euro;19 million towards construction costs, and the HSE will also provide funding for the provision of services to patients per year, of which 385 will be from the Republic.  Donegal on its own does not have the population to justify or support a specialist centre for radiotherapy, and nor do Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh, but taking the four counties together, they have sufficient population and critical mass to justify and safely staff a specialist centre.  That is what has been done there.  It is a good example of work that could be done in the future in Derry, Dublin and Belfast.  </p> <p>  There is continued engagement between the Department of Health here and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland on progressing co-operation and finding a solution for paediatric cardiology services on an all-island basis.  The expert international working group report on an all-island service for cardiology and cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease was published in October 2014.  This report is a pragmatic example of co-operation across both jurisdictions which seeks to create an effective, integrated service for the benefit of patients.  It makes clear and explicit recommendations on the development of a single congenital cardiac service for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  One of the recommendations was that paediatric surgery and interventional cardiology should cease in Belfast and that all services should be provided in Dublin, giving us the critical mass of a population of approximately 6 million, which is needed for such a centre.  This development will ensure that a very vulnerable group of sick children and young people get the best level of care no matter where they come from on the island.  Other benefits of the service will include an expanded database for research into congenital heart disease and an expanded range of medical services. </p> <p>  A report on north-west cardiology provided to the board of the Saolta hospital group in October 2013 was positively received and its recommendations accepted.  The adoption of the recommendations of the report can build and support a robust cross-Border relationship that has the potential to deliver a high-quality service for the benefit of all of the population of the region.  In particular, the recommendation to establish a joint cardiology department between Letterkenny and Altnagelvin is very exciting, not solely because of the benefits to service provision for the people of the north-west but also because it will be the first ever joint cross-Border department in medicine or surgery.</p> <p>  The promotion of health and well-being is deemed important for all important for all our citizens.  There is important co-operation continuing between the two jurisdictions.  There is broad agreement on the need for significant and innovative action to protect the health and well-being of the wider public, and especially children, from alcohol abuse.  The two health Departments have co-operated closely here through the work of the North-South alcohol policy advisory group.  One such area of co-operation is the introduction of minimum unit pricing.  This is an important measure to tackle the harm caused by alcohol in adolescents and problem drinkers.  The University of Sheffield reports, which were jointly commissioned by the two Departments, studied the potential impact of minimum unit pricing in both jurisdictions.  The two Departments have agreed to work together as far as possible to ensure a co-ordinated approach to minimum unit pricing in terms of timing and rates to ensure health impacts are maximised and the impact on cross-Border trade minimised.</p> <p>  Since the inaugural North-South tobacco conference was held in Belfast in November 2013, which allowed for the sharing of innovative ideas to benefit the health of people from both jurisdictions, there has been significant progress on tobacco control measures.  The Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015 was signed into law by the President on 10 March 2015.  This has made Ireland the first country in Europe and the second in the world to pass such legislation.  Legislation to introduce standardised packaging of tobacco products has now been enacted in both Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the provisions will come into force in Ireland in May 2016.</p> <p>  Rare diseases have also been discussed at NSMC level.  There is broad agreement in principle for future collaboration in this area. The national rare disease plan in Ireland was published in July 2014.  The foreword to the plan referred to the policy framework on rare diseases, envisaging a combined approach with EU partners and Northern Ireland to diagnose and treat people with rare diseases.</p> <p>  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm is a priority for the Irish Government.  Much has been achieved under our Reach Out suicide prevention strategy and the Protect Life strategy in the North.  However, more needs to be done.  The development of a range of all-island actions on suicide prevention, together with the long-standing co-operation between the National Office for Suicide Prevention and the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland, has resulted in several excellent initiatives, including the media monitoring service, the registry of deliberate self-harm, information campaigns and the all-island men&rsquo;s health forum.</p><p>The Department of Health and the National Office for Suicide Prevention are currently finalising a new strategic framework for suicide prevention for the period 2015 to 2020 to follow on from Reach Out.  A new suicide prevention strategy is also under development in Northern Ireland.  The publication of these two new strategies will present opportunities for further co-operation on suicide prevention initiatives.<br/><br/>The food safety promotion board, <i>safe</i>food, is one of the six North-South bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999.  Members will be familiar with the work of <i>safe</i>food as its representatives attended this committee last month and a detailed discussion took place on North-South co-operation in food safety initiatives to promote healthy eating and combat obesity.  <i>safe</i>food is principally charged with tasks involving food safety awareness through public campaigns, conferences, training and advising professionals and the general public.  It is also involved in supporting North-South scientific co-operation and links between institutions working in the field of food safety, including laboratories, statutory food safety enforcement agencies and international and domestic research bodies.  It has run a number of successful campaigns in recent years.  These include the &quot;Operation Transformation&quot; television programme, the Community Food initiative, which aims to promote greater access and availability of healthy and safe food in low-income areas, and <i>eatright.eu</i>, a new website with a focus on healthy eating, food safety and physical activity.  <i>safe</i>food's knowledge networks continue to enhance linkages across the island among food safety professionals working in the food production and processing sectors, research and academia and the wider public sectors.  Digital engagement is an important feature of campaigns as it allows <i>safe</i>food to engage with customers in a cost-effective manner.  <i>safe</i>food can build on this success by continuing to increase public awareness through these channels.<br/><br/>To conclude, some of the best examples of practical public sector cross-Border co-operation are in the fields of health and social care.  I acknowledge, therefore, the great work of all those involved in cross-Border health co-operation and the difference they are making to people's lives.  The health services in both jurisdictions have evolved in different ways but there has always been enthusiasm about collaboration where it is mutually beneficial.  I look forward to continuing and developing this work in the coming years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2634" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1085" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015052800002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  On behalf of the joint committee, I will ask the Minister a series of questions based on our meetings with health service representative organisations last Tuesday and on other briefings provided to the committee.  I thank all the health service representatives for the work they did and for taking time out of their busy schedules for a very informative session last Tuesday.</p><p>A number of the representative organisations identified a need for an overarching strategic framework and implementation plan to develop sustainable cross-Border co-operation, as distinct from the existing focus on individual projects.  I consider the lack of a framework to be a major stumbling block impeding progress in the implementation of real change on an all-Ireland basis.  Is the Minister in favour of liaising with other Cabinet Ministers and his Northern Ireland counterparts with a view to introducing a framework that should lead to a more systematic, co-ordinated approach?  As a follow-on point, do the Minister and his officials have regular meetings with their Northern Ireland counterparts in the Department of Health, Social Security and Public Safety with the common goal of enhancing health service provision through North-South co-operation?  Is the Minister supportive of the idea of establishing a working group of civil servants from the Department of Health and the Department of Health, Social Security and Public Safety in Northern Ireland to progress the issue in parallel with the North-South Ministerial Council?</p><p>The issue of training and accreditation of health professionals in both jurisdictions is very important in the context of the development of services on a cross-Border basis.  In particular, there are still significant issues around the recognition of professional qualifications and medical mobility across borders, notwithstanding EU directives in the area.  What are the Minister's views on the development of a common register of medical professionals, through liaison with the Irish Medical Council and the UK's General Medical Council, which would end the requirement to register in both jurisdictions?  This would significantly reduce costs, including indemnity insurance and professional registration fees, and encourage doctors to operate on both sides of the Border.  There appears to be significant scope to extend the GP out-of-hours service in Border areas on a cross-Border basis.  I understand that North East Doc has provided cover for south Armagh for some years now and that a similar arrangement is active in east Donegal, where patients can avail of the out-of-hours service in Derry.  One significant problem is that GPs here are not entitled to travel to Northern Ireland to see patients and <i>vice versa</i>.  Have the Minister or his officials or counterparts in Northern Ireland explored the issue with a view to identifying possible solutions and, if not, will the Minister undertake to do so?</p><p>The Minister is aware that alcohol abuse is a serious issue throughout the island.  I welcome the comments in the Minister's statement but note that we need an all-island alcohol strategy.  Obesity and childhood obesity in particular were referred to by the Minister.  Would he consider liaising with his Northern Ireland counterparts on the introduction of all-island measures to combat obesity?  Specifically, is the Minister in favour of developing a shared set of public health indicators, as it is difficult to make accurate comparisons in the absence of these indicators?  For information, I note that yesterday Colin Regan of the GAA attended the joint committee.  The GAA has a Healthy Clubs project.  We talk about <i>safe</i>food and getting messages across, and this is absolutely the right vehicle to use, as the GAA encompasses many clubs in rural areas and can address everything from drug awareness to alcohol abuse to community fitness.  This could be rolled out not only through the GAA but on a cross-Border basis, and the Minister could also work closely with the IRFU, the FAI and the IFA.  We are looking at various bodies, but we are not getting the message across in the way we should.  I encourage the Minister to look at the presentation Colm Regan made.  He was invited in by Deputy Gerry Adams yesterday and he made a very worthwhile presentation.</p><p>On co-operation and cross-Border partnership between the health and social care services in both jurisdictions, there have been a number of successful initiatives in the field of quality and safety training.  Are there plans to mainstream successful initiatives to other hospitals as models of best practice?  The Minister referred to rare diseases.  Deputy Joe McHugh has been instrumental in raising this issue also.  Ireland has the lowest ratio of consultant rheumatologists <i>per capita</i>in Europe, with one per 135,000 people.  Many patients must travel long distances, particularly from Border areas, to access appropriate treatment.  Rheumatology patients in Donegal travel must to Leitrim for treatment since the cessation of rheumatology services at Letterkenny General Hospital.  In addition, there is serious concern that expertise is not available nationally for more complex, life-threatening mixed connective tissue diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and sceleroderma, which are treated primarily by consultant rheumatologists.  Does the Minister consider that an all-Ireland centre of excellence based in one hospital would be a viable solution whereby both jurisdictions could piggyback on NHS expertise?</p><p>A further issue that has come up is the cost of pharmaceutical drugs in the Republic, which continues to be exorbitant according to international comparisons.  While a great deal of work has been done in this area in the last six or seven years, a significant proportion of the overall health budget, at approximately &euro;2 billion, continues to be spent in this area.  These drugs can be bought significantly more cheaply in Northern Ireland.  While I accept that there are complexities involved, have the Minister or his officials given any thought to an all-island arrangement for purchasing pharmaceutical drugs?  Are there at least any lessons that can be learned from Northern Ireland as to how to cut margins?  How can the huge disparity North and South of the Border be explained?</p><p>Another question that arose with the representative organisations related to the proposal that the planned children's hospital be constructed on an all-island basis.  What are the Minister's views?  Has the Minister had any discussions with his former or current Northern Ireland counterpart in this regard?</p><p>Finally, are his officials looking at organ transplant and retrieval services?  How can these be provided on an all-island basis?</p><p>There seem to be discussions among medical professionals suggesting it would enhance the service and resolve a number of time factor issues that impact so greatly on organ donation and transplantation.  The existing co-operation between both jurisdictions and the UK is testimony to the ability of services to overcome national borders to provide the best possible outcomes for patients.</p></speech>

There are many questions and to give comprehensive answers to all of them would take up the rest of the meeting, so I will not do that.  The Chairman asked about an overarching strategic framework.  The North-South Ministerial Council is designed to do that and has identified areas of specific co-operation, namely, accident and emergency services, planning for major emergencies, high-technology cancer research and health promotion.  The bottom-up activity has been most successful - the identification of the need for radiation oncology services in west Ulster, which are now provided in Altnagelvin; the identification by clinicians of the need in respect of paediatric cardio-thoracic surgery, which is now happening in Dublin; and deep-brain stimulation, which is now done for many patients from the Republic in Belfast.  The area of transplants is also being examined, but is only at the initial stages.  The question was whether it would be better to have a top-down approach, rather than a bottom-up approach.  I am not sure.  Some work was done in 2009 on a strategic framework.  The nature of such frameworks is to take forever to be drawn up and then get reduced to the lowest common denominator.  I would be interested to hear the views of members on this.  If the objective is to deliver cross-Border services in the interests of patients, it could be argued that is best done on a bottom-up approach to respond to service needs as they arise, rather than a top-down approach, but the reverse could also be argued, so I do not have an answer for that one.</p> <p>  Regarding meetings, I meet with my counterpart two to three times a year at ministerial level.  I am not sure exactly what happens at civil service level.  Perhaps Ms Joyce or Ms Hagerty want to answer that.</p></speech>

It is very regular contact, even if not face-to-face.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2642" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Audrey Hagerty" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015052800002#F00800"><p>We liaise quite with CAWT throughout the year on an ongoing basis.  As the Minister outlined in his opening statement, there is quite a bit of contact on the issues of tobacco, obesity and alcohol, as well as in the area of suicide with the two organisations responsible for that area of work.  There is quite a lot of ongoing co-operation there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2643" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1085" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015052800002#F00900"><p>Could the Minister try to arrange to meet with the GAA health club project?  It would be worthwhile.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015052800002#F01000"><p>I have done that.  I actually launched it.  The healthy club project is very encouraging.</p> <p>  On the common register for medical professionals and other professionals, that would be extremely difficult.  If we were to have common registration in Ireland and Northern Ireland, all the legislation would first have to be aligned just for doctors, then for nurses, dentists and 14 other professions.  About 16 different Acts of Parliament would have to be passed in both jurisdictions.  We would have to agree to align our legislation in both jurisdictions and things are different.  The universities are set up differently, competence assurance is different, and requirements for continuing professional development are also different.  There would also be the issue of extra-judicial decisions.  The Medical Council in Dublin hears complaints against doctors and can make serious findings against doctors and then strike them off.  If there were to be an all-island medical council that could strike off doctors in two different jurisdictions, I imagine an international treaty would be required.  It would need to have the effect of a cross-Border court.  That would then apply to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, CORU and all the others as well.  It is not impossible.  Unification of the island might be simpler.  That would be the way to start, rather than trying to align 14 different pieces of legislation and create 14 different quasi-judicial bodies with cross-Border powers.  We might even need referendums on that.  It would not be where I would start in unification.  I am not sure how East and West Germany did that, but that would be the case study to look at.</p> <p>  On out-of-hours services, from its commencement to 30 April 2015, 739 patients in Inishowen received GP out-of-hours services in Derry.  That is about seven per month.  Some 2,839 patients from south Armagh have received GP out-of-hours services in Castleblayney in County Monaghan, that is about 32 per month.  Patient uptake in the Inishowen-Derry pilot is quite low.  That is partly due to the reduction in the pilot size.  Initially, the pilot area was supposed to cover the Buncrana area, but I am told the HSE could not get agreement from the Buncrana GPs, so it did not happen.  There is also the issue of accommodation address, which affects people living along the Donegal Border, who are in some cases entitled to NHS treatment because they are frontier workers and use the service in Northern Ireland anyway.  The authorities in both jurisdictions have agreed that exploratory discussions should now proceed regarding the potential for extending the service on a trial basis to Blacklion in County Cavan and Pettigo in County Donegal, whereby patients from these areas could avail of an out-of-hours service in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, or in Omagh, County Tyrone.  Initial discussions took place with local GPs, but it was not possible to progress the matter at the time.  However, the HSE has now put arrangements in place with Caredoc for the commencement of a new out-of-hours GP service in the Sligo-North Leitrim area later this year.  That will allow discussions on the potential extension of cross-Border out-of-hours services in Enniskillen or Omagh to recommence, so they will have another go at that.</p> <p>  On the all-island measures on alcohol and obesity, in respect of alcohol in particular, we try to ensure we implement minimum unit pricing at roughly the same time and rate so that we do not have huge numbers of people crossing the Border to buy alcohol where it is cheaper.  That would totally defeat the purpose of doing it.  On obesity, we have had discussions but not many.  It is important to bear in mind that we are different jurisdictions.  We have a plan for alcohol and we are pressing ahead with it.  We know what we are going to do this year and enact next year.  We will have a plan on obesity this year and we will start implementing it next year.  The risk of having an all-island strategy is obvious: everything gets paused, a year or two is spent developing an all-island approach and what inevitably happens is that we have all the stuff we want to do, they have all the stuff they want to do, but all that makes it into the strategy is the crossover, so the sum of the two parts is actually less.  If it were a Venn diagram, instead of doing everything within the two circles, we only end up doing the things in the small overlapping section.  It would be a great strategy and we could all say it is wonderful and launch it and so on, but would it actually produce better results than us all doing what we want to do anyway?  It is probably better that each jurisdiction does what it wants to do on alcohol and obesity and we try to co-ordinate in a practical way, rather than having a lowest common denominator strategy, which would have the problems I mentioned.</p> <p>  The cost of medicines in Ireland is now coming down, largely because of reference-pricing of generic medicines and the various agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association on patent medicines.  Ireland spends about as much on medicines now as it did ten years ago, which is not the case in most other countries.  We came from a very high base, but most countries are still going up, while we have been flat for the best part of ten years.  The exception is the very high-tech medicines, which happen to be very expensive.  They are only made by one manufacturer, which generally has us over a barrel when it comes to pricing.  Members will have seen that with Soliris and some other medicines in the last few months.  In theory, medicines could be procured on an all-island basis.  That would make them cheaper here but more expensive in the North.  I am not sure the North would be up for that.</p><p> The best option for us would be for the Republic of Ireland to buy into the NHS purchase system to enjoy the economy of scale of a population of approximately 60 million between Britain and Ireland.  One could get a much better price with that kind of buying power but why on earth would the pharmaceutical industry want to do that?  We cannot force the industry to agree to purchasing across two countries.  Perhaps we would need to unify Britain and Ireland before we could do it because we cannot force somebody to make an agreement.  It suits the pharmaceutical industry to have different agreements with different countries and, often, to pick off the smaller ones with the highest prices, with a view to setting a benchmark price for those with the buying power.  We are, however, starting to procure certain very expensive medicines on a Europe wide basis.  A European directive has been introduced which specifically permits us to do that.  For example, as vaccines are more or less the same and used similarly in every country, procuring them with a buying power of 500 million people is obviously much better than a buying power of 5 million or 60 million people.  A similar approach may be adopted in respect of Hepatitis C medicines, which we would purchase with the buying power of 27 countries rather than the alternatives of one country and a province or two countries.</p><p> The children's hospital project began before I came into office.  I am not sure whether Ms Miriam Joyce wants to comment on that project.  The children's hospital is designed for the Republic of Ireland rather than for all of Ireland.  A major children's hospital would still be needed in Belfast given its catchment population of 1.5 million.  We would like to provide some of the high level specialist services for all of Ireland in the new hospital.  Paediatric heart surgery is already agreed and I think we could also provide other services, such as transplants.  That has to work three ways, however, because in some cases services will be provided out of Belfast or Dublin for all of Ireland, out of Derry for all of west Ulster and, where we do not have the population for certain very rare procedures, it makes sense not to provide them in Ireland at all.  They would instead be provided out of Birmingham, Newcastle or Great Ormond Street in London.  There are, therefore, two dimensions of co-operation, namely, east-west and North-South.</p></speech>

I welcome the confirmation by the Minister that solid moves are afoot on minimum unit pricing of alcohol in the Republic and co-ordination with Northern Ireland on the matter.  That will be an important achievement for obvious reasons.  As a representative of Cavan-Monaghan, it is critical that there is co-ordination on any new measure that is introduced because the alternative will be a major exodus to purchase alcohol.  There is good co-operation on tobacco products, in which regard the recent initiatives in the Republic are to be commended.</p> <p>  I recently attended a briefing session with HSE officials in our region.  Oireachtas Members and the officials referred to obstacles in providing good dental and orthodontic services arising from the difficulties in recruiting dentists.  Does the Minister see potential in reducing dental waiting lists through North-South actions?  He will be acutely aware this is happening on an informal basis in that people are travelling to Northern Ireland for orthodontic treatment.</p> <p>  I was proud to take part in the recent discussion in the D&aacute;il on cochlear implants given their significance for so many people.  Does the Minister see potential in North-South co-operation in hearing and specialist services?  I was glad to hear him note that we will have specialist paediatrics services.  I welcome the congenital cardiac abnormalities initiative.  He correctly pointed out that while we cannot provide a physical building to house to house services for children in all of Ireland, we can provide specialist services in Belfast and Dublin.</p> <p>  I take his point that it would be easier to unite Ireland than to codify and bring together all the legislation and professional bodies to achieve harmonisation of qualifications.  What initiatives might be taken to enhance staff mobility between North and South?  Could that be done without complex legislative reforms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2647" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015052800002#G00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive presentation.  I noted to the representative groups at our meeting with them on Tuesday that we have enjoyed good co-operation over the years.  It is more the fault of the political system than the people who deliver health services that such co-operation has not received the attention it deserves.  I am a firm believer in responding to service needs rather than devising grand strategies.  We are all familiar with the territorial nature of agencies, whether on a national or local basis.  It is important to respond to service needs in a practical way, with people on the ground who can take initiatives and work with their colleagues in the adjoining jurisdiction.  Ear, nose and throat and urology services for my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan were delivered from Omagh hospital, and there has been good co-operation across the Border.  We should consider ways of expanding existing services.  I would also like to see progress on improving doctor on call services to the central Border region of Cavan-Fermanagh and Monaghan-Fermanagh.  There has been good co-operation in respect of ambulance services, although I do not know whether this is on a structured basis.  I presume that we could also make improvements to providing ambulance services on a North-South basis, particularly in respect of the Border area.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly referred to our discussion with the HSE last Friday regarding the huge cost that families face for orthodontic services.  Many families purchase services north of the Border.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund previously purchased ophthalmology and cataract services from a private hospital in Derry to reduce the waiting list for these services in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  Orthodontic services and the dental service for school children are under huge pressure.  If there was scope to buy in services on a one-off basis it would be beneficial in terms of reducing the current backlog.  This is an area in which we would like to see progress.</p><p> I will conclude by asking about the development of new facilities.  I believe that when substantial new facilities are being planned or provided in the Northern jurisdiction or in our own State, provision should be made on an all-Ireland basis, particularly in regard to specialties.  We are fighting to retain hospital services in our own localities if we can.  Many people would willingly go to any part of Ireland to avail of a specialist service in many areas and ensure the necessary intervention is provided when needed.  We need to be developing services in many specialist areas on an all-Ireland basis.  I hope provision can be made for specialist areas in the National Children's Hospital.  The South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen was the last major new health service provision to be made North of the Border.  To my knowledge, some of that hospital is not being used at present.  It is a shame if that is the case.  I am sure there are some areas and services which are needed both North and South that could be provided there.  We have to look at the development of services, particularly in that respect.  As the Minister quite rightly pointed out, Ireland is an island of 6 million people.  We cannot have specialist services everywhere.  We must try to ensure there is the utmost co-operation.  I strongly believe the best improvement we can make in the provision of additional services should involve responding to service needs and driving initiatives at local level, rather than waiting for grand strategies to be drawn up North or South of the Border and finally agreed.  I am very conscious that nobody wants to cede territory to some extent.</p></speech>

As he knows, I come from County Louth, which is a Border county that has a close relationship with Newry.  It is a 15-minute drive from Dundalk to Newry.  The Minister spoke earlier about the difference in the price of prescribed drugs between the North and the South.  My constituents contact me on a regular enough basis about this issue.  They are concerned because vast price differences leave them with no option other than to travel to the North to purchase drugs.  They have noticed lately that pharmacies based in Newry are now advertising in the South of Ireland.</p> <p>  I know this matter has been examined by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Would it be possible for this committee to consider whether it has an opportunity to work with pharmacies from both North and South?  Perhaps we can pool our resources together to reduce the cost of drugs.  As the Minister knows, we have come out of a recession.  I have always said I firmly believe that one's health is one's wealth in life.  One can have lots of money in the bank, but that does not matter if one does not have one's health.  As the Chairman said, the Government has done a fantastic job over the last four or five years in reducing the cost of prescription drugs.  It is an awful shame that people from my local area have to cross the Border and that people from the far side of the Border have to come to our area to advertise their drugs at a cheap price.</p> <p>  The Minister knows that I am the Joint Committee on Health and Children's rapporteur on the issue of obesity, which we have discussed on many occasions.  I would welcome an opportunity for the North and the South to work closely together to try to combat the current epidemic, which is very serious for children and adults.  At a time when we are trying to cut back on costs, we should reflect on the link between obesity and heart problems and diabetes, etc.  Obesity has an impact on every organ of one's body.  Is there anything we can do to help the Northern side in that regard?</p></speech>

I just do not have enough detail on those matters to hand.  In orthodontics, it is intended to do some outsourcing to the private sector towards the end of the year to try to reduce the waiting lists, particularly for surgery.  Some of that is done in the Beacon Hospital already.  There will be more towards the end of the year.  That is already in the service plan.</p><p>I often hear of patients who go to the North on their own bat and then claim it back on the cross-Border directive.  We are probably going to see a lot more of that in the years to come.  Many more people will take advantage of the cross-Border directive to avail of treatments in another country, which then get billed back to their home country.  I think that is probably a good thing.  If significant numbers of people are going overseas to buy treatment they should be getting here, it might be easier for the Minister for Health to get the money in the first place.  If people are going off to get treated in England or the North instead, it might be a game-changer in the medium term.</p><p>Deputy O'Reilly will be aware that the bilateral cochlear implant programme started quite recently under Dr. Laura Viani in Beaumont Hospital and Temple Street Children's Hospital.  The real success of that programme will be shown quite soon in an RTE documentary.  It is powering away through the waiting list.  I am not sure whether it is yet in a position to take patients from North of the Border.  I do now know where they are done in the North.  It is certainly worthy of consideration.</p><p>There is a certain amount of staff mobility already.  Cardiothoracic surgeons come to Dublin from Belfast to operate on children.  Deputy Smith will be aware that when we were short on transplant surgeons in Beaumont Hospital for a while, we got a dig-out from the surgeons from Belfast who came down and did some transplants here.  There is some mobility.  There was a coaching and mentoring element to one of the INTERREG programmes, which was a workforce mobility programme, to facilitate the development of leadership skills and the sharing of knowledge across the Border.  There was also a social worker leadership aspect to enhance the leadership skills of social work team leaders.  The project is also delivering on the moving and handling training passport on a cross-Border basis so that people can have one that applies across the Border.</p><p>Under EU directives, it is generally not all that hard for someone who qualified in the EU to get recognised in another country.  One does have to pay the relevant fee, however.  It occurs to me that if somebody is registered already in the Republic of Ireland, we should waive the fee for them to be registered in the North, or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is just a thought and I am not promising anything.  We might find we cannot do that without extending it to everyone in the European Economic Area, on the basis that we cannot treat any European citizen any more favourably than another.  Maybe it is an idea.</p><p>I was invited by Jim Wells to visit the new hospital in Enniskillen.  I am told it is very impressive.  It is one of the most modern hospitals in Ireland or Britain at this stage.  It is also very big, for whatever reason.  I am not sure whether the relevant authorities were thinking ahead to cross-Border reconfiguring.  I do not know whether they are planning to treat people from Sligo, Cavan or Monaghan in Enniskillen.  I intend to take a look at the hospital in the next couple of months.</p><p>The HSE does have a tender out at the moment to outsource many of those who have been waiting more than a year for inpatient procedures, outpatient procedures and outpatient appointments.  I do not know whether any tenders came in from any of the trusts North of the Border.  I would be surprised if they did not.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that a Northern Minister is not here, or even that a unit representation is not here.  This is an ongoing thing.  It is for our mutual benefit, including the benefit of our constituents, that we are seeking to take advantage of any type of co-operation that is necessary.  Unfortunately, not everyone is represented.</p> <p>  I welcome the extent of North-South co-operation in a number of areas, as outlined by the Minister.  It is to be welcomed and supported.  I hope it will continue and expand.  The Minister spoke about the price of medicine and drugs and the problems in dealing with that.  He mentioned a &euro;500 million EU structure that offers some possibilities for the future.  It is something that all of us would like to see.  The cost of medicine and drugs is quite crippling for many people, especially those who do not have medical cards.</p> <p>  I welcome the co-operation with regard to alcohol abuse, which is ingrained in our society.</p><p>From a sporting perspective, for example, I doubt that there are many clubs that do not receive sponsorship or support from local pubs and so forth.  They have no other choice, as the situation has changed so much in the past 25 or 30 years such that football, soccer, hurling and boxing clubs, for example, have a dependency on publicans and the like for support.  Perhaps some State funding for clubs, in conjunction with funding for the national sports bodies, should be considered.</p><p> Regarding below cost selling, I do not believe minimum pricing will resolve the issue.  What is required is a form of excise duty on products which could then be used to fund programmes of education and so forth to help to address the problem, particularly as it relates to alcoholism which is ingrained in our society.  Perhaps the Minister might respond to this suggestion.</p><p> One of the most disturbing aspects is suicide and the lack of suicide prevention measures.  It is ravaging communities, North and South.  On Monday night I attended the funeral of a 29 year old constituent who had taken his own life, having been released from a psychiatric ward the previous day.  Before coming to Dublin on Tuesday, I attended the funeral of an 83 year old who had taken his own life.  These give an indication of the size of the problem.  Every month I attend the funeral of someone who has taken his or her own life.  It is a major problem, much of which is down to the way we treat our fellow human beings and how some people grow up with a sense of inequality and hopelessness.  I was involved with a number of local projects that dealt with this issue, particularly as it affected young people.  On reflection, though, we approached it in the wrong way.  There was a glorification of the person who had taken his or her life.  Young people said on Facebook that he or she was a lovely person and so forth.  That was counterproductive.  We need an all-island strategy to deal with the issue.  It will probably be done through education programmes in schools and by making facilities available for those who are suffering from depression.  If one drives down the Falls Road in Belfast, one will see public offices that were there to help people who were suffering from depression and had suicidal tendencies.  We must do something, as this is one of the most pressing issues facing young people in particular, but they are not the only ones affected.  Once, it was practically unheard of for a young woman to take this option.  Will the Minister respond to this point?</p><p> I thank the Minister for his presentation.  We should utilise our abilities in an all-island context.  This is a small island with 6 million people and the same issues affect everyone across it.  Putting services in place in a co-operative way - from the point of view of price and in terms of having proper state-of-the-art facilities available - makes common sense and should be pursued and I hope it will be.</p></speech>

I wish to raise a few points.  Nearly all of us present live in the Border area and have similar interests; therefore, the same issues are arising.  However, one cannot overemphasise the need for services.  I live in Dundalk and there has always been a good link-up between it and Newry in the provision of maternity services.</p> <p>  I have raised a matter with the Minister previously, namely, the provision of psychological services, particularly for children with intellectual disabilities.  As I say constantly, there is no child psychiatrist in County Louth for children with an intellectual disability.  It is heartbreaking to see the number of people who are trying to access services.  There is a correlation between the North and the South in some regards, but could something be done to deal with this matter?  I raised it yesterday.  Recently, there have been improvements and we have been told that jobs are being advertised, but they are actually being readvertised because the HSE cannot find anyone.  It states this is not because of salary issues, but if child psychiatrists can be hired in the North, I do not know why we cannot find them just across the Border.  Is there an initiative or a plan in place or could the Minister discuss this matter?  People swap.  Within disability services there are quite a number of occupational therapists and physiotherapists who live just across the Border.  The overall issue is a major concern for me.</p> <p>  Regarding drugs and prescriptions, one must consider the matter from both sides.  As Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick stated, people will travel to the North for their medicines, but they will also travel to the North for outpatient treatment, for example, at Daisy Hill Hospital.  As there are shorter waiting times, they travel to the North instead of heading 20 miles south to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</p> <p>  If we can have co-operation between the North and the South, I urge the Minister to consider the matter of disability services specifically.  There is a major shortage, chiefly of psychiatrists for children with disabilities but also of psychologists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists, and the waiting lists are long.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his presentation.</p> <p>  I have sat on the health committee at Stormont for approximately seven and a half years.  One of our main issues is health inequality, as illustrated in the Chief Medical Officer's report three years ago.  It highlighted how, if one boarded a bus in central Belfast and travelled to Finaghy in the leafy suburbs, one would live nine years longer  due to the lifestyles people were forced into having by deprivation, etc.  I am unsure whether there is an urgent need to address anything like this in the South as there is in the North.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Martin Ferris in that it is regrettable that the Minister's counterpart in the North is not present and that there is no Unionist representative in attendance.  It is important that this section of our community be represented.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned out-of-hours services, particularly in south Armagh which forms part of my constituency.  There are many examples of good co-operation, for example, the renal unit at Daisy Hill Hospital where six beds are reserved for people from north County Louth.  This has made a major difference to users of dialysis services in that they do not need to travel to and spend the whole day in Dublin.  They can go to Daisy Hill Hospital and be home by lunchtime, which is important in terms of the quality of life of those who must undergo this treatment.</p> <p>  According to figures made available two years ago, approximately 35,000 patients passed through Daisy Hill Hospital's emergency department.</p><p>Approximately 3,500 were from the South and the numbers are increasing.  There are some very good examples such as CAWT, Co-operation and Working Together, with which I have had some dealings during the years.  It provides a very good cross-Border and all-Ireland service.  Incidentally, I have been to the hospital in Enniskillen which is state of the art.  I am sure the former health Minister, Mr. Jim Wells, had a united Ireland in mind when it was commissioned, but I will not get too caught up in that aspect of the matter.  </p><p> In terms of GAA healthy club projects, three of the Border counties come under the auspices of the Ulster Council which is based in Armagh.  It is perhaps incumbent on the Minister to speak to his counterpart in the North about co-operation with the GAA clubs involved in the Border counties.  It may be difficult because of the jurisdictional aspects for people from County Monaghan, for instance, to attend meetings in Armagh; it may not be feasible for them to do so and, apparently Mr. Tom Elliott, MP, MLA, is taking his seat at Westminster.  He has refused and continues to refuse to have any dealings with the GAA.  These are barriers that have to be overcome and it is incumbent on all of us, including the Minister, to raise the issue with the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Simon Hamilton, MLA.</p></speech>

However, the point made about the need for strategic direction and strong leadership was made forcefully.  The impression I got from the Minister was that he was discussing the practicalities of that co-operation and saying all-Ireland co-operation was not feasible in quite a number of areas because of the practicalities mentioned.</p> <p>  The Minister said there was an agreement on minimum pricing of alcohol.  When does he expect to see progress being made on that matter to enable it to become a reality?  Is there agreement in the two alcohol policies on anything else?  As there is a new national drug strategy in motion, does the Minister envisage cross-Border co-operation or discussion on how we could co-operate in terms of the national drugs strategy.  </p> <p>  One point that really struck me in one of the presentations on Tuesday concerned the exchange of data, in particular figures for inequality and health outcomes and life expectancy for persons who lived in poorer areas.  I see a role for a greater working together on such data which could direct policy. </p> <p>  Co-operation and Working Together applies to Border counties.  Does the Minister envisage it being extended on an all-Ireland basis, as a way to move certain practices forward?</p> <p>  I receive a lot of calls, as does everyone else, about hip and knee replacement operations in particular.  Are there plans for further cross-Border co-operation on this issue under the cross-Border directive governing the purchase of treatment abroad?  </p> <p>  My last question relates to rare disease, a matter which the Minister has mentioned.  There are children who suffer from a rare disease in Donegal.  For some of them the disease is terminal.  With the pathways being developed, does the Minister see a way for these children to access services in Derry or Belfast?  This would be of considerable benefit to their well-being and that of their families.</p></speech>

My excuse is that I was in the hospital system.  </p> <p>  On previous occasions the two Ministers would have attended the committee - for instance, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and the Minister for Education, Mr. John O'Dowd, MLA.  It was useful that they spoke jointly about the co-operation enjoyed but also about the difficulties and the barriers encountered.  Will the Minister expand on some of the road blocks or difficulties experienced?  Are they political?  How many of them are practical?  </p> <p>  Previous speakers at this committee spoke about raising the quality of some services, for instance, children not having to travel to Britain.  They should just have to take a short drive down the road rather than having to catch a flight and stay in hotels.</p> <p>  I do not know if the Minister mentioned the national children's hospital.  I could raise the issue of its location, with which I had difficulties.  People want to know what is happening.  Those involved in the children's section in Tallaght hospital are concerned about beds that have mysteriously been disappearing out of the system.  On the hospital, does the Minister see it providing services on an all-Ireland basis?  If he does, when will this kick in?  From a practical perspective, when will children see the benefits?</p> <p>  Recently there was controversy surrounding the cost to the health service in this jurisdiction of treating a number of people who suffered from a rare disease.  Did the Minister have practical discussions with his counterparts, not only in the North but also in Britain, about coming together, not only across these jurisdictions but also on a European wide basis, to look at the cost factors?  Recently we had discussions on the spending power of multinationals and how they could bring down prices and so on.  Have there been similar discussions, not only with the Minister's counterparts in the North but also across Europe on the issue? </p> <p>   What are the practical things the Minister believes the committee can do?  As he is probably aware, it has been doing a lot of work to reach out to many of the Unionist and Nationalist areas in the North.  Does he see any benefit in us looking at or visiting some of the hospital or medical settings to see what is and is not working?  In practical terms, we want to come back with information on best practice, what works and what does not.  Would this be of any benefit to the work done in the Minister's Department?</p></speech>

They have been well rehearsed in other committees and the public domain and the committee knows where we are going on the issue.  We will not ban sponsorship outright, but we will regulate and restrict it and ensure the regulations in law can be enforced because, to be frank, the current codes of conduct are being widely flouted.</p> <p>  The difference between introducing minimum unit pricing and increasing excise duty has been looked at a few times.  The problem we have with cheap alcohol is that it might represent below cost selling.  We do not know if it is or not because no one knows what the cost is for sure.  Some multiples are selling alcohol very cheaply in order to drive footfall.  They do not make a profit but make it on the other things people buy when they go into a store.  The problem with increasing excise duty is that the multiples could still sell alcohol at a price that is lower the rate of excise duty.  For instance, there could be excise duty of &euro;2 on every can of beer, but the multiples could still sell it for &euro;1.50, take the hit and make a profit elsewhere.  Minimum unit pricing does not allow this practice.  It sets a floor price based on the number of units of alcohol in a product.  No matter what the rate of VAT, excise or anything else is, it is the minimum price and it will be an offence to sell it any cheaper.  That is why the research indicates it would be more effective than increasing excise duty.  That was the finding of the common research carried out in Sheffield which had been commissioned by the two Departments, North and South.</p><p>While this is not to say excise duties might not increase, we are convinced that minimum pricing would be the most effective measure.</p><p> At the NSMC meeting before last, Ms Michelle O'Neill, MP, MLA, proposed a joint North-South strategy on suicide and we examined it seriously.  There are a few difficulties, including the fact that our new strategy is ready and will be published during the next few weeks by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and we did not want to go back to square one and develop a new strategy.  We also found many difference in implementation structures, the availability of services and the way schools and hospitals work.  We have a National Office for Suicide Prevention, whereas in the North it is managed through the Public Health Agency.  There were too many difference to make it practical.  Although we could have put something together, it would have been wishy washy.  We wanted a specific strategy with specific actions and a named person who was going to do them, and we could not do it across the two jurisdictions.  We did agree to co-operate in areas where it made sense, for example research, evaluation of the effectiveness of policies, awareness campaigns which could be similar on both sides of the Border and sharing and learning good practice.  While there will be a North-South dimension to the new strategy, it will not be a single strategy.</p><p> I will look into the issue of the child psychologist in County Louth.  I am not sure whether the issue is lack of funding for the post or that they cannot recruit.</p></speech>

I add my congratulations to Mr. Mickey Brady, MP, MLA, on his recent election to Parliament.  All statistics show an association between low income and ill health which is very much linked to lifestyle including higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity and much lower levels of physical activity.  While some take the view that low incomes make people smoke and drink more and go running less, it is controversial and others argue that these social determinants of ill health are multifactorial and are due to a number of factors including genetics, parental upbringing and the environment in which people grew up.  In some cases, they are explained by personality, and one can see major differences in health in the same family between people who were brought up in the same place by the same parents.  I do not subscribe to the view that correcting economic inequality will automatically improve public health.  While I accept that there is correlation between ill health and low income, the reasons are indirect and complex.</p> <p>  Regarding the new drugs strategy, I do not know if there are plans to do anything on an all-island basis and I will discuss it with the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, in the coming weeks and see if there is anything that would make sense in the area.  The same issues would apply as to other all-island strategies.</p> <p>  I have not had a chance to meet Mr. Simon Hamilton, MP, MLA, in his new role.  I met him when I was 18 or 19 when we were almost on the same Washington-Ireland programme.  I would be interested to meet him.  It is an interesting move from finance to health.  I have not seen a finance minister become a health minister before.  It is new precedent and it will be interesting to see how somebody whose job it was not to give out any money will be in a job where he will be hungry for money.  I wish him the best and look forward to meeting him, which I hope to do in two weeks&rsquo; time at the NSMC in Dublin and have a side meeting with him there.</p> <p>  There is probably not much of a case for cross-Border co-operation in hip and knee surgery.  Hips and knees are relatively straightforward, can be done in relatively small hospitals and do not require a critical mass or a very high level of specialisation.  The solution to making them happen is probably to increase the capacity in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital and outsource to the private hospitals in Dublin, which we intend to do, rather than sending people to Enniskillen or Belfast.  It is intended that anybody who has been waiting more than a year for a hip or knee operation will have it done by the end of the year.  It will be done through outsourcing, by and large.  One finds that although people say they have been on a waiting list for two or three years, when one checks the facts one finds that they are not.</p> <p>  I met some of the families from Donegal whose children have rare diseases.  Some of these diseases are not very rare, for example, while cystic fibrosis is technically a rare disease, it is not very rare.  The same goes for haemochromatosis and a few others.  Given that the diseases are all different, although many people are affected, they are all very different and cannot all be seen by one specialist in one specialist centre.  This is well understood.  There is a case for people from Donegal to attend in Derry or Belfast if the services are available and if they so wish, given that the journey from Donegal to Dublin this extremely long.  In some cases, the HSE pays for travel costs from Donegal, including flights in some cases, which is very expensive.  There is room for co-operation there.</p> <p>  The planning application for the national children's hospital will be made in the next few weeks, at long last.  The planning application will include the satellite centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght, which will be located at the fronts of the two existing hospitals.  Assuming, not supposing, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, grants permission, which usually takes approximately six months, we hope to have full planning permission by December or January, begin site works immediately and have the satellite centres and hospital well under construction by this time next year.  We hope to open the satellite centres in Tallaght an Blanchardstown first in 2017, which is not very far away, and the hospital on the main campus open in 2019 and fully commissioned by 2020.  It will happen, if we stick to the plan.  If we do not stick to the plan but return to the old debates about tri-location, co-location and where it should be located, we will be back to square one and I do not know how Temple Street or Crumlin will last.  It is intended that while there will not be in-patient beds at Tallaght or Blanchardstown, there will be 23-hour observation.  This means wards not currently used in Tallaght could be used for adult patients, however none of it has been planned our or thought through fully.  Tallaght needs additional capacity.</p> <p>  While it will be a national children's hospital, not every child in Ireland will have to go there.  There will still be excellent paediatric services in Cork, Galway and many other hospitals.  It will be a secondary hospital for the greater Dublin area and the only people who will attend from outside this area will be those who need to see a particular type of specialist.  Some of the specialties could be done on all-island basis.  Compared to the hundreds of thousands of children who will attend every year, the numbers who will need to travel from other parts of the country will be relatively small.</p></speech>

I was deeply honoured to be chosen as Ombudsman for Children after spending nearly 20 years working as a psychologist, the majority of it in the area of child protection, and a further two and a half years as director of investigations at the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  I received my warrant of appointment from the President in February of this year.  I welcome the opportunity to make my first appearance in my capacity as Ombudsman for Children at the joint committee to discuss the role and functions of my office.  As members are aware, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is an independent human rights institution that was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote and monitor the rights of children in Ireland.</p> <p>  My office has a unique combination of statutory functions.  The one that is perhaps most familiar to the committee is its function in examining and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children.  In carrying out this function, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children observes the fundamental principles of an ombudsman.  The office is independent and impartial.  It is neither an advocate for the complainant nor an adversary to the public body.  The office seeks at all times to promote the swift resolution of complaints at a local level, where possible.  It aims to achieve systemic change through its investigatory work by tackling the root causes of the complaints it receives.  The investigatory mandate set out in the 2002 Act also contains a number of distinct elements that are derived from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, namely the obligation to have regard to the best interests of the child and give due consideration to the wishes of the child when investigating a complaint.  My office has developed considerable expertise with respect to engaging directly with children, some of whom are very young, when examining the cases that come to it .  This aspect of accessibility has been identified by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child as an essential component to the work of a children's ombudsman.</p> <p>  In addition to examining and investigating complaints, into which I will go in more detail later, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is mandated to promote and monitor the rights of all children in Ireland.  The Oireachtas conferred a range of functions on the Ombudsman for Children under section 7 of the 2002 Act to carry out this complementary role.  These functions include advising the Government and the Oireachtas on law and policy affecting children; advising Government Ministers on the development and co-ordination of policy affecting children; promoting awareness of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including among young people; and engaging directly with children and young people to highlight issues relating to their rights that are of concern to children themselves.  As examples of these functions, the office provided advice to the Government on the recent Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill and is now reviewing the education admissions Bill.  In relation to engaging with children and young people, we have continued to build on our excellent programme for primary and post-primary school students.  We provided human rights workshops to almost 1,500 young people from 17 counties in 2013.</p> <p>  The various functions of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children inform and support each other.  Work undertaken in accordance with one particular statutory function may trigger complementary work under a different function.  Similarly, where there is an obstacle to tackling a children's rights issue &ndash; for example, due to an exclusion from the office's investigatory remit &ndash; we can use another function to address the problem.  In the case of St. Patrick's Institution, we engaged young people about how they found the place and the concerns they had.  This happened prior to July 2012, when the office had no investigatory remit.  My intention in setting out this example is to demonstrate that a broad mandate that blends different functions can offer a range of options to address children's rights issues.  This is a very important aspect of the strong and robust mandate that the Oireachtas has given the office.  Although the mandate is strong and robust, my office has identified areas in which the 2002 Act could be further strengthened.  In March 2012, the office submitted its first review of the operation of the 2002 Act to the Oireachtas, in accordance with its statutory function.  I am glad to report that many of the changes we sought in our review of the operation of the Act were achieved through the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.  A number of public bodies previously excluded from the investigatory remit of the office, such as the National Council for Special Education and the State Examinations Commission, became reviewable agencies.</p> <p>  Despite the changes made at that time, my office is still seeking to clarify the remit in relation to direct provision.  The joint committee is well acquainted with the need for an appropriate and independent means of handling complaints for protection applicants, including those currently residing in direct provision centres.  My office's long-standing position is that the current exclusion from its investigatory remit of the administration of the law regarding asylum and immigration relates only to decisions on status.  My office believes that everything else, including issues regarding accommodation, administration processes and internal complaint handling, are included in its remit.  The Department of Justice and Equality does not share this understanding, however.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has consistently recommended that the Oireachtas put the matter beyond doubt by legislating for protection applicants to have clear and unambiguous access to it.  This is also the view of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, which recommended in its recent report that "Children in the Direct Provision System should have the same rights as any other child in the state" and "for as long as the Direct Provision System remains in existence, that the jurisdiction of... the Ombudsman for Children be extended to include the Direct Provision System, the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) as well as the administration of the law relating to immigration and naturalisation".</p> <p>  I am also continuing to seek to have enhanced independence for my office.  At present, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children receives its funding through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In practical terms, the control of the budget of the office by the Department has not proven to be problematic.  However, it is inappropriate for an independent human rights institution to receive its funding through a public body it can investigate.  I believe the situation should be remedied by providing for the office's funding to come directly from the Oireachtas.  This recommendation was also made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2006 and will likely be made again in 2016.</p> <p>  My office saw a significant rise in the number of complaints received in 2013, with 16% more complaints received than in 2012 and a 28% increase since 2010.  The majority of complaints relate to education - 43% in 2013 - and a significant proportion of complaints received relate to family support, care and protection - 26% in 2013.</p><p>The vast majority of complaints - 75%  in 2013 - are brought by parents on behalf of their children.  Complaints received range in levels of complexity, and we maintain our focus on seeking to resolve each one within the local procedures mechanism and as quickly as possible.  However, when the issues raised are of a more complicated nature, they may be more difficult to resolve locally and could, therefore, require a full investigation to achieve a resolution.  Examples of issues we have investigated previously include the handling of child protection notifications by a social work area, access to education for children in care, resource allocation for children with special needs, and the admissions policy within a school.</p><p> As education is the focus of the majority of complaints to the office, I have looked especially closely at the issues and outcomes in this regard.  It is clear to me that the concerns we have raised over many years in regard to the complaints architecture within education are falling on deaf ears.  My office has urged successive Governments to commence Part V of the Teaching Council Act 2001 and section 28 of the Education Act 1998, both of which concern elements of the complaints structure that are not available to the general public.  Parents are entitled to expect to be able to complain about the professional conduct of teachers and to assume there is a standardised complaints system within all schools.  However, neither of those mechanisms is available to them at present.  While the Office of the Ombudsman for Children was set up with the expectation it would be one part of the complaints landscape in schools, it has de facto become the only element available to many parents.  That is not good enough.  I urge this committee to seek to have both of those missing elements brought into being as soon as possible.</p><p> While we work continuously to provide a high standard of service within our complaints and investigations team, the increasing volume and complexity of complaints is placing significant demands on our capacity to respond.  I take this opportunity to commend all my staff on their efforts in this regard and to acknowledge that it has put immense pressure on the whole office.  This has been exacerbated by the delay in returning to a full staff complement following a number of vacancies in the past six months.  I do expect all of the staffing proposals I made to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to be cleared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform very soon.  In the meantime, however, the delay is severely hampering my capacity to engage fully with the task at hand and makes the fulfilment of my statutory functions much more difficult.</p><p> I will outline a number of key areas of concern for me and my office as I begin my six-year term.  After many years of pushing by this office, it was satisfying to see the 31st amendment to the Constitution, which was passed in 2012, voted into law in April of this year.  This amendment provides that the best interests of a child should be the "paramount consideration" in all decisions relating to that child within the judicial system.  This is a huge step forward for us as a nation in terms of how we view children.  Specifically, it changes the way the State must take a child's best interest into consideration when making decisions relating to that child.  The commitment from the State that comes with this amendment gives me hope that we can secure a future for all our children where the public service in general will seek always to consider the best interest of children when decisions relating to them must be made.  In my former role as director of investigations, I found, at times, that individual children can be largely invisible and decision-making excessively bureaucratic and lacking in the necessary flexibility to meet the individual needs of children.  It is my aim to see a mainstreaming of the best interests principle as a positive obligation in all relevant legislation.</p><p> The current level of homelessness among children is distressing and is part of the fallout from the devastation wrought by the economic crisis.  Focus Ireland spoke on Tuesday last about receiving, in Dublin alone, 71 referrals in April for families who have been assessed as homeless.  This was double the number in April last year.  There are approximately 1,000 children in more than 400 families currently being housed in hotel type accommodations across this country because they have been made homeless by economic circumstances.  When I talk to people about life in such settings I hear such phrases as "not fit for family life", "inhibiting children's social development", "exerting pressure on the mental health of the adults", "interfering with the education of the children", and "hampering access to health services".  These families are the true victims of the economic crash and perhaps even the upturn, as many are homeless due to the rush of landlords to maximise rent on properties where they were formerly happy to receive rent supplement.  I hear of families experiencing rent increases three or four months in a row, so they are eventually forced to leave a property.  The use of hotel accommodation is a new phenomenon and the message should go out that this cannot be a long-term solution.  Even a few months in such close quarters, with limited facilities and at the whim of the commercial hotel market, can be detrimental to a young child.  This is an issue I plan to consider deeply in order to decide how best to bring the various powers of my office to bear to improve the lot of the children and young people involved.</p><p> I also intend to look more closely at the issue of youth mental health and examine what is being done to promote protective factors.  In particular, my objective is to determine what is being done to ensure all children who need a service to help them are being provided with an equal opportunity, regardless of location and socio-economic circumstances, to access the best available services quickly.  As a psychologist, I am acutely aware of the importance of early intervention when seeking to help children to recover from traumatic events such as sexual abuse, bereavement, separation or bullying.  I am also aware that in many cases, the services available to those children are extremely limited or non-existent.  When a child does receive an appointment, the service may be so stretched as to offer only a small number of sessions.  A child of 12 years of age who is contemplating suicide or showing signs of serious depression cannot afford to wait a year for an assessment, but that is currently the situation in one third of all cases.  Such a delay is extremely counterproductive and can make the journey to health much more difficult.  I have worked therapeutically with some extraordinarily brave young people who have amazed me with their ability to recover from even the most horrific trauma.  I see it as a crucial part of this State's duty to offer them the opportunity to recover as quickly as possible and in the most appropriate setting.  I welcome the opening up of a conversation in this country around mental health in general.  People, including children and young people, are starting to discuss the importance of staying well and seeking help when their mental health is not good.  It is crucial that when those children and young people take that brave step forward to seek help, the system is there to support them.  I will be determining how my office can play a role in ensuring that is the case.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention this morning.  I am very happy to address any queries members may have regarding any aspects of my role and functions as Ombudsman for Children.</p></speech>

He faced very stiff competition in applying for the position and I wish him luck in his role.  It is a welcome development to have him here before the committee to highlight the areas of major concern to him and to consider what we can do as legislators to assist him in performing his duties more effectively and efficiently.  When one looks back to the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, it was a significant development on the road to the promotion and safeguarding of the welfare of children.  Nothing stands still, of course, and we must seek continually to improve on the systems that are in place.  When we consider the percentage increase in the number of complaints, the need for that type of evolution is clear.</p> <p>  Given the importance of the work it is doing, I am concerned at Dr. Muldoon's indication that the office is understaffed.  The ombudsman expressed confidence that this issue will be addressed.  Will he indicate the timeframe in this regard?</p> <p>  Direct provision is a very serious issue.  What is Dr. Muldoon's view on the Health Information and Quality Authority having an oversight role in this area?  A report was published last week calling for independent oversight of the direct provision system given that one third of residents are children.  These children are no different from those living in family homes.  They are children of this State and it is vital that this is acknowledged.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children should have a role in safeguarding their well-being.  When one considers that we are spending &euro;20 million on an independent investigation into what happened at mother and baby homes, my concern is that if we do not address this issue now, future legislators will be sitting here and asking how we could have allowed the system of direct provision to continue.  I have no doubt that when it was introduced, it was never envisaged as a long-term solution.  Unfortunately, however, that is what it has become.</p> <p>  The number of children living in consistent poverty has doubled during the recession.  That is a national disgrace.  One hears about families living in hotels, families travelling to the airport because it is warm and families sleeping in cars.  Every Member has observed the increase in the number of people coming in on a weekly basis with housing issues.  Indeed, lack of housing accounts for the largest volume of representations to my constituency office.  Local authorities are unable to provide housing or intervene in the private market in the way they were able to in former years.</p><p> We all know that the longer children spend in poverty, the poorer their life chances are.  From an educational point of view children living in poverty do not perform to the same level as children not living in poverty.  I welcome the fact that this is a priority on the agenda of the Ombudsman for Children.  Will Dr. Muldoon comment on how we could support him in that role?  Obviously if the office is not adequately resourced it is a major issue.  Does Dr. Muldoon think there are any legislative changes we could bring about which may be supportive?</p><p> This is not something Dr. Muldoon touched on, but what is his opinion on the rights of a child to an identity?  This relates to promised legislation in the programme for Government to introduce the adoption (information and tracing) Bill.  I compliment Senator van Turnhout who has worked with my former party colleague, Senator Power, to bring forward legislation in this regard.  This is something I have highlighted myself.  It is so important to give a child the right to an identity and I would welcome Dr. Muldoon's views on the matter.</p><p> The Supreme Court judgment on the children's referendum from a month ago is welcome.  The fact that the matter has now been adjudicated on puts an onus on us as legislators to enact the enabling legislation.  I would welcome Dr. Muldoon's opinion on this.  We can have all the legislation we like.  We have enshrined the rights of children in our Constitution and the Supreme Court has adjudicated on it.  At the same time we have a critical lack of necessary resources.  The chief executive of Tusla has said that the organisation does not have the necessary resources even to stand still.  We have a situation where not all of our children in care have an allocated social worker.  We have had situations like those in Laois and Offaly where 1,000 files went unassessed for a period of time.  Organisations which promote and support children with a disability have had funding cut to the tune of &euro;86,000.  Funding for domestic abuse help services in my constituency has been 100% cut by Tusla.  These are real and serious issues and I would welcome Dr. Muldoon's views.</p><p> Dr. Muldoon stated he met representatives from Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  The same representatives made a fantastic presentation to this committee in the audio-visual room.  This is an area I have an interest and one where I have worked since I was a councillor in my constituency.  What I see at the moment is a very disjointed and unco-ordinated approach in the mental health system.  Many agencies and groups have been established to fill the shortfall by the State, for example, a group in Westmeath called Good2Talk.  Pieta House and Console are doing great work.  There are so many different organisations but they are totally unco-ordinated.  Does Dr. Muldoon not believe it would be better to have a national approach to this issue on the basis that it is a national crisis?  The number of our young people who are taking their own lives and suffering from depression and anxiety is alarming.  It should not be left to community and voluntary groups.  The approach should not be left unco-ordinated and disjointed.  We need a national plan to ensure a consistent roll-out in this area.  I would welcome the views of Dr. Muldoon on the matter.</p><p> Again, I wish Dr. Muldoon well.  Certainly, he has highlighted some of the areas that we can work on from a legislative point of view and we would be happy to do that.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Muldoon and thank him for his presentation.  I wish him well in his role.  I wish to pass on the apologies of my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  Unfortunately, questions to the Minister for Health are clashing with this meeting and he is on his feet in the Chamber as we speak.</p> <p>  Some of the points I wish to raise with Dr. Muldoon have already been touched on.  The first point I want to speak about is direct provision.  Dr. Muldoon said the Ombudsman for Children is mandated to promote and monitor rights of all children in Ireland.  I brought raised this important issue with the Minister on a number of occasions and asked whether he agreed he is the Minister with responsibility for all children on this island and, therefore, has a responsibility to investigate the many tragic deaths of children in direct provision and the precarious living conditions for those children.  Unfortunately, he sidestepped the question by passing it over to the Department of Justice and Equality.  What are the views of Dr. Muldoon on the matter?  Dr. Muldoon has also stated that despite changes made the office is still seeking to clarify the remit in respect of direct provision.  What is the process for that clarification?  What progress has been made?  Will a decision be made on the matter any time soon?</p> <p>  Has Dr. Muldoon ever had a complaint from someone in direct provision?  What would happen to such a complaint if it is not under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children?  I agree with Deputy Troy in that I believe this will be the next scandal to hit the State and if we do not do something and act on it now, then in 20 years' time we are going to have another inquiry similar to the mother and baby homes inquiry.  It is simply not acceptable.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to homelessness.  Colm O'Gorman of Amnesty International recently made the salient point post-marriage referendum that he hoped the wave of public awareness and support around the issue of equal rights would spill over to people fighting for a more equal Irish society.  Unfortunately, we have children who are homeless and living in poverty.  How many cases is the ombudsman currently adjudicating on relating to homeless children?  How does this bear out nationally?  Has the Ombudsman for Children made any decisions on these matters?  If the Ombudsman for Children makes a decision in this area, what implication does it have with regard to all the other homeless children?  The homeless children to which Dr. Muldoon adverted are living in hotels, but we have serious overcrowding as well whereby whole families are living in one room and children are sleeping on sofas.  That is another issue which, unfortunately, needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned staffing.  He said the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is understaffed currently and that this impacts on how the organisation can do its job.  Is the Ombudsman for Children currently under-funded and, if so, by how much?  Is the organisation in a position to be able to stand still currently or is it fighting against the wind?  Would the office have all the necessary resources to do the job if the staffing issues were resolved in the coming months?</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned that the majority of complaints are brought on behalf of children by their parents.  I gather that accounts for 75%.  What is the make-up of the other 25%?  How long does it take, roughly, to investigate a complaint?  I realise some are more complex than others but in the overall scheme of things does take long to actually investigate a complaint?</p> <p>  Several issues come through our constituency offices.  One that comes up on a regular basis relates to children who are waiting for assessments.  Parents come to us because of constant breaches of the Disability Act.  The Act provides that children should be seen within three months but often it is eight or nine months and the delay is getting even longer.  Given the increase in the number of caseloads for the office, does this mean it will get an increase in funding and staff to actually deal with them?</p><p>Dr. Muldoon referred to mental health and in that context to the suicidal 12-year old child who might have to wait a year to be allocated to or to see a social worker.  If someone made a complaint to Office of the Ombudsman for Children, how long would it take to make a decision on the case?  Would it be quicker than waiting to see a social worker?  I do not think I have any further questions so I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2694" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015052800002#E00200"><p>I welcome Dr. Muldoon who will find that we are exemplary as a committee on children's rights.  We very much work together on an all-party basis on many children's rights issues.  I hope he will find friends here.  The only thing we will do is urge him to go further and to highlight more.  It would be good for us to have more regular engagement in order for us to highlight issues.  Even the fact of having the meeting keeps children's rights on the agenda, which is really important.</p> <p>  I subscribe to the concern outlined by my colleagues at the delay in appointing staff.  I will ask the Chairman to discuss the committee writing to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to express our view that the appointments should be expedited.  Given the scarce resources in the office, we should ensure that at the very least the resources are in place.  There should not be unnecessary delays.</p> <p>  I will make a whistlestop tour of issues and then raise some broader issues.  I wish to raise direct provision.  I totally agree with what was said by my colleagues.  I very much believe that there should be an independent complaints mechanism and that the Office of the Ombudsman for Children needs to have that role in relation to children.  I very much endorse that position.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise is corporal punishment because it is in the news with the Council of Europe decision yesterday.  Yet again, Ireland is failing.  I put forward an amendment to the Children First Bill for us to remove the defence of reasonable chastisement.  It is a practical way forward.  It is not a case of us trying to encroach too much.  I do not think we could be accused too much of nanny stateism.  One hundred years ago one could beat one&rsquo;s wife, one&rsquo;s dog and one&rsquo;s child and we still allow children to be beaten.  I find that reprehensible that we allow that in our laws.  I know it is not being used in the courts, to the best of my understanding, but I take issue with the fact that we leave it in our laws.</p> <p>  Deputy Troy raised adoption information and tracing.  I welcome recommendation No. 38 of the Ombudsman for Children in his report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that he does not see a block to retrospective information and tracing.  I would very much welcome his voice on that.</p> <p>  Homeless children is another issue that was raised.  I do not believe it is just because of the recession.  We accommodated children who were homeless in bed and breakfast accommodation when we were at the height of the boom.  Again, it goes back to how we view children and families.  In the UK, it would not be acceptable to house a family in bed and breakfast accommodation and yet in this country we seem to deem it acceptable to inappropriately accommodate children in hotels currently and previously bed and breakfast accommodation but still on a bed and breakfast basis.  I very much endorse Dr. Muldoon&rsquo;s sentiments in that area.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise relates to gender recognition and recommendation No. 20 in the report.  Could Dr. Muldoon review his position on gender recognition?  He said it should be open to those aged under 16 but we have had some very good debates recently in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il on children in which we urged the Government to go further on its gender recognition Bill.  I cited the recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children but we should go further in light of the constitutional amendment on children now being part of the Constitution and the best interests of the child.  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon could examine the position in order to find a system for children so  that they can go to the schools of their choice.  Why do we send someone who identifies himself as a boy to a girl&rsquo;s school and make him wear a girl&rsquo;s uniform?  That is a real children&rsquo;s rights issue.  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon could review the position on gender recognition?</p> <p>  I very much support recommendation No. 13 on reducing the voting age to 16.  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon could again consider urging the Government to amend the position for voting in European and local elections.  That would not require a referendum.  It could be done by the Government at any stage.  Perhaps the issue could be examined.</p> <p>  Marriage age is another issue to consider.  Senator Bacik and I tabled a motion and we are working to bring forward legislation to make the marriage age in this country 18.  It is unacceptable that we have up to 30 marriages a year of children in Ireland.  Once we allow exemptions we are saying it is okay, and we are saying that to other countries.  What brought me to the issue was Boko Haram.  We wondered what we could do when we saw those children being kidnapped and I looked at our own laws and discovered that they allow exemptions.  That sends a message that it is okay in some cases to have child brides.  It is important that Ireland would make the marriage age 18 and be unequivocal about it.</p> <p>  Mental health is another important issue.  I am concerned that the child and adolescent mental health services remain outside the remit of the Child and Family Agency.  I would welcome progress in that regard.  Building on the point made by Deputy Troy, could Dr. Muldoon also consider the pathways for people to access the services?</p> <p>  More generally, I call for more engagement with the Oireachtas in regard to reports from the Ombudsman for Children.  It is sometimes frustrating for us when we see a report in the newspapers and we have had no prewarning of it or knowledge that it is coming out.  We would love to provide a voice of support.  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon could keep us informed when he is planning to release reports.</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon has immense experience in complaints and investigations.  In his presentation he said that children can be largely invisible.  I sometimes feel that about complaints and investigations.  We need to hear more of the voice of the child.  We hear very much about the perspective of the parents or the adults in the child&rsquo;s life.  Perhaps we could make progress in that regard.</p> <p>  My final question before I get cut off relates to Dr. Muldoon&rsquo;s appointment with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child the week after next.  He has all the recommendations in his report.  If he were to pick out two or three things for the committee that this country must immediately tackle, what could be done in the time available?  Whatever we say, the Government now has less than a year left in office.  What should we address before the Government is before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child?</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Muldoon very much for his very detailed presentation and for outlining the work he is doing.  He raised homelessness and children and the considerable pressures on local authorities at the moment.  It is an issue that must be tackled urgently.</p> <p>  I was involved in referring two cases to Dr. Muldoon&rsquo;s office.  I know they are under investigation.  I will assist in whatever way I can on the matters I referred to him, which relate to local authorities, children with disabilities and the role of access officers within local authorities.  There seems to be a huge misunderstanding within local authorities about the role of access officers.  The Disability Act clearly sets out the role of the access officer.  I have already spoken to the Disability Authority on the matter and suggested that it would be helpful for it to correspond with local authorities.  Access officers are there to help people with disabilities but it appears there is an interpretation in some local authorities that their only role is to talk about access to public buildings, which is a very strange interpretation.</p> <p>  I wish to refer briefly to the issues I raised.  They relate to cases of children with major disabilities, both physical and intellectual, who are living in local authority houses but the local authority prevents any alteration being done to a house even where it has been offered on a voluntary basis.  In one case an architect and team of builders agreed to carry out alterations to a house on a voluntary basis as a contribution from the local community but the local authority said it could not be done.  The houses in question require to be adapted to accommodate the children with serious disabilities.  There is a considerable variation between the waiting time in local authorities to get adaptation work done.  I understand the waiting time in the Louth County Council area is less than three months, whereas in my area it is six and a half years to seven years.</p><p>It is outrageous that this is happening.</p><p> When I recently met representatives from my local authority to discuss this matter, I inquired about the case of a person who had been on the waiting list for six and a half years.  The individual concerned was sent a letter in July 2008 in which it was stated the necessary work would be carried out.  Six and a half years later the work has still not been done.  The person concerned has serious physical and intellectual disabilities.  There is a second case with which I am dealing in which the scenario is similar.  When I raised it with the representatives from the local authority, they stated the person involved had only been on the waiting list for two and a half years.  There appears to be a culture that unless people are on the waiting list for five years, there is no point in them knocking on the door.  Local authorities must be made aware of the fact that they have an obligation to make provision for work to be carried out where it is required because the children to whom it relates are being deprived of basic services.  Even where people are offering to do the work on a voluntary basis, they are being prevented from doing so.  This matter must be given priority.  I fully accept what was said about homelessness and children and the fact that a huge number of families require housing.  However, we must also cater for those who have houses but which are unsuitable, which is the cause children do not have their needs met.  They are not being accommodated in the proper manner.  Account must be taken of this fact.  I have requested a meeting about this matter with Dr. Muldoon.  I look forward to that meeting, but in the interim it would be easy for his office to highlight for local authorities that this issue should be given priority during the remainder of 2015.</p><p> I again thank Dr. Muldoon for his presentation.</p></speech>

I am aware that Senator Colm Burke is very familiar with it, but perhaps I might outline the work done at the preliminary examination level.  </p> <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman is the last resort for people.  In the context of complaints about housing, in certain instances it is not as if the relevant experts and professionals - occupational therapists and physiotherapists - have not already made reports to the authorities responsible for housing.  I will speak in generalities in seeking to outline the process involved.  </p> <p>  When we receive complaints, we always try to promote the local resolution of the issues involved.  On the first example provided by the Senator, namely, where a family might be in a position to mitigate its own circumstances, local resolution is something we always promote.  The beauty and benefit of a local resolution process is that before a matter ever reaches the point where there is the need for an investigation, it provides space and flexibility in pushing the boundaries in terms of what can be done.  I am aware of cases involving the widening of doorways and other simple things in which this process can prove extremely useful.  I am not talking about building large extensions but about simple, practical improvements that can help families.  That has always been our approach.  Usually, we are not the first to advocate this approach, but we are generally doubling what someone else has stated.  In the context of eliminating poverty, some families are not able to mitigate their own circumstances and, as a result, there is an inequity.</p> <p>  On the case to which the Senator refers involving a delay of seven years, we have tried to adapt our processes.  When we make initial contact with local authorities, the push-back in respect of resources is obvious, but we move past this in order to ensure decisions made in these times of economic difficulty are both fair and equitable.  That has been our strategic aim.  Resources may be the first issue raised when we pursue a matter, but we tend to push straight beyond this in order to discover what common-sense and practical steps can be taken.  We always try to promote this approach.  However, the number of complaints we are receiving in respect of homelessness and delays is not comparable with the number we were receiving four or five years ago.  It is almost as if this is the end stage and people are now bringing matters to the attention of the Senator and other public representatives, as well as our office.  While the country might be on the up economically - we all hope that is the case - we are certainly reaching the end stage regarding complaints which people have tried to resolve locally and in respect of which they are at breaking point.  We share the Senator's concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2703" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015052800002#F00800"><p>I wish to provide a good example of some of the things which could work in those situations in the context of people's best interests.  We are obviously not in a position to examine the resource element of things, but let us consider circumstances where somebody has been on a waiting list for three years and the local authority is aware that the occupational therapist's report is only valid for three years.  Reports of that nature must be kept up to date in order that when money becomes available, work can proceed.  We are aware of cases in which the delay has been exacerbated by the fact that up-to-date reports had to be obtained.  It can take up to six months for a report to be forthcoming.  We are in a position to keep on top of administrative matters of this nature.  It is about seeking to ensure simple best practice and that the child remains at the centre of the process.  As Senator Colm Burke stated, there appears to be a culture that until people spend a certain amount of time on the waiting list, they have not earned the right to have their cases considered.  Communication does not occur on a regular basis.  We often come across cases in which, following the sending of the initial letter, say, in 2008, a second letter was not issued.  The culture in this regard must be changed in order that the child will be placed at the centre of the process.  If we do this by means of holding monthly or bi-monthly meetings, different solutions begin to be arrived at and local resolution becomes more likely.  That is why I emphasise the need to focus on best interest principles being legislated for and being used across all systems.  That is the real example which does not change the position on resources in the slightest, but it does create an energy within the culture of the system - in this case, the local authority - whereby the child becomes the focus.  We need to move towards that model much more quickly than we are doing.</p></speech>

In the first week or two after I took office, I sent a staffing proposal to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It has since been signed off on and forwarded to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am under the impression that the matter will be dealt with relatively quickly from here on in, but it has taken some time even to reach this point.  This is an example of where independence might have made a difference.  If I had control of the budget, I would have advertised six months ago as opposed to being obliged to wait for a further three months, when clearance had been received from the relevant Department, to finally appoint staff.  If we had budgetary independence, we would not be in this position.</p> <p>  In the context of what Deputy Sandra McLellan stated, we are maintaining our output as best we can.  Obviously, there has been a slowdown in the rate of our activity.  Assuming we can get people in place before September, I do not see a major loss of productivity on our side.  There will probably be some loss of productivity, but it will not be major.  From my point of view, this is what happens in organisations when an upturn occurs and people have the opportunity to change direction in their careers.  That is fantastic for them and casts the office in a great light because its staff are moving on to different jobs.  The point, however, is that, in the context of flexibility and speed, we are encountering difficulties in filling their positions.  If we had our own budget and the ability to hire people independently, it would make a huge difference.</p> <p>  Deputy Robert Troy referred to the doubling of the number of people living in constant poverty and the lack of housing.  Poverty has so many facets.  As I stated in my opening contribution, this is a matter on which I need to reflect in considering how best I might bring my powers to bear in dealing with homelessness and children.  When I have done so, I will return to the committee with suggestions as to changes which might prove useful.  There are so many strands to child poverty.  Obviously, housing and the availability of options are key once somebody becomes homeless.  There is also the aspect of prevention.  I mentioned the economic environment and the upturn for a particular reason.</p><p>There probably was a way of preventing those approximately 400 families with 1,000 children from becoming homeless, a way of going upstream and preventing them from having to leave their homes.  I am not going to give the committee an answer on an issue upon which I am not clear yet but it is certainly something that I will work on over the next number of months and bring back to the committee the next time I am here, if that is acceptable.  </p><p> A question was asked about the right of a child to his or her identity.  We are on the record as being clear that this is an issue which is very important.  The right to one's own identity is a human right and we have recommended that consistently over time.  There has been no change in that regard and I commend the Senator on bringing forward the relevant legislation.</p><p> Regarding the referendum on children's rights, one of the recommendations we will be making to the UN CRC is that adequate resources are made available to Tusla.  We were one of the first to call for the responsibility for child protection and welfare to be moved out of the HSE because it was getting lost in that huge monolith.  The setting up of Tusla was hugely important as far as the Ombudsman for Children's office is concerned.  The same is true of the setting up of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Now that we have a focus on children, we need to provide adequate resources, although I am not sure what the correct amount actually is.  While resources are an important element, there are also systems problems that need to be fixed.  There are areas where there is a lack of co-ordination and consistency across the country.  The last time we appeared before this committee we brought forward a meta-analysis relating to children in care.  We spoke about issues like the standardisation of reports and social work supervision, for example, as well as the need for co-operation between agencies.  These are consistent themes and the problems seem to be harder to fix than was the case in the past.  As Tusla finds its feet, it is very important that it is supported and that the required systems are put in place.  Obviously we are very concerned about recent reports regarding Laois-Offaly.  The issues raised by those reports have been raised by us previously.  </p><p> One of the issues we have highlighted with Tusla directly is our concern around the numbers of children who are referred for suspected abuse and who undergo an assessment.  The target is that such children would see somebody within 21 days of a referral.  However, the figures from quarter three of last year show that only 21% of such children were seen in that timeframe, which leaves a lot of children in a very vulnerable position.  That is an issue of major concern for us and is something which can be improved upon through systems changes.  </p><p> On the issue of youth mental health services, the phrase "disjointed and un-co-ordinated" was used, which is a good description of some parts of it.  Senator van Turnhout spoke about access to the system and the pathways being difficult.  She referenced a number of voluntary services, including Console, Pieta House, It's Good 2 Talk and so forth which are certainly making a huge difference and are the community's answer to a real problem.  As I said in my report, local communities and society in general, to their great credit, are starting to open up the discussion around mental health.  The more we do that, the better.  There are also national offices working in this area, including the National Suicide Prevention Office and the national mental health division within the HSE.  I hope that the latter will make a difference in the co-ordination of the work.  It should not be the case that primary services are provided through the voluntary sector.  While organisations such as Pieta House and others do great work, they are picking up the slack for services that should be provided by the State.  </p><p> Our report, entitled A Word from the Wise, gives a very clear description of the problems in the area of mental health.  One of our complainants, a young girl, was admitted to an adult mental health facility after two suicide attempts.  She said: "I was being watched 24/7... I couldn't shower or go to the toilet by myself... I felt I was let down... I needed help and it wasn't there."  This child tried to commit suicide twice but the best we could offer her was somebody to watch her so that she did not commit suicide in the adult ward.  She was not provided with care, therapy or education, which should not be allowed.  She went on to say: "I had a terrible experience and other teenagers shouldn't have to go through it."  The most valuable point she makes is the following: "I have a lot to say for myself in the world and about the world.  I just wish the right people had listened at the right time."  We really need to be listening to the people who are suffering and to adjust the system accordingly.  It cannot be just about resources; much of it is about how we do things and how we provide services.  If we put the best interests of the child first, we would probably set things up differently.  Youth mental health is an area around which I will be pushing very strongly.</p><p> I hope I have covered all of the issues raised.</p></speech>

I am very hopeful that the working group will make a difference.  The Minister for Justice and Equality showed herself to be very strong on children's rights when she was Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  She made the very important change with regard to St. Patrick's Institution and taking 16 and 17 year olds out of the adult prison system.  That change affected 60 or 70 young people whereas direct provision affects between 1,500 and 1,600 young people.  It makes sense that we would have oversight of the system and, indeed, other Oireachtas committees have argued for that too.  I hope that the time has come for us to say that we cannot stand over a system that was set up initially as a stop-gap.  It was set up, if I remember correctly, because there were issues at Rosslare.  A hotel was available and new immigrants were housed there.  That seemed to work for a while but then we ended up creating a system in which people have been left in such accommodation, in some cases, for almost 15 years.  It is not tenable and as has been said by the other Oireachtas committee, it is not fit for purpose.  When that report was being launched, I sat and listened to the parents who were living in direct provision accommodation.  One parent spoke of having a birthday party for her ten year old son the previous day.  He was born in the direct provision system and has had ten birthdays in that environment, with no option to develop friendships or to invite people home to his place.  His family has lived for ten years with no privacy.  The HIQA report published last week highlighted the damage that can be done under the direct provision system.  It showed that child protection issues are more prevalent within the system.  It is time to reconsider the entire system and it is certainly time to increase my office's oversight of direct provision.</p></speech>

We deal with them as best we can.  We have a working relationship with the Department of Justice and Equality and while the Department does not believe that direct provision is within our remit, it does work with us and co-operate.  We have had complaints relating to child protection concerns, food and other issues.  The number has been small because we have not been able to promote ourselves within the direct provision system.  Furthermore, as we all know, those within the direct provision system often have difficulties coming forward in case it impacts on their rights and their asylum applications.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Walsh, to give some examples to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2713" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;raic Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015052800002#G00800"><p>It is a good example of how our threshold works, in terms of what we might look at.  We have had complaints about living conditions, diet, access to education and so forth but because the complainants are in direct provision, their environment is unique.  It is not the same as someone raising a complaint to mum or dad at home and having that space to do so.  We would always try to engage early in such cases and make sure the complaints are dealt with at a local level.  To date, the issues have been addressed but these would not be matters that we would see as heading towards an investigation.</p> <p>  Other issues of a more serious nature would relate to child protection and how concerns in that regard are dealt with.  Irrespective of any view held about our remit, we would see us as having an absolute remit in that regard and being involved in such cases, regardless of whether there is Tusla, or formerly the HSE, involvement.  That would not have been the intention of the good people of the Legislature when they drafted our governing Act in 2002 in terms of what actions would be excluded.</p><p>It relates to the administration of law regarding naturalisation and citizenship, but it would not relate to child protection or welfare.  That is not the intended outcome.  If one takes a purposive approach to what was meant, that is the space we are working in as regards the legislation.  We continue to push at that but, as Dr. Muldoon stated, there is a barrier.  There is a definite need for signposting.  </p><p> One question referred to parents being natural advocates and asked for further details.  In some circumstances there is a natural barrier, concern or impediment to bringing complaints forward for fear of affecting decisions.  Not only should there be clarity in terms of the remit, but we need to take on some work to make sure people feel able to bring complaints and concerns to our attention.</p></speech>

It is time to remove the defence of reasonable chastisement.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs said yesterday that he would prohibit corporal punishment within all State care scenarios.  If corporal punishment is banned for children in State care but it is still okay to allow the defence within the home, such a position would be untenable.  We would encourage the removal of that defence.</p> <p>  I refer to adoption information.  The recommendation was that the State should bring forward legislative proposals regarding information and tracing and ensure that they respect fully the rights of the adopted person.  In addition, the Adoption Act 2010 should be further amended to provide for more open forms of adoption and a statutory basis for post-adoption services.  The right to know one's background and parentage is crucial.  </p> <p>  On gender recognition, Senator van Turnhout suggested we consider the recommendation that a 16 year old would be able to have the right to his or her own gender identification.</p></speech>

We have advised that the State hold a referendum on lowering the voting age.  It was recommended by the Constitutional Convention.  The idea that it could be done within the Legislature for EU and local elections is something that could be considered.  </p> <p>  On the marriage age, it is international best practice and the recommendation is that 18 years of age is the way forward.  I do not have the numbers.  I understand there is a process whereby those under 18 years of age can apply to the Circuit Court.  I will examine the issue.</p></speech>

She also mentioned CAMHS.  From our point of view, there has been a disjointed approach, as well as a lack of co-ordination and co-operation.  We are conducting a number of investigations in this area and have found that CAMHS in different areas do not refer children or accept referrals from each other.  I do not mind who the parent body is; if the system works correctly, that is fine.  I do not think any child minds who pays the bills, as long as CAMHS work together and the system operates properly.  It is to be hoped the mental health division will make a difference in that regard.  However, there is a serious difficulty with the pathways to access these schemes.  One of the recommendations in our report to the UN is the need for an equivalent child therapeutic service for children as the national counselling service for adults, which is free and accessible within an hour of each person.  That is something that is long overdue and it would make a major difference.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about reporting to the Oireachtas.  It is something I will look into and I will check the timings.  I hope the committee has received the reports in a timely manner.  She discussed the need for the voice of the child to be heard within complaints and investigations.  From our point of view, we are legislated to listen to the voice of the child in every complaint we take.  The majority of complaints, as the committee can imagine, come from parents, and rightly so because they have to navigate the system.  </p> <p>  Every time we receive a complaint we consider meeting the child directly, and in many of our investigations we will do so.  In a number of investigations we have quoted young people in that regard.  It is something we monitor at all times in terms of whether we are keeping true to our voice and listening to the voice of the child.  That is part of the reason we included children's voices in our booklet, A Word from the Wise, for the UN.  It something we keep under review and keep trying to improve on.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the UN CRC priorities.  I am currently working on my priorities.  I do not want to pre-empt them.</p></speech>

So much has happened regarding children over many years in this country.  He has touched on a few of the positive things that have happened in the past few years, of which the establishment of Tusla has been one.  We would like to see more of him and I ask him to keep in touch more regularly.  As Senator van Turnhout said, we are a very good committee and speak about many issues concerning children.</p> <p>  In the next few weeks the committee will visit Oberstown.  The term "resources" has been mentioned a few times today.  It is something we need to consider.  I am a member of a Government party.  We need to apply a serious amount of pressure in order to ensure that we get a substantial amount of funding, in particular now that Dr. Muldoon is developing a list of his priorities.  That, along with the necessary funding, is very important.  We have a job to do to ensure that he gets sufficient money to carry out his list of priorities.</p></speech>

The presentation stated 43% of complaints related to education.</p><p>Is Dr. Muldoon saying that should be put back into the education sphere in order that the office can focus on family support, care and protection of children, or is he saying he is quite happy to send on the complaints if he had that infrastructure in place in the Department of Education and Skills to deal with complaints from parents?</p></speech>

I am saying that the system, as it was envisaged, was a tripod, whereby the Teaching Council would look after anything in regard to the professional conduct of teachers and the section 28 provision would allow for a consistent complaints system across the education system.  Neither of those is in place, which means we are dealing with 3,000 different types of complaints systems given that each school can do it whichever way its wants and then those issues come to our desks.  We would expect that if that those other elements - the other parts of the architecture - were in place, the numbers that would come to us would be fewer and that when they did come to us, they would have come through a different system and there would have been more opportunity to have a local resolution in that regard also.  We are trying to encourage that a proper fully-rounded complaints system is available to parents.</p></speech>

I will visit people who have been in that situation and listen to what they have to say.  As the Deputy will know from the quotation I gave to earlier, there are powerful stories to be told.  Many people in the youth area such as those involved in Jigsaw, Headstrong and some of the voluntary groups have already done much of this work.  I will gather the information rather than telling the Deputy exactly what I will do and in what areas I will do it.  One area we need to examine is going upstream and helping young people to maintain a healthy approach to their mental health while they can.  We need to consider some provision in primary schools and post-primary schools where the conversation has not started to open up about seeking help when a problem arises.  We also need to encourage the positive protective factors.  That is something I would be very interested in examining.  I am not quite sure what shape that will take as yet.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the education admissions Bill.  There are number of positive areas in that respect.  The section 29 independent appeals provision has been retained in it.  We have concerns around the derogation in regard to past pupils, which we have aired previously.  That can be a soft barrier for many children who arrive in an area and their parents have not been in school in a certain area, or some children may not have been to a post-primary school.  That is something about which we have had a concern and those are the areas we are examining.  I hope to have advice on that for the Minister for Education and Skills soon.</p></speech>

As far as I can tell, the children (amendment) Bill will provide for that last move and the young people currently in Wheatfield will move out there.  Oberstown is certainly a step forward because it is focused in a different way.  It is not seen solely as custodial.  There is education provision, therapeutic services and access to psychiatric services and there is also the ability there to change a child's life.  That is what we are looking for, namely, that opportunity for life to change.  They will not all take it.  Some will stay on the path they are on, but the opportunity and the availability of different options is there.</p> <p>  We would also be eager to build on trying to keep young people out of Oberstown.  The concept of last resort is what Oberstown should be, so the judge should be looking at the Garda diversion programmes.  That is something which has not got enough credit.  Much good work is being done in those situations where children are being prevented from taking that final step.  We have tried to find different ways to do that and they have worked very well.  We want to make sure that we do not use Oberstown for every single opportunity there is involving a young person who has committed a crime.  From our point of view, Oberstown is a huge step forward.  I have been there a number of times since they started building last year.  I have linked in with the campus director.  Our staff have been out there during the induction of new staff.  They have told them about our complaints system and how we work.  That is a very big step forward and I hope we will build on it.  There will probably be another intake soon.  The idea that we are a presence out there is something I want to make sure we build on.  That means young people, the parents and the staff know that if something goes wrong and they have not been suitably looked after, we are available to them.  That is crucial and it is something that was very difficult  within the prison system, but it has been taken on much more within Oberstown.  I look forward to that being something we can build on.</p></speech>

There is still concern about children and adolescents being treated in adult mental health services.  Considerable improvement has been made there.  The number has decreased from more than 300 but there were still approximately 90 there last year.</p></speech>

I know there are problems in regard to the three locations of Dublin Cork and Galway.  A child from Donegal who has to be admitted will have to travel to Galway and their parents will have to travel to Galway to be with them.  There are problems around that and I do not know how we can get over it.  The number of child psychiatric beds has increased threefold during the past ten years.  Despite the commitment to eliminate that practice, children are still being treated in adult wards in the adult mental health services.  That is inappropariate for any child and even one child being treated there is one too many.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2739" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015052800002#J01100"><p>Absolutely.  I would not disagree with any of that.  The figures I have in front of me indicate that were 290 admissions last year, of which 89 were to adult wards.  That is shocking.  I have been in adult wards on a number of occasions under various guises.  It is scary to be there when one is healthy and one knows one will be leaving it.  However, if one is a young person who has already attempted suicide, or is close to that, and is left in that scenario where people are so scared around one that they follow and special one, that is a very distressing situation, which makes it all the more difficult for one to recover.  Certainly it is something that is inappropriate.</p> <p>  The commitment was made in 2011 that this would not happen and every report now goes to the Mental Health Commission.  We are way behind on that.  One of the things I would hope we can do is reduce the number who need it.  That is probably the best thing to do so that people do not get that far.  Young Cait, whose name is included in the report to which I referred, was on her second suicide attempt before she ended up in a ward.  What happened after her first suicide attempt?  Why are we not doing something to prevent a second suicide attempt from happening?  We have had complaints from a young person who had made ten or 12 suicide attempts and then was brought into a ward.  What are we doing prior to that to prevent those young people having to get to a ward?  Examining that area would be the best way forward.  The commitment to creating extra beds is one part of it, but if we find ourselves in a situation where young people are in adult wards - that is totally unaccountable - we need to consider if a better service can be provided while they are in those wards and if the time spent in them can be reduced.</p> <p>  Instead of only specialing young people, we need to consider can we special them and bring them out to therapy.  In that way the time spent there in such a ward would not be dead time.  The time spent there now is literally lost time.  If a young person of 16 years of age is in an adult ward for two months, that young person will not have recovered.  All they have done is stayed alive and then they might be brought to a ward where they can be helped.  Why are those two months spent in the ward now being lost?  There are things that can be improved upon.  It is not all about resources because the money that is spent on specialing a young person would facilitate the creating of many resources.  Much work can be done and it is something on which I will focus.</p></speech>

It is a major issue but if one lives in a private house, one accesses that grant differently.  One submits the application and one will receive the adaptation grant within a number of months.  However, a person living in a local authority house on submitting an application will have to wait ten years for an adaptation grant.  Therefore, all children are not being treated equally.  What is required may need a policy or legislative change, but it would be useful and if Dr. Muldoon examined that and wrote to the local authorities about it.  I wrote to the Minister previously about this and pointed that out.</p><p>I put it to him that all the grant applications should be treated the same.  If a person lives in a local authority house and goes to the local authority if they need to get an adaptation, the local authority stamps it but it does not come out of the same fund.  It comes out of different funds.  Children are not being treated equally.  Children with the same disabilities living in two separate scenarios are being treated differently, which is extremely important.</p></speech>

In Cork, they will deal with bulimia and anorexia but will not deal with other complex issues.  The message that sends to a child, which Dr. Muldoon would understand even more than I would, is that the child is so out of control that they cannot deal with them and will send them to another bed.  This is unacceptable.  These beds are there for children and adolescent mental health.  Places are self-selecting what they will deal with.  I do not find this acceptable.</p></speech>

Our second session this morning is a landmark session as it is an opportunity for committee members to engage with representatives of the deafblind community in Ireland who are making the case for the recognition of deafblindness as a distinct disability.</p><p>I welcome the guests in the Visitors Gallery.  They are accompanied by a signer so the proceedings will be accessible to them.  The broadcast of this meeting will also be signed.  It will be the first public broadcast from the Oireachtas that is accessible to the deafblind community.  I welcome all the guests this morning, particularly Mr. Liam O'Halloran, Dr. Derek Lacey, who is sitting behind the witnesses, and Dr. Paul Kenna, an expert on research into Usher syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa.  Apologies have been received from Dr. David Keegan, who could not join us this morning because he is involved in surgery.<br/><br/>I welcome Ms Laura English, the service development officer with the Anne Sullivan Centre for Deafblind, Dr. Sandra Cummings from the Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists, Ms Carol Brill, an advocate on behalf of the deafblindness community, and Orla Pearson, who is helping to ensure Ms Brill's technology is working for her.  I ask the witnesses to make their case.  I will allow a little leeway with time.  I ask the members to speak very distinctly so they can be heard.<br/><br/>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I call on Ms English to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

For the purpose of clarity, according to the widely accepted definition across Europe, a person is regarded as deafblind if his or her combination of vision and hearing loss causes difficulty with access to information, communication and mobility.  The disability is also referred to as dual sensory impairment or dual sensory loss, and these alternative terms may be used throughout the course of this meeting.</p> <p>  Hearing and vision impairments create barriers to communication that can isolate people and jeopardise independence and well-being.  When vision and hearing losses combine, a person's ability to overcome these barriers becomes even further limited because one sense cannot adequately compensate for the loss of the other.  Deafblindness is not, therefore, deafness plus blindness; rather, it is a separate and unique disability that affects overall development, socialisation and communication.  One plus one equals three.</p> <p>  The Anne Sullivan Centre was established in the late 1980s by a group of pioneering parents whose children were born deaf and blind as a result of congenital rubella syndrome.  I am thankful that the State's commitment to ensuring the availability of the MMR vaccine has almost eliminated the incidence of rubella syndrome in Ireland.  Currently, however, there are more than 80 different causes of deafblindness, including hereditary and chromosomal conditions, prenatal congenital complications, postnatal non-congenital complications and older age.</p> <p>  Deafblindness is a growing concern.  Research has shown that the proportion of the population who experience a combination of vision and hearing loss is expected to rise dramatically as a result of the ageing demographic and increased survival rate for infants with severe disabilities. </p> <p>  In July of last year, I conducted research into deafblindness in Ireland with the assistance of a number of co-operating organisations.  As part of the investigation, I requested a cross-tabulation of data from the Central Statistics Office.  The data revealed that 1,749 people reported having a combination of blindness or serious vision impairment and deafness or a serious hearing impairment in the 2011 census.  An additional 8,616 reported dual sensory impairment with one or more additional disabilities, bringing the total number of those affected to 10,365.</p> <p>  In 2001, the United Kingdom introduced for all local authorities Care and Support for Deafblind Adults and Children Policy Guidance.  It recognised deafblindness as a distinct disability and required each local authority to record all people who are deafblind in their catchment area.  It also instructed local authorities to appoint a senior level member of staff to take overall responsibility for ensuring that people who are deafblind receive an assessment of need and have access to appropriate services.  Three years later, Irish MEPs joined their European counterparts in signing Written Declaration 2004/1, urging all members to recognise deafblindness as a distinct disability and acknowledge that having a distinct disability, deafblind people need specific support provided by people with specialist knowledge.  This is a sentiment echoed by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006, which was adopted in full just last week by the European Parliament.  It makes a clear distinction in Article 24 between people who are deaf, people who are blind and people who are deafblind. </p> <p>  Towards 2016 outlines a new and innovative approach to social policy.  It focuses on the adoption of the life cycle approach, which places the individual at the centre of policy development and delivery at key stages in his or her life.  The new directions policy and the congregated settings Bill also promote a person-centred approach to disability services that emphasises the need to ensure people with disabilities are supported to be active members of their communities.  Despite this, fewer than half of the 100 deafblind people who participated in survey research with me reported they were engaged with support services.  Those who were receiving services were predominately adults in full-time residential care who had additional disabilities, and children and young people in mainstream or special education.</p> <p>  Working age and older-age people living in the community or with the support of family were undoubtedly under-represented because of the difficulties associated with identification.  Those who did participate in the research or who have since contacted our outreach service for support report having limited, if any, access to services.</p> <p>  Recognition of deafblindness as a distinct disability is essential throughout the life cycle.  Children with a combination of vision and hearing loss require specialist education provided by people with expert knowledge of the disability.  Opportunities for training, education and employment need to be made available to people who are deafblind, based on their unique dual sensory disability as opposed to the severity of a primary disability, as is currently the case.</p> <p>  People who acquire deafblindness later in life need clearly defined pathways to care that allow them to manage and adjust to their loss of vision and hearing and continue to participate actively in society.  The majority of the over 10,000-strong deafblind population in Ireland rely entirely on services for the deaf and the blind.  In effect, this means that people who are deafblind are divided into parts for support and assistance, without a dedicated professional to co-ordinate the diverse range of services currently available.  Difficulties with access to information further limit a deafblind person's ability to access services.</p><p>In this regard, I commend and sincerely thank the Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and his colleagues in the broadcasting unit who worked tirelessly in recent weeks to ensure that today's proceedings were accessible to members of the deafblind community.  The lengths to which they have been required to go to ensure that people who are deafblind are afforded the same opportunity to access parliamentary proceedings as other citizens of the State who do not have a disability are indicative of the challenges that the community faces.  It should not go unmentioned that the Members present are involved in making history today as members of a parliamentary committee whose questions and comments will be accessible to the deaf community through sign language for the first time in the history of the State.</p><p> As advocates and members of the deafblind community, we urge the committee to recognise deafblindness as a distinct disability in Ireland.  We ask the Government to acknowledge the need for dedicated professionals to be appointed to support those affected, to collect accurate data on the number of people who are deafblind and to co-ordinate the services that are currently available.  If a person is profoundly deaf and totally blind, his or her experience of the world extends only as far as fingertips can reach.  Such people are effectively alone if no one is touching them.  To them, the members are invisible.  A dhaoine uaisle, we would like a commitment from members today that, to them, these people are not invisible.

I am an audiological scientist at the Beacon Hospital and I represent the Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists.  As my colleague has mentioned, deafblindness is a singular impairment that can present concomitantly different degrees of vision and hearing loss.  Recognising deafblindness as a singular impairment has a number of advantages for the patients involved as well as the clinicians whom I represent.</p> <p>  First, recognition is vital in terms of developing a care pathway for individuals with a bimodal disability or deafblindness.  A care pathway is defined as "a complex intervention for the mutual decision-making and organisation of care processes for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period".  The defining characteristics of a care pathway include an explicit statement of the goals and key elements of care based on evidence, best practice and patients' expectations and characteristics; the facilitation of communication among the team members and with patients and families; the co-ordination of the care process by co-ordinating the roles and sequencing the activities of the multidisciplinary care team, the patients and their relatives; the documentation, monitoring and evaluation of variances and outcomes; and the identification of the appropriate resources.  Only once deafblindness is recognised as a disability can a care pathway be developed and implemented.  The aim of a care pathway is, therefore, to enhance the quality of care across the continuum by improving risk-adjusted patient outcomes, providing patient safety, increasing patient satisfaction and optimising the use of resources.</p> <p>  Second, early and correct management of deafblind individuals is the responsibility of many professions and specialties.  Otolaryngologists, audiologists and ophthalmologists as well as other specialists from the rehabilitation teams should co-operate closely to achieve the best results.  From an audiological perspective, the liaison with the ophthalmology representation is particularly important when considering appropriate rehabilitation of the hearing impairment.  It is important that the audiologist be made fully aware of the deteriorating visual acuity, as this has important implications regarding the decision of when to refer for a cochlear implant should the vision be deteriorating quicker than the decline in auditory acuity.  Therefore, decisions on when to provide traditional amplification or when to refer for cochlear implantation should depend on the ongoing assessment of the multidisciplinary team.</p> <p>  Third, the recognition of deafblindness will allow for support at a national health care and remuneration level, particularly in terms of aids and appliances submissions and assessment of need submissions.  This has particular relevance for hearing aid and cochlear implant assistive technology like FM systems, sound field systems or any assistive technology that enhances the deafblind individual's communicative needs.</p> <p>  Fourth, the appropriate training of professionals who specialise in the rehabilitation and support of the deafblind will be implemented and facilitated by having deafblindness recognised as a singular impairment.</p> <p>  Deafblind people need specific means of communication to have access to education, career opportunities, leisure and social life.  Knowledge about the communication abilities and difficulties that a deafblind person has can guide public policies to create measures aimed at improving access to communication and information and, therefore, independence of deafblind people.</p></speech>

Please imagine that there is a power cut in this room.  All the lights go out.  The microphones do not work.  The Acting Chairman would call a recess to this meeting until power resumed.  Members sit here in darkness and silence.  They are unable to see people's facial expressions or movements and they struggle to hear what others in the room are saying.  Now, please imagine being at a hospital appointment in this dark and silent world.  That is the reality for people with dual sensory loss.</p> <p>  When I look at my colleague, Ms English, beside me, I can only see her eye.  I cannot even see my hand.  Without the support of my stenographer, I rely on lip-reading and my hearing aids.  My sight and hearing are deteriorating because of Usher syndrome, a rare genetic disease that, after old age, is the most common cause of combined deafness and blindness.  There is no treatment or cure.  I have little hope of seeing my daughter's first communion next year.  I have been told that hearing aids will be no use to me within the next ten years.  This is what I am facing as an unemployed single parent to my seven year old daughter, Sara.</p> <p>  Since the age of four years, I have worn hearing aids.  Recently, I received extremely high-tech hearing aids that allowed me to hear this world properly for the first time in all of my life.  These hearing aids allow me to feel safer as I go out in Dublin when I need to be aware of the dangers, such as the quiet Luas and electric cars that I may not see coming near me.  Sadly, they are unavailable to me on the medical card scheme because the hearing aids available through it fall far short of my audiological needs.</p> <p>  I struggled to find an audiologist who fully understood my needs as a person with dual sensory loss.  Now in my 40s, I have luckily found an audiologist in the commercial sector.  I know that not all people who are deafblind have this experience or can afford it.</p> <p>  At the age of 11 years, my parents were told by an eye specialist that I was going blind and that it would be best to send me to the boarding school for blind girls.  Thankfully, they did not listen and were determined that I continue in mainstream schooling.</p><p>Throughout my teenage years I struggled with my sight and hearing, unaware of my diagnosis.  When I was 21, I found out my diagnosis, that I would go blind due to retinitis pigmentosa.  Unfortunately, despite all of the consultations and investigations by various medical professionals throughout my younger years, no link was ever made between my hearing loss and sight loss and no one ever mentioned Usher syndrome.</p><p> I persisted with my own research and during a visit to America I met a researcher who was able to tell me that most likely I had Usher syndrome type 2.  Only this month, at the age of 45, I have been genetically diagnosed with Usher syndrome type 2a.  This genetic diagnosis was only possible through the relationships I have forged with many of the international researchers working in the field.  I could not avail of the services of the National Centre for Medical Genetics because it did not have the resources to undertake genetic testing of my disease.</p><p> All through my life, I have attended the eye specialist about my sight and an audiologist about my hearing.  I do not have a professional monitoring the progression of my Usher syndrome.  I have no one to help to predict and plan for the ongoing deterioration and the adjustments I need to make to continue as an active, contributing citizen and, above all, a mother.  The Disability Act 2005 entitles children born after 2002 to have their health and education needs assessed and receive a statement on the services available to them.  I remain excluded by this Act.  There are no statutory guidelines in place for people like me.  The life cycle approach advocated for in the policy Towards 2016 has been absent from my experience.  As a working age adult who would love nothing more than to work, I am invisible.</p><p> My mantra in life is, "Do not focus on the problem, find the solution."  I have researched audio equipment in order that I can continue to communicate with people via text and e-mail when my sight goes completely.  I have explored the options of cane training, guide dog assistance, braille and sign language.  All of the planning needed to meet my communication and mobility needs has come from my own initiative.  It has not been easy using my own initiative.  When faced with the prospect of losing my vision and hearing, sometimes it is easier to stay curled up in a duvet and avoid facing the world.  I am lucky; I have my daughter to keep me strong, but not all deafblind people are as lucky as I am.  The truth is that, despite all of my research, I am no clearer about whether I will be able to access basic health and social care services.  I honestly do not know how I will make my way in this world for the rest of my life.  In a place that proclaims to cherish all citizens equally, I feel invisible.  There is no dedicated entry on the national physical and sensory disability database where my needs should be recorded.  There is not a single case worker putting my needs and those of other dual sensory impaired people at the top of their priorities.</p><p> I see two possible trajectories for my life.  My future is that the degeneration of my condition will make it difficult for me to be the great parent I want to be to my daughter.  Already, finding employment is extremely difficult and I worry about becoming a prisoner in my own home for the rest of my life.  I do not want my daughter to witness this.  The other possible future is that, with the necessary supports, I will continue to parent effectively, continue to learn, grow and develop as a person and contribute my learning, knowledge and experience to others and society.  I have a passionate belief in my own responsibility to do all that I can to make that second, brighter future possible, but I also recognise that our elected legislators play a vital role in shaping the world in which we live, move, hear and see.  They have it in their gift to improve the health and social structures over which we often stumble.  Those of us with deafblindness are not invisible.  I ask committee members in earnest to positively consider our request to have deafblindness recognised as a unique disability.  Please open the doors that will allow us to live and fully participate in this beautiful world alongside them.  I am most grateful for their time and attention.</p></speech>

I also thank those who have journeyed with them in support and are sitting in the Visitors Gallery where I hope they are comfortable.</p> <p>  There is no question that the contributions of Ms Brill, Ms English and Dr. Cummings have challenged us all as members and touched us all as human beings.  I commend all of the contributions but Ms Brill's will be an abiding memory for me after today.  They have touched not only our hearts but will also have touched all those watching.  This is an historic opportunity and should be part of the broadcasting of the work of Parliament every day.  Perhaps the ability to reach out to people challenged by blindness, deafness and, in this instance, deafblindness, is something we have not achieved.  A clear distinction needs to be made in order that we will recognise that there are three very different circumstances to be addressed.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions and perhaps an observation or two to make.  I thank Ms English for her opening remarks and commend the work of the Anne Sullivan Foundation for Deaf Blind People which deserves great credit for all it has done.  It is important to acknowledge that Ms English engaged with us in preparation for the meeting, for which I commend her.  It will be of concern to everyone that a dramatic rise in deafblindness is expected in the years ahead, which Ms English attributed to the ageing demographic, meaning that I should be worried, with the increased survival rate for infants with severe disabilities.  Are there projections in this regard?  Will Ms English confirm that deafblindness can be consequential on a number of circumstances?  In some instances such as in the case of Usher syndrome, it is, as Ms Brill pointed out, congenital.</p><p>There are other triggers for the advent of deafblindness in one's lifetime.  If the delegates could tell us a little more about it, it would be welcome.</p><p> The delegates have put down a clear marker on recognising deafblindness as a distinct disability.  I noted their engagement with the Minister prior to the commencement of the hearing and hope we, as the elected voices of the people, will be able, as we do on so many things, to unite in a common demand that this happen.  The delegates have shared with us that in 2006 the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities echoed this sentiment in terms of this recognition and that only last week the European Parliament accorded full recognition.  I must commend our colleagues both here and in all of the member states on this achievement and hope that very shortly we will be able to herald the fact that deafblindness has been formally officially recognised as a distinct disability among our population.  That would be the direct consequence of the collective work of the delegates and their presentations.</p><p> On clearly defined pathways to care, I know from dealing with people with disabilities that one of the great frustrations is the period of time from a particular stage in the development of a disability to the realisation of the support the person needs.  This is a hugely difficult time during which people's abilities are impaired.  The word "ability" needs to be emphasised, not just "disability".  Ms Brill has highlighted the fact that she has nobody working on guiding and giving her a sense of her particular needs as each year passes.  Dedicated support services for people with deafblindness should be able to deal with this issue.  It is very important that there be no time lapse between identification of a need and the introduction of services and supports.  We need to be able to predict in advance and such services should be immediately accessible when the need presents.  We need services to coincide with the identification of need.  I ask the delegates to comment on this issue and, given her professional capacity, perhaps Dr. Cummings might like to offer her views on it.</p><p> I thank the Acting Chairman for her patience with me.  In her contribution Ms English spoke about collecting accurate data for the numbers of people who were deafblind and co-ordinating the services available.  She needs to up her game because it is the services that are not available that we really need to provide.  This is the only little difference I have with the thrust of her opening remarks.  The services available are simply not adequate enough.  They do not meet the current or projected needs of Ms Brill's and those like her.  This is not a criticism; it is only to say that in any other address I would up the game again and move to another level of demand.</p><p> Dr. Cummings has stated it is only with recognition of deafblindness that a care pathway can be developed.  This goes back to the point I made to Ms English on the identification of need and about there being no delay in accessing services when the need presents.  I invite Dr. Cummings to comment on this issue.</p><p> The detail of aids and appliances submissions and assessment of need submissions was not shared in any of the three submissions.  As laypeople who, blessed as we are, are not challenged by deafblindness at this stage in our lives - we do not know what the future holds for any of us - will the delegates elaborate a little on what aids and appliances are available?  Are there specific aids and appliances available rather than a combination of deaf and blind aids and appliances?  Will they elaborate a little and give us a clearer understanding?</p><p> I again thank the Acting Chairman.  There are no questions I can put to Ms Brill after her contribution; its clarity stands on its own merits.  It is the most compelling case I have heard put to us in all my years as a member of the committee and these Houses.  Recognising deafblindness is the only result of today's engagement that can be even contemplated.  With the Acting Chairman's indulgence and given that we work well as a cohesive health committee, I propose that we write to the Minister about our shared support for extending this recognition which we urge as a cross-party, cross-Government, cross-Opposition committee.  We make the case with one voice.  I have confidence that the Minister would be responsive, as he would only be expected to be.  What is most necessary is the supports for the journey through life when they are needed; it should not have to take years to receive them after they are identified.  It must be contemporaneous.</p><p> Will Ms Brill tell us a little about the aids and appliances she herself has?  Understandably, she spoke with great love and pride about her daughter.  I have four daughters.  Although I do not need its services, I also have a dog.  Has Ms Brill ever considered the services a guide dog might offer?  It may be unique or particular to people who are challenged by blindness.  Would a guide dog play a role in her particular circumstances as somebody challenged by deafblindness?  If she has not, why not?  Is it something that could be examined?  What other areas does she believe it would be useful for the system to address immediately?</p></speech>

I also welcome those in the Visitors Gallery.  As the Acting Chairman said, this is a landmark session and I am delighted that the deafblind community will be able to understand what is taking place.</p><p>All the contributions from all three witnesses are very important to ensure the committee members know exactly what deaf-blindness is and the witnesses have made a compelling case for recognising deaf-blindness as a unique disability.  Ms Brill made a most powerful and touching presentation on behalf of the witnesses.  I commend Ms English on the work she has done and the research she published in 2014, deaf-blindness in Ireland.  I commend the Anne Sullivan Centre on the work it is and has been doing over the years in the area.  The main focus of today's meeting is the question of recognition of deaf-blindness as a unique and distinct disability.  As we heard in the presentations, it has already been recognised by the UK, EU and UN.  I concur with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that I am sure the committee will unanimously propose it to the Minister and Department.  The committee works particularly well and is generally unanimous in its recommendations.</p><p> The number of people affected by deaf-blindness in my constituency, South Tipperary, took me aback.  The census showed that 44 suffer from deaf-blindness and a further 246 have an additional disability.  This is reflected in the national figures of 1,749 deafblind and approximately 10,300 with an additional disability.  Do we know how many people will be affected in the future?  It is important from the point of view of the services that need to be put in place.  As Dr. Cummings said, the recognition of deaf-blindness as a unique and distinct disability is vitally important if we are to implement pathways to care and the various services needed by people with this disability.  Ms Brill has clearly outlined the whole area of quality of life, or the lack thereof, of sufferers.  If services are to be put in place, we need to recognise the disability and put in place pathways of care and recommendations for services that would need to be available.  What sort of services are available for people with this disability?  Do the services reach all or most of the people affected?  What services need to be put in place for the future including outreach and outpatient services and residential services?</p><p> Again, I thank the witnesses for their important and powerful contributions on the subject and I assure them that the committee and I will support their presentations and their call for recognition of deaf-blindness as a distinct disability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2766" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Carol Brill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015052800002#Q00200"><p>I thank the committee for embracing our statement about why deaf-blindness needs to be recognised.  I live on a social welfare payment called the blind pension.  This is evidence that I am treated as a blind person, not a deafblind person or a person with dual sensory loss.  It is well known that it is difficult to live on a limited income.  Although I would dearly love to work, given the deterioration of my dual sensory faculties, it is very difficult to gain employment.  I could not even work on a supermarket checkout.  I would dearly love to be able to do so.  Given the restrictions of living on a low income, I am unable to commit to applying for a guide dog.  While the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind centre in Cork commits to providing one with a trained dog, one is responsible for veterinary fees, a special diet for the dog, grooming and compulsory pet insurance.  It comes to approximately &euro;25, a very large proportion of the blind pension.</p> <p>  I have worn hearing aids from the age of four.  At first, the HSE provided my hearing aids.  Unfortunately, as my hearing is deteriorating, my audiological needs are increasing, and the hearing aids offered through the medical card scheme are not sufficient to my needs.  Thankfully, technology has progressed and in the commercial sector I am able to avail of high-tech hearing aids.  The latest hearing aids I am wearing come at a very significant cost of approximately &euro;6,500.  I have been gifted these hearing aids because they are the best for my audiological needs and visual safety because I can use an app on my iPhone to adapt to my environment.  If the environment is noisy, I can change the setting.  My privacy is also protected.  Visually impaired people use voice technology on their phones that reads messages and e-mails aloud.  The iPhone app allows e-mails and messages to be read, via Bluetooth, straight into my hearing aid, which protects my privacy to some extent and ensures I am able to hear what I am engaging with.  Unfortunately, my hearing loss is getting worse.</p><p>I ask Mr. Derek Lacey, who is here as my audiologist to expand a little bit further about the future prognosis of my hearing loss because it is essential to the progression of my care under the health and social services.</p></speech>

As time goes on her understanding of speech gets worse; it is clarity issues for her.  As members will have noticed Ms Brill has participated in this meeting quite well.  She has been able to read.  She has been able to hear and able to converse with all present.  This is because of the sense of the device she is wearing.  It is able to take the speech and reduce it by compression to give the high frequencies more information so she is able to distinguish what is actually being said.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura English" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015052800002#R00700"><p>I thank Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Healy for their support on the issue both at the meeting and in advance of today in taking time to speak to us beforehand in order to get a good grasp of the issue.</p> <p>  I mentioned that a dramatic rise was expected in the number of deaf-blind people in Ireland and elsewhere.  There is no Irish context-specific information on that.  However, a UK study in 2010 used different data collection methods, including household budgets and some of the population census material to assess the number of people.  It estimated that at present, 210 people per 100,000 are affected by deaf-blindness in the UK.  With the ageing population the UK expects that number to rise to 343 per 100,000, which is quite significant.</p> <p>  On the other end of the spectrum, due to medical advances a greater number of children are surviving prematurity and from different complications, postnatal and prenatal, and are living but they are living with additional and severe disabilities.  A number of the children who were involved in that research were from places that look children with brain injuries and different multiple disabilities.  Part of that multiple disability would be deaf-blindness.</p> <p>  On pathways to care, I mention again the lifecycle process we mentioned at the beginning.  Pathways to care need to be accessible at all ages throughout the lifecycle.  Dr. Cummings can elaborate on that based on her professional experience.  Access to information is a huge issue for people who are deaf-blind.  HSE leaflets in doctors' surgeries are not accessible to members of the deaf community who use sign language.  Their first language is Irish sign language and to understand and really grasp all the services available to them in a second language is difficult.  For people who are blind, material is often not available in Braille.  The deaf-blind community in general have difficulty with access to information, which needs to be addressed to ensure they are aware of the different services available to them and the different pathways to care they can use and the routes they can access.</p> <p>  In terms of data collection, I have quoted figures from the national census from 2011.  As Ms Brill has said, we would like to see a specific box to tick on the census that would indicate deaf-blind as opposed to ticking deafness and blindness.  It should be clear that dual sensory loss is a distinct disability.  We would also like to see that reflected in the national disability database, physical and sensory.  There are issues on that.  I have asked them to give us figures on how many people on the national physical sensory disability database at the moment experience a combination of vision and hearing loss.  Even though it has been established since 2002, the numbers were below 500, which is quite stark considering that there are more than 10,000 people on the national census.  The Health Research Board that runs it would advocate for people over the age of 65 to be included in that data collection which is not the case currently.</p> <p>  The register is done by voluntary participation.  Perhaps if that were rolled out more through community voluntary organisations and the voluntary participation was stepped up a gear it might have the resources to collect more accurate information on the number of people who are deaf-blind in Ireland.</p> <p>  We were asked about what technology might be available.  I attended the international Acquired deaf-blindness Network Conference held in Belfast last year.  I saw there a number of deaf-blind people from across the world using different forms of communication which are not as readily accessible in Ireland.  A number of people use tactile communication and sign language.  If they had already acquired sign language earlier in life and then lost their sight they would use sign language into the hand.  There are a number of different methods.  Some would include each finger being a vowel, a, e, i, o and u, and the consonants would be in the palm.  A speech could be spelled out to them in their hand.  At the moment plenty of sign language classes are available in the country but not many people can help a deaf person to convert that conventional sign language into a tactile hands-on communications system.  We would also like to work on that.</p> <p>  Last year one of our events was attended by the only deaf-blind priest in the world.  He communicates through a Braille system that works through his iPhone.  He will enter a message via Braille, send it off in an e-mail and will receive it back on his Braille machine.  There is also a Lorm glove, which works on the concept of the manual alphabet on one's palm, but somebody can send one a text message and wearing the glove it will vibrate in certain parts of one's palm.  Those kinds of technological devices are available and information on them can be found through Google.  However, there is no information for deaf-blind people to find those kinds of devices in an Irish context.</p> <p>  I ask Dr. Cummings to elaborate on the pathways to care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2774" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sandra Cummings" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015052800002#R00800"><p>Care pathways are the route map patients will have from when they are diagnosed.  What is the route they will take?  Who are the people involved in assessing them?  How often will the assessments take place?  What other professional bodies will be involved?  Who will provide educational support?  It requires getting these people in touch with the patient and following them step by step so they are never left in the lurch.</p> <p>  We should know at any point in time what the visual acuity is like and what the heating ability is like.  Where do we need to up the game?  Do they need better hearing aids?  Going into the classroom, do they need classroom support?  There has to be a designated care pathway that this patient will take.  That is their routine life.  What are the stops along the way?  Who will help them along the way?  That has to be formalised because at the moment people are just veering and not coming back to the central pathway of the aim of how we need to help these people in every aspect of their lives.</p> <p>  For example, with the assessment of need, someone with a mild hearing loss cannot really get teaching support.  However, there should be extra teacher support in the classroom for someone with a mild hearing loss and a visual impairment.  That is one key aspect where this should be recognised as a single disability.</p><p>We do this all the time.  A person with mild hearing loss will not receive extra support.  Someone whose hearing is fine may be okay but if he or she has another disability, it will make things much more difficult in the classroom setting.  The most important issue to recognise is that we can work out the care pathway this individual needs to ensure he or she does not get lost along the way.</p></speech>

I was attending to business in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  It is extraordinary that we are discussing the recognition of deaf-blindness as a distinct disability given that lobbying has been taking place on the issue for many years.  Earlier this week, while checking something about previous Ministers for Health, I was fascinated to note the lack of progress on this issue.  People may disagree but in my view politicians should hang their heads in shame because some of the issues raised by the witnesses were being raised as far back as 1967.  Ms English used the word "invisible" to describe deaf-blind people.  That description sums up the position regarding efforts to have deaf-blindness recognised as a distinct disability for a long period.  </p> <p>  Despite what one hears, Ireland is a country of substantial wealth.  The issue is one of wealth distribution.  If that were not the case, the witnesses would not need to come before the joint committee seeking basic changes.  It is extraordinary that, having been discriminated against by nature, deaf-blind people continue to be discriminated against by society.  </p> <p>  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputies Healy and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  It would be a positive outcome of today's work if we were to move in the direction of finally securing State recognition for deaf-blindness.  The least members can do, collectively and irrespective of our political differences, is move in this direction.  </p></speech>

I had a prior commitment to raise an issue in the Seanad.  However, I have read the presentations.</p> <p>  The issue of deaf-blind and deaf people who require full-time care arose three or four years ago when we discussed deaf-blind and deaf people who are in care facilities that lack communication and co-ordination.  They must be in facilities that offer support.  Have consultations or discussions taken place with the Health Service Executive on the need to co-ordinate services?</p> <p>  Ms English stated the deaf-blind population numbers approximately 10,000.  A certain proportion of deaf-blind people living at home with family members will require full-time care at some point in future.  We need to plan for our long-term elderly care needs.  The number of people aged 65 years and over will increase from 585,000 to 990,000 in the next 15 years.  I am concerned at the absence of planning for this scenario, including in respect of the cohort of deaf-blind people.  Has there been any consultation or discussion with the HSE on co-ordinating services, especially for deaf-blind people as they get older?  If a deaf-blind person is accommodated with 50 people who are not deaf-blind, he or she will not have any support.  </p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive presentations.</p></speech>

Dr. Paul Kenna and Mr. David Keegan are involved.  </p> <p>  I have a particular interest in this issue as I have a family member with Usher syndrome, a genetic condition that may affect more than one member of a family.  I ask Dr. Kenna to provide a brief outline of the syndrome in terms of its genetic role and research being done in this area.  I met Dr. Kenna 25 years ago and I am aware that research in this area has made significant progress.  From my experience of having a family member with Usher syndrome, I can say it is hell on earth.  Families do not know who to turn to for help when a family member loses his or her sight.  They will call this, that or the other group because there is no co-ordinated service available.  </p> <p>  The lack of regulation for the provision of hearing aids is a serious problem.  People are paying sums of between &euro;4,000 and &euro;6,000 for hearing aids which are sometimes substandard and do not help the person with the hearing difficulty.  This issue needs to be addressed because some people are spending all their money on these products.  This industry must be regulated.  I am not referring to audiologists but to companies which are setting up shop in various towns and cities and are not subject to regulation.  These companies can put whatever price tag they wish on a hearing aid. </p> <p>  Isolation was alluded to but depression is a major problem among deaf-blind people.  Perhaps Dr. Kenna will address the issue of suicide ideation because it needs to be discussed.</p> <p>  Ms Brill referred to public services, including the Luas transport mode.  The colour of Luas trams the fact that they are extremely quiet mean it is difficult for deaf-blind people to see or hear them.  Public bodies must address these types of issues.</p><p> The witnesses made the point that high technology hearing aids are not available through the HSE.  We need to consider that issue seriously because it is a huge investment and I understand the hearing insert in the ear needs to be changed every six to 12 months, which also costs money.  Support services are limited in this area.  The Ann Sullivan Centre is doing its best but doctors should be trained in dual multiple sensory impairment.  I have experience of accompanying a deaf-blind person on visits to doctors and consultants who ignored the patient and directed their questions at me.  It is important that the dignity of the deaf-blind person is respected.  I would like to see more audiologists and experts in Usher's syndrome being trained in how to deal with blindness, as well more ophthalmologists being trained to deal with hearing problems.</p></speech>

I spoke about co-ordination of services because there is a shortage of deaf-blind specific services, and that stretches the capacity of other organisations.  Clearly we want deaf-blind specific services but we also recognise that a number of deaf and blind services are doing fantastic work.  For example, Fighting Blindness offers a counselling service and there may be opportunities to pool resources by adding a sign language interpreter to its counselling services.  The way forward will be through co-operation with other organisations that are already providing services to people who are deaf-blind while also working to develop deaf-blind specific services.</p> <p>  In regard to schools, we have a person working in our outreach service and a number of our staff are trained to masters level in deaf-blind communication.  Currently they are finding it difficult to get places on multi-disciplinary teams.  A multi-disciplinary team might comprise a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist and a speech and language therapist but none of the team will have specific deaf-blind specific expertise.  We want to reach the point where deaf-blindness is recognised as a distinct disability requiring a professional with deaf-blind specific knowledge.  We have also started to roll out training and support in this regard.  I have been in contact with UCD and gave a speech to nurses who will be graduating next year on dealing with a deaf-blind person in a hospital setting.  This training needs to reach a wider audience, including ophthalmologists and audiologists.</p> <p>  In regard to the deaf-blind specific services provided in Ireland, the Ann Sullivan Centre provides residential care to people who are deaf-blind and have additional disabilities.  The majority of these are intellectual disabilities, which we are not confident were always present rather being due to sensory deprivation from an early age.  Full-time residential care is not necessary for everybody.  As Ms Carol Brill demonstrates, a number of deaf-blind people do not have additional disabilities but they need to be supported in living as independently as possible in their communities.  Senator Colm Burke asked about elderly care and access to residential care.  A cohort of the deaf-blind population will need the residential support we currently provide but there is a lack of support for people who want to remain in their homes and close to their families and friends.  If Ms Brill had somebody who could support her in simple tasks, such as shopping or cooking, it would make a massive difference to her life as her condition progresses.  We need to enable people to live in their homes.</p></speech>

I want to be able to do that.  Recognition of deaf-blindness will help me to make that dream come true.  It is not my dream to end up in residential care; it is my dream to be a vibrant citizen who lives a full life despite hearing and sight loss.</p></speech>

While she may not have experienced particular problems because she has a good consultant, what is the experience of the deaf community and the deaf-blind community of hearing aids?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-28a.2783" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Carol Brill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015052800002#T00500"><p>I am involved with a network of people who are suffering dual sensory loss, mainly due to Usher's syndrome.  The most common complaint pertains to the quality of hearing aids available through the medical card scheme.  It is not simply a matter of being unable to hear properly but also the impact on families.  It can cause friction between family members when they are asked to turn around to facilitate lip reading.  If the hearing aids were better quality, that friction would not arise.  Poor quality hearing aids impact on every aspect of family life.  We want to live in harmony.  I have tried various hearing aids throughout my life.  In my first 40 years of life, I never had an audiologist explain to me what my hearing loss entailed and why I needed to wear a hearing aid.  I never understood the extent of my hearing loss until I attended a commercial audiologist who was kind and patient in explaining every aspect of my hearing loss.  That should have happened before I reached the age of 40, which was five years ago.  I should not have gone through life with that experience.</p> <p>  Social infrastructure, such as the Luas, can be detrimental.  There is no care or thought for people with deaf-blindness.  For some reason, Dundrum Town Centre, which is my local shopping centre, has erected silver and grey posts on grey concrete.  The streets are covered with grey concrete and silver street poles.  The Luas is supposed to reflect the colour of our grey sky.  This is why I feel I am becoming invisible.  If deaf-blindness was recognised, it would have an enormous impact on architects and other professionals in terms of improving the quality of life for people with dual sensory loss.</p></speech>

Usher's syndrome is a significant subset of inherited retina degeneration, whereby retina degeneration is combined with hearing loss.  I started my genetic work in collaboration with the ocular genetics unit in Trinity College Dublin more than 25 years ago.  In 1989, we were the first to identify a gene responsible for any form of retinopathy and since then progress has been much more rapid than I would have predicted.</p><p>With advances, particularly in our ability to sequence and identify the building blocks of genes and to identify changes which may be disease-associated, over 205 genes have now been identified in a whole variety of inherited retinal degenerations.  The identification of genes responsible for Usher syndrome has been even greater than that.  It is estimated that we know 60% to 70% of the genes that may cause inherited retinal degeneration, but in the case of Usher syndrome it is estimated that there are 12 different genes and we know ten of them at the moment.  Essentially, therefore, the genetic mystery of Usher syndrome has largely been solved.  We can now make genetic diagnosis relatively easily with the newer technologies for identifying disease-associated gene changes.  <br/><br/>The research which I and others have been involved in for the past 25 years and longer is now transitioning to becoming a diagnostic test.  I would urge that consideration be given to the importance of doing that gene testing, particularly on very young children who have been identified with congenital hearing loss because a significant portion of those will actually turn out to have Usher syndrome.  At the moment the visual part of Usher syndrome only comes to light generally when they are in their teenage years or even a little older whereas if the genetic testing could be done as soon as the significant congenital hearing loss is identified, the true diagnosis comes to light and the clinical care pathway which Dr. Cummings commented on, can be started from the outset.  Therefore, adaptations to education and so on can be set in motion when they will be of value and before the patient reaches a stage where they have a significant visual problem which, unfortunately, is the way most patients with Usher syndrome come to light at the moment.  Their hearing loss is known from a very early age but it is only subsequently that the vision deficit becomes apparent.<br/><br/>Another result from the advance in genetics and the identification of genes responsible for Usher syndrome is that there are realistic prospects in the foreseeable future of that knowledge being used to develop gene-based treatments.  There is already one human clinical trial which has just started - we do not have any results, it is in a very early stage - basically replacing the defective gene in patients with a form of Usher syndrome due to the Myosin 7A gene, and replacing the defective copies of that gene with normal copies of the gene with the hope of either stabilising visual function or there may even be a prospect of visual improvement.<br/><br/>There are two clinical trials going on of similar gene replacement in non-syndromic forms of <i>retinitis pigmentosa</i>.  In both of those the data would indicate that not only does the gene treatment stabilise the condition, but it actually leads to vision improvement.  The same may be the case with Usher syndrome.  There will be greater treatment options based on knowledge of what genes are causing particular forms of Usher syndrome.  The treatments will very likely be gene-specific, so patients with Usher syndrome will have to know what genes are causing their particular condition.</p></speech>

The Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists, ISHAA, has been actively working in Europe with the EU standard.  We have adapted the EU standard here in the society.  Our members adhere to that standard to the best of their abilities.  As was rightly said, there is no regulation or legislation.  Anybody can walk in here and sell Ms Brill a, b and c, claiming to be an audiologist or a scientist audiologist.  There is no regulation for that.  We are actively working with the Department in trying to get some sort of regulation and, hopefully, that will happen in the near future.  The only Department that has been really significant in this is the Department of Social Protection through the PRSI scheme.  Through that scheme we are able to monitor and ensure that good practice is adhered to at all times.  That is the only bite that we have.</p></speech>

The purpose of the proposed motion is to seek the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA.  The proposed motion follows recent Government approval for Ireland to complete the steps required to ratify the IRENA statute.  As the committee is aware, IRENA is an intergovernmental organisation that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future.  IRENA's aim is to promote the widespread and increased adoption of renewable energy with a view to sustainable development.</p>  <p>  Ratifying the IRENA statute will allow for full membership and provide improved access for Ireland to data and expertise that will complement the high-quality EU and International Energy Agency research, analysis and support with regard to renewable energy technology and policy developments.  This is particularly important given Ireland's abundant diverse and indigenous renewable energy sources, such as wind and ocean power.  It is also particularly timely, given our objective of transitioning to a low-carbon future and in the context of our involvement in setting EU and global targets for climate and energy matters for the period 2020 to 2030.  </p>  <p>               The agency, which is headquartered in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, currently has 140 members, including major economies such as the United States, India, Japan, Australia and China.  More than 32 states have started the formal process of becoming members.  The European Union and all its member states are members, apart from Austria and Ireland, both of which are in the process of becoming members.<br/><br/>IRENA is financed in the main by mandatory contributions from members.  Those contributions are determined by the IRENA assembly, which convenes annually to discuss and decide upon issues such as the agency's work programme and budget.  Based on the budget agreed in January 2014, Ireland's contribution for 2015 would amount to approximately &euro;70,000.  We will be invited to contribute a <i>pro rata</i>share of that sum, depending on the date membership commences.  It is because the IRENA statute involves a charge upon public funds within the meaning of Article 29.5.2&deg; of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann that the terms of the statute require prior D&aacute;il approval.  IRENA's role in attracting a greater profile for renewable energy as a long-term solution to climate change and sustainability aligns with the Government's energy policy objectives of security, sustainability and competitiveness.  I recommend the motion to the select sub-committee.</p></speech>

It makes sense that we should seek to learn from the experience and research of other nations as they develop renewable energy systems.  We must keep a careful watch, however, to ensure IRENA does not change from an information-sharing body into one which would seek to be a decision-making entity in terms of determining which nations must undertake which aspect of renewable energy.  Autonomy in that regard must be left to individual nations.  It is a pity the headquarters of the agency are not in Ireland, given the potential we have for a rich mix of renewable energy projects.</p></speech>
