Is that agreed?  And can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  We begin today with session 1, public hearing, discussion with Mr. John Hurley, former Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>And in doing so I would like to welcome everyone to the 28th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with senior figures who had key roles before and during the crisis and the focus of this morning's session is on the years 2000 ... of 2000 to 2008, the implementation of the new Central Bank and financial regulation structures following the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act 2003 and the years building to the start of the crisis in 2008.  The focus of this afternoon's session is on the years 2008 to 2009, the critical years in the build-up and immediate response to the crisis.  John Hurley was appointed Governor of the Central Bank in March 2002, a position he held until his retirement in September 2009.  Prior to this he has had extensive ... an extensive career in the Civil Service and served as Secretary General at the Department of Health and the Department of Finance.  Mr. Hurley, you're very welcome before the committee this morning.</p><p>Before we start hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information that they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the witnesses asked and the answers which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, such that ... such as that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the public Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  And members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. Hurley, please.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-21a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052100002#C00400"><p>Thank you and good morning, Chairman and members of the committee.  I propose in my opening comments this morning to set out three areas which I've been asked to address in my written statement.  These are: firstly, the impact of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act 2003 on the role and responsibilities of the Central Bank; secondly, the approach taken by the Central Bank in responding to one of its key objectives, that of contributing to financial stability; and, thirdly, the appropriateness of the decision of the Government to guarantee certain liabilities of the bank on 29 September 2008.</p>  <p>  In relation to the first matter, there is, I believe, some confusion about the effect of the 2003 Act on the role of the Central Bank.  The bank is sometimes perceived as being a co-regulator or co-supervisor, which it was not.  In fact, under the 2003 Act the Central Bank was divested of its responsibility for prudential regulation and supervision of financial institutions.  </p>  <p>         As a result it was unique among the so-called periphery countries.<br/><br/>Part of the reason for the confusion about the role of the Central Bank relates to the power of the bank to issue formal guidelines to the Financial Regulator under section 33D of the Act.  Any such guidelines must be concerned with policies and principles in pursuit of Central Bank functions, mainly financial stability.  The bank considered the financial stability reports prepared and agreed with the Financial Regulator as constituting the appropriate advice.  The bank never saw a reason to issue formal guidance.  Such guidance which was required to be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>would have arisen only if the Financial Regulator did not accept the overall risk assessment set out in the reports.  That situation simply never arose.<br/><br/>As an autonomous entity within the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator had responsibility for prudential regulation and consumer protection.  The 2003 Act was absolutely prescriptive in this arm's length legal autonomy.  The relevant powers of the Central Bank were transferred to the Financial Regulator and under section 33C of the 2003 Act the regulator had a separate governing structure with a membership of ten directors, including its chairman.  To underline its autonomy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the bank, section 33C(11) of the Act provided that the Financial Regulator was required to perform the functions transferred from the Central Bank on the basis of its own opinion, belief or state of mind.  The bank had, however, the core responsibility to contribute to financial stability, a role shared with the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance, and I will comment in some detail on this role later.<br/><br/>The decision to remove the prudential powers of the Central Bank over the banks was opposed at the time by the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  An appendix to the McDowell report set out an alternative approach locating the Financial Regulator within the Central Bank and subject to a single board.  I strongly supported that approach and worked hard to promote it when I was Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  Eventually, under the 2003 Act the Government adopted a structure that gave the Financial Regulator its own board, the regulatory authority, within a restructured Central Bank.  During the financial crisis the Government decided to reunite both functions again in a unitary organisation with one board, chaired by the Governor.<br/><br/>In seeking to clarify the respective roles of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank I want to emphasise that this is not intended to be a criticism of the Financial Regulator.  I do not believe that regulation could, on its own, have stopped this crisis from happening.  The forces that were at work, both domestic and international, were very formidable and involved many authorities and organisations, including the Central Bank.  I accept the Central Bank's share of responsibility for what has occurred.<br/><br/>The Financial Regulator adopted a policy of principles-based supervision.  This was in accord with the philosophy of the time and reflected a shift in favour of market discipline with a greater emphasis on the role of boards and managements of banks.  The Basel accords and EU directives under which the Financial Regulator functioned were the internationally recognised blueprints for regulators at the time.  The Basel-based framework has now been shown to have been fundamentally flawed and unsuitable to the challenges of the time.  Among the main weaknesses were that both the quality and the quantity of capital requirements were far too low and liquidity risk was largely ignored.  These flaws are addressed in Basel III which includes for the first time the promotion of macro-prudential regulation.<br/><br/>The supervisory framework here was favourably assessed in 2006 by the International Monetary Fund.  The weaknesses in the Basel-based framework were not appreciated at the time.  I believe these weaknesses are relevant in the context of assessing the performance of the Financial Regulator and, to some extent, the Central Bank in a pre-crisis period.  The central question is the extent to which flawed yardsticks as well as more general market failures impinged adversely on the performance of the two entities.  To this would be added the significant over-correction of property prices in Ireland.  The unprecedented global recession was also a major factor.<br/><br/>Turning now to the second issue, financial stability, the prevailing international orthodoxy in the pre-crisis period was that monetary policy, financial stability analysis and micro-prudential regulation constituted a sufficient framework to maintain overall financial stability.  </p>  <p>         Macro-prudential analysis was normally referred to as financial stability analysis at the time.  It involved the identification of risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system and communicating these to a broad range of stakeholders, including, for example, other authorities, market participants and the general public.  This approach was followed in Ireland by the Central Bank.  As was also the practice internationally, moral suasion was the main instrument employed.  The crisis has given rise to a search for a new approach and the centrepiece now is a major emphasis on macro-prudential regulation.  Its instruments are still being defined and developed.</p> <p> In his evidence to this committee, Mr. Regling, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism stated, "Today, every[body] who deals with these issues talks a lot about macro-prudential supervision, but that was not very fashionable at the time globally, and not alone in Europe."  As a result of the de Larosi&egrave;re report in 2009, much more emphasis is now being placed on macro-prudential regulation.  He recommended that an EU level institution be entrusted with this responsibility.  The European Systemic Risk Board has now been assigned this task.</p> <p> Turning now to the reports themselves, at the outset, I wish to acknowledge that the financial stability reports published by the bank underestimated the risks facing the Irish financial system.  This is because they did not foresee how the international financial crisis would combine with our existing domestic weaknesses to create such a critical position for Ireland.  The reports were concerned about typical recessions of the past several decades.  The scale of the international crisis, the worst since at least the 1930s, was not anticipated by any institution, domestic or international.  The effect on Ireland was magnified by the interaction of these risks, domestic and international, which dramatically increased the social, economic and financial consequences for Ireland.  This is not to fully recognise the part played by our domestic weaknesses prior to the crisis, including the dominant role of the property market.  However, I believe these weaknesses on their own would not have given rise to anything like the severity of the crisis we experienced.  I believe Lehman's was more than the trigger or catalyst.  It precipitated the near-collapse of the international banking system.  It destroyed, on a wide scale, trust between lenders and borrowers, the very foundation block of the banking system.  The market suffered what has been called a type of financial cardiac arrest affecting most western banks.  In particular, it triggered large-scale declines in the value of many assets, especially property, across the world.  It is clear that, in hindsight, the warnings in our financial stability reports should have been much stronger, and I very much regret that the bank underestimated the risk that subsequently materialised.  The fact that similar criticisms can be made of central banks in other countries that experienced systemic crisis is no consolation to me.  However, for an insight into the thinking at the time, the very favourable assessments of both the international economic environment and the Irish economy by most domestic and international commentators need to be taken into account.  In particular, these assessments reflected the soft landing consensus.  To save time, I do not propose tor recite these assessments here.  They're set out in my written statement.  </p> <p> So far as the financial system was concerned, the assessments made by the International Monetary Fund, both in its Article 4 reports and in its 2006 financial stability assessment update on Ireland, were quite positive.  The International Monetary Fund concluded in 2006, following its stress testing of Irish banks, that they could cope with substantial falls in property prices.  As late as 2008, the OECD stated that the rise in property prices was largely driven by higher incomes and demographics and that the Irish banks were well capitalised and profitable and should have considerable risk absorption capacity.  Given their cross-country perspectives and their experience of crises, the Central Bank regarded the views of OECD and IMF as very important.  Against this background, the financial stability reports highlighted the risks and vulnerabilities in the Irish financial system in the light of the information available at the time.  These risks included, in particular, the high level and rate of credit growth, the high concentration of loan books to property-related business, the high increases in property prices, and the increased funding gap.  Notwithstanding the warnings in the financial stability reports, they all assessed the overall health of the banking system to be sound based on the internationally accepted yardsticks, notably capital adequacy.  </p> <p> The draft financial stability reports were prepared initially by the financial stability unit of the bank and processed through the financial stability committee, which included senior staff of the Financial Regulator.  </p>  <p>         They were subsequently agreed, normally at two joint meetings of the Central Bank board and the regulatory authority.  The risks outlined, together with the Financial Regulator's own assessments, were to be the basis for regulation.  Once the reports were agreed, I took full ownership and responsibility for them and launched them at press conferences, where my introductory comments highlighted the key risks.  The financial stability reports formed the basis for my discussions with the Minister and the autumn letter sent by me each year to the Minister in advance of the budget.  They were also discussed at round-table meetings with the banks.  </p> <p> The reports of the Nyberg commission and Regling and Watson suggested that there was a basis for taking some action by about the end of 2005.  I've recently re-read some of the relevant documents from that time to get some insight into our mindset.  This is not easy with the elapse of close to ten years since the 2005 financial stability report was published.  Nevertheless, with the benefit of hindsight, I agree with the view that there was a basis for action in 2005.  The Central Bank should have escalated and reinforced its warnings on risks and vulnerabilities at the time.  At the time, the bank considered that the approach taken was the correct one and I would like to set out why it held that view.  </p> <p> The Central Bank was aware of plans to phase out tax incentives for property.  In October 2004, because of the increases in property prices and also the growth of the property sector, I raised the issue in the Governor's pre-budget letter to the Minister for Finance.  I advised that no further extension should be allowed to the termination date of mid-2006 for the range of tax-driven incentives.  In the event, a review of tax incentives was announced in the budget in 2004.  The review was completed in 2005 and the budget in December 2005 announced their phased withdrawal.  The Central Bank was also very much aware that a slowdown in credit growth and property prices was dependent to a significant extent on the future increases in interest rates.  It was clear that interest rates would not remain for long at their historic low levels and the Central Bank made this known to other authorities, to the banks and to the general public.  </p> <p> In my introductory comments at the launch of the 2004 financial stability report, I warned that the then level of interest rates did not reflect where the euro area economy would be in the medium to long term.  In the round-table discussions with financial institutions in December 2004, the Central Bank representatives pointed out that the equilibrium rate for retail mortgages was approximately 6%.  While it could take time to reach that level, it was twice the prevailing rate.  The spring bulletin of February 2005 and the summer bulletin of May of that year also cautioned about the effects of rising interest rates on borrowings.  The impact of rising interest rates was widely picked up by the media following our reports.  One leading newspaper reported that interest rates may double.  Other media also gave good coverage to prospective interest rate increases.  A further message to the same effect was given at the same time ... at the time of the publication of the financial stability report in 2005 with, again, extensive coverage by the media.  In preparing that report, the bank emphasised the psychological impact of the expectation of interest rate increases.  In the event, interest rate rises were later than expected by markets because of adverse developments in the euro area.  Interest rates did increase in December by 0.25%.  This was the start of aggressive monetary tightening, with six further increases of the same amount in the period between December 2005 and March 2007.  Because of the importance of the effect of interest rate rises for credit growth, the Central Bank's warnings on prospective rate increases were persistent and strong.  </p> <p> Towards the end of 2005, house price growth eased considerably as part of an international trend.  The real price index of commercial property, as the Nyberg commission shows, was fairly flat since about 2000.  The Central Bank considered that increases in interest rates were the most effective way of cooling the property market and, with a lag, easing credit growth.  The bank also considered the exchange rate to be an important factor in slowing the economy.  The euro appreciated by 35% and 12% against the dollar and sterling, respectively, between 2000 and 2005.  As indicated, the decision of the Minister for Finance to phase out the tax incentives for property was also expected to play an important part.  So too were the measures being considered by the Financial Regulator on risk ratings for high LTV mortgages and speculative commercial property.  The bank considered that this range of measures should be sufficient to reduce the growth in property prices and, later on, credit.  </p>  <p>         However, it wasn't until about 2006 that evidence of some slowing in house price growth started to emerge.  Later in the year, there were the first indications that growth in credit was beginning to ease.  Many of the aggregates continued to moderate throughout ... through 2007.  It seemed that the expected soft landing had begun.  The delayed response to the measures outlined earlier, and the weaknesses which were subsequently revealed in the risk management practices of the bank, had significant consequences for the banking sector.  My description here of the thinking during the relevant periods is not intended to take from the fact that, with hindsight, we were wrong.</p> <p> Turning to the third matter, the appropriateness of the guarantee, by way of background, I in fact returned to the Central Bank shortly after the collapse of Lehman's on 15 September 2008.  I'd been absent from the bank from 19 July due to a serious illness.  I was briefed by staff in the Central Bank on the deteriorating liquidity situation.  At that time international financial markets were extremely turbulent and liquidity provision by the ECB was increasing significantly.  One bank, Anglo, was very seriously affected, while other banks were also experiencing increasing outflows.  If outflows continued on the scale experienced, it would only be a matter of time before the Irish financial system was threatened.  Following discussions in the Department of Finance, the deposit guarantee limit was increased, and a strong statement of support from the Minister for Finance was issued, confirming the Government's commitment to the Irish financial system.  Consideration was also given around this time to the desirability of guaranteeing the liabilities of the banks.  While I did not support such a guarantee when it was first raised, I was conscious that if matters deteriorated significantly, and the Irish banking system faced imminent collapse, there would, in the absence of a European initiative, be no choice but to do so.</p> <p> The matter was subsequently discussed at joint meetings of the boards of the Central Bank and the regulatory authority and it was accepted that such an approach could be necessary in the light of the liquidity pressures.  In the meetings held during the weekend before the guarantee decision, it appeared likely that the financial institutions would have significant liquidity ... sufficient liquidity to get through the following week.  The liquidity outlook changed quickly on the morning of 29 September, when it became clear that, without assistance, Anglo would not be able to open for business the following morning.  Arising from contacts with the ECB, the view at the time was that Ireland was expected to stand behind its banks and a Lehman's-type situation was to be avoided.  When the Anglo situation arose, the major concern was how to prevent contagion from Anglo spreading to other banks, which were not then illiquid but were experiencing significant outflows.  Arrangements for the provision of assistance to Anglo had already been made in the ... the Central Bank and the necessary letter of comfort from the Minister for Finance was subsequently received.  Emergency liquidity assistance was extended to Anglo overnight to enable it to open for business on the morning of 30 September.</p> <p> The bigger issue was how to avoid the risk to the entire banking system materialising, with catastrophic consequences for the entire country.  Without decisive intervention, the risk of such an eventuality was very likely.  I supported the guarantee in these circumstances.  The question of emergency liquidity assistance, at national risk, for an Irish bank had been under consideration since the Northern Rock crisis in 2007.  The granting of ELA to Northern Rock, and its becoming public, had undermined public confidence in the bank, increased panic and gave rise to a bank run that eventually required nationalisation as well as guarantees by the UK Government.  Here, all the necessary arrangements, including the identification of non-ECB-eligible collateral in the banks and the legal arrangements for their transfer to the Central Bank, had been made.  The roles of the Minister for Finance and ECB had been fully taken on board.  The real concern in relation to ELA was the potentially serious effect it might have on a financial institution where market confidence had already been shaken, as well as the risk of contagion to other financial institutions.  The provision of ELA was not seen as a solution to the systemic crisis that had arisen.  The additional funding for Anglo agreed with the AIB and the Bank of Ireland in the context of the guarantee decision was designed to mitigate the risk of negative market reaction, with severe consequences for the credibility of the guarantee for the other banks if liquidity flows into Anglo did not materialise in sufficient quantity.</p> <p> The option of nationalising Anglo, together with the issue of a guarantee for the remaining banks, was considered on the night.  </p>  <p>         Overall, it was considered that the signal effect of nationalising Anglo would be more negative than positive and could raise markets' concerns about the systemic weakness of the financial system and, as with ELA, threaten the credibility of the guarantee.  Moreover, there was a strong view on the night that the Government had one opportunity to assuage the markets.  The markets were extremely volatile, with the decision of the US Congress to reject the proposed troubled assets relief programme, TARP, was likely to result in increased market volatility the following morning.  If the decisions taken were considered inadequate and failed, the consequences for the banking system would be devastating and lead to very serious economic and social fall-out for the country as a whole.  I supported the decision taken as being the one most likely to ensure that these consequences for the banking system and the country would be avoided.</p> <p> Before concluding, Chairman, I would like to take the opportunity to say that the Central Bank, in identifying the risks and vulnerabilities pertaining to the Irish financial system in its financial stability reports, considered at the time that its assessment was sufficiently strong and balanced and that it would provide the necessary guidance for the other authorities, market participants and the general public.  In hindsight, these assessments, as I have indicated, were not adequate.  I fully accept the role of the Central Bank and my role as Governor in underestimating the risks to the Irish financial system, which had such serious consequences for our country and from which we are only now beginning to emerge.  Again, I would like to reiterate my regret that the bank underestimated the risks that subsequently materialised.  These turned out to be much greater than we had anticipated.</p> <p> To conclude, Chairman, I hope that my recollection of events will be of assistance to the committee in the very important work that it is now undertaking.  Thank you very much.</p></speech>

Before I bring in this morning's lead questioners, Mr. Hurley, maybe if I can just deal with one or two matters quickly with you and maybe that is just to get a brief explanation from you as to how you saw your role as Governor of the Central Bank and, in that regard, did you see your role as being independent from the Department of Finance and from the banks themselves?</p></speech>

And one of the themes that has ran through that, Mr. Hurley ... one of the major issues was that the banks did not have access to consolidated data in relation to developers, to major projects or, in particular, to the commercial real estate sector.  The commercial bank did have access to that consolidated data and it ... it would appear that the commercial ... or that the Central Bank did not choose to do anything about the massive growths in the balance sheet of the banks.  </p>  <p>               The figures that we have quoted on a number of occasions, Mr. Hurley, from '01 to '08 is a 29% to 30% year-on-year increase in the balance sheet of the banks.  Could you comment why the Central Bank chose not to impact upon those enormous growths?</p></speech>

And the view in the reports if you ... when you go through them, is that the type of risk that eventually emerge weren't seen as likely at the time.  We regarded the banks as sound at the time.  We believed on the basis of the assessment coming through the financial stability reports that that was the position.  We did warn about the growth in lending and the growth in credit and that was set out very clearly in the reports, with all the warnings of the Central Bank in each of the reports.  We set out the warnings in relation to the growth under the different aggregates regularly and I pointed it out when launching financial stability reports on each occasion, and my introductory statement to the financial stability reports would have pointed out these risks.</p></speech>

One of the criticisms was that the banks were unaware that certain people who they had lent money to also had a cross-collateralisation, a cross-securitisation of loans with another bank and each bank was unaware that that other ... that same individual was indebted to another institution.  On how many occasions did the Central Bank request the top ten exposures from the primary financial institutions within the commercial real estate sector?</p></speech>

There was very good co-operation with the Financial Regulator throughout this period but we didn&rsquo;t encroach on the functions of the Financial Regulator.  The Financial Regulator was established as a separate entity with its own board.  It had its own responsibilities, and we were divested of those responsibilities in the 2003 Act, and so we had to accept that we were no longer regulating the Irish financial institutions.  So we had a ... we certainly had got a stability role but it very much depended on the accumulation of data and the information we were getting and then assessments being made on the basis of that.  We were no longer regulating the Irish financial institutions.</p></speech>

It advised very strongly that these would be looked at and these were.  The Minister took a decision in 2004.  He came back in 2005 having conducted two consultants' reports and set out a path by which these would be, by which these would be adjusted.  That was one key element that was part and parcel of what the Central Bank did.  The Minister responded at that time.  Secondly, I set out in my opening statement the path that we expected interest rates to take and the impact that interest rates would have on the growth in credit.  This was clearly set out and we knew that the mortgage rate would double.  We knew it would go to 6% and we spent '04 and '05 saying this.  We went to the banks with round-table discussions in December 2004 and pointed out what was going to happen the interest rate.</p></speech>

The increases were much later than had been expected.  So the assessment set out by the Central Bank at that time was that this would ease over time but it took longer than expected and it was really the additional credit and growth in credit that took place in that intervening period which has done the bulk of the damage.</p></speech>

The annual report went directly to the Minister and the Government and he presented it.  The financial stability reports were discussed by me with the Minister on many occasions.  In addition we would have talked about the evolution of the economy, talked about the risks that were emerging and our assessment overall of the banking system given to the Minister, so let us be clear about it, we did not expect that the banks were going to implode, and the Minister was never told by me that the banks were going to implode.  What the Government was told and the Minister was told that there were risks to the system, that property was a significant risk, that it would adjust, and in that adjustment there would be implications for the economy.  The primary implication that was seen was the fiscal implication.  It was seen that there would be a very very large gap to be filled, but it wasn't expected in the course of that period that this would destabilise the banking system.</p></speech>

Where this all changed of course was as the international crisis evolved but leading up to that particular period the assessments were the assessments and we believed very strongly that they were correct.</p></speech>

I just want to pick up on that point.

And we expected within that ... within that pattern, that financial stability would be ... would be secure.  And that ... in my opening statement, I talked about how I saw that happening as we came through 2004 and 2005.  We ... we expected ... we didn't expect what happened subsequently in terms of the continuation of that but then the interest rate increases came on board and managed to push back against growth.</p></speech>

And if that is your view today, can I ask you how you can ... how you can express that view given what we know today ... in terms of credit concentration limits, in terms of over-exposure to property, in terms of a commercial and housing property bubble, and in terms of the fact that some financial institutions were nearly exclusively devoted to lending into the property sector?  How can the statement that you have made today sit ... sit beside the evidence that we have today in 2015 that this is what was going on within certain financial institutions in the periods from 2004 up until 2007 and 2008 where you believe that financial stability was sound?</p></speech>

I'm asking you for your view today, which ... you've expressed your view that the financial stability of the system was sound up until the period of 2008.  And again, financial stability in ... and it's in the memorandum of understanding in Vol. 1: "A financial stability matter may include but would not be restricted to any event which could threaten the stability of an important financial institution or a number of institutions. "  So how could you ... how can you say that the financial stability was sound today, right up until 2008 when we know of the ... of some of the evidence in terms of concentration of lending, exclusive lending to property sectors by some financial institutions, unenforceable ability of collateral in large numbers by certain institutions and all of what we has flowed from the years 2008 that the public are aware of?  How do you make that statement?  How do you convince this committee that, even today, the financial stability, which is the individual institutions as well as in the memorandum of understanding, were sound at that period?</p></speech>

Yes, but that ... that was our assessment, Deputy.  As you ... as you ... as you moved through the particular reports, we made that assessment on the basis of all the data at the time.

Well, you are asking me my assessment at the time.  My assessment at the time was the assessment set out in the financial stability reports.  I mean the world changed in the meantime but we, in good faith, made assessments at the time.  And, clearly, all of this changed over the short period of time.  Now, we did expect as a result of the reports going through 2004, 2005, 2006 ... we did expect, you know, that the assessments there would be sufficient to assist the stability of the system, but the pressures that came on subsequently changed all of that.</p></speech>

You've made the point that you believe the financial stability of the system was sound up until the period of 2008.  Today is 2015.  I am asking you how do you stand over those comments that the individual institutions which were part of that financial stability were sound up until that period, given all that we know in the intervening years?  Do you still ... are you still of that view?  Are you telling the committee that you're still of the view that the financial stability was sound in 2008?

Mr. Hurley, I would like to refer to the 2004 board discussions, which have been summarised for the committee in the booklet of core documents.  It's in Vol. 1, page 106.  This is in relation to a discussion on the 2004 financial stability report and the summary as given reads, "a collapse in property prices would not only affect the quality of security for bank loans, it would also have widespread economic implications as the construction industry was now a major component in the Irish economy."  With that in mind, Mr. Hurley, is it reasonable or not to say that in 2004 the board of the Central Bank had taken note of the systemic nature of the Irish property loan book and that the Irish Central Bank was aware the Irish commercial and residential property loan book had the potential to cause systemic problems?</p></speech>

Our overall assessment set out in the reports is pretty clear.</p></speech>

I'll go through the four specific actions that the Governor - Governor Honohan - came back ... because I remember quite specifically at the time he asked for further time to give consideration to this because he wanted to answer this as accurately as possible and, therefore, was afforded the opportunity to write back to the committee so he could give it the fullest consideration, and this is his fullest consideration.  He goes on to say that:</p><blockquote>Two legislative provisions are relevant.  Section 23 of the Central Bank Act 1971 [and this] provides that the Bank has a general power to require banks or a particular bank to maintain specific ratios; this power could conceivably have been used to impose a wide range of limits, including minimum capital and liquidity requirement[s] etc.</blockquote>  <p>He then goes on in the next paragraph to say, &quot;Another provision, specifically Section 33D of the 1942 Central Bank Act, gave the Governor (having regard to his ESCB tasks) or the Board of the Bank (in relation to its objectives and most appropriately the objective of [continuing ... or] contributing to financial stability [he just quotes the Act again] ... power to issue guidelines to the IFSRA as to policies and principles it was required to implement in performing functions, or exercising powers, of the Bank.&quot;  He then goes on to say that in the ... on the second page of it, &quot;in relation to the power of the Authority to issue requirements on any bank under Section 23A of the 1971 Act as to the composition of its assets and its liabilities, including liquidity buffers, sectoral limits etc.&quot;  And then, in the next paragraph: &quot;In addition, it may be relevant to add that the Governor was empowered, under Section 17A of the Central Bank Act 1971, to authorise a suitably qualified person to investigate the business of the holder of a licence or ... related [policy]&quot;  In fact the letter is up on the committee's website because it was taken or deemed to be additional evidence.  Were you aware of those powers?</p></speech>

The old powers were really the ... I think it was said ... even said here in this particular letter .. that they would not normally be used.  The first power really had to do with European operations.  It had nothing to do with the powers that were subsequently given to the Financial Regulator under the new Act.  And under the new Act, we certainly had power to give guidance to the Financial Regulator but we did that through the reports themselves.</p></speech>

I ... we can go in and debate the broader implications of the statutes and Acts and all the rest of it but for ... just for now, were you aware of these powers?  Because when Professor Honohan came back to you he was specifically asked with regard to your tenure and what was ... what was the legislative architecture during your term as Governor, not preceding or proceeding your term.

I will rephrase that question and reframe it again just to get 100% certainty from you, Mr. Hurley.  Professor Honohan was wrote ... wrote to this committee after being asked a very specific question with regard to your powers as Governor following his deliberations with this committee on the Honohan report.  He took time out to give a very considered response.  He felt he wasn't able to answer it comprehensively enough when ... in his engagement with us and subsequently followed up that response with a very considered response outlining a series of actions which, he is saying, were your powers.  Whether you availed of them or not is what's not being debated right now, but that they were your powers.</p></speech>

The letter from the Office of the Financial Regulator is clear that there was an individual institution that had no access to ECB monetary operations, had not been accessing the wholesale markets for funding in recent months and were relying on retail and corporate deposits initiatives for liquidity.  Can you clarify to the committee as to whether this was brought to your attention or not?</p></speech>

Would you concur with the ... with what you see in the letter from the office of the regulator, that this does lead, or potentially could lead, to a financial stability issue?</p></speech>

I hope I didn't give that impression.

Central Bank would have to be involved and look at those, but, in general, the Central Bank's responsibility was a responsibility to contribute to financial stability and, like other central banks, the way that functioned was through the financial stability reports but it didn't have a responsibility for financial regulation.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty has already quoted to you from the memorandum of understanding.

Now, in ... From the 1990s, lateish, on into the 2000s, house prices were rising crazily every year, profiteering in land and in speculation was rife and daily in the newspapers.  Nyberg, in evidence, said that the banks complained to him that they had to chase Anglo, which was growing, in Professor Black's words, "like crazy", and the Central Bank didn't appear to notice the danger that that would bring.</p></speech>

What we did about it was we identified the risks.  It was the basis on which regulatory action would be taken.  We publicised the risks; we had round-table discussions with the banks themselves; we had press conferences where we outlined the risks; but we were not regulating financial institutions.</p></speech>

It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand, the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and landowners.  Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.</blockquote>  <p>How could a commentator who hasn't an iota of the resources and the responsibilities of the Central Bank be so spot on so early in the bubble, and the institution that is responsible for all this does nothing?</p></speech>

The assessment is the best assessment that people can make at the time, and it's on the basis of the information, the broad information that's available at the time.  Of course, you will have individuals who'll see things differently and may turn out to be very prescient, but the overall assessment still has to be made by a central bank on the basis of the totality of the information.</p></speech>

Now you have long experience in the financial sector.  You know, for example, the implosion of the banking system in Sweden in the late '80s and early '90s as a result of a speculative bubble.  </p>  <p>               Alan Ahearne gave evidence here.  He published, in 2005, or the Federal Reserve in America published for him, a study of 44 housing bubbles.  Professor Morgan Kelly studied also.  All could tell us that there was a tried and trusted historical precedent here of bubble, banks making massive profits and lending, and then a crash.  How could the institution supposedly responsible for controlling, supposedly controlling, and stopping all that not see the same thing?</p></speech>

It's certainly true in certain situations, but the broad evidence, looking across the whole gamut of research, does not necessarily lead to that conclusion.  The conclusion come to ... that came to in the Central Bank reports was the conclusion we came to, that, overall, the stability of the system was sound at ... on those particular occasions.  Over the period of time, of course, that changed and the risk changed, and so did our assessment change as we went, for example, on to 2006.  But up to then, we had a clear view, which we set out., set out in the reports, and there were many, many commentators and many economists that would have taken the same view.</p></speech>

Just following on on an unrelated matter, if I can maybe talk about monetary union with you, Mr. Hurley.

I mean it's a very, very significant change.  It means that we didn't have control over our own interest rates.  We were looking at interest rates in general across the euro area.  Now the ECB and ... and ... didn't have a responsibility for overall regulation and prudential supervision of the sector, but, of course, it has a different responsibility now as a result of this crisis but, certainly, at the time there was a definite lacuna there and that's now been filled.</p></speech>

In your statement, you stated that no request for funding or resources from the Financial Regulator was ever refused.  In your belief, did the regulator have sufficient staff and resources to carry out its statutory function?  And was that a factor in the crisis?</p></speech>

There would've been a consultative mechanism with the Minister.  And I think the building up of staffing in the Financial Regulator over a period of time, starting in 2003, unfortunately, coincided with the building up and developments of the problems in the Irish economy.  The timing of the creation of the Financial Regulator was unfortunate when one looks back in hindsight, where you were splitting responsibilities within an institution.  And, also, the Financial Regulator was given very significant responsibilities for the consumer function at the time so it was balancing these functions in a whole new environment.  I think it was unfortunate that the functions were split at that particular moment in time just as, in fact, the bubble was developing.</p></speech>

And given that the Central Bank had and had subsequently 1,200 staff, the fact that so few were devoted to prudential supervision of banks, was that not a mis-allocation of resources?</p></speech>

So it was a different approach to regulation.  It wasn't unique to Ireland; it was followed in very many places.  What we now know, and I think this would be accepted in hindsight by everyone, that it wasn't intrusive enough in the environment in which we found ourselves.</p></speech>

Governor Honohan, as you'll know, he also has that a three-person team was responsible for Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank in 2005 so that couldn't possibly have been adequate, given the size of both of the bodies and the problems that they encountered subsequently.</p></speech>

And that was consistent with the overall approach at the time to regulation adopted in the Government's White Paper, for example.  So I think the approach was determined by the regulator itself on the basis of principles-based supervision.</p></speech>

I think the Central Bank now has about 1,500 staff; that's the target.  How many of those should be engaged in the prudential supervision of banks?</p></speech>

And that was the orthodoxy at the time, it was the philosophy at the time, but that's now entirely changed.  In the situation in which we now find ourselves in, there has to be a far more hands-on approach to regulation, and I think that's ... that's being adopted everywhere now and the new structures within the European Union and the basis on which the ECB, for example, has now a role in relation to regulating major institutions is part and parcel of that.  So it's a significant change and, I think, an appropriate change.</p></speech>

It's on page 73.  As early as August 2000 a Central Bank official was aware of problems in the case study (i) firm and it never seems to have been corrected right through to the crisis.  And some of that was on the Central Bank's watch and some of it was on the Financial Regulator's watch.  The picture I get is that the Central Bank wasn't engaging in supervision and then there was a turf war after the 2003 Act and that contributed seriously to the problem.</p></speech>

I mean, after the 2003 Act was implemented, the legislation was clear.  It was something I didn't favour or support but the legislation was clear and the legislation divested the Central Bank of prudential supervision.  In that particular situation, the responsibility ... the responsibility was clear.  I didn't see any turf war at that time.  The turf war was over.</p></speech>

I mean, if you go into a rules-based system and a detailed system, the starting levels will have been very much higher.  But the view at the time was that principles-based supervision was the appropriate way to go.  This has suffered a sea-change since, it's completely different now.  We know that rules-based ... to some extent, is required.  And, of course, once we get into rules-based supervision or the new regulatory system gets into rules-based supervision, it will probably be only a matter of time before the squeals will come that this is too heavy and we will be eventually forced back to another balance.  But the lessons of what ... of this crisis is that we simply can&rsquo;t divest rules and solely rely on principles.</p></speech>

I mean, when the crisis hit, the Central Bank had to get involved in ECB funding and had to get involved in an area of liquidity management which was the responsibility of the Financial Regulator.  We were at the edge of our legal powers when the crisis hit, yet, nevertheless, the only way it could be managed is by me talking to the chairman of the Financial Regulator and saying: "I know what the legislation says but can we manage it on this basis?"  So that's the difficulty.  When you have these distinctions, they seem fine, you know, in legislation but when problems arise, it's very, very difficult to manage a system on that basis.</p></speech>

Okay.  In that letter, that referred to two studies in terms of price ... price overvaluation of 15% to 20%.  At the time, that was the type of overvaluation that we would have been steering the market and the media about ... that level of overvaluation where we believed as a result of the reigniting of the market in 2006 and the significant increase ... unexpected increase that took place in lending in 2006 ... that there was a level of overvaluation in the market.  Now, there was a discussion throughout 2006, to the best of my memory, about whether or not the Central Bank to actually promulgate a level of overvaluation ... should we plump for the level of overvaluation and we decided not to do that.  We felt that it would be inappropriate and instead we steered towards an overvaluation of roughly 15% to 20%.</p></speech>

I think from documentation we received it would be with individual institutions in relation to the stress testing.  But when we look then at the IMF report from 2006 and it's Vol. 2, page 19, and this is the country report from August, it seems clear from that that the IMF is commenting on the stress tests but not commenting on tests that they've been involved in but tests that the Central Bank has conducted: "Central Bank officials noted that recent stress tests indicate that the major lenders have adequate buffers to cover a range of shocks."  So this is the IMF noting what the Central Bank has noted, it's not an IMF judgment as to the stress test.</p></speech>

Now we know that there's no test that would have enabled us to cope with the shock that emerged.  There was no test anywhere that would have enabled us to deal with that.  This ... the crisis that emerged across the world, the globe and in the financial sector generally was way beyond stress tests.  No stress test was able to measure for that.</p></speech>

Enormous amount of resources have gone into this.  They're far, far more rigorous but that type of resource for stress testing wasn't spent anywhere before the crisis.</p></speech>

No banking system at the time was assessed against the type of shock that occurred.</p></speech>

I mean I said in my opening statement ... it underestimated the interaction of the two shocks.  The worldwide shock, which I think was unprecedented, and many have said not seen since 1930, you might even go back to the First World War, but that shock interacted with domestic vulnerabilities and that's what essentially caused the difficulty.</p></speech>

Can I start by asking you in relation to the Honohan report which pointed out that, prior to the financial crisis in 2008, there were no sanctions imposed on credit institutions and none that might be said to have reflected significant prudential concerns.  Can you comment on why, in your view as then Governor, as distinct from regulator, no enforcement actions were taken during that period in relation to prudential regulatory breaches, in your view?</p></speech>

I can't comment in the sense that that was a regulatory issue that wasn't being pursued by the regulator and the regulatory authority, that was the function.  And presumably it was on the basis of their assessment.</p></speech>

Professor Honohan examines in detail in his report the separation of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, and he arrives at the following conclusion, "Though few would now defend the institutional structure invented for the organisation in 2003, it would be hard to show that its complexity materially contributed to the major failures that occurred."  Do you agree with this statement?</p></speech>

Now we will never know what the counterfactual is, we just won't know.  But, when you look now at what's happening internationally and look at the forces that are in play to unify central banking with financial regulation, it's being done for a reason, and the reason is to try and bring some coherence to the overall function.</p></speech>

Do you agree?</p></speech>

We had financial stability ... instability, and that has occurred because, as I said, of the interaction of two ... and two forces - the enormous international force, which wasn't seen by the Central Bank; indeed, it wasn't seen by many domestic or international commentators, but this reacted with a domestic vulnerability.  And the domestic vulnerability of course, as we now know, includes a very significant depletion of risk management practices in individual banks.  That was not known at the time.</p></speech>

It would be a broad view and it seems to me that the broad view that it would adopt would be very like the broad view that we adopted in the financial stability reports.  But when you go through the different lists in the financial stability reports, they're outlined in the reports and they're set out in the reports and a guideline would have to be fairly broad.

The first power relates to ratios.  It relates to ratios for the conduct of monetary policy to create a credit shortage in the market to enable interest rates to function.  It's not a power that I know has been used anywhere in Europe for prudential regulatory purposes.  I think you may find an example of it in Africa or Asia.</p></speech>

In my view, because we were discussing these in the context of the reports, and because the reports were the framework, as far as we were concerned that was the guidance.  So if we thought it was necessary to issue guidance beyond that to the Financial Regulator, we would have done so and we would have discussed it at the board and I'm quite sure we would have found a way to do that, despite the particular provisions.

I thought the ...

So, is the practice ... or the practice at that time of the Governor of the Central Bank always being a former director general, is it in any way flawed do you think, or not, on the basis that the ... the Secretary General is very much an advisory role, whereas heading a Central Bank needs ... to act, to be decisive, to take decisions ... under the '71 Act, albeit your interpretation was not to issue the kind of guidelines ... as some of the rest may interpret from the Honohan letter ... but did that hamper your ability to do that?  In essence, were you qualified enough to do the job with the benefit of hindsight?</p></speech>

You're given a different role and the role then gives you an independent role - to give advice and to  ... to ... to carry out that advice.  And that's done in the form of the publications that were issued and the press conferences I held.  I think, Deputy, if you look at the press coverage over the years, you will find that I was praised for being at loggerheads with the Government on occasion because I had to stand up and say things that weren't appreciated.  And that's in the press coverage.  So, the reality is you have to take an independent line and you have to do and say things that are the responsibility of a Central Bank.  But the ... the career path in the governing council ... of the majority of the people at the particular moment in time would have been very like my own.</p></speech>

I just need to deal with one matter before I move on.  And that's just to come back to Senator MacSharry's earlier question is ... can you comment upon your relationship with the Ministers for Finance ... Minister McCreevy and Minister Cowen during your tenure as Governor in terms of regularity of meetings that you would have had with them on an annualised basis?  Just in the documents that we would have here before us ... it ... it would show that you would've had scheduled meetings on a regular basis with the Minister for Finance at that time.

I can't put an exact time on them because maybe the ... the formal meetings might be once every two months or more ... seven or eight meetings a year.  But, of course, we would be meeting in addition to that, outside the formal meetings, at the different fora and at different events.  What ... as ... as a matter of course, meetings were arranged particularly around ... at the time of publications or at the time of issuing letters to the Minister.  You would always take the occasion to have a discussion in those ... at those times.  So, it was fairly frequent and there was never an occasion where a request for a meeting was denied.</p></speech>

I said that the liquidity situation in the banks had actually fallen in terms of their access to ECB funding.  You said:</p><blockquote>Our understanding of the liquidity situation in terms of the Irish financial institutions is that there has not been a reduction in the overall level of lending being given by the ECB to the Irish financial institutions, whether it is in the broad financial institutions encompassing the IFSC or the domestic institutions.  In both cases the level of funding, if anything, is marginally up.</blockquote>  <p>Finally, then, Mr. Hurley-----</p></speech>

Yet, we have a letter a short time earlier on 1 March stating that one financial institution had no access to ECB funding at all.  So-----</p></speech>

But the reality is I don't have enough information from what's here in the letter to understand and to answer the question.

There was a particular issue here, but I am not familiar with it.</p></speech>

I mean, in 2005, going up to 2005, we took the action I mentioned in relation to taxation.  We saw the growth in interest rates and I would have known that there was an interest rate cycle coming, and we did our best by going out publicly to speak about this.  We spoke about it on quite a number of occasions and said interest rates are going to double.  It wasn't just ... I had to be very careful as a member of the governing council, but the economic staff went out and did this.  So we had this understanding of the incentives for property being taken away, interest rates increasing, exchange rates against the dollar and against sterling increasing and also, at the same time, a very very substantial increase in oil prices.  Oil prices went up to $70 at its peak in 2005 and I think it was a 70% increase in 12 months, and a 120% increase going back.  So they were the issues that were driving the mentality at the time.</p></speech>

I mean, the growth in property lending is all over our financial stability reports, going from 2004 up.  So the aggregate lending and the aggregate approach to property was well set out in those reports.  That, of course, was part and parcel of the problem.  But looking into 2006, then, what would we have done differently, which was your question?  The reality is when you look at the response of lending to those measures which were taking place.  We knew, for example, at the end of 2005 that property prices were reducing somewhat, not just here but internationally.  We had a forward indicator in 2005 which was about house registration, so we had an idea of how house building was going to go.  But the reality is, when we went into 2006, all those indicators were suggesting a certain direction.  It went the opposite way.</p></speech>

This is the point I am making in my comment to you earlier, Deputy.  We thought, as a result of the taxation, the increase in interest rates and the two very significant pressures of exchange rates and oil prices, that there would be a dampening demand in 2006.

As far as we were concerned, it was coming down.  It looked, from all the indicators going into 2006, that that was so, but it reversed in 2006.  Then what we did, Deputy, was our financial stability report of 2006 is extraordinarily strong.  Also, in that particular report for the first time we talked about the fundamentals no longer supporting the property price.  Now, for a central bank that was a very strong statement in 2006, at that particular moment in time.  But the reason it was done is because of the reversal that had taken place, which was completely not expected.</p></speech>

Briefly, at the start, with the benefit of hindsight, do you feel that the discussions that took place at ECOFIN level and, indeed, financial committee level in Europe on macroeconomic issues and on financial stability in the period leading up to the crash were sufficient?  What decisions came from those discussions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-21a.608" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052100002#BB03500"><p>My memory of the discussions was that it was in the context of what expectations were at the time.  We were expecting strong growth here.  </p>  <p>         We were expecting internationally strong growth.  The discussions of ECOFIN would have been the same.  It was ... there was a very positive background.  But what happened was entirely different.  The crisis that erupted from the United States was wholly unexpected by Europe and wholly unexpected at ECOFIN.  And the consequences of that was that ... really the earlier actions being taken in a more benign environment don't sit well with the result that ... with the actions that had to be taken subsequently.</p> <p> The scale of the adjustment that took place following the decisions of the United States was ... has been absolutely extraordinary.  No one expected Lehman's to fall, no one expected that it would be bankrupt.  Europe was in shock as a consequence of that.  And the United States, I think, subsequently, was in shock.  The scale of adjustment and damage that was done by that decision is immense.  And I think, as we go through our assessment of this over the years, that the real severity of that shock is going to really come home.  We ... I know now in some of the reports there's a suggestion that, you know, heavily qualified ... that that shock wasn't that significant.  I think it's hugely significant.  And I recall that when you had economists before this meeting recently - I think it was Mr. McArdle - and I would agree with his view ... essentially, the adjustment as a result of Lehman's and the shock to confidence in the banking system, in my view, has been hugely underestimated.</p></speech>

I want to turn you now, if I can, to core document, Vol. 3 on page 55.  It is briefing on financial stability issues from 7 May 2008.  In the middle ... page 55 ... the middle of page 55 under a heading, "Contingency Planning".  It's on the screen in front of you, I think, there, as well.  Do you see the heading, "Contingency Planning"?  I want to put the quote to you.  It says that: "The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank have been working very closely with the banks to monitor their liquidity position on an ongoing basis and seek to identify risks to their sustainability at the earliest possible stage."  With respect to the Central Bank, which is referenced in the quote, do you believe that you were identifying those risks at the earliest possible stage?</p></speech>

All through 2008, once the liquidity crisis happened in the United States - we touched on this earlier ... and here the Central Bank would have been at the edge of its legal powers and responsibilities in the context of the division of responsibilities that had taken place.  We ... because of our role in relation to ECB funding and as lender of last resort, we took much a longer role in relation to this.  And we attended meetings with the Financial Regulator on liquidity issues, not all of them but very many of them, throughout 2008, and I would have attended those meetings.</p></speech>

And then, finally, in my last couple of minutes ... the following page, page 58 ...it's what you were referencing yourself earlier about the meetings that were taking place with chief executive officers.

Irish banks in a crisis situation and to respond to any problem  in small institutions in a collaborative fashion."  I want to ask you about the extent of those ...

There wouldn't have been a specific discussion about it but it would have arisen in the context of the liquidity meetings with, say, the financial institutions.  And on occasion I would have ...

No, the issue that arose in 2008, if I remember rightly, was that the Minister announced, as a result of the ... as a result of the economic and financial problems, I think he brought in a budget which required all institutions to cut back to some extent.  My memory of that is that in the discussions, any discussions were prefaced that organisations must fulfil their statutory responsibilities, but we still, I think, were required to try and respond in some way to the Minister's decision, as a public institution.  And we did that in a sensible way, both on the ... the Central Bank side had far more scope, I think, to do that, in that we could, you know, cut back on some support services.

There's a soft and there's a gradual, and it seems to me that very many of the boom-busts ended up in gradual ... or, the over-valuations ended up in the gradual adjustment, and when you look at many of the views at the time, and, indeed, the contrarian views at the time that have been cited here, there was a view that that over-valuation would dissipate over a period of time, over a period of years.  That was exactly the same view that we had of the over-valuation that might have been there in 2006, that we really expected with the action that was being taken that this would dissipate and be absorbed, with difficulty, over a period of time.

We had already started an easing of property prices and an easing of credit growth.  So, you know, what's a central bank to do in that situation, particularly, where it has an interest in a gradual landing or a soft landing, and it would like over-valuation to dissipate in and orderly way?  What it doesn't do - and I think somebody else has said it before this committee - is it doesn't frighten the horses.  What it does is it tries to be balanced and prudent in its assessment and tries not to bring about the risks that it's trying to avoid.</p></speech>

I need to move to it because we need to break for lunch as well and I need to bring the leads in as well to wrap up.  Just to wrap up with some matters directly myself with you, Mr. Hurley, and I just want to reference the Nyberg report.  It's evidence book Vol. 1, page 215, under the paragraph 441.  In that paragraph, it says ... the heading is &quot;The Central Bank Pre-Crisis (2003 to mid-2007)&quot;:</p><blockquote>As in the case of the Financial Regulator, there was a major domestic policy failure at the Central Bank  in respect of the maintenance of financial stability. Not only did the CB (with a small number of contrarians at board level) seriously underestimate the nature and extent of the risks in the Irish financial system but it was content to express only nuanced and somewhat indirect concerns on possible risks rather than study contingent worst-case scenarios. Had it done so, it might have issued stronger warnings (at least confidentially to the Government) or even taken appropriate action.</blockquote>  <p>Would you care to elaborate upon this statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-21a.697" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052100002#EE01000"><p>I think that... I've said in my opening statement that at a particular moment in time the warnings by the Central Bank should have been stronger in hindsight but we didn't know that at the time.  Now, in relation to the idea that I would have had a different view and that I would've given this to the Government, I have a problem with that.  I don't have a problem where, for example, there's a specific issue that the Government might not have been aware of where they should be aware of something specific but I think the implication here is that you have a financial stability report or an annual report and the Central Bank publishes a view and that is the Central Bank view.  So the notion that there would be another view I have a difficulty with, as a public servant.  As far as I'm concerned, that was the view.  That was the view given to the Government and if I had a different view, it would've been in the published report.</p></speech>

I just want to move on and then I will bring immediately Senator D'Arcy after this.  Did you feel that the level of European macroeconomic and prudential supervision was adequate in the years between 2003 and 2007 and, in that regard and in your recollection, were there discussions on a European level at meetings you participated on in regard to strong credit growth in Ireland, house price inflation and substantial borrowings by the Irish banks in the European and overseas markets?</p></speech>

As part of the reports, there would've been a feeding in of the situation in different countries but there was nothing specific that I can recall in relation to Ireland.  In terms of the oversight generally, we now know that the establishment of the systemic risk board is a huge development in the context of the architecture for dealing with these crises in future.  It didn't exist at the time.  The role of the ECB at the time was more curtailed than that.  That's a big change and that's ... that will make a significant difference.</p></speech>

There would be meetings, formal meetings in Frankfurt.  There would be informal meetings and you would have teleconferences.  And during all of that period, there would've been frequent contact with the president and the executive board in the context of those meetings.  Teleconferences became more frequent in the middle of the crisis, particularly at the ... towards the end September, that particular period, 2008, because all governors were in their capitals and Europe was in serious difficulty.  And they needed to be at home as well as discussing together and the main mechanism for doing that was teleconferencing at the time.  So that would have been the structure of contact.</p></speech>

I want to return to a question that I asked you, one of my final questions in the earlier session, and it was in relation to the Central Bank's reaction to the market ... the share price drop in ... of financial institutions here in this State, and I think you mentioned that this was a market adjustment at the time.  Can I say to you, in particular, because it was become known, and I'll pick out one day in March because I asked you over the period of March, but St. Patrick's Day 2008 was known as the St. Patrick's Day massacre in the financial circles.  It seen one financial institution, Anglo, it's well-publicised, its share price dropped by 23% at one point, finishing that day at 15% down, wiping a billion euro off the value of the bank, and losing, for every minute of trading, losing &euro;1.6 million.  Do you still believe that that was just a market adjustment, or do you think that there was something more?</p></speech>

And we would be looking at liquidity, looking at the implications for that for people ... rolling over liquidity in particular financial institutions, and so the consequences for central banking at the time would have been primarily through that avenue and that focus, and it would have been the consequences, the implications of a drop in share price for other things, and we were very much looking at it from that point of view and looking at the liquidity-raising power of particular institutions, and the ECB backdrop or collateral backdrop at the time.  That's the way, primarily, it would have been looked at.</p></speech>

My feeling at the time was that was largely a regulatory issue, but because he phoned me and asked me when the call came through from the institution, I met the institution, together with the Financial Regulator, for an initial meeting, and when the issue emerged, as I thought it would, that it would be primarily a regulatory issue, it was taken on by the Financial Regulator.</p></speech>

I would like to re-emphasise the point that I made earlier that we cannot compensate ourselves for commodity price rises over which we have no control.  If we [do] attempt to do so, then we risk repeating the mistakes of the past, from which the economy took so long to recover.</blockquote>  <p>With that in mind, can I ask you how you stand over those comments, and the fact that your own remuneration in 2003 was &euro;290,869, and for the year that that report was released, 2007, it had increased to &euro;368,703, with the addition of a car included-----</p></speech>

Those relationships didn't change during my period, there was no additions, pensions, superannuation, or anything else except normal Civil Service terms in my case, and subsequent to the crisis, there would have been voluntary reductions in pay taken which were subsumed in the statutory reductions later on, which would be very significant.  I accept the point, that public service salaries, at the time, were too high, and President Trichet, when he was here, spoke about the competitiveness issues that he raised, and the issues that you just quoted.  And I think they're valid points, and I think, in hindsight, we didn't in our pay determination processes here pay enough attention to that.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, again, Mr. Hurley.  I want to firstly start by referencing evidence that was given to the inquiry by Mr. Brian Goggin, former chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland.  In the evidence that he gave when he was here, he said that, in his opinion, and it was concerning Bank of Ireland's request to the Central Bank to have the ECB collateral rules expanded, and I want to quote him directly: "the Central Bank of Ireland was, for whatever reason unwilling to push the issue with the ECB".  And that was in the days prior to 29 September 2008.  Do you have any comment on Mr. Goggin's observation?</p></speech>

And the best example of that is the asset-backed securities debate, which involved a significant enlargement of collateral for us.  But also around that time ... around the time prior to the guarantee, in the period when I was ill, within the period when I came back, there was interventions by Ireland to try and expand the collateral list.  Now, our interventions ... we would have known that it takes a considerable time to adjust collateral.  It has to be done as a unified list for all parties and not just for an individual country.  So ... but, nevertheless, the point was made.  We weren't successful at that particular time because it would have required an extension of collateral for all countries, not just Ireland, so I think the suggestion-----</p></speech>

I want to just retrace my steps a little bit.  When we had Mr. Boucher in previously from Bank of Ireland, I put to him a quote from Bank of Ireland minutes.  </p>  <p>               It's on the record of the inquiry and I just want your reaction to that particular quote.  He said on this point, the CEO, Mr. Goggin, and the CFO, "sensed a marked reluctance on the part of the CBI [Central Bank of Ireland] to approach the ECB and also formed the impression that the CBI [Central Bank of Ireland] was less well informed on market developments [...] for all Irish banks than would have been expected."</p></speech>

In fact, in the course of the crisis, because we had a smaller banking system, and because we had developed very close links with the banks, particularly in the type of meetings I referred to earlier ... my assessment is we had far more information than some of the larger countries where the logistics were much more difficult.</p></speech>

Can I ask then in relation to the &euro;1.5 billion bond that fell due from Anglo to a German bank, which we don't know which bank it is, which has been discussed by several witnesses, again primarily the Bank of Ireland witnesses who have come before the inquiry?  Were you aware of that liability coming due prior to the discussions that you had with Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

In this particular situation we knew exactly what the liquidity position was and we knew that there &hellip; that particularly as of the Monday, when the liquidity situation significantly deteriorated, we knew of the potential there was for a problem the following morning.  But all the arrangements were made &hellip; all the arrangements were made in terms of asset swops, the legal arrangements were done.  There was going to be no default.  We had those arrangements in place.  The only piece that was actually missing from &hellip; the particular jigsaw, was that the letter of comfort from the Minister was to come, and it did come later that day.  So the whole circle was &hellip; the whole circle was there.  Now, having said this, just &hellip; this is a very important point.  As Governor of the Central Bank, I can&rsquo;t talk to other banks about the specific internal affairs of another bank.

I want to turn now to specifically the night of the guarantee itself &hellip; and we had evidence from Mr. Goggin again, the former CEO of Bank of Ireland, who was the CEO at the time.  You&rsquo;re on page 22 and 23 of the transcript of that particular meeting, where he said that after discussing with his colleagues from capital markets in the treasury side of Bank of Ireland, he then offered his opinion to Government on the night of the guarantee that dated subordinated debt be covered by the bank guarantee.  Subsequent to that, Mr. Burrows, in evidence here, gave a different interpretation of events, stating that he recalls no discussion on subordinated liabilities having taken place, and Mr. Gleeson and Mr. Sheehy indicated that neither of them had sought on behalf of AIB to include subordinated liabilities.  Firstly, I want to ask you for your recollection of those discussions, if you could, briefly, maybe?</p></speech>

I think I went over to Government Buildings probably around 6.30 p.m. ... around that time, and there would have been ... I'm not sure when the meeting proper started, chaired by the Taoiseach and with the Minister for Finance, but some time later, and there would have been at that stage about ... maybe about 7 o'clock, what I would describe as the first plenary session chaired by the Taoiseach.  </p>  <p>         And that particular meeting started with a detailed discussion on the liquidity position, on the threats facing the system, how the individual banks were.  I would have given a broad view on the situation as we knew it.  We had very good information and the Financial Regulator ... and the chairman of the Financial Regulator would have gone on in detail about individual banks.  All of this information would have been supplied and sent to the Department of Finance in the course of the day.  There would've been a lot of contact during that day because the liquidity position changed as and from the beginning of that morning on the 29th.  At the weekend, we had a view that we would probably get through the following week.  That changed on Monday and we knew that we were in a critical situation ... we knew for a start that one bank would be illiquid unless we did something that particular day but the contagion effect and the implications for the other banks would have been enormously serious.  So at the meeting, we outlined all of this ... the Department of Finance would already have had the data ... I think the Minister and the Taoiseach probably were up to speed but we gave the up-to-date information, as we saw it, because things had been evolving on an hourly basis on the course of the day.</p></speech>

My memory of the meeting was that the meeting was introduced by Mr. Gleeson who went through a sort of short presentation on the situation.  Others came in and spoke and at a particular stage ... I think it was Mr. Sheehy or Mr. Gleeson spoke about the broad guarantee for four banks and gave a rough indication of what they would see as being included in that.  Now, my interpretation of what was said was that it was very broad and included all of the categories that would have been discussed in the Department of Finance over the previous days and that, to my mind, would have included subordinated debt.</p></speech>

I suppose ... yes, that's a slightly different version than we might have heard already.  You've kind of thrown me off my train of thought by having a different ... a slightly different version but can I .... can I ... can I ask you then, in relation to your own opinion as Governor of the Central Bank, being party to those discussions, what was your view on the inclusion of subordinated debt?</p></speech>

On the following morning we ... there was extraordinary volatility around Europe and, remember, I was involved in teleconferences and I understood exactly what was happening in each country and the level of volatility and the fear that there was right across Europe at the time.  And that day and previous days I would have been involved in these teleconferences from my room in the Central Bank and it was very, very clear that the dangers right across the Europe and the dangers stemming from what had been happening in the United States had created enormous difficulties for banks across the Continent.  So, that essentially was the backdrop.</p></speech>

I don't want to walk you into something] should be nationalised there and then.  Just to be complete on it, he also argued strongly not to go down to cover subordinated debt.</blockquote>  <p>Is that your recollection?</p></speech>

My recollection is that the plenary meeting that I described ... the first plenary meeting, there was a very broad discussion on the options and I think the view was that we should tease out the different options.  And Mr. Lenihan, Minister Lenihan, would have been very anxious that that would have been done and that the different options ... all of the different options would be looked at.  So, in that context, yes, he did ask that this issue would be examined but so did others and, in fact, it was the sense of the meeting that it needed to be examined.  But, in relation to subordinated debt, this, essentially I think, discussion on subordinated debt occurred at a second meeting ... a second plenary meeting, as I would describe it, after the first meeting with the banks.  And at that second meeting, we would have been considering ... having come to a decision about what was the best option ... considering the other elements, for example, subordinated debt, and that was surfaced and discussed and the issue that ... and Mr. Lenihan would have been involved in that discussion and would have been anxious that it was discussed.  But the issue that was involved was ... do we take the risk of not including subordinated debt when it is not such a big issue in terms of costs in the context of the overall guarantee?  Certainly significant when you look at it in isolation and look at the cost involved but the issue wasn't that.  The issue is we have to present a coherence to the markets, the markets are volatile, the American TARP had gone down, there was a sense in which, you know, you didn't quite know how the markets would open the following morning.

Can I then turn actually at the end, maybe, to a brief question about the drafting of legislation which took place in the spring of 2008 and the analysis surrounding that drafting with regard to the possibility to nationalise a financial institution and specifically what advice you, as Governor, or the Central Bank in general would have given to the Government on the drafting of that particular legislation?</p></speech>

And I think this would have cropped up probably in the context of the domestic standing group but it was carried on then by the Department of Finance and preparations were made in the Department of Finance.  So that issue did crop up at that particular time and, you know, there would have been an anxiousness, I think, in the Central Bank that preparations would be made just in case.</p></speech>

Can I just go back to where Deputy Phelan had mentioned earlier on, on page 165 and the bullet points for Cabinet and the contemporaneous note there at the end ... just in relation to that, was there a specific question or query that Mr. Doyle or Minister Lenihan had asked you to ask or seek out with ECB representatives, which they may have been waiting for the answer for?</p></speech>

The first message was, really Europe can't have another Lehman's.  The second message was, countries really should stand behind their banks.  This was the common view and the question you're asking me really is a variant on the second, countries stand behind their banks.  When you were looking across Europe at that time and listening to the conversations the thing that struck me most forcibly was that the nation-state mentality had suddenly resurrected itself and that the community <i>communautaire</i>view had weakened, and so countries standing behind their banks meant action by countries.  So the issue really was whether we were reading properly that there was no pan-European initiative around - was there anything around that our Government could be part of?  And the discussions and conversations and notes would be about me checking that.  I knew myself that there was no European initiative, on the basis of what I was seeing and hearing, but I did want to check that.</p></speech>

My feeling is I don't remember being tasked, I do remember it coming up in discussion and I remember saying "There's ... there's really no initiative emerging in Europe and I think I can't ... I can't see any one, and I'm going to check out to see whether that's correct."</p></speech>

Indeed, many other witnesses have said that there was a prevailing thought that no bank should be permitted to fail - as you put it, another Lehman's ought to be avoided.  And while everybody is prepared to say this was a prevailing thought, I'm just having difficulty identifying who came up with this thought.  Was it discussed at ECB level?  Did the ECB tell their ... the Governing Council members "Look guys don't let a bank fail"?  Did that ever occur?</p></speech>

Just in terms of a guarantee again, Mr. Goggin, his testimony was mentioned earlier on.  He, he mentioned in his testimony, and I'm just going to quote a piece where he was speaking about ... the night of the guarantee and the meetings and I'm just going to quote a passage and I'll question you on it afterwards.</p><blockquote>In fact, as I recall it, the prospect of a guarantee, which was raised earlier that morning in relation to acquiring Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent, had been mentioned to me during the summer of 2008 in a conversation with the Governor of the Central Bank.  He mentioned to me that there was lobbying for a system-wide guarantee for all banks.</blockquote>  <p>Would you agree with that statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-21a.923" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015052100002#NN04200"><p>Well I agree with a number of things.  First of all I agreed that I asked him the question.  I agreed that I, I asked him whether his bank would be interested in a guarantee, in a broad guarantee.  </p>  <p>         And he gave me the response which he said at the time, which was the bank wasn't.  Now, where I have a slight difference is that I thought this discussion came later.  I attended a meeting in Government Buildings on 18 September, the day after I came back from sick leave.  The guarantee was raised at that meeting.  I'm sure you have it in your papers.  And at that meeting, I was asked for my opinion on the guarantee and I said I thought it would be counter-productive when it wasn't being proposed by the Central Bank then.  The following day, the discussions on the extension of the guarantee scheme to &euro;100,000 were engaged in and there were discussions with the banks.  I thought it was in the context of those discussions, and I looked up the minutes of various meetings and my view in relation to the Bank of Ireland and AIB is recorded in one of the Central Bank notes, minutes, where I recorded that they had a view at a certain stage that they didn't think a broad guarantee was for them.  Now, that's the timing I put on it, but I mentioned in my earlier evidence here before the committee that before the summer I would have had quite a number of meetings with banks on the liquidity situation of banks and the collateral situation, on readying up collateral and so on.  And before I went into hospital, I would have made a point of understanding the liquidity position facing banks, just ... not just to brief the Minister, which I did before I went into hospital, but also to be prepared for the ECB meeting, the last ECB meeting, in July.  So in the context of those discussions, I can't remember it coming up specifically but it's quite possible that somebody mentioned guarantees.  It might have been mentioned as a consequence of the Northern Rock guarantee.  It might well have come up.  The broad guarantee did come up in the context of DSG meetings earlier in the year.  So I can't say it didn't come up but I have really no specific recollection of it coming up.</p></speech>

That was a fairly lengthy discussion about different options, and that's the one I remember mostly in ... in ... in ... in the period preceding the decisions.  There would have been discussions at meetings with the Minister and meetings with the Department of Finance, that meeting on 18 September and subsequent meetings where these issues would have been teased out.  There were meetings, I think, over the weekend.  All of that would have been involved in trying to assess the position, assess the liquidity position and tease out various options, and then as we went over on the night of the guarantee on the 29th, a lot of that ground had been ploughed up, but it would have been discussed at the first plenary meeting and the options would've been ... would've been set out.</p></speech>

On page 5 of Vol. 1, he wrote about the Government's best available response given their limited information.  He spoke of the:</p><blockquote>...two failed banks should, in my opinion [I'm quoting], have been intervened by the public authorities, replacing top management, likely through nationalization (this corresponds to Minister Lenihan's stated preference).  ELA should have been provided to allow time for consultation with European officials (including on the potential for risk-sharing).  A more limited systemic guarantee should have been provided (no old - i.e. existing - bonds, no sub debt).</blockquote>  <p>Do you believe that European officials would have agreed the possibility of risk-sharing if the Government decided, despite the accepted doctrine that everybody apparently knew, to liquidate the two banks that Governor Honohan referred to there?</p></speech>

I mean, I don't agree liquidation was an option.  I mean, if you take the common view across Europe, as I said, no Lehman's, but, you know, Mr. Honohan, Professor Honohan, has his view.  I don't have that view and I would not have advised any Government to take that risk.  Nyberg's report basically says it would have been extremely risky to take that approach.</p></speech>

And, yes, during that discussion the Minister for Finance would have said, "Well, let's look again, let's look at the nationalisation option, are we sure about this?", and that was the type of discussion it was.  In my view, it was a very constructive plenary meeting, well-organised and with views coming and going on the options.  If I was to come to a view on it, I would say there was a marginal view in favour at that stage of the broad guarantee, but no decision was taken at the first plenary meeting.</p></speech>

And when Anglo was nationalised later on in ... in 2009, the liquidity flows were enormous as a consequence of that.  So ... so these were judgment calls in real time.  There is no certainty about this.  These were very big judgment calls where everyone was trying to ... to come to the right conclusion so as that something coherent could be presented in markets in a few hours.

But there were other factors at play.  Anglo was illiquid, it wasn't insolvent.  You were giving the guarantee to other banks and you then weren't giving Anglo a chance to live and so you were wiping out all of the shareholders overnight and there would unquestionably have been significant legal actions against the State.  Now these might not have been enormous in the ... in the ... in the fullness of time.  But, on the night in question, you had to make a judgment that you were going to nationalise an illiquid bank when you were giving a guarantee to every other bank.</p></speech>

I just want to deal with one or two other matters.  Just to clarify, you said nationalisation was discussed on the night there.  You say, Mr. Hurley that there was legislation for the nationalising of a bank.  Is your testimony to the committee today that whilst nationalising of banks was being discussed in Government Buildings on the night of the guarantee, at no time did anyone make reference to legislation being prepared or ... discussed the item ... that there may be legislation that we can now look at?</p></speech>

In that plenary meeting, there was an initial discussion on the options.  There was no final decision at that meeting.  After that meeting, there was a meeting with the banks.  After the meeting with the banks, there was a further major plenary meeting at which the final decisions were made.  And in the course ... and that includes all of the details ... and in the course of the meeting, not the press release or anything like that ... just the decision ... what is the decision?  At the end of that meeting the Taoiseach sought the views of everybody and what the decision was and then after that, there was a further discussion with the banks.</p></speech>

My understand is that everything was in readiness to recapitalise Anglo Irish Bank.  I don't know exactly what happened at the meeting but I do know that there was ... as far as I know, some advice from, I think, Merrill Lynch in relation to nationalising a bank.  And, secondly, there was the corporate governance issues that emerged and which, I think, the Minister was very upset about.</p></speech>

If, for example, Anglo Irish Bank didn't benefit substantially from the guarantee and continued to be illiquid, I think the Irish Government would have a cast-iron case for nationalisation.</p></speech>

I think 13 or 14 countries have had a systemic crisis.  The systemic crisis arose because there was a general collapse in markets; there was a failure of the Basel accords; there was an incomplete EMU; the Stability and Growth Pact wasn't as strong as it should have been; and we had oversight from the IMF, from rating agencies and from accountants.  No one saw this coming about, so the Central Bank in Ireland would have been quite unique if it saw this crisis coming.  Where I think we have to answer and account, we have to account about the weaknesses in our own system.  And some of those weaknesses, particularly in relation to risk taking in individual banks, which would not have been known by the Central Bank, they caused problems and would have caused problems anyway.</p></speech>

I was the secretary of the Department of Finance at this time, so maybe I should answer for that.  But the situation is this recommendation that was given to Ireland was given because of the broad economic guidelines issue and ... and over-expenditure by Ireland, as they saw it, of some not very significant amount of money at the time.  The only thing I would say about all of that is, yes, maybe we should have reacted differently at the time but we were quite upset because so many countries were driving coaches and four through the Stability and Growth Pact at the time, including the larger countries.  I think there was a level of annoyance that maybe Ireland, because of a, not a very significant breach of the policy guidelines, was really being reprimanded.</p></speech>

I mean, the ... the ... the building up of the Eurosystem, which was essentially ... took a very large chunk of my time, was terribly labour intensive.  I mean the issue that arises, Senator, that you're actually, you know, I think, touching on, is the very fact that the ECB wasn't given any responsibility for regulation and supervision early on, and is only now being given some of these functions in relation to the main banks.  This was ... there was no unanimity at the time to enable this to happen.  And had it happened, I think then you would've had a different dialogue.</p></speech>

I mean, I think the European Central Bank, when Europe was in disarray and when, as I said, the nation-state mentality emerged very quickly after Lehman's and the community approach weakened, it was the ECB that was holding Europe together; it was ECB that was pumping in the liquidity; it was the dialogues with the Federal Reserve right across the globe to try and stabilise a disastrous situation.

All of the signs in 2007 was that this adjustment would take place ... the adjustment in values would take place.  Yes, there would have been a very significant fiscal problem, but that fiscal problem, you know, in my dialogue with the Minister, they were quite aware there was a fiscal problem but there was a confidence that they'd be able to manage this fiscal problem.  So the actual collapse didn't come until much, much later.  At that time, there was still a great expectation that this could be managed in terms of the gradual or the soft landing, with significant action being taken on a fiscal adjustment.  Ministers and the Government knew we couldn't continue to build at the level we were building in terms of houses, and they knew that there was an overvaluation element, but there was a confidence that it could be managed because economic growth was still extremely strong, the prospects for growth were strong and we didn't have the emergence of Lehman's and the disaster that emanated from the United States.</p></speech>

A new regulatory system was put in place, the legislation was hardly dry, the new ... the Financial Regulator was being established.  The financial regulatory system ... they were working extremely hard to build up this system, extremely hard.  It was on the basis of principles-based regulation.  Principles-based regulation wasn't an Irish invention.  It was a worldwide movement.  It was on the basis that markets know best, and the Irish regulatory system was adopting a philosophy that was a general philosophy.</p></speech>

This will be a matter for the financial regulatory people when they come here, but the fact of the matter is, we had round-table discussions with financial institutions at which the Financial Regulator was present.  The Financial Regulator emphasised in those meetings, all of those meetings, that there had to be prudent lending and careful standards and proper risk-taking by banks.  And this is recorded in round-table minutes.  So, they were following this up at the time, and followed it up subsequently in 2005.  And in your papers, you will see a very significant decision of the regulatory authority, in the very same document, where they took a view in the middle of 2005 in relation to proper lending by banks.</p></speech>

In hindsight, that's correct.  Now, all of the actions that were being taken at the time, including by the Government on property, interest rates ... we knew the ... the regulator had already indicated at a meeting in the middle of '05 that they were going to look at the options.  They were stating that they would get in touch with the banks again in relation to the quality of lending.  All of that was going on.  And I said earlier that it looked very much from forward indicators that in '06 things would come down.  Now, that didn't happen but what did happen in '06 was we had an extraordinarily strong financial stability report where the Central Bank came out for the first time and said the fundamentals are no longer supporting the market.  That's what we said.  Now we didn't put a particular figure on it and there was a big debate internally as to whether we should or not.  And the very strong view was that we shouldn't because we weren't sure of the extent of overvaluation.</p></speech>

Mr. Hurley, can I ask you, in relation to the crisis simulation exercise that was performed by the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, do you think a simulation exercise lasting less than three hours is sufficiently detailed to simulate a realistic scenario?</p></speech>

Simulation exercises take an extraordinary long time to prepare and the scenarios take a long time and it's hugely ... it's hugely time-consuming.  But what you were trying to do in those simulation exercise is test a particular scenario.  And we know that the scenario that unfolded wasn't tested in any of the simulation exercises.  The scenario that unfolded couldn't be tested in any of the simulation exercises because nobody would have been able to design it.</p></speech>

You didn't simulate a bank defaulting.  Can I ask you if you regret that you didn't do that?  Can I ask you maybe to also elaborate ... what, from your simulation exercise and your ... the Red Book, I think it's called, did you actually use when the crisis unfolded?</p></speech>

I didn't know that there was a distinction as you mentioned, I thought it was a large financial institution.  Now ... but in relation to the Red Book and the ... the Red Book was an adjustment that came about in 2007 as a result of the experiences that came through the stress-testing exercise.  The original manual was a black book, a fairly basic book, but nevertheless important because anyone involved in these exercises had to have a starting point and it was a starting point.  The Red Book was more sophisticated and it basically, as far as I was concerned, started to delve into some of the deeper questions like systematic risk assessments, emergency liquidity assistance, the details of all of that.</p></speech>

Now, since Northern Rock we had been considering the whole question of emergency liquidity assistance.  There was a lot of work put into this with every single bank in relation to a liquidity ... emergency liquidity assistance for every bank ... all of the legal arrangements, all of this was done.  But we knew in Northern Rock that the extension of emergency liquidity assistance that its becoming public was what led to a run on Northern Rock.  It led to guarantees from the British Government later on.  So we were in a situation where it was going to be impossible to keep emergency liquidity assistance to Anglo Irish Bank quiet.  It was out there in the marketplace that they were in difficulty.  The contagion effect from Anglo was very real.  And these are risks and you make a judgment on the risk.  The risk was that it would have seriously damaged, by contagion, the other banks.  They were ... there was already a major draining of liquidity in relation to the other banks.  The potential for a collapse of the system was very strong.</p></speech>

I just want to clarify one matter with you, Mr. Hurley, before we go into questions with Senator D'Arcy.  When the press release was issued by the Central Bank the day after the guarantee, or the morning of the 30th, this is "Government Decision to Safeguard Irish Banking System."  It then goes on to say that the guarantee makes mention that it was on "advice from the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator about the impact of the recent international turmoil on the Irish banking system."  It's in the very first paragraph of the release.  Can I just ask you one question?  Was that your advice coming to the meeting, that it would be a blanket guarantee and is that statement correct that it was on your advice when it was ultimately designed and delivered?</p></speech>

I came to the meeting with a view that yes, it would probably be necessary to have a broad guarantee.  I hadn't finalised my view until the discussion on nationalisation.</p></speech>

I'm just giving you the nuances involved.  I'm very clear that the broad guarantee was absolutely essential to save the financial stability of the country.</p></speech>

Mr. Hurley, you're welcome.  Can I ask you, Mr. Hurley, in the conversation that occurred on the night of the guarantee, you discussed previously about the subsequent international events that occurred.  Was there any conversation about a potential funding cliff when the guarantee would end?</p></speech>

There was a discussion about periods, about ... and the cliff issue ... I think it was probably a substantive point in the determination of the two years.  There was a feeling really that that would be an adequate period to get over some of the ... a year would've been too short ... six months, a year, too short, and it was felt that the ... it would give more space.</p>  <p>  There was also a feeling at the time that international action and concerted action was being taken.  Central banks were taking action.  As I said in the course of my previous evidence, the nation-state mentality unfortunately was ... it was alive and well, it had got strong for a period and I think that ... that eventually I believed would change, because I had been involved in my young ... my younger life was all about preparations to join the Common Market and to ... the implications of that and the legislative implications of that.  I ... that was my ... what I worked on as a younger civil servant.  So it struck me that the Community view would resurrect itself after the crisis of the international markets subsided somewhat and so I was ... I felt very strongly that there was a very good chance that that period would work out and would be a good period because I felt Europe would ... would get its act together and the likelihood is that ... that ... you know, the cliff would be less in two years.</p></speech>

That particular declaration I thought very ill-advised at the time and caused a great deal of difficulty.  So despite the fact that so much work and action had been taken, a lot of it was undone by events that had nothing to do with this country.</p></speech>

I wanted to stay until the end of the discussions in the ECB about the NAMA process, and I told the Minister at the time that I would probably try and wind up after that because I had been very ill.

First of all, I think the ... I have no criticism to make of the people involved in NAMA.  They are very good people and they were doing the best that they could, and they had to make decisions in the context of the market and decisions in the context of the advices coming from Europe.  But the question you asked me is was I surprised and the answer is, very surprised at the level of the price reductions involved, and of course what it did mean was very significantly increased levels of capital that would have to be put in.  And, of course, that was really taking money from one pocket and putting it into another pocket, but essentially what it did was it gave the markets a view of the recapitalisation costs added to the national debt which had significant problems for Ireland subsequently.  But I say that because it is the question you asked me, but I have no criticism to make of the people involved.</p></speech>

Now, there would not have been such a stigma in a normal crisis.  It is just that if you have a systemic crisis emanating from the United States in the way it did with the destruction of confidence in banks, emergency liquidity is the signal that markets take fright at and in our situation the judgment - yes, this happened in Northern Rock - so the judgment that had to be made is what's the impact of this.  If more and more emergency liquidity were required for Anglo Irish Bank over that week - and sentiment had been running very heavily against Anglo Irish Bank, which produced the liquidity problem on that particular day - if that had been necessary, what is the sentiment effect of that on the market?  What does it do for the guarantee?</p>  <p>  The judgment - and I was central to this judgment - the judgment was that a further liquidity assistance had to be given to Anglo Irish Bank, in the context of the guarantee, which they now had, what did that say about the guarantee and the other banks and would that damage the guarantee for the pillar banks?  And the judgment on the night - and I was central to this judgment - was I believed it would and I believed, therefore, a back-stop was necessary.  The back-stop was to get to the weekend so as that other decisions could be made.  There was no decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank that night, nor was there any decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank at the weekend.  But it was my view-----</p></speech>

Nationalisation was not on the table.  The decision had been made but the intervention by me had to do with the very point I've just mentioned, that if further emergency ... it was known that emergency liquidity would be given to Anglo Irish Bank.  If it was known that in the context of a guarantee, far more emergency liquidity would have to be given to Anglo Irish Bank, what would that have done to the guarantee and the decision the Government had just made?  And my view was, that was extremely risky.  If that position had happened ... if that position had gone out into the public domain, the guarantee could have been damaged and we had to have a coherent position going out to markets seven o'clock the following morning.  If that wasn't coherent and didn't stand, the chances of it being challenged would be high and that risk simply could not have been taken.</p></speech>

That might have been the decision but I would have preferred that that matter was discussed at a weekend and not in the middle of the week.  In our stress tests earlier in the year, one of the messages and one of the lessons was "Look, it's very difficult to nationalise a bank in the middle of the week".  So, you buy time ... you have other options at the weekend to consider, it might be nationalisation, it might be something else but at least you wouldn't have a run on the guarantee and the Government's decision wouldn't come down.</p></speech>

If I just put another quote to you from Mr. Dermot Gleeson, it's page 66 of the transcript:</p><blockquote>I mean when Governor Hurley says &quot;Can you get &euro;5 billion to keep Anglo going to the weekend?&quot; it wouldn't make any sense if you were going to guarantee six banks the next morning for us to be providing liquidity to the weekend.  It was inconsistent with that.</blockquote></speech>

Now, I do accept that there was moving in and out of the room, so I can't actually say who was in the room at the particular time but, in my view, the decision ... the Taoiseach's decision ...  the Taoiseach's announcement of the decision was very clear, so I don't understand-----</p></speech>

I thought my position was that we wanted to protect the guarantee, that, if in fact, you have to extend more emergency liquidity assistance to Anglo Irish Bank, when already the situation of Anglo Irish Bank was out in the marketplace, that could damage the guarantee for the two pillar banks.  </p>  <p>         And in that situation the Government would have made a decision to guarantee the entire financial system and you would be endangering the guarantee.

We had total flows for the previous period since Lehman's, both in relation to ECB funding and outflows.  And that day we had a picture of exactly what happened that day because, I said in my earlier evidence that it looked very much at the weekend, and we had meetings all over the weekend, it looked very much at the weekend as if there might be enough liquidity for the banks for the week.  That changed on Monday.</p></speech>

I mean we ... this question came up earlier in discussions, and because of the size of our banking system we had a ... we had a very good handle on what the liquidity position was in each of the banks.

And in my view, we had a far better handle on the liquidity position in our banks than some of the other countries had about their banks.</p></speech>

The immediate action that was taken on this was in the context of the stress test.  There were stress testing exercises earlier in the year.  If I remember, I would have got a report on the stress testing exercises and one of the conclusions was that there was too quick a movement to a guarantee in the context of the stress test.  So when I came along and came back to the bank on 17 and 18 September, that would have been the reason for my view on the 18th, that I'm not recommending a broad guarantee now, that I'm, I'm urging caution in relation to this.</p></speech>

In March 2008 that discussion is happening at the DSG.

That would have happened and you ... you would expect in a banking system that if a small bank was in difficulty, that the first port of call would be the main banks because private sector solutions would be the main vehicle at that stage.

I just need to raise this issue on the domestic standing group before we move on.  You mentioned there, Governor ... as role as Governor, you did not have a central, pivotal role in the domestic standing group, but given the parties comprising domestic standing group, can you outline the possibility that there was a deficiency in the domestic standing group operating model, which may have resulted in the group's failure to identify early signs of a crisis?  There is documentation, in our core documents on notation, that in the Central Bank's assessment of financial markets in or around November 2007 presented to a meeting of the DSG it states that, "If present market conditions persist as expected into 2008 there will be an increased risk of liquidity arising from Irish banks", and it also goes on to say that, "The Central Bank the Financial Regulator continues to liaise with the banks closely at CEO levels and are monitoring the position very closely".</p></speech>

I thought that the operations of the domestic standing group and the way it went about its business and the issues that cropped up, I thought they were appropriate.</p></speech>

But it was an individual bank stress test and I accept, Senator, that there was no stress testing for the type of crisis that happened, not here, not anywhere, but, clearly, the risks that gave rise to this international crisis, they had their roots in some of the major issues that we've spoken about: a collapse in the broad market, a failure of the Basel accords, low interest rates for too long, far too much increase in the money supply.  These are the things that gave rise to the problem that eventually came to cause the implosion of the financial system.</p></speech>

We've heard that.  We know that assessments were being made of key loans at five banks.  We know that INBS had particular financial instrument debt, if you like, of &euro;7 billion and we know then, coming into early September of 2008, that now two key banks were asked in by the regulator to discuss INBS, in particular.  So, if you like, there were lots of things all accumulating over a period of time.  How then did we end up, if you like, in a panic all in Government Buildings on that night?  How come there wasn't an earlier, more controlled, more calm intervention on behalf of, and by, the Central Bank?</p></speech>

Mr. Hurley, Senator O'Keeffe asked you there about worst case contingency scenarios of a systemic bank failure and you responded in detail.

I mean the fact of the matter is that we had very significant information coming through the Financial Regulator in relation to the individual banks.  </p>  <p>         Subsequently, examinations were done - I think it was by Pricewaterhouse ... they came to a view and that gave a view on a certain level of capital that was required.

I mean, if that had been done earlier, at least that view would have been there.</p></speech>

But what you appear to be confirming is that the ECB was aware, right up to 29 September, that a bank guarantee was an option under consideration in terms of rescuing the Irish banks.</p></speech>

Okay.  And, just to pick up on the point that Senator MacSharry raised with you about the backdrop behind all of this - and it was a time of crisis - that no bank shall fail.

None of the other banks were illiquid at the time, even though they were moving in that particular direction.  The risks, as I mentioned earlier, of actually doing this were extremely high and even recognised in the Nyberg report.</p></speech>

Now, just a brief supplementary in response, or in following on from the questions of the Chair with regard to what was known as Project Atlas.  Did the analysis that emerged from that prove to be accurate in the following months?</p></speech>

I think in the context of the letter that we issued, we saw downside risks for the capital requirement to increase.  In the following months, it probably did so because the capital requirement for Anglo Irish Bank, for example, was higher than was in the Atlas report at the time.</p></speech>

I mean, the depletion and the devaluation of property over the following number of years caused a very, very significant injection of capital to be required by the Irish ... by the Irish taxpayer and with ... that was not foreseen at the time.</p></speech>

The first issue is this was a falling market and values were going to be determined very much in the context of the falling market, so it wouldn't have been known at a particular moment in time how far property prices were going to go, but the other element to your question is very relevant.  It's really got to do with the risk assessment within individual institutions and why that went so badly wrong over the period of time, and what that means is that, irrespective of the international crisis, there would have been a higher capital requirement because of the risk management practices in some banks.</p></speech>

If the decisions taken were considered inadequate and failed the consequences for the banking system would be devastating and lead to very serious economic and social fallout for the country as a whole.</blockquote>  <p>I will just repeat one sentence: &quot;There was a strong view on the night that the Government had one opportunity to assuage the markets.&quot;  Can I ask you, Mr. Hurley, does it sit well with a society and a system of governance that is supposed to be democratic that a government can have an economic gun put to its head by institutions in the financial markets that are unelected and, as far as the vast majority of people in Ireland and Europe are concerned, are faceless and anonymous?</p></speech>

I think, as a result of this crisis ... and a lot of reflection has got to be done on that particular issue ... it strikes me that the influence of these decisions on governments across the world has been very, very severe and, through that, the impact on populations has been very significant.  So, I think that there's a ... there's a very significant point there, that really has to be dealt with in the context of the reconfiguration of how the financial sector is going to be dealt with.</p></speech>

I mean, there is a reality ... this is the reality, the reality of the markets.  But I do believe in designing systems going forward ... I mean, and it is the balance between principles and rules ... that balance has to be struck, it has to be struck properly ... and, we will always face a particular moment in time when there will be a cry that the rules are now too hard again and we need to soften the rules.

I wouldn't be able to ... I hope I've conveyed in some way the extraordinary situation that the country found itself in.  There are all sorts of arguments of why it shouldn't have been there but this was the situation that the Government faced and the choices were very, very limited.  And if they didn't take a decision to actually manage the situation at that time, I said earlier that I thought our financial system would have come down with extraordinary implications for the country, not just for a week or a few days but for years.  Now, that was, you know ... that was a very, very traumatic moment, it was a sobering moment but that was the issue that was being considered in the room at the time.  It wasn't pleasant .... it was pleasant for no one in the room but the scale of the implications for this country was truly extraordinary.  I've been a public servant for 46 years, I've headed up a number of different Ministries, I thought I had seen every sort of crisis ... I have never seen a crisis like this.</p></speech>

I'm going to move towards wrapping items up there, Mr. Hurley.  I just want clarification on one piece of documentation that we have and I just ... it may be familiar to you ... it's a note from a Department of Finance presentation and I'm just trying to establish the date of when that was actually provided.  There's a particular line on it; it's the second last bullet point on it, it says: "Open-ended State guarantee exposing the Exchequer to significant fiscal risk are not regarded as part of the toolkit for successful crisis management and resolution".

I remember this at the time, but then you have the last sentence, which then indicates circumstances where that might be possible.  </p>  <p>         I referred earlier to guarantees coming up in the context of a crisis simulation exercise and the too quick a reaction into guarantees which essentially informed my view, particularly around the 17th or 18th that we should, you know, that it shouldn't be ... should be considered more carefully.  I basically said it might be counter-productive and I think the minute of the meeting of 18 September is there to that effect.  But, as Deputy Higgins has said, this situation changed absolutely dramatically within a short space of time and the options for the Government were quite limited and in the circumstances of the change, and in the circumstances of the implications for the country as a whole, I changed my view too.</p></speech>

I think you might have even used the only decision that could have been made on the night of the guarantee.  Yet you have also outlined in your evidence that a facility, at least for one institution, was available for emergency liquidity assistance to be provided.  In light of that I want to quote to you evidence of your successor, Governor Honohan.  On 11 March 2015 before the inquiry he was asked by Deputy O'Donnell whether Anglo should have been nationalised on the night of the guarantee, and he gave the following response:</p><blockquote>It should have been nationalised because that was the only tool available legally for the State to take control.  Control should have been taken.  It should not have been left in the hands of the management.  It was very risky to leave it in the hands of the management.  I would have left it to the weekend using emergency liquidity assistance, ELA.  </blockquote>  <p>I just want to, I suppose, ask you of your view on-----</p></speech>

The whole issue of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was discussed on the night.  A lot of time was spent discussing the options.  The conclusion reached was that it would be more negative than positive to do that.  Now, that was the overall conclusion.  A decision had to be made in real time and the decision had to be made before markets opened.</p></speech>

He had done a lot of research and was widely published in this sector.  He subsequently became your successor.  He gave evidence that is contradictory to what you said, that on the night of the guarantee - sorry I just want to finish - that there was another option in his view, and the other option was a partial guarantee of four institutions and nationalisation of the other two.  You have given the evidence already that the ELA facility was there and therefore I am trying to ask you to-----</p></speech>

This is not an easy situation where there are simple answers.  There are judgments in this and judgments can be right or wrong.  But on the night, there were a group on people in Government Buildings ... do their best to make the right decision.  It was extremely difficult, an extremely sombre occasion where we were pretty much on our own and we had to make those decisions.  Now, you ... you ... some people might be very content to take risks but with those sort of risks, I doubt if many governments would have taken it.</p></speech>

But the fact of the matter is given the ... the crisis, given the risk management practices within the institutions that particularly happened in 2006, it seems to me that you have to have an amalgam of principles and rules-based systems.  And it's a question of getting that balance going forward.  I think the chairman of the Financial Regulator before has accepted that in the circumstances, that there probably should have been more intrusive regulation.  But principles-based regulation was adopted for good reasons.  We weren't the only jurisdiction, it was fairly widely implemented.  And it was consistent with the Government's own regulatory White Paper.</p></speech>

In the discussions and the deliberations in the room when people were trying to make that right judgment and when discussions around the potential to allow banks to fail was being considered, what was the contrarian view put forward?  Were people ... was it said, ''Look, everybody knows we can't do that'', or was it, ''The ECB won't wear that, the IMF won't wear that'', or, ''The Commission won't wear that''?</p></speech>

I'm going to bring matters to a conclusion, Mr. Hurley.

Other than that, I just want to thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to come here.  I haven't spoken about this in public before, but I was very anxious to come here to say what, you know, to give my information to the committee in relation to all of this.  I'd like particularly to thank the committee for the way this has been conducted.  It's been a long day but it has been very well conducted, and I want to thank the back-room staff of the committee for the way they've dealt with me over the past weeks.  They were ... very constructive and they're a credit to the committee.  And, finally, I just want to wish you well in your task.  I think this is an extremely important examination.  I think everyone involved has to come here and account, and I believe that you will do a great service if we can find a way of preventing this from happening in our country again.  So thank you very much.</p></speech>
