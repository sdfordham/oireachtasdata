This must be done now in order to ensure these issues do not deflect from the integrity and importance of the work the committee is mandated to do.  That is the key issue for us as members of the committee.</p><p>  The media reports deal with a number of matters to do with the conduct of the Chairman when he was Minister of State at the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment between June 2007 and April 2009.  Deputy Shane Ross has requested that members be allowed, for the purpose of examining this issue, to question the Chairman.  The sole issue for members is the need to protect the committee and ensure its work is not hindered by constant newspaper revelations in regard to the Chairman.</p> <p>The Chairman has agreed to brief the committee on the issues and to answer any questions that arise in respect of these specific matters.  He has also agreed to vacate the Chair while this part of our business is conducted.  We are doing this in public session.  I will ask members to confine their questions to issues that arise from the media reporting as it impacts on the work of this committee.  I also ask members to be succinct in view of the specific time available and to conduct our discussions in a professional and cordial fashion.</p><p> I will first call on our Chairman to make a statement.  Thereafter I will call on members who indicate that they want to raise a question.  I would like to confine questions to approximately ten minutes.  If people do not use up their ten minutes we will allow members to come in if they have questions at the end.  We will try to deal with all questions.  When the questions are complete I will give an opportunity to Deputy McGuinness to make a short closing statement.  If we conclude before 11.45 a.m. we will suspend the meeting and return to our normal business at that appointed time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> We are here because each and every member of the committee values the work we do and its integrity, and the revelations of late have distracted from that.  That is why we have called on the Chairman to make a statement before members today and to answer questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013061300003#B00200"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for agreeing to set aside the time this morning from the busy schedule of the Committee of Public Accounts for me to make this brief statement and answer any questions they might have about the matters that have come into the public domain between the end of April and now.  We have dealt with some of these issues but I am quite prepared to deal with them and the new issues that have emerged.  In doing so, and in agreeing to allot the time this morning to allow this to happen, I am conscious of the importance of the work of the Committee of Public Accounts and its members.  I am also conscious of the importance of the committee itself in relation to the House.  I believe it to be the most important committee in this House and it has carried out its work down through the years without fear or favour and in a non-political way.  During my time on the committee from 2002 to 2007 I experienced the challenges that can present to a member of government.  I had to get over those challenges and work with the other members as they did the important work of scrutinising spending for the State.  I admire the work of the current committee in carrying on that tradition.  It is true to say that since 21 April there has been a certain distraction from that work because of public comment or public media reports about the position that I held in 2007 for a brief period of 18 months as Minister of State at the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with responsibility for trade and commerce.</p><p>  The first issue that arose in respect of that appointment was the provision of an office.  I believe the Accounting Officer dealt fully and adequately with that in the past few weeks.  I quoted at the end of that meeting from the freedom of information request I had put in to the Office of Public Works, OPW, the reply to which stated clearly that it was senior officials within the office of the OPW who scrutinised this work, provided the plans, carried out the tendering process and delivered the finished office.  The Accounting Officer and that written reply to my FOI request clearly demonstrated, in my opinion, that I had no hand, act or part in the decision-making about the materials used in that office, its size or its extent.  I am quite prepared to answer any other questions that might have emerged for members since then.</p><p>  There were other reports after that which came into the public domain.  I apologise to members of the committee because I know that Deputy Harris asked publicly why members were not informed or why I had not informed members of what the FOI request was about and the response to it.  I will start with 21 April, or sometime around then, and what happened afterwards.  I did not receive from the Department any copies of that FOI request by way of that process.  I had to go to the Fianna F&aacute;il research office to ask if it could get a copy.  I was not quite sure of the procedure but I did not have copies.  That is why no one was informed.  I tried to respond as best I could to those articles by casting my mind back six years by way of preparing myself and so on.  It was hard to do that when, day after day, something different and significant appeared without my knowledge and without my having the paperwork to back it up.</p><p>  Last Friday - this relates to current events - I received a telephone call from the Department to say that certain information was being given in response to an FOI request.  That was on 7 June at 5.34 p.m.  That is when I received the e-mail.  I studied that e-mail and its contents on Saturday and I spent all of Sunday trying to respond directly to the reporter concerned by e-mail.  Sometime late on Sunday night, I think, I finished providing information in response to the queries addressed to me.  I regret that I did not have the opportunity to forward the information to Deputy Harris and the other members of the committee, but I did not have it until that late hour.  At that stage the articles were ready for publication and the information was put into the public domain.  It consisted largely of what was known about the office and about toilet rolls, and then it touched on some other subjects, including the fact that I had employed my son when I entered the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as it was known then.  That was in 2007.  In the course of 2008 a key member of our staff went on maternity leave and we had staffing issues during most of my time in that office.  In order to compensate for the work that was required to be done, overtime was claimed.  It was claimed in the normal way according to the standards of the Civil Service.  It was not signed off by me, as was suggested in different places.  I did not have anything to do with that process.  It is true that in hindsight I could have managed things better in terms of staff, and I accept that, but I ask members to understand that during that time I ran a busy constituency office on one side, and when one is appointed a Minister - I hope some members will enjoy that some day - one's constituency office workload doubles or trebles.  I took on the Department role as well and I expected my staff at local and national level to be able to respond to the massive number of queries that we received from organisations and individual business people who were facing difficulties in doing business abroad and at home.  All of us in that office dealt as best we could with all of those issues.  As I said, the overtime was appropriately and properly claimed.  My regret now, looking back, is that maybe we could have organised things better, but all of this was within the guidelines that were set down.</p> <p>I am in politics since 1979 and my record will show for itself that I am not a traveller by nature, particularly with regard to long-distance flights.  In 2007, when I was appointed Minister of State, I recall raising the issue with the Secretary General and posing the difficulties I had with travelling - I recorded this in my book too - and I was told I would have to overcome that.</p><p> With a trade mission approaching at the time, I asked - looking back now at it, I was probably na&iuml;ve and simple - could my wife travel with me and that I would pay all her costs.  This is recorded in the e-mail response to other e-mails on 27 August.  It was a simple question.  It was a question put more recently by a more senior Minister when he went to travel.  He was told the same - a Minister&rsquo;s wife cannot travel on a trade mission whether he pays for her or not.  My wife did not travel on trade missions.  I served 18 months in that Department and I know what trade missions are about.  I respect the decision on spouses travelling.</p><p> At the end of August, it came to my attention that the simple request I made had civil servants writing to civil servants asking for clarification.  Most of the e-mails, I think, start with the Minister may be contemplating bringing his wife.  They then go on to seek clarification on rules, regulations and protocols around wives travelling.  When these were brought to my attention, I decided, if they were sharing these e-mails about my contemplation about maybe bringing my wife on a trade mission, that I should respond.  When I read my response six years later, it was probably written in frustration with a bit of anger.  Maybe I was having a bad day and it was not expressed as it should have been.  It was nothing only a philosophical discussion within that e-mail about the protocols and so on relative to travel.  I accepted the point that even if one paid, one could not bring one&rsquo;s wife on trade missions.  Within that e-mail, the question of travel generally, aside from trade missions, was being discussed by civil servants.  I gave the opinion at the time that maybe in exceptional circumstances for other than trade missions, it should be considered that wives should be allowed to travel and the Minister could pay for it or the State should in some cases consider it.  Reading the e-mail now, it was a poorly presented opinion.  However, that is all it was.  I expressed an opinion.</p><p> The next item that appeared in the media concerned travel on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in 2008.  My understanding back then was that these arrangements were announced at the Cabinet, the Taoiseach had a say in it, they were then presented and the Ministers travelled.  Junior Ministers were also nominated to travel.  Some travelled with their wives and some without.</p><p> The work abroad was generally of a nature of improving the relationship between Ireland and the country in question being visited.  The trip which was commented on was to Seattle.  My wife came with me.  I considered it to be a busy working trip.  I did what I was required to do in terms of the work that was necessary.  The Department paid for the trip, as was reported, and it was arranged in accordance with the guidelines that existed at the time.  I am not the only Minister who travelled with his wife abroad at that time and, indeed, before and after that time.</p><p> Looking back at it now, it was a different country then in 2007.  What was accepted back then is not acceptable now.  I accept that.  It is a different economy now than it was then.  It is a different set of rules and guidelines that guide each and every one of us now than was the case back then.  I accept that.  What I was doing in the correspondence is something that is done right across this House.  I was challenging old ways.  It was only recently that I got the 1959 document on travel and it is interesting.  It was signed by T.K. Whitaker and addressed to Se&aacute;n Lemass, which shows how far back it dates.  Why not ask about it?  Why not have an opinion about it?  Why not be prepared for that opinion to be changed for the better?  It was always in the interest of providing better value for money which is what we talk about at this committee.  I talk about it more than most or that is what I am accused of anyway.  This was a travel arrangement.</p><p> The question in all of this, in each and every one of the cases or instances that were cited, is did I personally go out to do something wrong.  Did I do things that were deliberately to benefit me or were to deliberately access the public purse in any way?  They were not.</p><p> I will go back to the beginning again.  Was the cost of the office that was created as a State office with me as the first occupant excessive?  I did not know then but I know now the price of that office.  As I have said twice before at these meetings, yes, it was excessive and something far less would have done.  That was the way those offices were delivered at that time.  Maybe we should check or question how these offices are delivered.  Was the management of staff in my office handled correctly?  Again, in hindsight, it could have been done more efficiently and better.</p> <p>However, I would suggest, in the context of the staffing arrangement, that at the end of the day it may have cost even more if permanent staff were to be recruited, but I agree that things could have been done better.</p><p> Regarding the hiring of a family member, this yesterday, and I do not want to be misrepresented in the media would I do it today?  For his sake, I probably would not, but if asked whether I would do it in terms of his ability, the skills we were looking for and the loyalty I got, the answer is, "Yes, I would".  Is it being done across the system?  There are examples of it, and we have to admit that.  Perhaps that needs to be changed.  We may need to set down appropriate rules and guidelines that will guide us through that process.</p><p> In terms of foreign travel for spouses, of course it needs to be looked at because we are in a different place.  </p><p> I want to say to the members and to the public that I take my job as Chairman of this committee seriously.  I take seriously the comments I make about the committee in regard to value for money, good governance and so on.  We are reflecting today on something that happened six years ago.  I am sure all of us in our lives would do things differently or better out of experience, and I am no different from any of the members or anybody else.</p><p> In general, I believe I have covered the issues that were raised.  There may be questions members wish to ask but the final question that needs to be answered is if my credibility has been damaged and should I continue on as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have to say, frankly, that I do not consider that my credibility has been damaged because within all of what was there six years ago, I acted appropriately.  In terms of credibility, I believe that is a matter for other members to judge, but I do not believe that what has been printed about me regarding these matters damages how I might chair this committee.  I do not think it changes my views on what needs to be done by the Committee of Public Accounts.  It will certainly sharpen my view on the standards being applied today and what might happen for the future.  That is a fact.  I can say no more but to put that case before the members.  On reflection, I would say that for any appointment in this House, I would prefer to go through an inquiry like this one in front of my peers and for them to ask any questions they wish to ask at the time of appointment to uncover anything they could uncover about me, personally or otherwise, than go through what I and my family have gone through since 21 April.  I respect fully the Freedom of Information Act, the scrutiny that is applied, and the views of the members here.</p></speech>

Before calling the members I wish to pose some questions to the Chairman.  Is this the end of the matter, Deputy McGuinness?  Are there further revelations to come?  Is he aware of any other freedom of information requests in respect of his period as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?  In the questions we are posing the Chairman made reference to his own credibility.  This is about the integrity of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee of Public Accounts is bigger than one person.  It is about the work we do collectively as a group, the work we have done in the past and the work we will do into the future.  This is not about personalities but there are issues.  I ask the Chairman to address those three questions but I ask him to first address the question: is this the end of the matter?  I put that question in the context of the distraction from the work we are doing as a committee.  Is the Chairman aware of any other freedom of information requests in respect of his period as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?</p></speech>

I do not know what FOIs might be in but out of the FOIs that were submitted, what has to be asked here, away from the mix of the media and the mix of the replies, is what was the response to each and every one of those FOIs.  What did they find within those FOIs that shows that I stepped beyond the line of authority during those 18 months?  I do not know what FOIs are in.</p></speech>

It certainly stalled us in terms of our work, and we see that here this morning, and I regret that.  I can only express a regret that we have not been able to conduct our work without the hindrance of this coverage but I cannot account for the coverage.  I apologised to the members earlier for not being able to inform them because I do not know what is next but having gone through what I have gone through from 21 April up to now, I cannot imagine that there is much left.</p><p>  To add to the response, efforts were made by the paper to contact various people locally in my constituency to ask of them if there was anything they believed should be investigated by the committee.  I think I am quoting them accurately.  In fact, during the course of the last two to three days questions were also asked locally about my wife's activities outside of my own political activities.  I do know and what would ensue from that - I cannot say, as much as any Member of this House could answer that question in relation to their own circumstances or what might be asked of them.</p><p>  I agree with the Vice Chairman that the Committee of Public Accounts is bigger than any individual.  I am the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and therefore I am the one who is in the spotlight here, and that is why I am anxious to answer as best I can.<font color="#222222"> </font></p></speech>

The Chairman made reference regarding the freedom of information request on travel that he sent an e-mail on 29 August 2007 to the assistant secretary in the Department Enterprise, Trade and Employment and it was copied to various officials in the Department up as far as the Secretary General.  Does the Chairman stand over the points he made in that letter where he said that there was a strong case to be made for State spending, despite the cost, in respect of the taxpayer paying for Ministers' spouses to go on trade missions?</p> <p>In this particular instance, did the Chairman discuss it with the line Minister?  Could he give us an indication of the number of trips he took with his spouse?  This is in no way personal towards his wife but it is a job of work we have to do today.  It is important we are seen to deal with the issues.  Will the Chairman detail all the trips he took, including St. Patrick's Day?  Were they paid for by the State?  How much did they cost?  Did he refund the State for travel?  Does he stand over his comments in his strongly worded letter?</p><p> Looking at the correspondence and the various e-mails, it strikes me that the Chairman set a precedent whereby, for the first time, a Minister was questioning the issue of spouses' travel costs being paid in terms of trade missions.  One had officials scurrying here, there and everywhere trying to find out what were the guidelines.  Eventually, they unearthed a 1959 guideline, probably at a time when Dubai was never heard of.  </p><p> When one goes through this, even post the Chairman's e-mail of 29 September that was about Dubai, on 9 October, he made a further request that the taxpayer would pay for his wife to travel on a trade mission to Canada.  Does the Chairman stand over his comments that the taxpayer should pay for spouses of Ministers to travel on trade missions?  Why did he come back - post the letter on 9 October - and request that the State pay for his wife to travel with him on a trade mission to Canada?  Did he discuss these particular issues with the line Minister?</p></speech>

Do I believe that the spouses of Ministers should travel at a cost to the State willy-nilly?  No, I do not.  Do I believe that in exceptional  circumstances, which is the point I was making - I mean seriously exceptional circumstances - a case could be considered and could be rejected?  That is the point I was trying to make in the correspondence.  This was a philosophical exchange which went nowhere.  It was an opinion expressed.  The Vice Chairman asked me, and rightly so, whether I hold that opinion today.  Circumstances have changed considerably, and I respect they have changed considerably, so I do not hold that opinion.</p></speech>

In exceptional circumstances, I think it says in the other correspondence that the Taoiseach can view that.  There are and can be exceptional circumstances but generally speaking "No."</p><p>  The Vice Chairman referred to the correspondence and asked why I wrote back.  In the course of August, this correspondence was entered into without me knowing about it.  I did not know that my simple question was going to cause 25 or more e-mails to senior civil servants in a Department taking their time to answer them when the economy was going into collapse.  I did not know that was going to happen.  I did not know it happened until I came back and I felt that I should answer it because I wanted to make the point in relation to the issues.</p></speech>

The Chairman just acknowledged that at that time the economy was going down the tubes.  If that was the context - we have to ask these questions for the ordinary people looking in at the Committee of Public Accounts - why did the Chairman put in a request, which based on the e-mails would appear to have been a reasonably persistent one, and write on 29 August a relatively lengthy and strongly worded letter and subsequently over a month later on 9 October or thereabouts request that his wife go on a trip to Canada with him when, as he said, the economy was going down the spout and the officials should have been dealing with far more important matters than e-mails from the Chairman?  Why did the Chairman put them in the position where they felt it necessary to deal with him by way of e-mail?</p></speech>

I wanted to pay for my wife on those trade missions.  I asked about it.  I accepted that could not be done and she did not travel.  We are not talking about something which cost the State anything.  It was a request and I point again to the fact that in more recent times, a Minister asked and was told "No" and his wife did not travel.  That is a fact.</p></speech>

This a difficult issue for all members to deal with.  </p> <p>I have always admired the Deputy's chairmanship of this committee because of his courage in allowing members to push issues and hold people who appear before the committee to a high level of account.  I am approaching this in the same way as I would approach questioning any other witness.  I will apply the same level of scrutiny to the Deputy as I would to any other person.</p><p> The Vice Chairman has already tried to establish if we are likely to read any more about this issue.  The biggest concern for this committee at this point is the drip drip feed of accusations and allegations, which is beginning to impact hugely in terms of distracting it from its work.  The Deputy's response is that he does not know the answer to that question.  Has he had any contact with the FOI officer of the Department and is he aware if any more FOI requests have been made?</p></speech>

I am not sure one can do that.  If it is the view of the committee that I should make such contact, I have no difficulty doing so.  I have never contacted members of the committee with a view to influencing their direction in any way.  I have always allowed things to happen in a public, transparent way, as in the case of this meeting.  I have not pursued the FOI officer.  I do not want to place a media person or FOI officer in the position of being able to say I had pursued this matter with him or her.</p></speech>

The Deputy's argument appears to be that he did not break any rules and we were in different times.  Nobody has publicly contradicted him in that regard.  The Deputy mentioned on numerous occasions this morning that this happened six years ago.  The difficulty I have is that Deputy McGuinness, as Chairman of this committee, would not accept that from another witness such as, for example, Mr. Rody Molloy, former CEO of F&Aacute;S, a man whom Deputy McGuinness has commented on publicly on a number of occasions and about whom he wrote in his book, <i>The House Always Wins</i>.  The following is a direct quote from that book:<blockquote><br />The following day, seemingly oblivious to the growing public anger about the revelations, Rody Molloy, speaking on &quot;Today with Pat Kenny&quot; on RTE radio defended his practice of exchanging one first-class airline for two business-class tickets so that his wife could travel with him.  In fact, he claimed he was &quot;entitled&quot; to do so.</blockquote>Mr. Rody Molloy broke no rules, rather he operated within the guidelines.  However, Deputy McGuinness arrived at the considered position, as did the then Committee of Public Accounts, that F&Aacute;S should not have paid for those tickets.  How does the Deputy tally those two views?  The Deputy believes he did everything right and that all this happened in a different time when the country was not in an economic mess.  The key issue is why that is acceptable for him given the level of scrutiny he applies to others who appear before this committee.</p></speech>

I want to be absolutely clear about that.  The guidelines are set down by the Department and have been followed by past and current Ministers.  Ministers do not sign off on their own foreign travel, including hotel arrangements and so on.</p></speech>

I did not do that.  I can only answer for myself.  I cannot answer for anybody else.  The Deputy asked how having done what I did I can chair the Committee of Public Accounts.  I put it to him that I was appointed as a Minister of State and worked within the conditions, rules and regulations as set down.  Others within the Department charged with responsibility for doing so looked after the specifics of what I was doing.  In other words, where approval was granted to travel, the arrangements were made by senior civil servants in accordance with protocols, which are set out in Circular 6/59 from the Department of Finance, which I support.  I have read the document closely, which I had not done previously.  It is fine.  I accept it.</p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's question - I will answer it only as it applies to me - that is the answer.  As regards whether I can chair a meeting the answer is "Yes, I can" because I did not do anything wrong.  I did not sign off on anything that I should not have signed off on or for which I was not responsible for signing off on.</p></speech>

The Deputy was not an innocent bystander.  He made the decisions, which we will get to later.  This is not about the Deputy's wife; rather, it is about the Deputy and his public office.  The only reference to the Deputy's wife is in relation to that.  The Deputy is the one who made the decision that his wife was to travel at a cost to the taxpayer.  It was the Deputy who made that decision.  The civil servant did not tell the Deputy, then Minister of State, that he had to bring his wife or that he had to fly business class.  The Deputy made those decisions.</p><p>  Other people who appear before the Committee of Public Accounts also make similar decisions.  In my time as a member of this committee, which is not as lengthy as that of Deputy McGuinness, I have rarely, if ever, come across a person sitting on that side of the room who had broken a rule or not operated within guidelines.  Generally, they have.  However, the Deputy, as Chairman of this committee, and the committee collectively, has been critical of their not questioning or probing issues.  The committee has produced pretty hard hitting conclusions in such situations.  That is what is at issue for me.  I am not asking the Deputy to answer for Rody Molloy or anybody else.  I am only using him as an example in terms of the level of account to which the Deputy, as Chairman of this committee, has held people and the level he now wishes us to hold him to.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach of the day nominates his Cabinet.  The Cabinet handbook - I did not receive a copy of it as I was not a Minister - sets out how things are to be conducted.  As I said in my opening remarks, in 2007 I was nominated to travel on a St. Patrick's Day mission.  I brought my wife with me and, yes, the State paid.  That was part of what was agreed could be done at that time.  I made no decision about the tickets.  They were booked and paid for by civil servants in accordance with the regulations in that regard.  That happened six years ago.  The question that has been asked is should it be permitted now.  I have already outlined my position in relation to travel.</p></speech>

The Deputy said the other night on "Tonight with Vincent Browne" and repeated again today that this was done six years ago when it was usual for wives to accompany their husbands and the State paid for it.  It is not true to say that every Minister brought his or her spouse.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that certain Ministers, including the Deputy's then senior Minister, the current Leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, did not bring their wives on official business and when they were accompanied abroad on St. Patrick's Day by their spouses, they paid for them.  The point I am making is that it was not that under the guidelines the Department booked the tickets and off one went.</p> <p>There were Ministers, including Ministers in his own Department, who made the conscious decision themselves that the cost of bringing their spouses abroad should be met by themselves rather than the taxpayer.  Does Deputy McGuinness agree with that? </p></speech>

I think the Taoiseach of the day had a degree of discretion.  I am wondering which category the London trip would have fallen into?

He said there are circumstances that should be considered where Ministers are away on State business for long periods of time and where, if they want to pay for their spouse to accompany them, that is fine.  He then said that there may be other circumstances where the Minister can then make a case, within a new set of guidelines, where he believes the State should pay because work practices have certainly changed.  The family is now central to everything and it may be that a Minister might want to make that case.  I really do not understand that.

I was talking about it.  It was that in seriously exceptional circumstances, maybe there should be an arrangement where a Minister could make a case to the Taoiseach - it is provided for in the 1959 regulation - which had to with illness or a bereavement or any personal circumstances, and that he should be allowed to articulate it.  I made this point in my reply to the reporter on this issue.  It is not one that gives a <i>carte blanche</i> travel arrangement to every spouse right across any Department.  Would it be done now if I was a Taoiseach sitting down looking at it?  It would want to be seriously exceptional.</p></speech>

I think I have explained what I consider to be serious exceptional circumstances.  These rules are rigid.  For example, we said at one of our meetings on allowances and payments and so on that all of that system was out of date and should be looked at.  We also said about ourselves that we needed to have someone to define our work for us.  We needed someone to say, &quot;this is the job one is applying for and this is how one will be paid&quot;, so that it is upfront and transparent and people can actually see and understand it and there are no grey areas here.  On one side the Deputy is saying we should challenge the <i>status quo</i> here.  That is what we do here.  On the other side there is a voice saying: &quot;What were you doing challenging the <i>status quo</i>?&quot;.  I am trying to get a mixture of both.</p></speech>

I have a rake of questions but I am happy to come back in, other than to leave it on this point.  Deputy McGuinness said that the stories about his own time as a Minister of State have been in the media since April, so I imagine he has been doing quite an amount of research to check his time in office and to check that he has all his facts and figures lined up.  I find it somewhat surprising that he does not have the details of the London trip but perhaps during the meeting they might come to him.  There are three occasions the Deputy was able to volunteer to the committee that he travelled abroad with his spouse, paid for by the taxpayer.  He has been able to tell the committee the details of two.  It would be very helpful if we could have the details here at this committee rather than this trundling on.</p></speech>

There is the fact about the office and the fact about the toilet roll which have been dealt with.</p> <p>I have taken from all of that the queries that were put and the information that was asked for.  There was one trip to Seattle and trade missions.  I focused on those.  I do not have the information readily to hand.

There has been no indication that he has held back or had any political bias.  He has been an independent Chairman and I have no quarrel whatsoever with his tenure.  I echo his interesting point on whether it would have been better if all these things came out in hearings beforehand rather than now.  It is a lesson the committee and others might learn when choosing a Chairman in the future.</p><p>  It would be far more appropriate if there were not an adversarial session but rather one where those who wanted to could come before the committee and answer questions of this sort rather than information appearing in the press two years later.  The journalism involved has been excellent and laudable.  It was something that should have come out earlier.  As a result the committee has, willy-nilly, become politicised.</p><p>  The Deputy is a member of a political party and I am an Independent Deputy.  The Taoiseach has become embroiled in this.  There is no doubt the committee has been damaged by the fact that people have been forced to take political positions on matters being discussed by a committee which has traditionally not been politically tinged.  It is something with which we will have to deal, and it is deeply regrettable.</p><p>  The nub of the questions is that over the three issues, namely, the Deputy's office, his son and his wife, the McGuinness family seem to have done pretty well out of the State and taxpayer in 2007.  We have to ask whether that is consistent with the drive the Deputy and the committee leads to save as much public money as possible and make public officials and Ministers as accountable as possible for their tenure.</p><p>  I would like to ask the Deputy a few questions about that.  I take his point about it being five or six years ago.  I did not quite understand his answer to the questions asked by Deputy Harris and the Vice Chairman.  Is it unambiguously now the view of the Deputy that Ministers' spouses should not travel at the expense of the taxpayer?</p></speech>

That is clear.  I said the exceptional rule needs to be clarified in terms of cases which are seriously exceptional.  It is the Taoiseach who signs off on them, and in this day and age, that would not be acceptable.  I gave myself as an example.  I said if I was asked to sign off on it, I probably would not.  What constitutes an exceptional case needs to be established.  I did not say or mean at any stage that there should be a <i>carte blanche</i> arrangement for anyone and everyone to travel.  I do not agree with that.</p></speech>

I do not think any Ministers should have any spouses travelling with them at the State's expense.  I do not think there is justification for that.

Ministers should pay if their spouses are travelling with them.  There is no case to be made for a spouse going on a trade mission.  We have established all of that.  In general terms, the circular states a seriously exceptional position may be established.  That is the only point I was making in 2007.  I said already that if that were in today's terms, the answer would probably be "no".  That is a given.  I cannot be any clearer than that.</p></speech>

In some regulations it states it is for somebody else to decide.</p><p>  It is an opinion and does not affect the coffers of the State or the view around this table and how we question Ministers.

It is important that the committee can establish that the Deputy's opinions are consistent with the purpose of this committee, which is to save taxpayers' money.  That is what I am trying to establish.</p></speech>

He has been a member of this committee since 2011.  He could easily establish from my contributions to the committee that the opinions I hold do not cause me any difficulty in undertaking my task as Chairman.  I want to take up the Deputy on one point.  He stated that the McGuinness family did well.  I reject that comment completely.  He has no understanding of the contribution that we made.  I have already told him that the payments to my son were checked.  He did the work in accordance with the rates and, if I had the same judgment now and could apply it back then, it would have been done differently.  Any of us can say that about anything we do in life.  We learn from experience and we move on.  Sometimes we change our opinions and move on or else we develop our opinions.  None of the matters put in the public domain or under discussion today means I did something wrong in the context of the State and how I was paid.  I do not think the Deputy has anything to worry about in respect of my opinions and how I conduct business in this committee.</p></speech>

In my view, there are two elements to this matter.  One is whether Deputy McGuinness's position is consistent with being Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The other is the strange way that the matter entered the public arena.  There should not be criticism - as a journalist I speak with prejudice - of a journalist pursuing a story like this with determination.  That is absolutely fair.  A journalist is only as good as his or her source.  Deputy McGuinness said in answer to Deputy Harris that he spent some time wondering where it all came from.  There appears to be consistency or a pattern in raising events which occurred a long time ago.  I would hate to think they are all coming from a source that wishes to damage the committee or its Chairman.  What is his view on where the consistent information about the furnishing of his office, his son and his wife came from?</p></speech>

He might write about them on Sunday.  To be clear, that was not a criticism.  I have said that to the journalist, who is sitting in the Gallery.  I told him he has to do his job.  Let us not speak about him as if he was a shadow behind Deputy Ross.  He submitted the FOI requests and he knows whether he has made further requests.  He is only doing his job.

I am simply saying that we should have been discussing those views, as we do in the House everyday.</p><p>  Deputy Nash has views and I listen to them and I do not see anything wrong with including a mixture of views in what might be a better solution to a problem that we are trying to resolve.

In the e-mail of 29 August 2007, Deputy McGuinness states in the second last sentence: "I am logical, reasonable and tolerant, but I will not be intimidated by you [the assistant secretary], the Minister, an "ethical" position or the attitude of the press."  This is quite a terse exchange between the Deputy and the assistant secretary of the Department.  Obviously tensions were running high and it was quite frustrating for the Deputy to be in that Department and dealing with the civil servants who were trying to impose a view that the Minister of State did not appreciate or accept.  Deputy McGuinness is a high profile critic of the Civil Service and sometimes those particular criticisms are justified but have these exchanges coloured his judgment on the efficiency or otherwise of the public service?  I was just wondering.</p></speech>

The concern that I had in writing this e-mail was that in my previous life in business, if somebody asked me a question such as "Can I do X or Y?",  I would probably answer them directly.  "No, you cannot," or "Tell me why I should let you do X or Y."  In this instance the simple question was posed and it resulted in all of these e-mails, which were not addressed to me but to each of the officials.  They were pondering on this issue and starting their e-mails with the "I am given to understand that the Minister may be contemplating bringing...".  They were discussing a request.  When I responded on 29 August 2007, it may have been a poorly presented argument in a poorly presented e-mail.  As I have said already, it may have been written in anger or frustration.  I was not getting things done.  There was pressure building up in terms of delivery from policy on the Department side.  I was stuck without an office, without the appropriate staff, without many of the necessary things to function.  That is where some of the commentary came from.</p><p>  Deputy Nash also raised the efficiency of the Civil Service.  Right across the Civil Service there is no doubt that one meets good and efficient people but when I see people working with ancient regulations and in some cases poor work practices, one tries to articulate an argument around change and efficiencies and so on.</p> <p>It is true that my opinion is that there is not enough efficiency and delivery in the context of the Civil Service.  This is something the committee discusses every week.  It tires me that in spite of being a member of the committee in the period from 2002 to 2007, some of the very same problems emerge.  When I am asked about the efficiency of civil servants I base my judgment on the fact that there could be greater efficiencies. </p></speech>

My next question is on the operation of the freedom of information request.  As many Deputies are aware, if a freedom of information request is made about an individual, that individual must be notified.  I checked the Freedom of Information Act this morning and the explanatory memorandum states that this process must be initiated within ten working days of receiving a freedom of information request.  It is not a case of me having to telephone an official to ask if a freedom of information request has been submitted about me.  If a freedom of information request is submitted about an individual, the person in question must be notified.  Has the Chairman been notified of other freedom of information requests related to his tenure as Minister of State?</p></speech>

Notification depends on the freedom of information request.  If the request relates directly to one's role in this House, one is notified.  However, I was never notified of the freedom of information requests submitted about me.  The Deputy can check that with the Secretary General of the Department.  The only time I was notified was not when a freedom of information request was submitted but when a response to a freedom of information request was being released.  That was last Friday at 5.30 p.m. or whatever time it was.</p></speech>

Deputy Donohoe asked whether I have been notified that other freedom of information requests have been submitted to the Department in respect of me.  The answer is "No" and nor was I ever notified that FOI requests had been submitted about me.  I want the Deputy to understand that.  He stated one would not have to go to a third party to obtain a copy of the freedom of information request.  I did have to ask a third party.  When the initial information was released at the end of April, I obtained that information through a third party.  I did not think I could ask the freedom of information officer for a copy of the information and as I did not want to intervene in that way, I asked somebody else in the House to check the matter for me.</p></speech>

I reiterate that the information released last Friday was released in the evening, almost at the close of business.  I cited the time and date earlier.

I will pick up on a point made by Deputies Ross and Nash.  The Chairman expressed admiration for the work of the current committee, which he described as a collective and the most important committee of the House.  The Chair can be held to account by members when matters arise that impinge on the integrity and reputation of the committee.  Deputy McGuinness implied in the media this week when answering questions on this topic that, regardless of what has occurred, he intends to pursue a banking inquiry and matters relating to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and so forth.  This gives the impression that, for some reason, the other members of this collective entity either have no interest in furthering these investigations or are incapable of doing so.  By implying as much, the Chairman has damaged the reputation of the committee which is bigger than one man.  It is not just Deputy John McGuinness but the rest of us who work in it every week.  This was a negative and while it may have been an error on the part of the Chairman, it should be pointed out that the comments he made damaged the committee.  I put that to him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013061300012#L04000"><p>I did not intend to damage the committee.  I would not set out by way of comment or action to damage this committee; I have far too much respect for it.  In my opening remarks I made clear that I have respect for the members of the Government parties on this committee who must often take difficult positions or listen to difficult challenges that may reflect on the Government of the day.</p> <p>I too have been in that position.</p><p> Whatever I said this week about the Dublin Docklands Development Authority or the banking matter was a personal view.  I expressed the opinion that I believe we should pursue a banking inquiry, because we have the groundwork done for it, and likewise with regard to the DDDA.  However, that did not mean that I questioned in any way members' own determination, as members of this committee, to do likewise.  I have respected every member and how they might like to contribute to the general debate.  If Deputy Nolan has the impression that I offended a member or that in expressing my opinion I have damaged the committee, that was not intentional.  I would not set out to do that and I do not believe myself to be bigger or better than anyone who sits on this committee.  I happen to be Chairman of the committee, but I would happily serve as an ordinary member of it, which I have done previously.  If that perception has been picked up from something that was said, it was unintentional on my part and I apologise for it.  There was no intent to make me appear bigger or better than anyone on the committee.</p></speech>

Many others travelled in 2008.  I remember being a member of this committee, between 2002 and 2007, when members and wives travelled and members paid for their wives.  This was not unusual.</p></speech>

One can examine the activities of committees, chairmen and Members down through the years and one will see that down through the years, Ministers, Ministers of State and Members travelled at a cost to the State.  They may have brought their wives with them and paid for their wives.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the Member would reimburse the Department or committee at that time.  What I am being asked - I want to answer the question - is should all of that and all of the costs associated with every Minister or Minister of State who travelled be referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I heard the Comptroller and Auditor General answer a question asked by Deputy Ross one day when he asked about the Central Bank and he said that if the committee asked for that to be done, he would consider it.  Therefore, if Deputy Fleming wants to ask for an inspection of this matter, as he did in regard to the allowances, he should ask the Comptroller and Auditor General when he is here tomorrow whether he will undertake an examination of all costs, rather than single out a member.  I do not mind him examining mine, but they would be included in such an examination anyway.  He could do an analysis and recommendation on the whole area.  I do not have any difficulty with that.</p></speech>

The Chairman has said that previous members of this committee when travelling on Committee of Public Accounts business brought their spouses along by agreement, but reimbursed the committee.  Therefore, it has happened that spouses travelled, but the member subsequently reimbursed the committee the costs.</p></speech>

One of the issues here is that freedom of information has cost Departments a considerable amount of money.  However, long may the facility to make FOI requests last.  I have no problem at all in that regard and I have said that.  Under the chairmanship at the time of Deputy Michael Noonan, a group travelled from this committee to Sacramento.  I was part of that group and that is how I know of it.  Our wives were brought with us and we paid for our wives.  That is a fact.  I am sure there are other examples to which this committee can turn.  The Deputy asked about this and pressed me on it, so I am giving this example.</p> <p>What seems to be unusual about travel is that it seems as if I did it and no one else did it in 2008, but that is not the case.  That is not my case.  I am answering questions for me today.</p></speech>

I put it to Deputy McGuinness that on reading some of the correspondence one does not form that impression.  I will quote from one official.  She said that if there was official guidance she would appreciate it and that she was refusing for the moment to sign the authorisation which was solely for the Minister's wife and so on.  She continued by saying that she did not particularly like starting her relationship with the then Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, with a row but that it had to be and so on.  It strikes me from reading that correspondence that in the mind of the official it was not a case of a casual inquiry into whether it would be okay to bring his wife along.  That correspondence suggests that there was a vigorous exchange or that the official might even have felt under pressure to agree with Deputy McGuinness's position and go along with it.</p></speech>

There was not.  It was like anyone going into a job.  In my case I could say I was trying to get my feet under the table and get on with it, but there was no table.  There was no office.</p></speech>

Deputy McGuinness has made it absolutely and abundantly clear.  I absolutely accept that the issue of Deputy McGuinness carrying the costs was made explicitly clear and it is implicit in the documentation.  I am not questioning that.  I am suggesting that on reading the correspondence it strikes me that this official, at any rate, did not interpret Deputy McGuinness's request as something casual.  She said she was refusing to sign and that she did not like starting off on a row.  That suggests it was not simply an exchange of the type that Deputy McGuinness has indicated.  That is my objective read of it.</p></speech>

Deputy McDonald will have to take my view on this, that is, factually it was put casually.  Bear with me for a minute.  I was in the Department and attached to it and so on but there was no office for me and therefore I was not there.  Then the officials went into what is almost an overdrive of correspondence.  I find it hard to believe that a simple question triggers that, but it did happen.</p></speech>

Let us bring it to the end of the correspondence because it may help in understanding what went on.  They went into this overdrive of correspondence.  Apparently, that is what civil servants do.  They check things out and go from HEOs to APs up along the line.  That is fine.  I only discovered that at the end of August and therefore I cannot say how they felt about me.  Maybe on a human level I can understand that they might have said that the Minister asked them to do something.  I only consider myself as John McGuinness; I do not attach any other extras to me either as a Chairman or as a Minister, but they might have done so.  They were trying to be specific and, I would suggest, helpful.</p><p>  I wrote an e-mail to the official at the end of all of these e-mails.  I am referring to the correspondence with the official that triggered this and which I am being quoted from.  Perhaps it was a bad day when it was written.  I had not met the official in question.  That was my first time in the Department.  I met him later on.  Deputy Nash asked about the Civil Service.  If I had met him beforehand and known him better, I probably would not have written the e-mail.  He was a gentleman and a man that was well informed about all that stuff.</p></speech>

I put it to Deputy McGuinness that this official was an assistant secretary.  Let us take that window into what occurred.  It strikes me that the official did not view it simply as a casual throwaway consideration.</p><p>  Let us move forward to the correspondence of Deputy McGuinness.  I understand it was sent by e-mail on 29 August.  I accept that Deputy McGuinness has said that it was written a long time ago and that all of us have written letters at times that we could have couched in better terms.  However, the language used is quite strong.  Deputy McGuinness said he would not be intimidated.  This suggests to me objectively that what we were dealing with was not simply a casual request followed by a flurry of activity among civil servants and a response.  I suggest it was more charged than that.  Following an objective read of the words on the page, that is the impression one forms.</p><p>  I call on Deputy McGuinness to reassure the committee that in his tenure as a Minister of State at no stage did he attempt to force a situation with officials to succumb to his wishes in respect of the travel of his spouse.  I call on Deputy McGuinness to tell the committee that this was in fact the case.</p></speech>

I said it earlier several times - Deputy McDonald has acknowledged as much - that perhaps in the context of the reply at that time one might have done differently.  I did not expect the flurry of e-mails.  My life beforehand was about one-to-one and "Yes" or "No".</p></speech>

It was a casual request.  Deputy McGuinness did not seek to coerce or pressurise any officials.  That is his testimony.</p><p>  Let us fast forward to October.  There had been a flurry of e-mails.  Deputy McGuinness had sent correspondence and then he went back again, having been knocked back in respect of the trip to Dubai, and asked in respect of Canada.  He made a request again of the system in respect of a trade mission to Canada.  Deputy McGuinness said that when the answer was "No" he accepted it and his spouse did not travel.  That is the factual position.  How is it that Deputy McGuinness went back a second time?</p></speech>

The particular e-mail that the official wrote was out of a reconciliation.  We were sitting down at that stage, talking to each other and there was a better understanding of these trade missions and my role in the context of the trade section.  I do not have the document in front of me but I believe he acknowledged in the letter that the exchange in the conversation about Canada was a reasonable one.  I believe that was the term used.  We talked about Canada but it was a question and it was around the expectation.  It was my first time, or perhaps the second time, to sit down with the official in the context of all of what had happened.  Fences were being mended and we were sorting things out and that was the end of it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013061300015#O00500"><p>I think we met in my office - his office was beside mine - and it was time to bring to a conclusion this correspondence and these e-mails.  It was after the e-mail of 29 August.  I was obliged to work with the officials and, as stated, we did not get off to a happy start.  This concluded that round of discussions and it was no more or no less than that.  If I asked about the trade mission to Canada, he was reaffirming the position and explaining it.  It did not happen.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to mending fences.  It is clear that there were tensions within the Department and I have no doubt that some of these arose because the Deputy did not have an office or a desk.  Again, however, this gives rise to the question as to what was his level of interaction with the officials.  The Deputy has indicated in his testimony that at no stage was any official placed under duress or any pressure to go along with any arrangement.  I accept what he has said in this regard.</p></speech>

It is quite a stretch - even accepting the pressures involved - to insinuate any level of intimidation or ethical high-handedness on the part of the man who was both the Deputy's line Minister and party colleague.  The atmosphere which obtained was clearly charged.  At the time did Deputy McGuinness approach Deputy Martin and inform him that he was obliged to travel a great deal, that he had made an inquiry about his spouse accompanying him, that he was prepared to pay her way but that he was being stonewalled by the officials?  Did Deputy Martin approach Deputy McGuinness and say, "Listen, John, there are ethical issues here"?  Did any conversation take place six years ago in respect of this matter?</p></speech>

The Deputy used a particular word and I am conscious of what words mean.  There was no intimidation.  There was nothing like that intended.  I accept that there was a difficult start to my time in the Department and it was probably not the happiest of starts.  However, even without the happiest of starts, one can still get things to work.</p></speech>

I say this as someone who did not vote for him in the election to that position.  What is really debilitating for the committee for it is to obtain information from newspapers and other media outlets.  That places all of us in an entirely invidious position.

In the context of the overtime he was paid, I may have missed out on one or two points because I was obliged to leave the room for a time.  The amount involved was &euro;31,000.  How did such a sum build up?  Did the Deputy's son submit travel or subsistence claims in respect of his position?  Would it have been legal for him to do so?</p></speech>

In other words, he would have had to have made submissions on his claims and had these signed off on within the Department.</p> <p>The claims were made relative to that.</p><p> The Deputy asked me about the overtime.  Again, the overtime was worked over the seven days of a week for that period because we were short-staffed and because of the sheer volume of work that was coming into the office at that level.  It was not just constituency work.  It was IT, research and Department work.</p></speech>

I think the Oireachtas arrangement is different.  The Department arrangement is different when one is employed at that level and any of the claims were made in accordance with the rules, the guidelines, that were set down at that time.  In other words, he had to give information.  He had to have the matter vouched.  He had to have conducted his travel or his overtime, and they were then submitted to the Department for scrutiny and sanction.</p></speech>

I want to refer to the Vincent Browne programme but it is clear that the London issue needs to be addressed.  Members made it absolutely clear that the details of that need to be forthcoming, and I would agree with them.</p><p>  To refer to Vincent Browne's programme a few nights ago, at the end of the exchange between Deputy McGuinness and Mr. Browne - it was a typical Vincent Browne interview - the Deputy got quite combative and he mentioned the issue of Dublin Docklands and the banking inquiry as potential reasons, and Deputy Nolan might have alluded to this, this is happening.  The Deputy put it out there that that was a potential reason individuals were leaking pieces of information, that freedom of information, FOI, requests were being made and that, as he said, a journalist was doing his job.  The Deputy is in politics since 1979, as he said.  He is a realist.  He has made political enemies, as I have, but is he surprised by what is happening here today because I am not?  The general view within this building is that the Deputy may have gone too far with regard to dealing with Government, civil servants - the mandarins.  Is anyone really surprised that we are here today dealing with this in this fashion?  I am not.</p><p>  There is a balance in terms of the Government picking a member of the Opposition as Chairman of the most powerful committee in this building and that individual doing their job, as they see it, but we should be honest about that.  The Deputy has been very combative with regard to elements of the Government, particularly when it comes to the banking inquiry.  He has been very vocal in the media.  In some cases he has raised the ire of members of this committee because he has done that singularly and, in some cases, without informing members of the committee, and that has been raised.  </p><p>  I am not surprised this is happening and, in my opinion, the Deputy made it clear on the Vincent Browne programme that he is not really surprised either.  There is a reason for everything, and the reason somebody or some people are leaking information is to remove the Deputy from his position.  That is my opinion.</p></speech>

I will make a point at the end of it.  I will give my opinion and will then ask him a question.  I have mentioned the London issue, which he needs to clarify quickly.  That would be helpful.  I revert to the "Tonight with Vincent Browne" programme, at the end of which I thought the Chairman got quite direct and combative with regard to the reasons this could be happening.  He mentioned Dublin Docklands and the banking inquiry as reasons we are sitting here today and that these questions are being asked.  The reality is someone is leaking to the media.  Freedom of information, FOI, requests are being made and stories are appearing in that newspaper.  The Chairman has been around politics for a long time and has a combative style.  Moreover, it is fair to state he has made political enemies.  As to whether I am surprised this is happening, considering everything that has happened over the past two years with regard to the Committee of Public Accounts and where we are as a country, as well as the exchanges that have appeared in the media over the past couple of years, I am not surprised.</p><p>  I will separate the leaking and the FOI requests with regard to what has been driving this issue over the last couple of weeks.  That is important and I refer to the Chairman's style and the manner in which he has handled the committee.  As to whether he has gone too far, in the opinion of some Government members and people within the Government, I think their answer to that question is "Yes".  As to whether I think it is debatable, with regard to his position as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I think it is.  Equally, I think the opportunity this has given to members of the Government party to use this as an opportunity to get rid of him is also debatable.  I think it is being used as an opportunity to remove him as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Consequently, as to whether I am surprised that this is occurring, based on what has happened and on the Chairman's style over the past couple of years, I am not.  That is the Chairman's opinion and in my opinion, he said so and made this clear on the "Tonight with Vincent Browne" programme.  However, there are reasons for everything.</p> <p>When it was put to him why this was occurring - other members have asked this question - Deputy McGuinness made it clear that in his opinion issues that were a point of contention between this committee and certain Departments could be the reason we are here asking these questions today.  That is my assessment of why we are here today and Deputy McGuinness should answer the question, if he can, as to why we are in this position.</p><p> My opinion is that one needs a combative Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to get to the bottom of matters in many circumstances.  One does not need a mouse.  As to whether Deputy McGuinness has crossed the line in how he has run this committee, in Government circles people think he has and that view has been expressed to me.  People dance around such matters but the reality is everybody in this room knows what has been driving this in the past couple of weeks.</p><p> I also think that if members of this committee have issues with the way Deputy McGuinness has been handling the committee, they should come out and say it.  Maybe they have not been as vocal as they should have been, in particular, in the past few months.  If Deputy McGuinness arrives back in the Chair next week, we need to deal with that if there are issues to be dealt with for the future.</p><p> It is a comment of mine.  I suppose I see both sides of this.  There needs to be fairness here.  Every one of the members who has spoken here today has been at pains to state that Deputy McGuinness has handled this committee in a fair and impartial way, but there are political undertones to this meeting and I think Deputy McGuinness shares that view.</p></speech>

I have just said I will not answer them because one is entering into the area of conspiracy theories.  That is how I feel.  I am here to answer questions about specifics.  Deputy Deasy has done something different in terms of the questions.  He himself is fairly combative and fairly straightforward.  He has put the questions in a different way and he deserves an answer.  Given what he said, I feel that, unless he trumps me on that competitiveness, combativeness and everything else, I will have to answer those questions.  There are probably two of us in it.</p></speech>

I think not.</p><p>  Deputy Deasy stated he is not surprised that this is happening and I am not surprised that this is happening.  He asked whether I had gone too far.

That is for whom it tolls, and I am not on my own in this.  I chair the committee by consensus.  I have very strong views.  Deputy Nash probably differs strongly with some of the views that I express because he asked me in general about the Civil Service and so on, and I do not mind.  I try to be accommodating, but I will not stray away from my belief that we must do a job as impartially as possible and a mouse will not suit.  I do not know where I am on the spectrum between a mouse and whatever else one is looking for, but it is not close to the mouse.</p><p>  The next question Deputy Deasy asked was where I thought this was coming from.  I read newspaper articles recently where members of this committee admitted that they were under pressure in Fine Gael from their own Ministers.  I read it in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and there were other anonymous remarks about it.  I do not ignore that; it happened.  That is fine and that may be the case.</p><p>  What about civil servants?  Deputy Deasy is pressing me on this.  It is the same answer and he knows the answer.  Being on this side of the committee, which I have experienced for the first time today, is not a comfortable place to be.  I thought Mr. Elderfield might get me, as well as the country, out of the loop but he has not.  I am still here and I am willing to answer the questions.  I am sure that there are sets of civil servants who consider the Committee of Public Accounts with not that much respect, with concern or with a view that it is difficult to come here and the Chairman - to use a phrase from Deputy McDonald - might be cranky to say the least.  I am not sure whether Deputy McDonald was referring to me, but that is the way I see it.  Those civil servants probably do not like that I ask those questions.</p><p>  Deputy Deasy asks where these matters are coming from.  They come from freedom of information requests, but I am damn sure they are being leaked from the Department, whether by freedom of information request or by press inquiry, both of which are two different matters, but there is also other stuff which I am sure is being put into the public domain through one means or another.  That is the nature of matters in politics.  It is also the nature of matters within the Civil Service.  If one goes back over the history of the State, one will see matters being leaked about people, and one can ask where they came from.  I believe there are probably powerful forces that would not like to see a banking inquiry conducted, that would not like to see an inquiry into other spending in the State and would prefer to have it lie.  I do not take that point of view.  I am sorry, I do not.  Maybe all those forces are at play.  I do not know because now I am back to the other question, the conspiracy theory.  I must say to all the members that in all my time in politics, I have never seen such reporting on an individual and his actions in the 18 months of a Ministry as I have seen over recent weeks and since 21 April.</p></speech>

Deputy Deasy has answered the other parts of that question.  He asked whether I had crossed the line.  I have not crossed the line.  I have taken the job seriously.</p> <p>That in itself caused problems.  If the Deputy told me to adjust my sights, I would consider the advice but may decide not to adjust them because I believe a job has to be done.  I do not want to offend anyone or act without the co-operation of the committee.  The committee sets the agenda.  In every meeting we attend, the agenda and work programme is set out and members are asked for their agreement.  I do not know whether that answers the question.</p></speech>

That is the standard against which we must measure the London trip.  These are the official guidelines according to which a spouse of a Minister can be paid to travel.  I set that as the context for when the Chairman reverts to us with his information.</p></speech>

He made an impassioned contribution but during 2008, the only full year in which he was a Minister of State, a parliamentary question on foreign and domestic travel and subsistence claims by individual Ministers or Ministers of State indicates, to the best of my knowledge, that he came out at the top to the best of my knowledge with claims of &euro;54,126.77.  I do not have time to go through all the figures but they are available from the Official Report.  He was one of four Ministers of State in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and we was the top of the table in that Department, as well as at the top across Government.  I acknowledge that he had responsibility for trade and commerce, a brief which involves travel, but so too does the job of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  Why did he top the league table for travel and subsistence claims in 2008?</p></speech>

That is how seriously the Government - not the Department - considered the matter.  I challenge Deputy Harris to go forward in years and take out the Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce - it is structured differently now - to compare the figures.  He should not just put a figure into the public domain.</p></speech>

I want to be straight about that in order to develop a perspective.  I think I am unique, with the possible exception of Deputy McGuinness, in serving previously as a Government backbencher and now as a member of the Opposition.  There was always tension between Ministers and the committee.  When Accounting Officers got a hard time from us, they could not voice their complaints publicly.  They would go home or back to their offices to complain to their Ministers about backbenchers giving them a hard time, with the result that Ministers collectively started to view the committee as troublesome or a nuisance.  Fine Gael and Labour Party Ministers are feeling the same way as their predecessors.  It comes with the territory.  What is the purpose of having a Comptroller and Auditor General and a constitutional role for his office and the Committee of Public Accounts if we are to serve at the pleasure of Ministers?  We would be better to close up shop.  The day the committee does not trouble Ministers is the day we should go home.  I hope there will always be tension between this committee and the Government of the day to ensure we hold it to account.</p></speech>

As this meeting is being held in public session, the comments and reflections from various members require a response from the Government.  We are not naive.  We understand that tension with the Administration is unavoidable and, arguably, necessary in the course of our work but I hope I speak for others when I seek an assurance from the Administration that, notwithstanding this tension, there will be no attempt to undermine the necessary work we do on behalf of the taxpayer.  I would like to see a statement to this effect from the highest level.  It was mentioned earlier that the Taoiseach remarked on the specific matters emerging in the media.  We now need a statement of understanding of and respect for our work from that highest level.  Whatever position the Government takes, the members of this committee will continue to pursue our work.</p><p>  The outstanding issue from this meeting revolves around a particular trip to London.

It is a conspiracy theory.  I ask Deputy McGuinness to comment on a couple of points.  It is a serious situation when a Government Deputy asserts that members of Government believe Deputy McGuinness has gone too far.  There is talk on the Government side of conflicts arising between the committee and the Government.  It appears that we are totally politicised and almost inevitably on a collision course with the Government because of the statements from the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition, as well as today's meeting.</p> <p>I take seriously what Deputy Deasy said but I take even more seriously that Deputy McGuinness said he was "damn sure" the leaks came from the Department.  This is a grave situation.  I have no idea whether it is true or not, but if it is true that the Government is deliberately trying to undermine the work of the PAC and there are civil servants, which is what Deputy McGuinness means, leaking information to undermine the work of the PAC, the very least we can expect is a statement from the Taoiseach, as Deputy McDonald said, reassuring us that our work is not being undermined and will not be interfered with and that the respect for the independence of the PAC continues.  I do not know whether any of these statements are true because I am not privy to what Government Ministers feel about the PAC and I have not got those particular reverberations myself, but it is now being said, and it demands a response.  I do not know which Department Deputy McGuinness is referring to but I presume it is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  That Department must respond to the statement Deputy McGuinness made that he is "damn sure" the leaks came from there.  Would he agree with that?</p></speech>

The first session of this committee hearing was useful and the Chairman answered all questions well.  There is an issue about London that people want clarity on.  No law or guideline was broken.  Nothing was done that people could have a judgment on.  The Chairman did nothing that was illegal and broke no rules and I see nothing, therefore, that would require him to vacate the Chair of the PAC.  As I have said, I always thought he was a strong and independent Chairman.</p><p>  What happened in the second session was a farce where we have gone into conjecture, nonsense and rubbish talking about conspiracies and all kinds of stuff.  The journalist who wrote the articles said explicitly in one of his articles that there are no conspiracies, that he is not involved in perpetuating any conspiracies, that they are simply facts that exist.  I have never been contacted or impugned in my work by any Minister, Government Member or member of my party to do anything to frustrate the work of this committee.  Now the headline will be, "Allegation: Government trying to scupper work of PAC" when I have never come across any of that in any of my dealings, and I have been on this committee since day 1.  That needs to go out there.</p><p>  This conjecture, allegations and mud-throwing, which the Chairman has been subjected to in other arenas, has undermined this session.  I thought we were getting out of it.  By engaging in it the way he has done, Deputy McGuinness has created a greater problem for himself.  His judgment on whether he should have gone there at this point has to be questioned.  I had no question whatsoever in my head whether he was unsuitable until now and what this has turned into.  If we are talking about protecting the credibility and reputation of this committee, it has certainly been damaged by this farce of the second half of the session.</p></speech>

I have formed my own opinion on this matter, which I have expressed in this room independent of any member of Government and my fellow members of the PAC.  Any inference that any other forces are seeking to influence my opinion is utterly incorrect and untrue.  As other people do, I take my responsibilities on this committee with the utmost seriousness and my independence in that regard is respected by everyone in my party and across Government.  For the impression to be created, as it has been in the last number of minutes, that the contrary is true, is something I refute firmly.</p></speech>

I found part of this process useful and the other section is as clear as mud and has created more issues, I am afraid to say.  It is very damaging that any inference would go out - and that impression was being tried to be created - that Deputies who happen to members of Government parties are somehow being got at by Ministers.  We all know and accept how the business of this committee should be conducted.  If I were ever approached by a Minister on a certain PAC issue or how I should conduct myself on the PAC, I would resign from this committee and have nothing more to do with it.  I would have a serious issue with that.  I think I can speak for my own party colleagues.  That view taken in the last few minutes has been really unhelpful and is being used as a deliberate distraction from the real issues.  It is very damaging.  For those who talk about the credibility of the committee and their presence here being about trying to re-establish that credibility, efforts to do that have undermined it further.</p></speech>

I have one final question on his son taking on the maternity leave cover role.  Would it be the norm that the Minister would decide who would take up a maternity leave position?  Did he make the decision and what would be the procedures in the Department?</p></speech>

As is the case, Ministers and Ministers of State are appointed and the staff move to the Department and are paid by the Department.  It was not a formal decision.  It was a question of what was happening in the office, the volume of work in the Department and the constituency, how best we could cover it, and people took up positions.  Those who generally took the lead roles were best skilled in running the IT, the office, dealing with problems and liaising between Departments.</p></speech>

In doing that it was possibly the most cost-effective way of doing it.  From an administrative point of view, it was certainly the most efficient way of doing it.  The fact that the person had to work almost seven days a week meant they could cover liaison between Department and constituency office, keeping the other staff sorted, doing IT training which we paid for ourselves and so on.  That is the reason for it.  What was the other question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.482" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013061300021#V00400"><p>I do not have another question.  During the first session we dealt with the matters at hand and we veered into other areas in the second session.  As a Government party Deputy, I agree with my colleagues that I greatly value the independence of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think I speak for all members in saying that regardless of who appears before us, we are robust in our questioning, which is extremely important.  The message needs to go out from this committee that, collectively as a group of Deputies, we value the independence of the Committee of Public Accounts and we value the work we do.  Today was about the integrity of the Committee of Public Accounts itself in dealing with issues that came into the public domain.  It is something about which I feel very strongly.  I see the role of the Committee of Public Accounts as being very independent of Government and I have always operated in that way.  The work we do bears that out.  We have produced reports, including the banking report, that I believe everyone has fed into.</p><p>  Nobody, including me, questions the Chairman's very good and ongoing role as Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is about different issues.  This is about the credibility of the Committee of Public Accounts itself, how we do our work and the distractions from that work with various issues.  If the Chairman was in this position, I believe he would be doing likewise.  He would not expect anything less because that is what we do in the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>  In his closing remarks, I ask the Chairman to deal with the issue coming back in terms of the London trip but equally that he would reflect on what the Committee of Public Accounts is all about, the reasons we are here today and the legitimate questions that we have had to pose on behalf of the taxpayer.  Regardless of how these have come into the public domain, questions have had to be posed.  The Chairman spoke about being robust etc.  People involved in the Committee of Public Accounts want to question.  That is what we are here to do.  It is never a personality issue.  To put a positive note on our deliberations more recently, we are an independent committee, we do our work and we value our credibility.  We are a robust committee and will continue to be a robust committee, and that is down to the members of the committee and the work we do.  Mr. Matthew Elderfield will appear before the committee shortly and we will question him in a robust way on behalf of the taxpayer.</p><p>  I ask the Chairman to make his concluding remarks, including undertakings to come back about the London trip and so forth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013061300021#V00500"><p>First, I am not going to delay the meeting with long closing remarks.  I think they have answered all the questions.  As previous speakers have said, I think it has been a very worthwhile exercise and I cite it as being an example of what might happen before anybody else is appointed as Chairman - to have these conversations first.</p><p>  The only issue I was unable to deal with - because it is not in the freedom of information requests - was the detail of that trip to London.  When we broke for the vote in the D&aacute;il, I made a call to the Department to have that checked out.  I do not have that information.  I would not have it.  It would not be normal for me to have it and I do not have it.</p><p>  I also checked out a point raised by Deputy Donohoe.  I only get notified when the freedom of information request is actually being released.  I do not have a notification that the freedom of information request has been submitted to the Department.  The other part of the response to the question the Deputy raised is that there are other ways of getting information, such as press queries and that.  There would have been a lot of press queries handled in this way as well.  The information I gave the committee earlier about the process that involved me is accurate.  Therefore, those named in the freedom of information request, including me, would not have got the freedom of information request or known it was made until they actually were told the result of the freedom of information query.  That answers that part of it.  If I receive the information from the Department before we conclude our next session, I will make it available to the meeting.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Nolan, in terms of the other specific political issues, as we might call them, which were raised in the latter part of the meeting, I was only responding to Deputy Deasy and giving an overall view on how things might happen or do happen in politics.  The question ranged across surprise that this had happened, what was driving this and whether I had gone too far.  I do not think I have.  All the other questions I answered in the context of Deputy Deasy's query had to be raised because they were specific commentary on my style of chairmanship.</p><p>  The Vice Chairman asked about assurances.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013061300021#V00700"><p>I will get those.  From here on in, what happens?  I hope the debate we have had today strengthens the committee.  I do not see anything wrong with any of the things that have happened.  It has been a good strong robust exchange.  The members have proven to the public that regardless of whether one is a member of the committee, an Accounting Officer or a Secretary General, if one comes before the committee, one can expect to get what is a very direct, robust exchange of questions in the interest of the public and the detail required on whatever topic it might be.  The members of the committee have proven that point today, in my opinion.  I might not have liked it in terms of being the one who is sitting here, but an excellent job has been done.</p><p>  I would be inclined to steer away from the political and get back to the point where it is the most important committee in the House.  It is exercising that importance every week by scrutinising the Secretaries General and the Accounting Officers.  It is not distracted in any way from its work.  I admit this has been a distraction but not necessarily of my direct creation.  I am happy to come to answer what needs to be answered.  I have often had direct calls from senior civil servants and had an exchange with one of them over how the committee operates.</p><p>  Let us bring down the tension a little bit at the end of this.  I am as prepared as everyone around this table if Government, the Civil Service or any collective groups wants to say, "Look, we need to chat to you about how this thing is going because we believe it either could be done better or maybe you are going too far."  Deputy Deasy told me that I was stepping across the line.  There is no harm in having that conversation with people like that to establish if a direction needs to be taken and to re-establish the boundaries.  That is fine.  It is like having an opinion.  Let us have a conversation about the opinion.  That was part of our discussion today.  I have no difficulty with that.</p><p>  I firmly believe every member of this committee is as important as the next member.  I just happen to be the Chairman and that is as much as I would like to say.  I thank those who made their contributions and asked the questions.</p> <p>I thank the members of the media who brought up the issue and put it out there.  I might disagree with the way in which it was done but I have no difficulty whatsoever with the fact it was done because it is their job.  I hold no grudges against anyone.  This is what we do here.  This is the transparency of the operation.  We have learned a lot from it, in so far as there must be ways and means found to raise these questions at a more appropriate point, perhaps the appointment stage.  I come back to this because it is very valuable.  The <i>status quo</i>, be it regulations, protocols or issues from a Department, need to be clarified.  Perhaps Members of the House should be made aware when freedom of information requests have been made.</p></speech>

The fact is that during public session a very troubling possibility raised its head in respect of interference.  I am not in a position to adjudicate as to the rightness or wrongness of it, but it has happened.  As a committee we need to ask for a response to this.  I certainly feel very strongly in this regard.  I am not a Government Deputy.  Like others I come here to carry out my function week on week.  I want to know that if there has been any funny business, and I am not in a position to say whether this is correct or not, at a minimum it will cease and get reassurance from the Administration there will not be any future episodes of this kind.  This is a separate concern to the specific issues Deputy McGuinness had to answer here today.  There are two concerns.  I feel the committee should request this assurance from the Administration, whether one is a Government or Opposition Deputy.  I feel very strongly on this.  Things have been said here which are on the public record now and they demand response.</p></speech>

Across all political circles, including the Government, this is the case.  I suggest we send a transcript of this meeting to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and deal with it in this fashion.  This is reasonable.</p></speech>

They are separate issues to those which the Chairman has dealt with.  It is very important to state as a Government member of the committee that if we want to explore this more it is very clear to anybody looking from the outside in and to colleagues on the committee, that Government members of the committee have participated in the publication and production of reports and the interrogation of witnesses which, it would be fair to say, would not have been comfortable for any Government of any day.  This is important to note.</p><p>  It is also important to note the committee has never divided on an issue other than the election of the Chairman.  The Government has an inbuilt majority, were it to use it, which it never has.  I make this point in the sense there is no evidence to suggest any Government Deputy on the committee has been less vociferous than any member of the committee who may not be a Government Deputy.  I want to put this on the record.</p></speech>

I asked how a freedom of information request operates.  Section 29 of the Freedom of Information Act provides for consultation with individuals where personal information has been requested.  However, details of official trips are not regarded as personal information.  I do not have good recollection of the London trip.  It was on 14 and 15 November 2008 and involved a function in London.  The Secretary General will follow up with the relevant details.  It appears I deputised for a Minister.</p></speech>

It also reported on the regulator's response to recommendations in two earlier special reports that had dealt with regulation of financial services providers by the Central Bank and the regulator.</p><p>  The first examination carried out by my office was reported on in 1999.  It looked at the Central Bank's approach to the regulation of credit and investment institutions which was the extent of the bank's regulatory remit at that time.  The report on the examination concluded that the frequency of the bank's on-site prudential inspection appeared low.  The target levels of prudential inspection were not being achieved.  The Central Bank had adopted a light touch to prudential supervision based on limited on-site inspection activity, combined with periodic review meetings with the management of the institutions.  Also, the Central Bank did not base its prudential supervision work on a formal risk assessment system.</p><p>  We recommended that a risk assessment system be developed on the basis that the prudential risk profile of financial service providers could potentially be used to gauge the stability of the credit and investment sectors.  Following publication of the special report and the committee's inquiry into deposit interest retention tax administration, which was completed around the same time, there was an in-depth review of the role of financial regulation and its structures.  That resulted in the establishment of the Financial Services Authority of Ireland in 2003.  That brought responsibility for most financial regulation into a single agency and operates as a stand alone entity within the Central Bank.  The functions of the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding regulation of the insurance sector were transferred to the regulator, which was also given a consumer protection remit.</p><p>  Having allowed a period for the new regulatory regime to settle in, a second examination of financial services regulation was undertaken by my office.  The report on that examination was published in May 2007.  The examination's main finding regarding prudential supervision was that the regulator had developed a formal risk assessment system.</p> <p>However, the model used had been developed to assess risk on a relative basis only.  It did not try to assess the underlying level of risk attaching to the financial institutions in question.  In practice, the risk model operated to allocate the resources available for supervision work in each financial sector rather than to inform assessments about trends in sector riskiness or decision making about what level of resources might be required for effective prudential supervision work.  As a result, in 2007 prudential supervision was still being resource-led rather than risk driven.  </p><p> The 2007 report also repeated the earlier concern about the frequency and intensity of on-site inspection work.  It found that the frequency of inspection visits to financial services providers remained low.  We also noted that the regulator had up to then used its administrative penalty powers only in a very limited way.  The report recommended that the regulator should arrange for an independent review of the adequacy of its prudential supervision processes, including the target frequency and duration of inspections, the resource levels applied, the type of checks carried out on site and the follow up processes.  We suggested this work be carried out by means of peer review and that the regulator's inspection process be benchmarked against those of other EU regulators with similar mandates.  The Financial Regulator did not carry out the proposed independent peer review.  Instead it commissioned a firm of management consultants to carry out a review of the adequacy of its prudential inspection process as part of a general business process review.  In the event, that review was carried out as the financial crisis was unfolding.  It ultimately confirmed that the level of resources the regulator had allocated to banking and insurance supervision was lower than that for other national financial regulators.</p><p> Special Report No. 72 which was completed in December 2009 found that there had been a significant increase in the intensity of supervision of those credit institutions that had availed of the State guarantee for banking liabilities, including additional reporting of Ireland's increased on-site presence by supervisory staff and attendance at key meetings of the institutions.  The regulator noted that the availability of additional resources would be a key factor in implementing a more intensive supervisory approach across all sectors.  The regulator also committed to developing and extending its current risk model as a priority but stressed that the ultimate design of the system would need to be aligned with developments in the international regulatory framework.  </p><p> Based on the report's findings and cognisant of the need to strengthen the regulatory framework, the report set out a number of proposals.  We suggested the regulator should consider placing more emphasis on the testing of transactions and balances in the course of its on-site inspection work, especially testing that the relevant internal controls in financial institutions had operated properly.  The reason this was suggested was that risk-based systems could only function optimally when they were informed by feedback from the review of actual transactions, in conjunction with top-down analysis of the sustainability of business models and associated strategies operated by the individual institutions.  We also suggested consideration be given to a requirement that credit institutions' external auditors provide an annual positive assurance statement on the functioning of the internal corporate governance regime, including the risk management function.  While this is likely to involve some additional cost, good internal regulation is in the interests of financial institutions and would strengthen public assurance.  We also suggested consideration might be given to requiring the regulator to present an annual statement relating to supervisory matters to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann so as to ensure more formal cyclical public accountability for financial regulation.  </p><p> The deputy governor will be able to update the committee on developments on these recommendations since the committee last took evidence on this matter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.524" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Elderfield" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013061300024#Y00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting me back to discuss the progress made in improving financial regulation and supervision since I was last here in May 2010, at which time we discussed the Comptroller and Auditor General's work on the lessons of the financial crisis.  There is a lot of ground to cover, but I will be brief as we can cover more of the detail in the discussion.</p><p>  Let me spend just a few minutes on three areas: supervisory capability and approach, regulatory standards and powers and regulatory philosophy, including the role of enforcement.  Let me mention one loose end from the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report 72 which relates to auditor assurance statements.  They are the two measures the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned that have been implemented.</p><p>  I sound a note of caution that while good progress has been made in improving financial regulation and supervision in Ireland, we are by no means all the way there yet.  As a supervisor, one is almost always playing catch-up with the industry and it is dangerous to think one will get to a point when one can rest on one's laurels.  Therefore, it is important to maintain the momentum of improvements, keep the regulatory framework up-to-date and ensure supervisory capabilities are always at their best.  It is also especially important to be vigilant against backsliding and attempts to compromise the independence or dilute the diligence of regulation, especially when times start to get good.</p><p>  In terms of supervisory capability and approach, it was clear that supervision was under-resourced in a range of areas; therefore, staffing levels have necessarily increased in the past few years.  My original estimation was that the regulatory function division of the Central Bank would need to be some 725 persons strong, but based on experience, process improvements and efficiencies, I think a target level of around 600 would be sensible for the end of the current three year Central Bank strategy in 2015.  Continually striving to improve quality is also important, by ensuring the right mix of experience and investing in training in order that supervisors have the skills to challenge firms effectively.  Ensuring the Central Bank can attract and retain the skills it needs will, no doubt, become an increasingly demanding challenge as the market for the relevant specialised skills improves.  Having some 600 supervisors into more than 10,000 regulated entities requires some strategic choices to be made about resource allocation which we undertake through the new risk assessment framework we have developed called PRISM, probability risk and impact system, not the NSA's PRISM that is in the news.  This involves an implicit exercise in setting risk appetite in terms of ensuring adequate resource levels for those firms that have the biggest potential impact on customers and their financial stability should they fail.  Our PRISM system also provides a framework for systematically scoring firms on the risk they pose against particular categories such as credit risk, market risk and operational risk.  We then communicate these risk scores to the firms, together with a risk mitigation plan which in plain English is a "to do list" for firms to address.  This system is new to the Central Bank in the past couple of years and reflects best international practice in how to assess risks in an organised, consistent and systematic manner.  The framework does not provide a guarantee that failures will never occur - we should expect that they will continue to do so in smaller firms - but it does mean that we will closely man mark the largest firms in order to reduce the risk of their failure.</p><p>  Supervision is about how one polices the rules; regulation is about setting the rules.  There is a very busy international agenda of regulatory change which is feeding into Ireland via the European Union, the G20 and the financial stability board.  I have some sympathy for industry about the volume of change taking place and the challenges this poses for implementation.  At a domestic level, the Central Bank has been focused in the initiatives it has taken on the statutory code for corporate governance, the new framework for fitness and probity and the major changes that impact on most sectors.  These have helped to fill important gaps in regulation.  I am also very grateful to successive Governments and the Members of this House for the support they have provided in upgrading the supervisory and enforcement powers available to the Central Bank, with legislation in this area close to final adoption.  This is a welcome step towards improving the regulatory framework.  It will be important to keep fine-tuning the rules based on emerging international best practice.</p><p>  In this very brief survey I wish to say a word about regulatory philosophy.  The lessons of the financial crisis are clear - supervision and regulation were too light touch.  As the IMF states, good supervision is, in fact, intrusive.  As Professor Patrick Honohan said in his review, supervisors need to be decisive in following through on issues.  Our PRISM system is designed to provide a framework that prompts such action; for example, we closely track the risk mitigation programme plans we send to firms to ensure they are doing what we ask them to do.  However, at the heart of the approach there needs to be a robust regulatory philosophy that encourages challenge.  We have described this as "assertive risk based supervision underpinned by a credible enforcement deterrent".</p> <p>This is designed to put a few concepts front and centre, namely, that we operate a risk-based approach in which we differentiate based on impact and probability; that there are consequences and accountability for non-compliance; and that our supervisors are empowered to insist upon actions to mitigate risk where we are not satisfied by the explanation of a firm's management. </p><p> As today's session is, I understand, formally designed to help close off the committee's review of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report into the lessons of the financial crisis, Special Report 72, I note there is one loose end in the recommendations that still needs to be concluded.  This relates to the introduction of auditor assurance statements.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to two other points.  On the testing of controls, this is done in PRISM.  One of the powers that is coming in the Act will be the ability of skilled persons to look at controls.  Public statements are provided under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.</p><p> The one loose end, as I noted, is the auditor assurance statements.  Having conducted some preliminary consultation with stakeholders, we believe that a risk-based framework, with the obligation applied to the highest impact firms only, is the best and most proportionate way forward.  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill provides a clear mandate to introduce such assurance statements.  Once the legislation is adopted, this matter can be progressed to a conclusion and we will have a consultation on the issue at that stage.  </p><p> We could cover much more ground and I am sure there are more areas the committee is interested in discussing.  This short introduction was by way of highlighting some of the key areas from my perspective.  I thank the committee for its attention and look forward to our discussion and to answering members' questions.</p></speech>

The figure has increased to about 620.  When I did the first budget I thought we would have to increase staff numbers to about 725 but I no longer believe we will have to go that high.  I think we will be able to trend down towards 600 as a couple of our tasks start to roll off.  There is a lot of activity around dealing with the troika and EU-IMF programme and this will fade away over time.  Certain regulation and supervision projects will also fade away over time.  The principal way of becoming more efficient, however, and we have started to do so, is by putting more of our staff on front-line activities rather than processes.  We still do too much using manual processes.  We have been trying to automate different aspects of our work.  In the area of regulatory information and the sending in of returns and financial information, much of this work involved sending in spreadsheets on pieces of paper.  Almost all of this work is now done online.  Under our fitness and probity framework, if one comes into the system and wants to become a director or work in the industry, one must file a questionnaire with us and be assessed.  We now do this online in an automated process and we also plan to have our authorisation processes completed online.  We will be able to reduce staff numbers when we bring these different elements online.</p><p>  Staffing, which was under-resourced, has reached about the right level.  The thing to watch out for after I leave, if one likes, is to make sure current quality is retained as markets get hotter, as they will at some point, and staff are not poached.  The key issue is to retain good quality staff who have experience of the industry and are experienced supervisors. </p></speech>

We now have a mix of experienced supervisors who have done supervision for a while.  They are people who have come from industry, some of whom are from overseas, while others are home-grown, as it were.  We need to keep investing in training and improving technical training.  There are some very complicated, technical aspects of what we do, for example, stress testing for the banks, looking at loan loss forecast models and actuarial assessments on the insurance side to ensure the reserve levels of the firms are adequate.  Holding on to one's most skilled staff is a constant battle and struggle.  Obviously, the difficult pay environment is a challenge in this regard.  We need to keep an eye on that and maintain investment.  One should never say: "We are there, it is done and we are in a happy place."  One must keep working at it.</p></speech>

I do not have the numbers to hand but it has been below 10% for most of the time I have been in place.  The one area that tends to have a higher turnover is insurance supervision because we have a large international insurance market and there is a great deal happening in regulation and solvency, which is an issue we can discuss in greater detail if Deputies wish.  This is a highly skilled technical area in which we have an above average turnover.  As we all know, the job market is constrained because of the economy.  This is particularly the case in banking where turnover has not been high.  However, if one looks ahead to when things start to go well, that is when it will become difficult for a supervisor.  One must then start to say "No" because one needs well-qualified staff who understand the business models and can challenge when things are getting too hot.  That is the moment of risk when turnover could increase and it is one to watch.</p></speech>

More than 126,000 mortgages are in arrears.  What is his estimate of what the figure will be in the next six, 12 and 18 months?</p></speech>

We are seeing a slowing of the rate of increase, which is encouraging.  Economists will tell one that it tends to lag unemployment by a couple of years.  Given that unemployment has peaked and is declining a little, one would hope that the rate of increase would flatten out.  There are, however, many uncertain drivers for that.  The new personal insolvency framework is in the mix as well.</p><p>  Our focus has been on trying to accelerate the pace at which the banks are tackling the mortgage arrears problem in two senses.  They need to move faster and the solutions that are provided to customers need to be sustainable, rather than short term and lacking proper traction.  We had a period in which we asked the banks for their mortgage arrears resolution strategies.  If I remember correctly, we went in to the banks at the beginning of last year and found that their operational capability to process and get their hands around the arrears problem was very weak.  Our staff did a third party report on that issue.  Much of the intervening period has been about building the infrastructure.  Banks are great at lending and being able to market but they were not very strong in collections and triaging these numbers.  The operational base is now better, albeit not perfect.</p> <p>It is far from ideal but I believe it is strong enough for us to set the targets we have set for them.  We are saying to the banks that over a period of months we expect them to re-underwrite their population of arrears cases, propose solutions and then conclude those solutions.  This is set to ramp up the speed of the process.  We are also saying that these arrangements need to be on sustainable terms.  The default options tend to be short-term interest-only arrangements, which will work in some cases, for example, if a borrower knows his expenses will come down in future or if he is confident that his spouse will get another job in future that might be okay.  Anyway, we are saying that it is not acceptable as a blanket approach.  There must be sustainable terms and we need to assess the capacity to repay the principle over the full term of the mortgage.  Therefore, we are keen to see a wider range not only of interest-only arrangements but term extensions or split mortgages.  We could talk about these if we have time because we believe they are important tools.  Unfortunately, in some cases repossessions will take place and no solution will be possible because the arrears situation is so bad or the affordability is so bad.  Anyway, we need to break the impasse irrespective of what is happening in the trend of arrears numbers, to which the Deputy referred, to make some progress.</p></speech>

It is not desirable, it is a last resort, but the relative level of repossessions in Ireland compared to the United Kingdom is rather low.  There are good reasons that will be the case in future but it would be surprising if they stayed at those low levels.  A legal case, the Dunne judgment, has stopped the legal proceedings in the meantime, but I expect that if one does not co-operate with the bank and share financial information then the bank will move swiftly to take legal action under the new framework.  However, if one is a co-operating customer and one declares all one's information and one is upfront, then the banks will work step by step through the process and have a wider range of options.  However, as a last resort in some cases if a customer is right at the cusp of insolvency or insolvent then it is possible there will be repossession cases.  I imagine there is likely to be more voluntary surrenders whereby the banks say it will be impossible to keep a person in his home but if he surrenders the house, they can work out some sort of deal on the shortfall if there is negative equity.</p></speech>

I believe we will get them back shortly.  The deadline for the first targets is the end of quarter 2.  We will get raw reports from the banks but they will be un-audited by us.  In the first instance I will be somewhat sceptical or cautious, for the reasons suggested by the Comptroller and Auditor General, because we want to test these things.  I believe the banks will hit the targets in terms of the numbers.  The senior management are saying to me that they are very confident about doing so.  However, we need to check that they are on sustainable terms.  There are two aspects to it.  Did they get the numbers and are they going fast enough?  What are they offering on sustainable terms?</p></speech>

If they miss the targets we have two principal sanctions, and, for the Government-owned banks, there is a further one that is quite tough.  First, we have the ability to impose capital add-ons to the banks.  Second, we have said that for those mortgage solutions not done on a sustainable basis we will require the provisioning to move to a repossession level and we will insist the banks cannot assume any revenue from those mortgages other than the cost of disposing of the underlying home.  That is quite a robust level of provisioning and it will come in at the end of next year.</p></speech>

One examines a loan that is in place, even if it is in arrears.  There are two things one can recognise.  The first is the stream of revenue coming from payments and interest, maybe not full interest payments but some payments over time.  The second is that at the end of the day there is the collateral value to be realised.  We are saying that if the solution a bank is offering to the customer is not on sustainable terms then we will not let the bank count the first stream of income.  We will insist that the bank assumes that it will only get the value of the disposal when it comes to repossession, in order to be suitably prudent and conservative.  To do so, one must make some assessment about where house prices will be and factor in disposal costs, which can be quite significant.</p></speech>

Then the bank cannot count the stream of revenue and for the value of the property the bank must figure out what the real disposal costs will be and what the house price will be, because they may not amount to 100.  To dispose of a house there are administrative costs and so on.  That is quite a significant incentive for the banks to get through it as well as the capital measure.</p><p>  When I launched the targets with the Minister for Finance he said in quite a pointed way that he expects the management of the State-owned banks to get on top of the targets before it gets to that and that, basically, their jobs were on the line.</p></speech>

Professor Honohan and I were surprised by it.  One core skill of banking is lending but another core skill of banking is being able to get money in.  That collection side was very weak, having looked at the banks and their operational capability.  We examined this aspect and BlackRock examined it as part of the last engagement.  We found that the number of staff doing collections and managing mortgage arrears was rather low and that the expertise levels were rather low.  The systems were very weak too.  I heard some particular feedback.  Someone told me that a staff member would have to interrogate three or four different systems, pull all the documents together, write them up and then get ready to call Elderfield.  All that would take 20 minutes of preparation time.  Then Elderfield would not be there when called.  Then he would move on to the next case, which also involved 20 minutes of note collation and preparation and another official would be called who was not there either.  That was not very efficient and they have had to work with big systems.  It was frustrating that it was not in place but there has been enough time to improve the operational capability.  Now is the time to reach these targets.</p></speech>

A great deal of capital has been put into the banks.  The average is approximately 15% and it is higher in some cases.  The level is a good deal higher than our minimum of 10.5% and a good deal higher than the EU requirements.  There is some capacity to absorb levels of loss on the mortgage portfolio over time.  However, it is not an unlimited amount.  We have to be cautious about debt forgiveness or doing deals that would create moral hazard, and people would be wanting more and more of this.  Getting a balanced approach between trying to assess the right solution case by case is very important.</p><p>  I gather the Government is publishing the ninth or tenth EU-IMF review today and it will have some wording on the stress tests.</p> <p> The basic point is that because the single supervisor is coming in, this changes the timing a little bit with regard to how the stress tests are going to work.  One of the pillars of banking union - we can discuss the other pillars if the Deputy so desires - is having a single supervisor, namely, the ECB.  The single supervisor is going to come into force probably in July of 2014.  Therefore, there will be a 12-month run-in period.  In preparation for the single supervisor, two exercises are going to be carried out.  One of these will be an asset quality review, to be carried out towards the end of this year.  This is a phase 1 exercise.  The second exercise will be a stress test, which will be carried out in either the first or second quarter of next year.  The agreement with the troika is to try to align, as much as possible, the work we are doing under the programme with those.  The Minister has stated that these will be done in close proximity.  What we will see towards the end of this year is a kind of first phase of work.  The asset quality review will examine provisioning levels and the banks' risk models.  This will feed into the asset quality review of the ECB and the stress tests will come after that.  It will be a phased process, with some deliverables before the end of the year.</p></speech>

I will try to provide a short answer and then a more complicated one.  The short answer is that the banks have plenty of capital right now.  However, we know that in the future they are going to need more capital because of Basel III and matters of that nature.  The questions are how soon they are going to require that extra capital, whether they can obtain it on their own and how much they will require.</p><p>  I will comment first on why I believe they have plenty of capital now.  On the previous occasion on which I commented publicly in respect of the banks, I stated that AIB has 19.9% capital, Bank of Ireland has 14.3% and Permanent TSB has 21.5%.  The position may have moved since then and this will be shown in their published accounts.  I did not have time to check the accounts.  Those amounts are above 10.5% by a wide margin and are also above the EU minimum levels.  The banks, therefore, have a buffer.  We know, however, that this buffer will be eroded over time as losses occur.  Then there are the international rules such as Basel III and the EU capital requirements directive IV - same difference - and these are going to institute tougher capital requirements over time.  The banks have perhaps not a mountain to climb but they certainly have a hill to walk up in the context of capital.</p><p>  The banks are already at the ratio levels at which they need to be and mostly they are also on equity.  However, there are deductions which they must make.  For example, they must take from their capital any tax losses they have accumulated.  They have quite a number of such losses.  That is the big, moving number and it will probably amount to approximately &euro;6 billion over time, just from Basel III.  It must be remembered, however, that there is a five-year phase-in period, so the banks have plenty of capital-----</p></speech>

The banks have a great deal of capital right now and they have a slight hill ahead of them.</p><p>  What other factors are in the mix?  In the first instance, we know there are more losses to come in the banks.  The questions which arise relate to whether there will be enough money in the pots they have put aside to cover these and how quickly those losses are going to come due.  We will carry out an analysis in this regard in the next set of stress tests.  We will bring BlackRock in again to obtain an independent, market-recognised approach.  There are some positives, some negatives and some uncertainties in respect of this matter.</p><p>  On the positive side, the arrears levels are still inside the stress test levels.  This was shown up in the most recent stress tests, which is a positive.  House prices have stabilised.  In addition, there are the asset disposals which the banks have been required to do.  The banks have many non-core assets and we informed them that they had to slim down their operations and reduce their loan-to-deposit ratios.  They have managed to sell those assets without crystallising as big a loss as we feared when we carried out the stress tests.  Those are all the positives.  On the negative side, arrears continue to rise bit by bit and the domestic economy - rather than that which relates to exports - remains weak.  The big unknown relates to the impact the insolvency framework will have.  At some point we will consider all of these points and try to envisage what is going to be the outlook.  I am not going to make a pre-emptive guess today.  We will do that when the time comes.  That is the first factor.</p><p>  The second factor revolves around how we are going to apply stress tests in respect of all the aspects I have mentioned.  How tough a test should be applied?  Do we really want to pile stress upon stress?  How far do we want to twist the dial when it comes to stress testing?  The ECB and the European Union, as part of the single supervisor, are going to make the decision in this regard.  The questions which arise relate to how quickly loan losses are going to pan out and how tough should be the stress tests.</p><p>  The third factor involved is profitability and how fast the banks are going to accrue profits.  The capital they have now is going to erode over time and we must ask how quickly they are going to realise profits to replace the capital they will lose.  The position of the banks in the context of profitability and their net interest margins have not been strong.  There are some early signs of improvement but there is still some way to go.  Again, we will have to assess the position in this regard and include it in the mix.</p><p>  The final issue which arises is somewhat political in nature and is, quite frankly, somewhat above my pay grade.  If, hypothetically, there was a shortfall in another country, we must consider when this should be dealt with and who should have responsibility for dealing with it.  As stated, the banks currently have a great deal of capital.  We must ask whether, in the context of a stress which has been identified in the middle distance, we should immediately invest more capital in the banks.  It is not strictly necessary to do so because there is already a buffer in place.  This brings us to the issues of debt, the banking system and the sovereign and the banking union.  The Government's policy - which I think is the right one - is to say that European Union instruments such as the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, should be used to provide for direct recapitalisation.  All of the elements to which I refer are going to have to be considered in the context of how quickly it will be necessary to phase in Basel III, the speed at which capital will be eroded by loan losses and other, different scenarios, the severity of stress, the level of bank profitability and what is happening in Europe in the context of the ESM.  Decisions will have to be taken and judgments will have to be made around these in the fourth quarter of this year, the first quarter of next year and over time.  That will lead to a decision being made on whether there is a shortfall.  As previously stated, I will not pre-empt the position and make a guess now.  However, I have outlined the process and the factors involved.</p></speech>

Mr. Elderfield will leave his post in October.  He stated earlier that "as a supervisor one is almost always playing catch up with industry and it is dangerous to think one will get to a point when one can rest on your laurels".  Is he concerned by the fact that in the past six months certain individuals have complained about the level of regulation that has been put in place in the past three years?  I refer to John Bruton of the IFSC, individuals from the SEC and Michael Somers.  Mr. Elderfield made the point that one can never rest on one's laurels.  Is he concerned that when he leaves his position, we may slip back to where we were previously?  Will he have any input with regard to the appointment of his replacement in the context of ensuring we remain on our current track?  If he had been in position prior to the financial crisis, would that crisis have occurred?</p></speech>

The costs that arose are so significant that it is important to learn the lesson that light touch regulation did not work and that, in the context of some of the issues the Comptroller and Auditor General has assessed in the past, the lack of proper testing and a strong framework led to weaknesses.  I again make the distinction between rules, regulation and supervision in this regard.  In the context of regulation, a great deal is happening.  The G20's financial stability board has a very large agenda which flows into the EU and on into Ireland.  There is much for the industry to digest.</p> <p>I have sympathy with that approach in terms of getting the pacing right on that and making sure there are no unintended consequences of all these different things happening simultaneously.  There are some valid points in there.  I think what it means is that at the Central Bank, when one is doing something extra, one needs to pick and choose one's spots and make sure one has a strong case for that.  I think we had that.  I think we needed a corporate governance code.  That had been stalled or pushed back and we needed a fitness and probity regime.  That is fair in terms of how much regulation and when.</p><p> Supervision is something to watch.  One wants to make sure of a number of elements.  One must have the right number of supervisors, the right system and the right degree of independence from the Government, politicians and the Department of Finance to make the calls on these things.  Having the right philosophy of being challenging to firms is very important.  That is one to keep an eye on.  Professor Honohan is very committed to that.  I am sure there will be a lot of continuity in that regard.  One must be alert for when the next bubble comes, be it five years, eight years, ten years or whenever that is, as that is the moment of risk.  When everyone is making lots of money and the regulators are an irritant, then Deputies, media commentators and the Central Bank must ensure the supervision is strong.  If people are complaining about it, then one must examine their motives and goals.  I hope we have got a good platform for the future and I am sure there will be much continuity, but it is always something about which one should be vigilant.</p></speech>

We have gone in the complete opposite direction to where we were.  Will Mr. Elderfield have an input into his replacement at any level?  Does he believe that a crisis would have occurred were the changes he implemented in place prior to the crisis?</p></speech>

There is a special process for recruitment.</p><p>  It is really hard to make that hindsight judgment.  I think it is probably unfair for me to make a judgment on that.  Let me put it this way.  If one had all the elements in place &ndash; supervisors, the right challenging approach, as well as stuff we have not talked about such as a resolution framework where one could wind down banks &ndash; on the night of the guarantee, I think one would probably have known at that point that Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent and Irish Nationwide Building Society was in trouble.  One would have had a toolkit already available to deal with the problems in terms of the ability to wind down those institutions, which would have made a big difference.  It would not have been attributable to me personally but a better framework would have helped out on that fateful night.</p></speech>

I mentioned the other day publicly that last August my wife and I were in London for the Olympic Games and we just realised we missed London a lot.  We have been away for a long time.  It is almost six years, because I did my Irish time, which I have enjoyed, but I was in Bermuda for two and a half years beforehand.  I felt that if I had stayed for the full term, it would be something like seven and a half years away.  I mulled it over for a while and then at Christmas I thought about it and lots of lobbying took place from family and friends in London saying, "Come on, you have been away too long", so I told Professor Honohan at the beginning of the year that I would give it another year but it ended up being a bit earlier.  I have really enjoyed Ireland and living in Dublin.  I have lived in lots of cities in the world.  I grew up in Manhattan and I think Dublin is a great city.  I have really enjoyed living here but I want to get back home.</p></speech>

I know there is unfinished business and that is something I debated a lot about.  That is a fair point.  I know there are still big challenges ahead.  A big one is the single supervisor.  That is kind of a big break mark where banking supervision is going to go to the ECB.  One could ask whether it makes sense to be in there for a short amount of time.  I would not say the situation is fragile.  There is a strong platform.  The numbers are there.  The staff quality is there.  With the powers Bill, on which members will vote in the next month or so, there will be a strong legislative framework.  We have a risk-based framework &ndash; PRISM &ndash; in terms of how we are looking at firms.  It is clear that an intrusive, challenging approach to supervision is embedded.

It is important to us that the Central Bank, which obviously is accountable to the State, is operating a whistleblower procedure in a satisfactory way.  What is important about this, and I understand Mr. Elderfield's reticence about the individual, is being sure that anybody from the inside with an expertise in this area who goes through the whistleblowing process is not silenced, dismissed or suspended for those reasons.  It is to make sure that the right and fair procedures are put in place and because it is not clear, it seems to me that this episode is a little murky.  It would help if Mr. Elderfield could say to us that in terms of what happened, they made these allegations, they were investigated, we suspended them for a period, or whatever happened, and then we took them back, if that is what happened.  This is a very serious issue because the way these stress tests are conducted is very important to the nation but we would need to be sure that the Central Bank is behaving in a way which protects the integrity of the process, not just the integrity of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

The status of the individual through it and what has happened is a matter for employment law and confidential with the individual but I will try to reassure the Deputy on a couple of points.  We have a speaking up policy.  When the person raised this concern it was treated very seriously under the speaking up policy.  We had the internal auditor separate from that area investigate it thoroughly and feed back to the individual, and the individual was satisfied.</p><p>  For the stress test itself, we had peer review from other regulators.  We had the European Banking Authority.  We had our own consultants.  We had the troika, the ECB, the Commission and the IMF.  We had many people looking at those numbers, and the stress test results we published were the most transparent in terms of the details we provided.  If the Deputy looks at the PCAR information we provided that March, he will see there was a lot of information there.  In terms of the integrity of the stress tests and the ability to track and test them, there is a lot there and there were many eyes on that.</p></speech>

In terms of the new law that is coming in, we will have this framework that says one can now make a protected disclosure.  We have to treat that individual in a confidential way.  Unless there is an exclusion it is necessary to reveal the person for the purposes of pursuing the investigation.  We are thinking through that in terms of the circumstances in which the information would be disclosed.  The Financial Services Authority, FSA, for instance, tries under all circumstances not to disclose the individual's name but sometimes it is very hard to investigate that.  That is one aspect of it.</p><p>  The protected disclosure is great.  The new framework means employment action cannot be taken against the individual.  They are protected, etc., but we also have a duty as a regulator - I am talking in our context - to keep the firm's information confidential.  We will have the whistleblower present information to us but we cannot come back to them, and I think that drives them nuts.  It probably drives the members nuts when they talk to the whistleblowers, but that is the nature of it.  We must be confidential towards the firms and the individuals.  We also must be confidential, in this context, to our staff members under employment law.  There are protections for whistleblowing.  One cares about the policies that are in place but when one wants to get to what happened to it, typically it happens internal to the supervisor in terms of the actions that are taken.</p><p>  Of the approximately 42 whistleblowing incidents we had last year, we took actions on about half of them.  Half of them we find do not have any legs, so to speak; there is not enough to go on.  Sometimes they go to enforcement and sometimes they go to supervisory action.  We take whistleblowing seriously internally and from the point of view of the firms too.</p></speech>

I do not understand why we should not get those when they are considered to be untrue by the Central Bank and have been dismissed.  I do not understand why we should not hear those allegations, the reason they were dismissed, the procedures and the outcome.  Those are procedures about which we are entitled to be satisfied that they are working.</p></speech>

If the banks become a better investable proposition, one then would see private capital and this obviously has happened in the case of Bank of Ireland in the past couple of years.  In respect of any public support, the clear Government position is the best approach is the use of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, as direct recapitalisation.  There will be much debate on that over the next nine months or so, as to exactly how much and in what circumstances.  Given the link between the banks and the sovereign finances, it is very important to have available that tool for Ireland and across Europe.  One would want to have such ESM direct recapitalisation in order not to add to this vicious cycle between the banks and the sovereign finances.</p></speech>

While AIB may or may not become profitable, does Mr. Elderfield think we must rely on ESM for recapitalisation otherwise?</p></speech>

At present, there is a lot of capital in the banks to absorb losses for the foreseeable future.  One may identify in the stress test a hypothetical loss in the future.  Consequently, there is a question as to how fast one might wish to deal with that.  One might decide one should have a plan to get there in stages between now and the end of Basel III.  The circumstances may well be that a private investor decides this is a reasonable plan in which it will take part.  Consequently, I would not rule that out as an option.  One should think very carefully about how fast one wishes to address these things until one knows what will be the European policy framework.  This probably is a good reason to align our stress tests with the European stress tests, in order to ascertain what the European framework will be for direct recapitalisation.</p></speech>

However, if one is a stressed sovereign and the only way to do this is through borrowing, one might then decide this is not the best way in which to do it.  Were one a supervisor in the United States with a triple-A rated country at one's back with lots of money, one would simply state one should err on the side of more injections in the short term and one's microprudential need for recapitalisation would trump any macroprudential concern.  However, if one is in a situation in the eurozone with a stressed sovereign, one needs to make one's judgment about timing.  It is a fair point and there are arguments both ways about the speed of it.  However, because there is a debate under way on ESM recapitalisation, it makes sense to see how that emerges and work on the stress tests in parallel.</p></speech>

That was the way it worked.  Any new applicants must apply to us in what we call an individual questionnaire.  This gives a lot of information to help us assess both the fitness and the probity sides of the equation.  This comes into a central team and we look through that and make a judgment.  For the higher impact firms, including the banks, we tend to do interviews for these roles and assess the fitness and probity.  We have put in place a flagging system whereby if someone from one of the banks that required a Government bailout tries to come back into the system, a flag is raised.  We then slow down the process and state we will be obliged to carry out an assessment of the individual in question and to ascertain what was the history of the position.  For example, were they in human resources and therefore had no responsibility or were they in charge of commercial lending and, therefore, have some questions to answer?</p></speech>

You have to be able to provide evidence that the person is failing to be fit and proper for his or her current role.  You have to meet certain evidential tests.  It has to be confirmed by the courts after a certain period of time.  One has powers, but I would not say it is the most straightforward process.</p><p> If the committee would not mind a small digression about accountability for individuals, that is one reflection - since perhaps I am here for my final appearance - that I would like to mention.  I spoke about it previously.  There is an open issue about how effective the system is, if I can call it that - that is, ourselves, the Garda and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement - and about being able to ensure individual accountability through the enforcement and sanctions process.  We have taken a lot of enforcement cases against firms - we have been very successful in that, I think, in terms of raising standards there - for systems and controls lapses, for mis-selling and for overcharging, but it is much harder to take cases against individuals.  The firms tend to settle with you quite quickly and individuals tend to fight you tooth and nail to the very end.  We have a couple of cases from the financial crisis period in which we are still taking action against individuals.  That is more protracted and drawn out.  A reflection I have is that white-collar crime seems to be an area in which the system is just not operating well in terms of being able to tackle that.  It is too protracted.  The deterrent value of taking actions against firms is good but the deterrent value of taking actions against individuals is much better.  One of the thoughts I had, maybe a few months ago, is that this is something that somebody in Ireland, such as a retired judge, a former Attorney General, the Law Reform Commission or, if it is the correct jurisdiction, the Committee of Public Accounts, should look at.  They could do a stock take, ask "How could we tackle white-collar crime more effectively?", and set out a few thoughts.  There is one question, which is really about the capabilities of the different players.  Does the Garda have the resources and the capabilities?  Does the ODCE or the Central Bank?  What is the right split between the three of them in that regard?  One has some questions about powers, the questioning of suspects-----</p></speech>

The United Kingdom has had some banning and some big fines for individuals who were involved with failed banks.  That has not happened here.  There has not been, as far as I am aware, the criminal prosecutions there have been in the United States.  I think it is relatively weaker.  Obviously, we still have the big court case on Anglo Irish Bank to come - I want to be careful as I do not want to say anything prejudicial to that - but you could really have somebody do a stock take about how well are we prepared as a system and also how good the law is.  There are issues such as whether there should be a strict test establishing individual responsibility when there is an enforcement case against a firm.  It is quite a tough test that the enforcement lawyers have to do, which makes it hard for us to do that.  The United Kingdom is looking at whether there should be presumptive liability or presumptive sanctions for directors of failed banks.  That might be in the banking standards report on Friday when it comes out.  Should there be a reckless trading offence for financial services?  Exactly how the constitutional protection of ability to earn a living interacts with the fitness and probity regime was a complicated matter in the drafting of the law, which affects the ability to take action against individuals.  There could be a stock take, a report by the Law Reform Commission, a wise person's report or something like that to draw this together.  I would say we have done a good job of enforcement against firms, but I wish we had done more on individuals, and the system could do better on them.</p></speech>

I am unclear as to how he exercises these powers.  As he will be aware, there is an extraordinary reappearance on the boards of current banks of persons from banks which have not necessarily failed - certainly from the boards of banks which have subsequently been bailed out - or persons who have been involved in failed departments or failed areas of banks.  That, I presume, is not a factor that bars them, but it certainly should not be one that is encouraged.  The fact that persons who have been identified with failed banking enterprises in the past are popping up on the boards of banks is something which alarms some of us.  Obviously they have not been involved in any activity which is criminal or anything like that, but they have been involved in identifiably failed projects of a mega nature.  I wonder how they get through Mr. Elderfield's fitness and probity tests.</p></speech>

On our standards for fitness and probity, the probity side is a matter of one size fits all.  You must be proper whether you are a small director or a big director, if Deputy Ross knows what I am saying, and it is about criminal background and the rest of it.</p><p>  Fitness is very much relevant to the individual and the role that he or she plays, but one point we explicitly wrote in - there was much debate about this internally and I insisted it should go in there - was a reference to the track record of the individual in his or her previous roles.  You have to interpret that in the context.  I tend to be bad at giving good examples, but the questions are what sort of role the person held in the past, how directly responsible he or she was for the failure, and how big an institution he or she was in compared to where he or she is going now.  I will give an extreme example.  If a person who was a HR director or senior manager in a bank that got into trouble now wants to be a non-executive director of a fund, one thinks, "All right; the person was in a bank that got into trouble," but he or she gets through.  If a person who was a senior manager or head of commercial property lending in a bank wants to go into a similar role in that bank, then one would slow it down.  I am not going to say we have done it in that type of case, but there are cases that I am aware of in which we have said, "We have problems with you because of your track record in the past.  We know about you from the past," and those persons have withdrawn.</p></speech>

Mr. Elderfield might flag that for his successor.</p><p>  I have one question for Mr. Elderfield about Custom House Capital.  Like many members of the committee, I have received many representations about Custom House Capital, which had 1,500 staff.  It was identified as being in trouble by the Central Bank in 2007 - I think my dates are correct, although I am open to correction - with a &euro;4 million deficit, but it was slow to be identified as being in really big trouble and running a Ponzi scheme.  Eventually, it was discovered what was going on, not by the Central Bank but by a company called Appian Asset Management, which took it over.  Was that a major lapse on the part of the Financial Regulator?</p></speech>

That was a very frustrating experience.  There was this history from 2007.  I first heard about it in the spring of 2010 and I approached it in two ways.  The aim was to make sure the client assets were okay.  From memory, we did a review, we had a third-party review, and we had two external auditor reviews - something of that order.  All of them said there were some questions about systems and controls but the client assets were fine.  The question was, if the client assets were fine, did we want to close the company down or liquidate it, or did we want to try to get the management out?  If we had liquidated it then, we would have crystallised a loss for the investors because of all of the illiquid property investments.</p> <p>We debated it back and forth and decided that as long as the client's assets are secure we would bring in an outside chairman or non-executive director and try to sell this thing to another person.  With hindsight, two problems arose.  The first is that we were getting false positives on client assets.  We got a false positive on the third party report.</p></speech>

It was very frustrating because it was like a false premise for our decision making.  If we had known of the fraud we would have taken a different course but fraud is difficult to identify.  That was one problem in hindsight.  The second problem is that we only had the nuclear option of liquidation.  We do not have the ability to put investment firms into administration.  This is a gap in the law.  We would have preferred to appoint an administrator, clear out the management entirely and have the administrator run the organisation.  All we could do was work with the management until we could sell the operation or liquidate it but liquidation would have crystalised losses for the customers.</p><p>  Due diligence was also required during the sales process.  Off the top of my head, four or five counterparties came through but none spotted the client asset hole.  It was just before settlement of the deal that Appian finally spotted it.  We published our lessons learned and were quite open about them.  We learned lessons about how we should approach these matters.  It is important to have a low risk tolerance about handling client assets.  We tightened up in that regard.  We have a dedicated client assets team and put a protocol in place for problems with client assets.  We intervened with a spreads company at the beginning of last year to ensure everything was in proper order and have done some other interventions which required the use of third parties to get the management of client assets out of the firms in question.  There are lessons for us and the auditors in the way the matter unfolded.</p></speech>

I am not going to make an excuse for that but fraud is a really hard thing to find in client assets.  All of the documents provided appeared to reconcile but they were false.  It is difficult to freeze the company and go down to a full reconciliation of client assets.  We have done that on a couple of occasions under our new framework but it is a very difficult exercise.  I am not making excuses for them or for us.  A considerable number of firms have gotten into trouble in respect of client assets in the UK and the US.

The people commissioned by Mr. Elderfield were appointed because the company was in turmoil.  I presume they were specifically mandated to look for something like this but they appear to have failed completely.  They returned what he describes as a false positive, which basically is an indication that everything was okay.  Surely he should investigate a means for holding them accountable to some extent because they were acting on his behalf and, indirectly, on behalf of the taxpayer and the customers.  We certainly should be getting our money back, if not investigating how thoroughly they did their job.</p></speech>

It will not help with the current cases because the offences were committed under the old law but there is an opportunity to learn some lessons.  I can give my short list of areas we could examine.  Do we have reckless trading legislation, as the Vice Chairman mentioned?  Should we have a presumption of direct disqualification for failed banks?  How do our administrative sanctions work?  That is just the tip of the iceberg.  One would want somebody who would systematically examine that.  In due course we will be able to take some actions against individuals and we are pursuing that in a couple of cases but I wish it had happened faster.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Elderfield believe it is potentially possible we could have a further property bubble in years to come?  What types of measures could be put in place <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the banks and legislation to ensure that does not happen?</p></speech>

I do not know when the next property bubble will occur.  Inevitably there is a cyclical element here where there are pressures to build up and so one wants to think about the right tool kit.  My colleagues on the economist side of the Central Bank talked about some tax changes to do that.  I am not an expert in that.  From the regulatory side they talk about a macro-prudential tool kit.  Does one have the ability to slow things down when times get good?  The typical way to do that is to ramp up capital charges and make it more expensive for banks to lend when times get good.  We are a long way off from that.  The other tool one could use is loan-to-value limits.  We have visitors to the Central Bank from places such as Hong Kong and Singapore and they have quite strict loan-to-value limits as a way to cool their markets down.  That is something one would want to have available.</p></speech>

Traditionally here it was two to two and a half times principal salary and one to one and a half times second salary and it served us reasonably well.  During the Celtic tiger it went up as high as six times one's salary.  Could Mr. Elderfield see room for that measure, which is very straightforward?  Could he elaborate on the particular engagement with the banks on laying down such rules now?</p></speech>

Loan-to-income limits would be a possibility.  Most jurisdictions do loan-to-value rather than loan-to-income.  It has not been a live issue in Ireland for obvious reasons right now so I have not spent much time examining the different trade-offs and what is the best way of approaching this.  We are doing an assessment of our powers on macro-prudential tools but it is not a burning issue right now.  In the next phase of the journey of improving regulation that will be something to engage the banks with but it is not top of the priority list for the short term.</p></speech>

Internally we are examining loan-to-value limits and to what extent we have the powers.  We might need some fine-tuning but that is something to worry about putting in place in the next two to three years rather than the next two to three months.</p></speech>

Where does Mr. Elderfield see that progressing in terms of arrears?  Does he believe the banks' provisioning is robust enough in that area?  He might refer to individual banks such as AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.  Generally, where does he see that market going?  What are his views on repossessions and the family home?  As public representatives we deal with people every day who are under enormous pressure in terms of mortgages and retaining the family home.  That is the next big issue with the insolvency legislation coming on board.  How are the banks dealing with that issue?  That feeds into recapitalisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.752" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Elderfield" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013061300033#HH02300"><p>Operational capacity has improved greatly but is not all the way there.  There is a strong commitment to hit the targets but there is still much work to get through to put sustainable solutions in place.  The pressure is on to do it in the next 18 months before our new, tougher provisioning rules come in.  There are uncertainties on how the personal insolvency regime will interact with this but there is a commitment to get these arrangements in place.  There are so many different areas we could talk about.  We are under time pressure.  Rather than forcing everybody into the personal insolvency framework we would like banks to work out solutions beforehand.</p> <p>It is important that both the unsecured creditors and the secured creditors come together for that.  Banks are not going to give deals if the unsecured creditors, credit cards and credit unions are getting paid 100 cent in the euro.  Both sides have got to come together.  So I think there is a burden-sharing initiative that we have done, which I understand a lot of credit unions have signed up to.  It is very important and welcome.  I think one can get a fair approach there.  It is a real win-win situation that rather than paying the personal insolvency practitioner and dragging this whole thing out, one can find a way that the credit union gets something, the bank gets something and the customer gets a deal and can move forward.  That is one observation to share.</p><p> Second, as Professor Patrick Honohan mentioned recently, when one looks at the menu of approaches, short-term interest only might work in some circumstances with term extensions in cases where there really is not a prospect of being necessarily repossessions.  We think that this device of the split mortgage is a very important way to do it.  I know people are impatiently waiting to ask questions.  I am just going to take two minutes to explain how that would work and why it is valuable.  Basically, one would look at the customer and ask how much they can afford.  We are going to right-size based on affordability into part A, a mortgage they can pay principal and interest on.  On what they can afford, one has got to accept disposable income is going to come down, minimum living expenses - all that debate has to go on there.  I do not think one can keep people on the absolute minimum living expenses <i>ad infinitum</i>- it is not going to stick - but there have to be sacrifices to get that.  Then one parks the remaining bit of the debt in the part B for the warehouse and one has two scenarios.  The person could actually improve their income and start to pay the part B down.  Therefore the bank has not written off a debt owed to it and there is not more cost to the taxpayer.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.755" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Elderfield" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013061300034#JJ00300"><p>I will come to that.  Then there is the other scenario which is actually the customer cannot pay that down.  We have thought a lot about this - about whether one should allow interest charged and the rest of it.  We think the best approach is to say - I think this got missed in the press release from one of the trade associations on Monday - we will only accept as sustainable a split mortgage if for the part B, for the warehoused element, the bank accepts that it cannot pursue the full amount and cannot try to get the shortfall.  Therefore if at the end of the term of the mortgage, with interest accumulated or not or whatever, the part B is bigger than the value of the house, the bank must accept it will not get the shortfall.  Then the person going into the split mortgage knows that their worst-case scenario is that they get to the end of the term of the mortgage and do not have this debt hanging over them.</p><p>  We are also saying that if at the end of the term of the mortgage the person is 70 years old and cannot trade down, one needs to keep them in the house until the end of their life.  That way the person stays in the home and the bank has the option if the income improves.  Regardless of what happens to the interest it cannot pursue the person to the ends of the earth for the shortfall and one keeps them in the home.  We think this is a sensible, balanced approach.  It is not debt write-off, but it is pragmatic and it also allows the option that if things improve then the debt can be covered.</p></speech>

The economists we talk to about this say one has a time lag after unemployment peaks and that one would expect it to tail off, but I cannot make a prediction as to exactly what is going to happen in the future.  What I can say is we have set very strong targets for the banks.  We are very serious about that and they have said to us they are serious about hitting those targets.</p></speech>

We published some pretty tough provisioning guidelines a year and a half ago, which prompted a lot of increased provisions and more transparency.  We published another set of provisioning guidelines a month ago which we would anticipate at the end of the year will prompt even more robust provisioning.  We are saying if they are not on a sustainable basis we are going to require even more conservative provisioning.  I think the provisioning policy framework is quite tight and the provisioning has got a lot better.</p></speech>

Split mortgages were put on the table by the Keane report of about October the year before.  We required the banks to pilot split mortgages last autumn.  If one wants to be generous, that is why it is a bit late.  The problem really is, as I say, it has been predominantly short-term interest only, which is not satisfactory.  Hence the reasons for the targets, which is to say not only must one go faster, it has got to be on sustainable terms and short-term interest only is not good enough.</p></speech>

Taking on board Mr. Elderfield's generous interpretation as to why there might be so few, if one forgot we were talking about mortgages and laid aside for a moment the financial difficulty our banks are trying to escape, the principle of split mortgages is a very obvious principle when considering difficulty with stressed debt or the management of debt among people finding it difficult to pay.  The idea of paying some now and leaving another amount to be dealt with in the future makes sense.  With the obviousness of such a solution in mind, what does the fact that only 52 are in place tell us about the state of our banking system in terms of the operational capacity within it and in terms of the potential capital foundations of the system?</p></speech>

I think the operational capacity to deal with the mortgage arrears has been frustratingly slow as I have mentioned.</p> <p>There was great investment in lending and marketing but not in sorting out the problem.  This had a number of dimensions on the collection side, with regard to the disciplines, resources and skills and also in inventiveness.  It has been said that split mortgages are obvious.  We think they are sensible but it is not a widely used practice in other jurisdictions, such as the UK or the US which has had many problems.  The repossession numbers tend to be a lot higher in these jurisdictions instead.  We are trying to craft for Ireland a situation whereby having this device means we do not have to have the same levels of repossessions one would naturally get.  The scale of the challenge in Ireland has been much more than that in the UK and US.  As a result, there is a need to be more innovative.  This is partly a reflection on the banks' weak operations, a lack of innovative thinking and a desire to hope things will get better, and partly it is a reflection on the scale of the challenge in Ireland and the need to go into new areas and develop new approaches which have not been used elsewhere.</p></speech>

I have a lot of sympathy with this concern and it is an area which the enforcement system, if I can call it that, comprising ourselves, the Garda and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, has not done so well.  Perhaps the political and legal systems need to take stock.  It is probably a narrow slice of this.  This is our gatekeeping role and how many people do not get through?  Perhaps it is 3%.  If I remember correctly, the UK has a higher return rate, but it is pretty consistent with other countries in Europe.  There is a weakness in the approach to white collar crime and accountability for individuals.  Part of it is with regard to the capability and role of the enforcement agencies.  Are we resourced and staffed up to pursue this?  Part of it is the legal framework.  I can do a stab in the dark analysis or diagnosis and I may not have it right.  It makes sense for someone to step back, look at it very systematically, put the pieces together and make improvements.  We have done enforcement well against firms but the system has not done enforcement well against individuals.</p></speech>

When the market starts to get hot, we will have pressure and there will be a need to have more flexible ways of thinking about retention of staff in future.</p></speech>

We closed 42 cases during the course of last year.  It is a very useful and valuable source of information.  I get letters and sometimes they are sent to the public complaints unit.  Sometimes we receive calls.  We collate them and send them to the relevant supervisory area.  Approximately half tend to not go anywhere and half lead to action.  Sometimes we have a supervisory response when we say systems and controls must be tightened up, or we make a direction to stop doing something.  I recall one case where we said that, because the whistleblower was known to the firm, it needed to engage with the whistleblower and have a proper dialogue with the individual.  We have had revocations of authorisation, supervisory warnings, enforcement and further monitoring.  It is a useful tool.  My guess is we will probably receive more under the new legislative framework the Oireachtas will pass because of the protected disclosures approach.  I chair a meeting of our supervisory risk committee every quarter to track where we are on whistleblowing cases and ensure both that they are being progressed and that I am comfortable that the actions being taken are appropriate.  We have tightened up the process but with the new legislation, we have the prospect to do more.</p></speech>

Action against individuals is the missing link and we all have put our fingers on that link.</p><p>  I have got some ideas.  I want to be very clear about where the weaknesses are.  Like I say, the committee would need somebody to work through it more systematically than I have done.  One of the questions is about the role of different enforcement bodies.  We have the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and my office.  The UK has the Serious Fraud Office and the Americans have the FBI.  We must ask ourselves what resourcing levels could we expect and the capabilities in terms of those areas.  We have really geared up our enforcement area which now consists of between 50 an 60 people.  Has everybody got the right skill-set?  That is one set of questions.  I know that we have done a lot of work on that, on ourselves, but I do not know about elsewhere.  I am not criticising the Garda bureau or the ODCE.  The following is an open question that the committee could ask.  Do they have the capacity to do the number of cases that the public and the representatives of the public want?  That is my first question.</p><p>  There are some outstanding recommendations.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement recommended  improving the legislative framework and the ability to pursue cases.  For example, he talked about the questioning of suspects and the rules for same.  The Department of Justice and Equality has produced a White Paper on white collar crime.  Where does the paper stand?  What future action will be taken?  </p><p>  As I mentioned, a number of legal offences could be tightened up.  If we take administrative sanction against a firm, then we will want to establish that the individuals are culpable as well.  We have a test of responsibility for individuals which is quite a tough hurdle to get through.  Is that calibrated the right way in order to take an action against an individual as well as against a firm?  That needs some thought. </p><p>  Like I say, in the UK there is a concept of presumptive liability.  If one is a director of a bank that has failed, rather than the regulator having to establish that he or she is liable and whether he or she should be disqualified, there should be a presumption of disqualification.  That matter should be examined.  There are some pros and cons.  Will it discourage people going into the system?  Will it keep people on their toes?  The committee should debate the matter.  These are things it should examine.</p><p>  The Vice Chairman asked if there was a reckless trading in financial services concept.  The committee can take action on that.</p><p>  The committee needs to conduct a very systematic trawl.  There are certain constitutional protections for individuals in terms of a right to earn a living.  How does that interact with action on fitness and probity?  We really need a public debate.  Perhaps an inquiry would be a good way.  I had not thought about an inquiry as a way into it but instead thought of a wise person, a Green Paper or something like that.  We must think about it systematically.  There are pros and cons and the committee must do a thorough job.  We must be very open about the fact that an inquiry will not help current cases.  Is it not the case that all of the current cases are under existing laws?</p><p>  There has been talk of lessons learned from the crisis and improved regulation.  First, I shall consider the  lessons learned.  Who has done the stock-take in this area?  We have had the Honohan report, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Nyberg report, the Regling-Watson report and I am sure that I have not identified many other reports.</p></speech>

A regular member of the public, whether they lost everything or not, would ask the following simple question.  Why has it not been done yet?  I presume that Mr. Elderfield, as regulator, related his opinions to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or whomever.  Has he done so?  Is there a sense of frustration?</p></speech>

What one wants is a deterrent effect that has public acceptance but also acts on individuals.  A person can say, "All right, they are going to come after my firm but I am going to move on".  One needs to have a deterrent effect on individuals in order to have confidence in the system.</p><p>  There have been improvements in the sanctions powers going through in the supervision and enforcement Bill.  A year ago, I raised the matter in a public speech so I have said it once.  Today I wanted to say it once before I went.  We need a special mechanism such as a wise person who can take a step back and think about the matter.  That would be the sensible way to proceed.</p></speech>

Mr. John Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance attends here quite regularly.  In the early days of his job he was very overt and clear about where problems lay in the Department and where people did not talk to each other.  He put together a simple system to make sure that people talk to each other and there are no gaps when organisations wish to deal with issues.</p><p>  It is common knowledge that different organisations that were involved in finance in this country were not involved in communication, or at least not an appropriate level of communication.  I mean by that whether it is the Central Bank talking to people in the Department of Finance and the regulator's office speaking to somebody in the Central Bank.  My question is a general one.  Has the regulator dealt with communications at all?  It is a common perception that his predecessor was asleep at the wheel.  The regulator's office must correct the communication gaps with other financial bodies working within government.   </p></speech>

We have gateways to talk to the Department of Finance and we do.  Frankly, my immediate priority, and we have made improvement, was how we work within the Central Bank.  I shall list a couple of things.  I meet all of my directors every morning or most days of the week so we are all in touch with each other.  We have an escalation system.  For example, a hot supervisory issue can be escalated to our supervisory risk committee where we can track its progress.  That committee deals with whistleblowing once a quarter.  It means that we have a line of sight and things cannot just crop up and then fade away.  There is an audit trail.</p><p>  We have a probability risk and impact system, PRISM, that allows us to systematically examine issues.  We take our universe of firms, divide them up and decide which will get a very thorough risk assessment.  Where that is the case, then the firm has its assessment on site.  Then we have a risk governance panel and a challenge process.  Before we communicate with the firm we bring people together, whether it is a bank or our financial stability colleague from the Central Bank who will also be present and we join up with the economists who can see the bigger picture.</p> <p>In doing our risk assessment, we say to the supervisors that rather than considering what is at the front of their minds, they must systematically think about these ten risk categories - the market risk of their bond portfolio, the credit risk, the insurance risk, the operational risk management, anti-money laundering considerations and the rest of it.  They have to score those formally and explain the scores to the risk governance panel, tell us the areas in which they have identified a problem, and in these areas, require the firm to do something about it.  In Mr. Honohan's report, he had an issue with cases in which things were spotted but they rolled forward in a kind of perpetual analysis and perpetual dialogue with the firm.  We say, in our assertive approach, that there should be a period of dialogue with the firm but that one should call it quits after a while so that it does not get into a filibuster.  Having these new process, I think, reduces the risk of an issue coming up and getting lost in the woodwork as it gets caught in the system or is periodically looked at.  That is a good legacy for the future.</p></speech>

We had some discussions with the Department at the time of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 but I am not sure if this is for that Department, the Department of Justice and Equality or the Oireachtas.  It is a matter for public debate.  I do not think it is something to be put into a letter to John and John will deal with it.  There needs to be a debate among members, as they know the system better than I do.  Is it an issue for the Law Reform Commission, an investigation by an Oireachtas committee, or a wise person's report?</p></speech>

Mr. Elderfield obviously feels strongly about it.  Since 2008, the financial crisis has cost the citizens of Ireland some &euro;64 billion.  Much of that money will be totally written off.  I have no doubt that in society there are people who through the misfortune of losing a job have suffered the rigors of the law.  That strikes me as extremely unfair.  Is there a need for a combined effort?   May I ask Mr. Elderfield to consider raising this in the annual report of the Central Bank?  Is there a blueprint for dealing with this issue in other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom or the USA?  Often, it is not about reinventing the wheel but about looking at what has worked in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

If one had a wise person in each group or had one of the Departments do a Green Paper, one would want to look at best practice elsewhere.  I do not think there is an off-the-shelf model; one could consider what the FBI does in some areas and what the UK Serious Fraud Office does in other areas.  It has to be built in the Irish context.  The Irish Constitution is different from other constitutions.  The political culture is different and all such aspects have to be looked at.  I think one would want to examine best practice elsewhere.</p></speech>

I have a huge amount of sympathy for the difficult job they will have in making progress on these cases.

The purpose of the meeting is to consider the following Revised Estimate for public services 2013: Vote 26 - Education and Skills.  As members will be aware, the 2013 Revised Estimate was presented to the D&aacute;il in the new programme-based format.</p> <p>This means the Estimate, as presented, contains the following information for each programme: how the money allocated to the programme is proposed to be spent and the previous year's outturn in each case; the number of staff assigned to work on or connected with the programme and how the number compares with the previous year; performance-related information; departmental outputs, with corresponding information from previous years and what are termed performance and impact indicators relating to the previous year's information as well; and administrative expenditure for the Vote as a whole, which is summarised in more detail than previously.</p><p> The Revised Estimate gives us an opportunity to review whether targets set and the distribution of moneys across the Vote are appropriate in the circumstances and whether they demonstrate the best use of resources.  It also gives us an opportunity to explore issues facing the Minister in terms of the 2014 allocation for his Department.</p><p> A timetable for today's meeting has been circulated and agreed by the members.  It allows for a brief opening statement by the Minister, approximately five minutes, and then a discussion of the 2013 Revised Estimate with questions on each programme listed in the Estimate.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.842" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12013061300004#C00200"><p>As requested, I will keep this opening statement short.  The net voted sum proposed by the Department for 2013 is &euro;7,926.9 million, made up of current expenditure of &euro;7,514.4 million and capital expenditure of &euro;412.5 million.  The Department has supplied briefing material on the 2013 Estimate, which members will have received.  The document is in a new format and seeks to reflect the new performance budgeting approach to the Estimates process.</p><p>  Under this new process the traditional expenditure-type information is accompanied by additional detail on the outputs to be delivered and outcomes achieved with the funding voted in the Estimate.  The move to performance budgeting has also resulted in a restructuring of the Department's Vote to reflect the high-level goals in the Department's statement of strategy.  This explains the revised structure of the subheads in the Vote this year.  The new-format briefing supplied is part of a pilot project and is, by definition, a work-in-progress.  The Department will continue to work with the committee and with the Oireachtas services to improve the effectiveness of this new approach.</p><p>  The briefing material supplied summarises the overall expenditure position for the Department in 2013 and how it is divided across the Department's four high-level goals.  Almost four in every five euro of current expenditure in the Vote is on pay and pensions, supporting almost 92,000 whole-time posts in the education sector.  This equates to one third of overall public sector employment.  The paybill also covers the costs of 2,700 Civil Service posts and posts in various other education bodies and agencies.</p><p>  Details are provided of key outputs to be achieved in 2013 under each high-level goal, as well as information on savings measures introduced to maintain education expenditures within their overall ceiling.  These measures are required to keep within the general government deficit ceiling of 7.4% of GDP for 2013.</p><p>  While I would prefer not to have to seek any expenditure savings in education, I have sought, with Government colleagues, to protect front-line education services as far as possible.  Budget 2013 protected the pupil-teacher ratio in primary level schools and in free second-level schools, while there was a two-point increase in the ratio for the 55 fee-charging schools.  It is expected overall that some 900 additional teachers will be hired for the next school year.  Special needs assistant numbers were also maintained, and the DEIS scheme was also protected in the budget.  I also sought to make provision for several important education initiatives.  These include further funding for the national literacy and numeracy strategy; an overhaul of the junior cycle; the continued roll-out of high-speed broadband to all second-level schools; and funding under the national training fund for extra places under the labour market education and training fund, called Momentum, and under the Springboard programme.</p><p>  The allocation for capital expenditure in the Estimate was almost &euro;414 million, along with a carryover of &euro;19 million from the previous year.  This forms part of the &euro;2.2 billion five-year capital investment programme for education.  The allocation was announced as part of the infrastructure and capital investment framework for 2012 to 2016.  Major elements of the programme this year include the following: a total of 50 major school building projects scheduled to advance to tender and construction, which will deliver over 25,000 permanent school places; a further 63 school projects carried forward from last year, including eight projects under bundle 3 of the public private partnership programme; and an investment of &euro;60 million under the devolved additional accommodation scheme.</p><p>  In addition to the provisions for capital expenditure in the 2013 Revised Estimate, earlier this month I announced a further provision of &euro;50 million that will enable 28 further school building projects, made up of 18 primary and ten post-primary schools, to go ahead.  The Department's total investment in these new school projects, which will provide facilities for over 12,000 students, will amount to &euro;100 million, with the balance coming from within the existing school building budget.  On Monday this week, I announced that a total of &euro;15 million has been allocated in 2013-14 to replace prefabs and provide permanent classrooms and resource rooms.  Some 46 schools with 115 prefabs will be offered grants to provide the new facilities.  This is a follow-on to the 2012 scheme, which provided funding in excess of &euro;42 million for the replacement of more than 458 prefabs.</p><p>  As part of the economic stimulus package announced in July last year, the planned consolidation of the Dublin Institute of Technology at the Grangegorman campus was signalled.  The first phase of the public private partnership works proper, at a value of &euro;180 million, will be completed in 2017, with 9,500 students to move to new facilities on the campus at that time.  In advance of the PPP works commencing, enabling infrastructure works are required to be delivered through conventional procurement, for which Government approval of almost &euro;80 million was secured as part of the stimulus package.  Some of these works have already begun on site.  The target is to have 1,000 students on site by September 2014 in the first phase of relocation.</p><p>  I do not propose to go into further detail regarding the Department's Estimate at this stage but I, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, would be pleased to respond to any matters raised by the committee members.  I commend the Estimates to the committee.</p></speech>

My opening question relates to the cost-cutting measures introduced for 2013.  Can the Minister provide an update in terms of the impact they have had or an assessment of what has taken place, especially in respect of the measure relating to reserves in the VEC sector?  There was a request for VEC institutions to operate from cash reserves and therefore they had to decide where and if any cuts would be made.</p> <p>Has the Minister received any feedback in respect of the impact this is having?  I have received feedback from a number of VECs that feel hard done by.  Those which took a sensible approach to fiscal budgeting in the past and which set aside reserves in respect of particular projects have been obliged to absorb significant cuts.  In a sense, what is happening is counterproductive.  The VECs which may have been sensible in the context of how they conducted their business and which have a certain level of reserves have found that the budgets they received for this year on foot of last year's Estimates process are significantly lower than those they were allocated in previous years.  Is the Minister in a position to provide any further information on the breakdown in this regard?  The reductions to which I refer formed a significant part of the budget savings envisaged in the 2013 Estimates.</p></speech>

It is stated that the relevant measure in this regard was fully implemented but that an additional &euro;3 million was allocated to the student assistance fund in 2012 and 2013 to cover the increased cost.  Will the Minister comment on the particular measure in question?  In the context of the broadening of the grant means test to include the value of capital assets, it is stated that the report of the implementation group is under consideration.  Will the Minister indicate whether this will form part of the upcoming budget?</p><p>  The Department's documentation appears to indicate that nearly all of the proposed savings measures have been implemented in full.  For various reasons, however, some of these have not achieved what was envisaged.  I refer, for example, to the adjustment in staffing schedules in small primary schools.  The budget measure in this regard was implemented as planned but the yield was lower than originally projected as a result of the introduction of the appeals process.  The original target was 100 posts, while the actual yield was 80.  If the targets that were envisaged for 2012 have not been achieved, how will the Estimates be achieved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.854" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12013061300005#D00300"><p>We are working with a format that is slightly different to that which previously obtained.  If the Deputies on the other side of the table feel somewhat confused, I assure them that they are not alone.  We want to co-operate with them and if there are queries which we are not in a position to answer today, we will reply to them in writing at a later date.</p><p>  On Deputy McConalogue's question regarding cash balances, I have in my possession a note which is very informative.  On 1 July, the 33 VECs will be amalgamated into 16 new entities.  Those VECs had cash balances of &euro;160 million in recent years.  These figures are monitored on a quarterly basis by the Department.  Budget 2013 includes a measure to reduce, on a one-off basis, these cash balances.  This measure involved reducing the non-pay allocations to VECs by &euro;13.2 million, a small portion of the total cash balance within the sector.  All VECs have been advised that they are expected to maintain the same level of services as in 2012.  This measure is purely intended to utilise the level of cash balances which exist in the sector.  The significant majority of cash balances existing in the sector are those from funding previously allocated by the Department of Education and Skills.  In other words, this money was allocated but it was not drawn down and spent.  Rather, it was lodged in the bank accounts of the VECs.  From our point of view, it makes no sense for such amounts of money to be held in VEC bank accounts at a time when difficult budgetary decisions are being made in respect of the education sector.  This one-off measure to reduce the bank balances of VECs will not impact on the education of children but it will allow the Government to continue to protect the pupil-teacher ratio in our schools as well as maintaining the number of SNAs and resource teachers available to support children with special needs.</p><p>  Deputy McConalogue also referred to the impact of other budgetary measures.  The one with which we are all familiar in this regard is that which relates to the equalisation of the pupil-teacher ratio for post-leaving certificate courses.  We asked each of the VECs to provide an indication of what would be the impact of this and of the 33 committees, a total of five were adversely affected.  We have discussed the introduction of measures to ameliorate the position in this regard.  The measure in question has largely affected the large urban VECs, namely, City of Cork VEC, City of Dublin VEC, Dublin County VEC and one or two others, which, in the context of the provision of their post-leaving certificate courses, employed part-time teachers.  We are in the process of addressing the impact of this measure.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy O'Brien's question on the decision to disimprove the pupil-teacher ratio over a period of three years, an estimate was made of what would be the yield.  The Deputy is correct in stating that the yield was 80 posts rather than 100.  This was due to the application of the appeals process.  It is expected that the projected savings will be achieved during the implementation period but not necessarily within the timeframe originally envisaged.</p></speech>

We have no reason to believe that these will not be achieved.  As the Deputy quite rightly pointed out, some of the schools lodged appeals.  The pupil-teacher ratio is based on the number of children who are in the system, which, depending on the number of applications for places, can vary from year to year.</p></speech>

The amount for 2013 is &euro;6.5 million and that for 2012 was &euro;1.5 million.  Are these net savings or do they just relate to the adjustment in the staffing schedules?  Are teachers being redeployed elsewhere in the system?  Is the amount to which I refer the net saving that is going to be achieved on foot of this budget measure?</p></speech>

However, given that the population is increasing, extra teachers will be needed.  This means that the teachers in question will be redeployed.  It also means that newly-qualified teachers would otherwise be obliged to wait until the former are redeployed before taking up employment.  I will come back to the Deputy on how redeployment actually works.  Vacancies which occur in an area from which teachers are being redeployed and which might require the appointment of new teachers would, in the first instance, be filled by redeployed teachers.</p></speech>

Is this due to the redeployment process or is it because teachers are reluctant to move from locations in which they may have family ties, in which they may live or whatever?  Why was the full yield of 100 posts not achieved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.862" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12013061300005#D01100"><p>There are two possible explanations.  The first of these is that the school involved may have appealed.</p> <p>The appeal is an independent process.  The evidence has shown that numbers are not dropping as expected and they are retaining teachers or their numbers have increased to allow them to retain teachers under the new pupil-teacher ratio.  Alternatively, it may be that there are difficulties with a teacher's redeployment.  It is mostly due to the appeals.  On the Deputy's other question on capital assets, the memo has not yet been brought to Government despite public discussion of the matter.  It was never intended to be applied for the forthcoming year.  A notional saving of approximately &euro;1 million for this year will be factored in.  The implementation of it for September 2014 to September 2015.</p></speech>

Our advice is that the information the Minister has supplied to the committee does not include the comprehensive expenditure report we required.

It should be made clear that not all of the saving options, of which there were 83, identified in the comprehensive expenditure report, or CER, were agreed to be implemented.  The CER submitted by the Department in September 2011 contained a very large number of saving options across the education area.  The options were identified to facilitate wide consultation and ultimate decision by Government in determining the budgetary position for the years 2012 to 2014.  It was never intended that all 83 options would be implemented.  In fact, some options are mutually exclusive including the range of options to abolish or modify the school transport scheme or different options to reduce teacher numbers.  Between budget 2012 and budget 2013, some 42 options, or half the total, have been implemented in some shape or form.  The commentary in the CER on those options that were not proceeded with identified the challenges to their successful implementation.</p></speech>

Looking at the Minister's stewardship of the Department since taking office, I note a number of things to be highlighted.  I have used every opportunity I have had to speak on education to commend and recommend the Minister's continued approach to special needs education.  To his credit and the credit of the Department, we have the same number of special needs assistants and resource teachers - 9,750 and 10,500, respectively - in the system as were there when he took office.  I am very pleased to see that and hope it will continue to be the case as we compile budgets.</p><p>  I welcome this stage of the process.  It is very interesting and gives members of the committee a great feel for each subhead, where moneys are going and where savings can be made.  It justifies some of what are always referred to as budgetary cuts but which in fact often involve reform.  That is the more progressive term to use but for political reasons, we tend to choose different language.  The Minister's legacy reform on special needs is notable and appreciated.  The infrastructural developments which have taken place over the last couple of years have been second to none, which is a point that must be made when we talk about budgets.  The capital budget is approximately &euro;400 million again this year.  That is to be welcomed.</p><p>  Have the useful recommendations that emerged from the NCSE's report on special needs had any impact on the short-term budgeting and clinical process of doing sums within the Department?  I appreciate that the recommendations are more policy-driven and refer to the role of the special needs assistant.  Has there been any move to make changes to the allocation of funding in the area of special needs on foot of that review?</p></speech>

I received the NCSE's report in the middle of May.  Deputy Cannon, the officials in the Department and I are looking at the 28 recommendations the NCSE proposed.  I have not yet received from within the Department a recommended response.  The NSCE has proposed changes in the way resources are allocated to ensure that each student with special educational needs gets the supports he or she requires based on his or her actual needs.  The NSCE also wants to ensure that children with special educational needs have immediate access to additional teaching support in mainstream schools.  We will carefully review the recommendations and bring forward proposals for future improvements to our system.  The changes will not happen overnight.  It has been 20 years since the original allocation of resources and a great deal has been learned and much research has been conducted in that time.  We will be looking at the recommendations in that context.</p></speech>

I welcome reform wholeheartedly.  It is very important in all sectors, but particularly in the case of education.  Certainly, reform is required in the special needs area.  While I am very supportive of some of the measures advocated in the NCSE report, what I hope is that we can maintain the budget and funding that is there for special needs education for children with learning difficulties.  While the way in which the money is spent should be reviewed and challenged at every opportunity, it is important to get a commitment in principle from the Department to continue to ring-fence the amount of funding that has been applied to date.</p></speech>

It is a question of whether we are getting value for the money being spent.  That is the principle behind it and it is an interdepartmental process set out by the old Department of Finance and maintained by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is a comprehensive work that I hope will be published quickly but it does not have a budgetary impact and is not seen in the context of budgetary figures.  When it is available and has been cleared by the Cabinet, I would be happy to come to the committee to discuss it in detail.  There are major long-term implications.</p></speech>

Money is being spent on the capital programme and we are building new schools and replacing prefabs with extensions.  Given two schools in the same location, one may be housed in an 80-year-old building, which takes much more to heat and to run and is not energy-efficient, while the other may be very modern and may not cost as much to operate in terms of heating and overheads.  However, the capitation payment is based on the number of students.  Has any consideration been given to, or any report produced on, capitation grants and how the Department allocates them?  One suggestion is that part of it could be based on student numbers, but consideration should also be given to the type of school, its age and its energy efficiency.  If it costs more to run a particular school because of its age, it makes more sense that the amount the school gets in capitation grants is greater than that given to a modern and up-to-date energy-efficient school that does not cost as much.  This is particularly the case given that the minor works grant and the summer works grant are being discontinued.  It is a very general question but I wonder whether research has been done by the Department into how the capitation grants system is implemented.</p></speech>

On the question of whether we are looking at changing the basis for capitation grants, the short answer is that we are not, but I can see why it might warrant being examined.  One size fits all is the approach to primary schools, if that is what we are talking about.</p></speech>

These include general electricity, water and other things.  The minimum size of the school for the purpose of the capitation grant is 60 pupils in notional terms.  From memory, there are some 25 schools with 19 schools pupils and the capitation grant they receive is the same as that of a school with 60 pupils because of the minimum floor threshold.  That is the only variation within the capitation allocation.  While some principals and boards of management talk about the cost of running a school, we have not gone beyond that.  There are no proposals currently.  If boards of management in the primary school system were to come forward with ways in which we could, in these difficult times, more efficiently meet costs generally, then we are open to it.  The summer works scheme and the other schemes to which the Deputy referred are deemed to be one-off projects for maintenance and early intervention to avoid capital replacement costs later, but they are not seen as current account operating costs.</p></speech>

Is there any progress on that, or will it happen under the education and training boards when they are set up?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.889" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12013061300007#F01300"><p>Across all sectors of the public service, the Government is trying to systematically reduce costs by combining the purchasing power of schools to jointly procure services such as electricity through the extra volume that can be brought to the market.  Some school boards of management have traditionally had a local supplier in the area and want to maintain and support local business.  If, for example, photocopying paper is deemed by the procurement officer to cost X euro, and the school can get that price from the traditional supplier, the school is free to do business with that company.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is directly responsible in this area.  Different agencies of the public service were paying wildly different prices to the same company for the same product.  The effort is to ensure we get the lowest price applying to all State agencies.  It is a matter of combining procurement services.</p> <p>We have been speaking to the primary school sector about public procurement in that regard.  To answer the Deputy's question, we will continue to explore it and continue to encourage and support boards of management to do so.</p></speech>

Is that in-service education or does it include the training colleges?  If it does, what impact are the private colleges having?  Is there a budgetary bonus?  I understand private colleges such as Hibernia College are training one-third or two-thirds of our teachers.  Is that having a budgetary impact and is there a knock-on bonus as a result?</p><p>  With regard to the capitation grants to schools, has the Department carried out any work on examining the value for money of water harvesting systems for schools?  I conducted a brief analysis in my constituency.  I contacted many of the schools and looked at their water bills for a year.  They and the Department are paying huge amounts of money to the local authorities for water.  Has the Department considered a cost-benefit analysis of providing a grant to schools for water harvesting systems?  Many of them have a flat roof and there is no shortage of rain, so it appears obvious that the option should be explored.</p></speech>

Since then, all major school building projects, where site conditions and circumstances allow and where economically viable to do so, can incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into their accommodation brief.  While fitting the systems in new schools during construction is relatively straightforward, retrofitting them in existing schools is much more difficult and expensive because of the various dedicated pipework systems both within the building and externally underground and the amount of making-good work that is required in each instance.  For existing buildings it is more cost-effective to minimise the demand for water through installing measures to reduce water usage, such as push-type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks and so forth.  To this end, schools were invited in 2010 to apply for water conservation measures and funding of almost &euro;10 million was made available to promote water conservation measures as part of this initiative.  A list of the schools whose applications under this scheme were successful is available on the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p><p>  Harvesting is different from conservation.  It should be considered by schools and it is being considered in a positive way in the new-build area, but that is a small percentage of the total stock of our schools.</p></speech>

This was raised at a number of the teachers' conferences last spring and some of the Deputies here will be aware of that.  Not everybody who applies to do a conversion course to become a teacher on top of his or her original primary degree is necessarily looking for employment in Ireland.  Some of the teacher unions have looked at the demand for teachers within this country, the places that are available and the number of people qualifying and have said that we are producing too many teachers.  A number of people who, sadly, have decided to emigrate for whatever reason realise that there is a worldwide shortage of highly qualified English-speaking teachers.</p><p>  The colleges of education, or teacher training colleges as they were known, accept people from the top 15% of leaving certificate results, which is totally at variance with the average across Europe.  The quality of an Irish primary school teacher, and to a lesser extent a secondary school teacher, is very high.  For example, there are premiums in pay for Irish qualified teachers who commit to working in an inner city school in London for a fixed number of years, such is the increasing demand in London and the quality of teacher education.  There are also teaching opportunities in the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East.  People who opt to do the conversion course with Hibernia College, which costs approximately &euro;10,000, do it on the basis that they can get that conversion to primary school teacher accredited and recognised in the space of 20 months, after which they have the earning capacity abroad.  They are being recruited in that way in many cases.</p><p>  The Deputy is probably aware of what we have done in structural reform of the initial teacher education area.  The 19 providers are being reconfigured into six different clusters.  That is proceeding very satisfactorily and I hope to be able to make a comprehensive report on the position in the autumn.</p></speech>

An increased number of teachers will be required from next September.  I presume they are factored into that.  What will be the cost of the additional 900 teachers required from September?  If the Minister were also to increase the number of special needs assistant posts and learning support posts proportionately to cater for the increased demographics, has the Department assessed what the likely cost of that might be?  I realise it is difficult to project that because one cannot be sure how many will be in the system given that it is new intake but, based on trends from other years, can he give an estimate of what the increased demand might be under the current system?</p><p>  The Minister is establishing a new board to consider reforming the way special needs supports are provided.  However, if the Minister were to take the same approach to special needs and learning supports as he is taking to the general pupil-teacher ratio by increasing the number of teachers proportionately to the likely increased demand, what might be the additional cost for learning supports on top of the cost he will incur with the increased hiring of teachers?</p></speech>

Obviously, one-third of that cost will arise in the current year because of the autumn period, and that cost is &euro;18 million in round figures.  A SNA costs &euro;30,000, which is approximately 50% of the cost of a qualified teacher.</p></speech>

We have capped the number of SNAs at 10,575.  I have not yet had a chance to look at the recommendations from the NCSE this year.  We will be publishing them quite soon.  However, it is not a <i>pro rata</i> increase <i>per se</i>.  It is not a demographically correlated ratio of SNAs to population.  It is related specifically to the estimated needs as assessed by the SENOs and the services of the NCSE, and despite population growth those numbers are relatively stable.  I am trying to protect the budget allocation so we are keeping the figure at 10,575.  Also, there was some controversy due to a misunderstanding in communications within the system.  The NCSE is making an allocation of approximately 150 below the total of 10,575, if memory serves, based on the applications that came in through the process.  That reserve of 150 is for late applicants or cases that manifest themselves, so we have money and resources within that envelope to allocate them during the year.  I have been given the actual figure.  The allocation proposed for 2013 is 10,410.</p> <p>There is cover for late applicants, emergency cases or ones that come through the system.</p></speech>

I am told it is slightly more but the principle is the same.  When somebody says that I allocated only 10,410 while there were 10,575 last year, it does not mean there is a drop as the reserve is kept for late applicants.  We have made a budgetary provision of 10,575 SNAs for the year, and that is protected.  If this is not drawn down and is not needed, there will be redeployment throughout the year.  Next year, I intend to have the same figure.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and I are working closely together.  Report Stage of the SOLAS legislation was completed yesterday evening in the D&aacute;il and Second Stage will be taken fairly soon in the Seanad.  It is the intention to have the SOLAS legislation enacted probably before the end of this month and to establish the SOLAS board in July.  We have a dedicated office for SOLAS-ETB implementation in the Department.  It is a fairly big operation logistically.</p><p>  With regard to the reconfiguration of the third level sector generally, the Chairman will be aware that we have received the HEA report, the landscape document.  I submitted it to the Government.  We have basically recognised the reconfigurations in regard to the institutes of technology.  There are proposals for educational clusters, which I will be happy to discuss.  I refer to clusters of various higher education institutions in different regions to allow for co-operation.  Most important from the learner's perspective, there will be portability.  One will be able to take one's qualifications from one educational institution in the south east, for example, to another and obtain full credits for what one has already learned.</p></speech>

How much will the budget for programme A be reduced bearing in mind previously announced measures?  I would appreciate the figure.

How much does the Department spend in the sector at present?  What does this involve?  This area has received much coverage recently.  At present, however, the matter is falling between two Departments, the first being the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which provides the free preschool year.  The Department of Education and Skills is responsible for the education aspect and education policy.  The two do not knit together as they should.  In the longer term, an issue will arise in respect of who has responsibility.  I refer in particular to the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills.  It would make sense for responsibilities to lie with the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  With regard to the implementation of the curriculum and the S&iacute;olta quality requirements, what is the current expenditure of the Department?  The Minister mentioned the implementation model for evaluating the quality of early childhood care and education.  Does he have more detail on additional expenditure in this area to try to generate improvement, particularly in light of recent experience?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.922" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12013061300009#H01600"><p>I agree with the Deputy in that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is less than two and a half years old.  It grew out of the Department of Health.  It was originally under the late Deputy Brian Lenihan and former Deputy Barry Andrews.  It was a semi-autonomous unit that has become a full Department.  The previous Administration introduced the ECCE programme, which every one of us supports.</p><p>  The recent revelations on child care, as distinct from early childhood education, are disturbing.  I will be meeting the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and senior officials to talk about much closer co-operation in this area.  We have a responsibility for the educational input in this area.  That costs approximately &euro;6.5 million currently.  With the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, we are trying to improve the qualifications of child care workers.  Currently, the recommended level is level V on the national qualifications framework, but this could be raised to level VI.  We will be talking to the providers of the education.  In many cases, the care workers in the sector pay for their own education.  We are considering how this could be subsidised because, quite frankly, the workers are low paid.</p><p>  We want to increase the quality and implement, in so far as it is possible, the two educational programmes, namely, S&iacute;olta, the quality control framework, and Aistear, the curriculum framework.  I will revert to the committee and report on the outcome of the meeting with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to address the quality of the educational input.  A child could be in a cr&egrave;che for the full working day of its parents, but nobody would suggest a child of cr&egrave;che-going age should have more than three or three and a half hours of education, as one would see with junior infants.  Their capacity to absorb information is lower.  The duration of being in care is not the same as the duration of being in early childhood education.</p> <p>We are working to improve the relationship between the two Departments.</p></speech>

One criticism continually put forward is that there is a skills deficit in the labour force.  How is the Government addressing it?  The Minister may want to make some general comments on that and how SOLAS will play an integral role.  The legislation is very progressive.  As I said, we have had three reforming pieces of legislation from the Department which have not received the media attention they should have.  They are significant and I congratulated the Minister on their implementation.  The impact of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 and the Further Education and Training Bill 2013 will be felt for many decades to come.  There is constant criticism that we are not tailoring our courses to meet the demand of industry.  What steps has the Department taken to deal with that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.929" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12013061300010#J00700"><p>I thank the Minister.  On the criticisms to which the Deputy referred, namely, that the training and further education provision engaged in across the further education and training sector is not aligning itself as it should with the needs of the labour market, I would argue that significant progress was made in that area under the previous Government.</p><p>  One of the main thrusts of the reform programme of the new director general and board of F&Aacute;S since taking over has been to ensure all our provision is the best possible because, as the Deputy might be aware, the labour market is evolving and changing on an almost weekly basis. The director general and the board are ensuring there is significant, ongoing and in-depth forensic analysis of the labour market at national and regional level to ensure the training programmes and further education opportunities we are providing are responding to the needs of the labour market.</p><p>  As the Deputy knows it will be the ambition of SOLAS to build on that progress and ensure every single piece of further education and training provided to our learners empowers them to move closer to the labour market or directly back into it.  It is envisaged that research will be carried out at national level by SOLAS with a well-resourced research unit and, more importantly perhaps, by individual education and training boards, ETBs.  They will also have a role in carrying out research into the skills shortages that are occurring on a regional basis.</p><p>  For example, I am from Galway where a significant medical devices and ICT cluster is emerging on the edge of the city.  There is already excellent work being done by F&Aacute;S, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, and NUI Galway in responding to the unique skills required for that particular sector.  One would expect that in Cork, pharmaceuticals would be a focus and in Dublin the focus would be on financial services and ICT.  ETBs locally will work very closely with industry.  There is provision for there to be significant co-operation between industry and enterprise in each region to ensure not alone that are we responding to the skills deficit, but also the curriculums being designed to respond to those deficits are designed through collaboration between ETBs and local enterprises.</p></speech>

I am sure other Deputies have visited Ballyfermot College of Further Education.  I will not get into the changes to the pupil-teacher ratio.  One issue it raised was certification of some of its courses.  Some are regarded as higher education courses.  It must get certification from institutes in Scotland and England.  Is that something the Department is examining?</p><p>  If we are to develop further education, perhaps it is something we need to consider.  There is an argument about whether they are stepping on the toes of institutes of technology and higher education.  I understand 60% of the courses run in Ballyfermot are higher education courses.  Representatives from the college told us at a meeting that it was not the case that it could not get courses certified here, rather it was because of the way the system operates.  Further education colleges and higher education institutes are separate, which creates a difficulty in getting courses certified.  It is not that bodies do not exist to certify them, but for whatever reason Ballyfermot must get permission from outside colleges.  Can the Minister of State comment on that?</p></speech>

We had this discussion on the drafting of the SOLAS Bill.  We did not tie down the exact definition of "further education" because we wanted to have flexibility to be able to incorporate as wide a range of provision as possible within the further education sector.  It is an example of why we needed to do that.  In terms of the certification and higher education implications, I will defer to the Minister, Deputy Quinn.</p></speech>

I asked whether the representatives from Ballyfermot whether the college would apply for SpringBoard.  They thought they were not eligible.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions on the matter.  I have established that the college could apply for SpringBoard.  A place like that could be used by the Department.  It is very close to where I live.  It is not in my constituency but it is next door.</p><p>  The most recent study by Professor Clancy of who goes to college study showed disadvantaged postal districts had greatly increased their participation over a certain period, but Ballyfermot had not.  In Ballyfermot, students went to the Ballyfermot College of Further Education which did not come under the heading of third level even though they got third level qualifications.  It is a great resource for the community in terms of getting people to go to college who might otherwise not do so.  Its potential should be maximised.</p></speech>

Where we have centres of educational excellence, for whatever reason, we should celebrate them and not try to squeeze them back into the box from which they came.  That does not make sense.  It is part and parcel of why the higher education strategy referred to regional clusters of education.</p><p>  Ballyfermot is unique because 60% of the courses it offers are in the area of what could be more properly described as higher education.  We are trying to get a seamless connection between higher and further education because they are ultimately related to qualification levels under Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  It will be something we will explore with it.</p><p>  Quite frankly, the fear is that if specific recognition is given to one college of further education, for whatever good reason, the door will be opened to all sorts of other colleges of education throughout the country who will seek the same.  That was the answer I got when I was in opposition.  We have to look at ways in which we can capture the excellence in Ballyfermot without having a knock-on effect for colleges which do not have the same level of excellence.</p></speech>

The figure was &euro;102 million last year and &euro;103 million the previous year, but it is just &euro;89 million this year.  That represents a cut of 14%.  Can the Minister of State explain where that reduction in funding came from and what impact it has had?  According to the table on page 20 of the briefing document, which gives details in relation to context and impact indicators, the figure categorised as "F&Aacute;S throughput training for those seeking employment" decreased from more than 77,000 in 2010 to approximately 60,000 in 2011 and 2012.  That is quite a significant drop at a time when one would have expected this country's employment situation to necessitate the training of more people through F&Aacute;S-supported training schemes.  Can the Minister of State provide any more detail in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.936" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12013061300011#K00200"><p>There are a number of reasons for that reduction.  Significant savings are accruing in the area of administration and staffing costs, particularly in F&Aacute;S.  Staffing numbers have reduced under the employment control framework.  The figure takes account of the estimated impact of the Haddington Road agreement on future salary costs.  The decision to discontinue the practice of paying the maximum level of jobseeker's allowance - &euro;188 per week - under F&Aacute;S training schemes has produced a saving of approximately &euro;9 million.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that a review of our apprenticeship training delivery model is under way.  The demand among employers for the training of apprentices, particularly in the construction sector, has been reducing.  We used to train approximately 7,000 construction apprentices per annum, but that figure has decreased to between 600 and 700 at this point.  I ask the Deputy to bear in mind that those savings have been offset to a certain extent by increased expenditure in other areas.  We are spending almost &euro;20 million on the provision of 6,500 training places under the MOMENTUM fund, for example.  We are targeting the achievement of savings in specific areas as a result of administrative, staffing and other reductions.  I remind the committee that 50,000 training places are being allocated uniquely and solely for the long-term unemployed this year as part of the Pathways to Work initiative.  That commitment has not been made in the past.</p></speech>

The list of headings is on page 22.  This programme is covered on page 15 of our own brief.  There are seven headings to be dealt with.  Does anyone want to ask any questions?  I will ask a general question.  There seems to be a lack of transparency regarding some of the institutions.  Expenditure issues have arisen in the university sector.  I refer, for example, to the provision of bonuses to those who are on salaries at the top of the scale.  How are the universities doing in general in terms of producing better value for money for the taxpayer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.938" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12013061300011#K00400"><p>This whole area comes under the remit of the Higher Education Authority in the first instance.  The universities approached the Government to explain that their pension fund provisions were no longer adequate.  I am speaking in general terms.  When they merged their pension fund provision for university academics and staff into the Civil Service sector, in effect, they automatically came under the employment control framework, which the Government is operating in line with the terms and conditions of the troika agreement.  There will be an employment control framework after that, as there always has been in the past.  The figures in the current employment control framework were set by the troika, but when that comes to an end, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will set our own framework which will be similar in principle.  In that context we argued that the changes in high-level salaries for senior public servants should apply to the university sector as well.  I am not in a position to update the committee on the progress that is being made in that regard.  We are monitoring it.</p><p>  I will comment briefly on the way in which universities spend their money.  The tertiary sector is unlike the primary or secondary sectors because universities and institutes of technology raise money in varying degrees for ongoing programmes.  Waterford Institute of Technology, for example, has a strong record of raising money.  The question that arises in that context is whether they should be subject to control in the areas where they are raising additional moneys.  Some of the benevolent bodies, such as the graduates' associations and the foundations of various colleges, have said they are prepared to give money to universities but do not necessarily want the Government to say how it should be spent.  They feel that should be left to the discretion of the universities themselves.  There is a fair argument to be made in that regard, as far as I am concerned.</p><p>  I have been given a note to the effect that there has been a 12% reduction in the number of people employed in this sector on a full-time basis.  The overall figure decreased from 19,900 to 17,600 between 2008 and 2013.</p><p>  Members will have taken note of the announcement of the possible establishment of three technological universities and four regional clusters.  These reform plans are all about achieving a better alignment of the public funding at our disposal so that we can streamline the system, create additional critical mass and gear the system towards the kind of performances and outcomes we need.  If we were starting from scratch today, we would not create 14 regional technical colleges, or institutes of technology as they are now known.  We are looking at how best to reconfigure that structure.  As a first step, we invited colleges and institutes of education in that sector to indicate where they thought they should or would be, or where they would like to be, within the framework of the Hunt report.  Submissions regarding their aspirations were received by the Higher Education Authority, which examined them and decided to reconcile conflicting aspirations - there were cases of double and triple counting - by recommending an infrastructure for the institutes of technology landscape, with which we are familiar.  In effect, there will be a Connacht-Ulster alliance between Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, the Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  The proposed Dublin configuration or merger, involving an alliance between Dublin Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology Tallaght, is proposing to apply for technological university status.  I will come back to that in a moment.  Details of the other configurations are available if Deputies want to discuss them.</p><p>  The outline has been recommended back to the sector.  They have been told, in respect of mergers, clusters or applications to proceed to technological university status, that they will have to come forward with a development working plan by the end of this calendar year.  Based on an assessment of the feasibility of that plan, with the assistance of external international experts, they will proceed to the next stage.  That is the change.  The relationship between a university and an institute of technology will be part and parcel of that.  For example, a structured relationship between Athlone Institute of Technology and NUI Maynooth has been proposed.  The same thing applies in the case of Dublin City University and Dundalk.  That would allow students to carry their learning qualifications from Athlone Institute of Technology, for example, to NUI Maynooth if they wanted to proceed to level 9 or level 10 of their course of study.</p></speech>

University College Cork would take students from Cork College of Commerce which is run by the VEC and they would pursue a law degree, but there is nothing like that in Trinity College Dublin which does not take students from colleges of further education or institutes of technology.  Obviously, the DIT and other institutes of technology have always had such access.  All universities should be free from this and play their part.</p></speech>

It is important in the overall scheme of things, but in terms of access for people from disadvantaged areas, it would not come near that of the DIT and similar colleges.  Trinity College Dublin has that programme, but it is a very small part of the bigger picture at the college.  For example, it provides virtually the same part-time night learning programme as it did when I attended in the 1980s.  It has not done what the other colleges such as that in Mayooth, UCC and the institutes of technology have done.  It does very good work, but it needs to be pushed to have a broader programme and instead of token stuff and having little things around the edges, it needs to be like the others, where there is equality of access.</p></speech>

Can I assume that this is a deliberate act in cross-departmental initiatives to encourage more international students to come to our higher education institutions?</p></speech>

The previous Government and, in particular, the then Minister of State, Mr. Batt O'Keeffe, recognised that the promotion of education in Ireland on a global scale needed to be undertaken by a dedicated agency.  There was a commitment to do this in the programme for Government.  He saw Enterprise Ireland in operation in China in promoting Ireland and Irish companies.  A decision was made which, in opposition, I welcomed and supported that we did not need another semi-State agency and that one which had expertise in promoting Irish enterprises in the broadest sense should be utilised.  With that intent, Enterprise Ireland has a dedicated promoting education in Ireland unit in East Point Business Park.  There is a target figure to effectively double the number of foreign students coming to Ireland.  Some 32,000 students are registered in Irish higher education institutions, including 7,000 who are studying as part of Irish programmes overseas.  There is continued development of the education in Ireland brand in our priority markets, including the United States, China, India, Brazil and the Gulf states.  This has included a particular focus on social media and the use of student ambassadors, which is innovative.  Some weeks ago there was the launch of a new Government of Ireland international scholarship aimed at attracting top students from priority and emerging markets.  We are strengthening intergovernmental relationships with different countries.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, has made a number of visits to target countries and there is ongoing progress on the strategy being monitored by a high level international education unit chaired by the Department.  The university that has the highest level of foreign students is University College Dublin.  It has a total of 25,000 students, 5,000 of whom are foreign students.  I encourage Deputies to go and have a look at its programme.  It has a student support centre for foreign students.  The attrition rate can be high because students are away from their own cultural area and possibly studying in a different language.  The drop-out rate has been identified as costly in every sense of the word - costly for the parents and student involved but also for the institution that has gone out of its way to attract such students.  Therefore, supporting systems to keep students engaged and meet their cultural needs is an important factor.  Int his regard, UCD has a very good unit.</p></speech>

I commend the unit for its professionalism and the commitment it has shown in significantly expanding our presence internationally.  We can often underestimate the creative and excellent use that can be made of social media in this regard.  The unit has been anxious to establish an education in Ireland social media presence in each of our target countries.  For example, on Facebook, education in Ireland-Vietnanm has 11,000 members, while education in Ireland-India has 500,000 members.  We are communicating directly with students and their parents through very innovative use of social media, for which I commend Enterprise Ireland.  We are seeing the benefits accruing from this.  Excellent material is being provided in the social media videos created by Enterprise Ireland on the significant benefits of studying in Ireland and in other excellent resources from IDA Ireland.  Excellent work is being done and it is beginning to produce dividends.  For example, two years ago we only had 150 students from Saudi Arabia studying here; now we have almost 2,000.  Shortly we will receive 750 PhD students from Brazil through our international marketing process, using all of the resources of Enterprise Ireland and our embassy presence.  Everybody is working together to ensure the best possible outcome.</p></speech>

It is shown in the table under the heading "Administration - Universities-IoTs".  The 2012 Estimate figure was &euro;1.119 billion and the provisional outturn was the same amount.  The  2013 Estimate figure has gone from &euro;1.119 billion to just over &euro;1 billion.  It is &euro;107 million less, which is a 10% reduction on 2012 figure.  That is a massive swing in any one year.  What exactly is involved in that reduction for universities and institutes of technology?  </p><p>  The 2012 Estimate figure for superannuation was &euro;48 million, whereas the actual provisional outturn was &euro;65 million, 18% more than expected.  What was the reason for the increase?  </p><p>  The miscellaneous column shows an allocation of &euro;5 million in 2112, whereas there is nothing included for 2013.  On what would the &euro;5 million have been spent?  </p><p>  The figure for postgraduate grants is not broken down as such, but more specific figures are provided on page 14.</p> <p>The figures showed that in the postgraduate grants area savings increased from over &euro;6 million in 2012 to &euro;24 million in 2013 and an expected &euro;42 million in 2014, which is exceptional money in the context of the education budget.  The figures coming out of the postgraduate maintenance grants budget are stark.  Overall, this is making postgraduate study difficult for people who are not of significant means.</p><p> There was a recent report and announcement that the door is open to three technological universities to be developed in the coming years.  What are the thoughts and plans at this stage with regard to additional funding that may be made available to those technological universities?  For these to come up to the mark it will take money and investment and it will not happen otherwise.  I do not expect the figures to be in the 2013 Estimate but if there is to be some investment in 2014 one would expect some figures.  I am concerned because without providing the investment, achieving that aim will be very difficult.  If we are not serious about going after that objective the flip-side of the policy objective is that one creates the expectation and the environment in the institute of technology sector that there will be three technological universities.  That, in turn, raises the question of which of the institutes of technology will not become part of a technological university.  Do they begin to fade a little subsequently?  Do people begin to drift away from them?  It is far easier to create a lower tier in the institute of technology sector than to create a higher tier.  A higher tier will take investment while a lower tier could simply come about by creating an image or a view that some institutions will not be superior or not up to the same standard as some of their prospective technological university counterparts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.953" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12013061300013#M00200"><p>There are several questions to address and I will try to answer all of them and get Deputy McConalogue the information as well.  The first question was why there has been the significant drop in the funding of the universities and the institutes of technology.  This reduction is mainly the result of the decision in the 2012 budget to reduce the once-off funding by 2% for 2013 and in addition the decision in the 2013 budget to make a once-off reduction in the cash balances.  This is similar to what we discussed earlier with the vocational education committees.  Some &euro;25 million was taken from them.  There is also the estimated savings from the Haddington Road agreement.  I understand that is the reason for the figures amounting to approximately a &euro;100 million reduction.</p><p>  Deputy McConalogue referred to pension increases.  There was an increase because of the 29 February phenomenon last year when many people were able to retire on their outgoing salary rather than the incoming reduced public service salary.  The committee may recall that there was an increase among the teaching profession at primary and secondary level, and there was a similar increased number in the third level sector.</p><p>  Deputy McConalogue asked a question about the three possible technological universities.  I am please that Deputy McConalogue is using that term because there is an expectation that one can simply change the name over the door of the institution and by that one has changed the content of what is happening inside.  In a way, that is what happened in 1997 with the then Regional Technical College, Waterford.  By general consensus that college had achieved an academic status that was significantly higher than many other of the regional technical colleges throughout the country.  However the legislation at the time was so loose that the title of the college could be changed by ministerial order rather than by primary legislation or an increase in academic evaluation.  Once the change took place in one college all the others got the same designation.  Therefore, the attempt by the college in Waterford to get recognition for its distinct status was effectively nullified.</p><p>  The legislation has since been changed and there is newer legislation in place and the institutes of technology are now under the Higher Education Authority.  Three clusters have applied.  The Dublin Institute of Technology with the institutes in Blanchardstown and Tallaght have decided to apply for technological university status.  One could argue, given the nature and the history of the Dublin Institute of Technology, that had the concept of a technological university been available ten, 15 or 20 years ago it probably would have applied directly for that title rather than the unique name of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Representatives from the Dublin Institute of Technology have told the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and the Department that to promote the Dublin Institute of Technology as an institution internationally and to attract foreign students, notwithstanding MIT and the California Institute of Technology, Caltech, and several other such world-renowned names, the existing title does not have the same resonance from a comprehension point of view and does not suggest that it is providing courses up to and including level 10.  That concept does not exist in such places as India and China.</p><p>  I cannot prejudice what the expert group will likely adjudicate at the end of the year but one would assume, given what we know already about the critical mass of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the two other Dublin-based institutes of technology, that they are in a different position to the institutes in Carlow and Waterford on the one hand, and Cork and Tralee on the other hand.  Some are more advanced in the work on this process but they must produce a clear plan of campaign to get to the level of criteria set out in the Hunt reports and the subsequent Higher Education Authority report on the required thresholds for the level of PhD members of staff, the level of PhD students and the amount of research being undertaken in the technological university, as well as its proximity to local businesses and activity in the region where they are located.  They must demonstrate all of that in tangible terms rather than aspirational terms.  Not only will the HEA evaluate the particular application and enable the successful applicants to go on to the next stage but a group of international experts will examine the qualifications and the gap between the thresholds set by the HEA and the current position of the clusters, that is, the colleges in Cork and Tralee or the colleges in Carlow, Waterford plus some other institutions in the south east area.</p><p>  There is a reason for doing this.  The internationalisation of third level education is such that the standards now are determined internationally rather than nationally and one cannot do what took place under Mrs. Thatcher in the 1980s in Britain.  At that time a UK magic wand was waved and it re-branded every polytechnic in Britain and called them universities.  Calling those colleges universities unilaterally had no impact on the reputation and perception of the universities in Oxford, Cambridge, St. Andrews in Edinburgh or the London School of Economics but it did have a big impact on other premier league universities in the so-called Russell group.  The result was that one could have three universities, for example, Norwich University, the University of East Anglia and the Norwich University of the Arts.  Many academics in Britain maintain this has done great damage to the overall infrastructure of third level education in the UK and specifically in England, because it is an English phenomenon.</p><p>  I am keen to ensure that we provide for the technological university concept.  It relates back to the original regional technical college concept, that is, a close proximity to industry and the needs of industry.  However, at the same time I wish to protect the quality reputation that Irish education has.  I received a text message two days ago from Professor Brian MacCraith from DCU.  He said that in the league or category of young universities, that is, universities that are 50 years of age and younger, DCU is now rated 40th in the world, a fantastic tribute to all the people who are associated with it.  We must maintain the reputation and quality of all existing third level institutions, including the institutes of technology and the universities.  Any progression to technological university status, which is clearly needed and desired in parts of the country, must be matched by meeting a minimum threshold of academic excellence.</p></speech>

He announced that he is Irish by choice, whereas most of the other people in the room were Irish by accident.  I have got to know him reasonably well since then and he makes the point that Open University was an obsession of Harold Wilson's in the Labour Cabinets between 1964 and 1974, allowing for the Ted Heath <i>interregnum</i>.  Wilson was a scholarship boy from a lower middle class or working class background, who went to grammar school, an example of that famous divide in the British educational system between secondary modern and grammar schools.  He had a sense of the very bright cohort that came from grammar schools and for whom part of the social deal in England - and I am talking about England rather than Great Britain - was that if one was working class and qualified and went to college one detached oneself from one's roots.  It was nearly an unwritten condition.  People changed their accents and their cultural lives were quite different from those they had been born into.  In some cases they left their entire family behind.  I know a young woman who travelled a very similar route and has little or no connection with her family or its immediate circle, which I think is tragic.  Open University was Wilson's attempt to address that and most of his contemporaries thought it was a nonsense, that it would not work and that there would be no demand for it.  What we have discovered is that it is an extraordinary success.  It is not part and parcel of our infrastructure.  I know that many people in the Republic take its courses.  We do not have immediate plans of which I am aware to make the relationship more formal, but it is open to pretty well anybody to take its courses.</p></speech>

I would be the first to say that a lot of work is being done in the form of new school buildings, replacement of prefabs, etc.  We can see that over the past three years the figures for replacement of prefabs show that their numbers have decreased, which is a positive step.  Significant funding has been put into the capital programme to meet the increased number of students anticipated over the next couple of years.  Is there a particular reason for the underspend in the past two years?

He is very public in his support for them and I appreciate that.  We have several problems and I have taken quite an interest in this, given my own background as an architect and that I worked in that area.  We had problems, which we have now solved to a certain extent, in the way in which the Department's building unit appointed architects.  Then, the Department's architectural technical section second-guessed how it was doing its job.  On the basis that if one has a dog one does not bark, we now have a different relationship with the design teams and hopefully that will speed up the process.  There are other areas under our control in respect of procurement, which we are trying to streamline.  It takes between two and four months to appoint a design team under European rules of procurement.  I am absolutely convinced that our colleagues in Portugal, Spain and particularly France and Greece are adhering as rigidly to the standards of procurement as we are.  There seems to be something in the ether of Tullamore that makes them adhere very strictly to those standards.  I think we need to speed things up, but that is only part of the solution.</p><p>  We are having great difficulty getting planning permission from local authorities.  We have memorandums of understanding with the administrative staff.  There are administrative staff in Tullamore, as distinct from technical staff, negotiating for site acquisition, but the delivery of that can be problematic.  I know the Deputy is a former member of a local authority and will be able to understand this from his own experience.  With the exception of Deputy McConalogue, who I think was not a member of a local authority-----</p></speech>

That is something we all share.  The city manager or county manager will tell the equivalent administrative person that the council will facilitate the project and that message goes down the line until it reaches the planning officer, who says there is a local area plan in the draft plan - this was driven by the Celtic tiger - such that in an area to be developed for private sector housing, proper planning suggested that the local neighbourhood centre should be in the middle of that development.  However, since the Celtic tiger collapsed the site has remained a brown field and the school is located out in the middle of that area.  There is no indication of when the rest of the development will be built, but because the school is to be the first physical item of development on that site, the Department of Education and Skills and the building unit are required to pay for much of the preliminary work, such as the road into the middle of the site and related engineering costs.  In one case I saw when I visited Tullamore in the past six weeks, the fire officer effectively wanted a swimming pool built under the school so that it would have a water reserve in the event of fires breaking out in buildings that were yet to be built.  They saw us coming with the chequebook of taxpayers' money, one public authority to another, and felt that we were fair game.  The alternative is to change the location of the school and put it to the edge of the site where it would abut the existing road infrastructure.</p> <p>There are health and safety implications in walking over an undeveloped site which is not necessarily cordoned off.

I will be happy to come back and discuss this in some detail.  The Deputy has heard me say many times that my nightmare is a child looking into an empty field rather than a schoolyard, largely because somebody does not want to go through the hassle of changing the area development plan or because a planning officer or a traffic control person feels there will be problems.</p><p>  I support the idea that an educational campus makes sense from the point of view of the provision of education services.  Sporting facilities, halls and so on can be shared.  The numbers at primary and secondary school level can be increased.  A traffic officer, who is an engineer and works on the technical side, as in Cork city, may say the area does not like a traffic arrangement or will refuse an application on traffic grounds because between 8.30 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. there will be a traffic jam in a particular area. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the fact that we have memorandums of understanding negotiated at senior national level between county councils and county managers and their counterparts in the Department, that has not been implemented.  There are also third party appeals, such as in Athenry.</p></speech>

This Government has stated the funding is still in place.  It is a primary school.  Pupils are being taught in a GAA hall and prefabs.  The local authority has passed the planning application twice and has been taken to An Bord Plean&aacute;la twice.  It is now probably subject to court proceedings.  There seems to be a continual delay which is not down to funding.  I recognise that it is a problem and steps are being taken to rectify the situation. </p><p>  Some &euro;19 million was rolled over from the capital budget last year.  One obvious question people will ask is why we cannot take that money and allocate it to another area to offset some of the cuts in other areas of education.  It is very hard to explain why we cannot do that.  Is there a communication problem with the Department?  Today would have been the first indication I heard that there are issues around new builds, in particular a greenfield site to which the Minister referred and the additional costs if a school will be the first building.  Perhaps those matters need to be communicated better by the Department.</p></speech>

To add to other factors to which I did not refer, even though very little activity and development is taking place, a lot of landowners saw that at the height of the boom property was worth X.  For emotional or personal banking reasons they still think it is worth X.  We are the only buyer in town.  If the State or a local authority is involved there can be a perception that there is no end to the amount of money that can be spent because we have our hands on other people's money through the taxpayer.  I do not want to deride the public sector for its profligacy, but some landowners have no difficulty in charging a price that is way above market value for the land on which we are trying to build.  Getting deals over the line for acquisition is a problem.  Implementing planning conditions that are too onerous and costly is also an issue. </p><p>  There are also difficulties in the vagaries of building programmes.  However, I assure the Deputy that there is no loss.  We have an agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over the money.  Some of the carryover moneys went to the stimulus package I announced recently.  It is frustrating and a matter of concern.  We need to have some kind of national debate about it. </p><p>  Strategic infrastructure legislation would deal with third party appeals.  There is a case in Tallaght where a site was allocated in the area development plan for a school which we want to expand.  However, neighbours have become so used to the site which has been unbuilt on for so long that they regard it as their personal park and are now objecting to the school being built on the land which was originally intended to be used for the school.</p></speech>

There are 15 PPP schools currently in operation located throughout the State.  There are a further eight schools, bundle 3, in construction, and two further bundles, 4 and 5, announced by the Government to proceed last July.  These bundles will deliver a total of 12 schools.  The vast majority of schools delivered through the PPP process are post-primary schools because of their size, which is much larger than primary schools and more amenable to the PPP process. </p><p>  Approval has now been given for bundles 4 and 5 by the National Development Finance Agency to proceed to publish the contract notices for the projects and invite expressions of interest from suitable consortia for pre-qualification.  Our intention is to engage further with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a further pipeline of schools.  The attraction from our point of view of PPPs is that they project manage the whole process.  It is like buying something on hire purchase.  It is more expensive but the contract is maintained for its duration.  That is all the information I have at the current time.</p></speech>

On the minor works grant and the summer work schemes which were not available this year or last year, how much was spent in the past?  The Minister might have the figures.  I again emphasise the loss of those schemes, in particular the minor works grant.  We all see it in schools we visit.  It is putting serious pressure on schools.  It is paid in the autumn and is normally a minimum of &euro;5,000.  What would it cost to reinstate it?</p></speech>

The soaring demand in pupil numbers which, as the Deputy is probably aware, are projected to increase by 70,000 up to the year 2018 is putting extraordinary pressure on the provision of school places, that is, the net number of additional places, as distinct from improvements that would have been characteristic of the minor works grant, from which a total of 837 schools benefited last year at a total cost of &euro;81 million.</p></speech>

The grant was last issued in November 2011.  All of the management bodies were advised that a minor works grant was unlikely to be available in the coming years for the reasons I stated, namely, that all available capital was going towards new build rather than refurbishment and upgrading works.  I accept the argument that early maintenance saves the capital cost of replacement down the road, but we have to make choices.</p></speech>

I found part of it a little challenging in locating some of the material sought in questions.  We might reflect on how successful and effective this exercise has been.  I am scheduled to come back to the committee on an Estimate later.  If there are unanswered questions or queries that have not been adequately responded to and we receive advance notice, we will be able to give the members the required information.  I will have no problem in giving them all of the information we have available.  There is nothing secretive as such, but sometimes the format in which we have the information or the way in which members ask for it does not immediately fit.  That does not mean we are not trying to answer the question, it just means we have a difficulty in replying.  I do not adhere to the policy of a previous Minister and Taoiseach who said, "You did not ask the right question."</p></speech>

T&aacute; deis againn inniu d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus comhr&aacute; a bheith againn i dtaobh forbairt agus dul chun cinn na Gaeilge.  I welcome members to the meeting and also the contributors to today's discussion.  It is an opportunity to examine ways by which to develop the Irish language and, in particular, the outstanding issue of the implementation of the Irish Language Act in Northern Ireland.  I hope the debate will be engaging.  We are joined by a number of guests to discuss the issue.  I welcome Ms Linda Ervine of the East Belfast Mission; Mr. Niall &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in, Gl&oacute;r na nGeal; Ms Janet Muller from POBAL; and Mr. Aod&aacute;n Mac P&oacute;il&iacute;n, Iontaobhas Ultach.  I became more familiar with POBAL recently when I was in Belfast with Ms Muller at the launch of a document.  She is very welcome to Dublin.  POBAL is the Irish language umbrella organisation in the North.  It was established in 1998 during a period of great political, social and economic change.  Its work has since focused on advocacy and the issue of community development.  It recently launched a document on the 15 years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, collating personal views of members of the Irish speaking community.</p> <p>POBAL recently launched a booklet entitled the Good Friday Agreement Pledge 15 Years On, collating personal views of the Irish speaking community.  Ms Ervine is the Irish language officer of the East Belfast Mission.  This committee is fully briefed on the work that goes on in east Belfast as we have been in the Skainos Centre a number of times.  She is very welcome to Dublin.  Her work relates to the promotion and understanding and knowledge of the Irish language among the Protestant, Unionist and loyalist community in that area.</p><p> Gl&oacute;r na nGael is an award winning Irish language group in rural Carntogher in County Derry and will be aware of a group from my parish in Na D&uacute;naibh and may be involved in some bilateral cross-Border collaboration with it.  No doubt Gl&oacute;r na nGael is aware of the good work being done by the group in my parish and <i>vice versa</i>.  Gl&oacute;r na nGael runs an Irish language centre at gaelscoileanna and na&iacute;onra&iacute; among other activities.</p><p> Iontaobhas Ultach is an independent charitable trust based in Belfast.  Its principle aim is to promote the Irish language throughout the entire community of Northern Ireland.  A core objective is to encourage cross-community involvement in the language.</p><p> I welcome the representatives of all of these groups and look forward to their contributions.  Before I call on our first contributor, I want to advise the witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only cognisant evidence in regard to the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or person outside the Houses nor an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Ervine to make her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1024" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Ervine" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013061300003#B00200"><p>The East Belfast Mission is situation on the Lower Newtownards Road, within a loyalist community and close to the interface.  Over the past few years, it has been the scene of serious rioting and this area has taken centre stage in the recent flag dispute.  The mission is surrounded by paramilitary murals and a sea of union flags, yet it is also the home of five thriving Irish language classes a week, and since September last year, has registered over 100 people, including ten children, for Irish language lessons.</p><p>  As well as teaching the language, East Belfast Mission has also engaged with the Protestant, Unionist, loyalist, PUL, community through a programme of education.  To date, over 100 people have participated in workshops which explore the links between Protestants and the Irish language, with 68% of participants expressing a desire to know more about the language.  Another 650 have attended presentations, with 100% of both workshops and presentations being received positively.  We have not waved a magic wand and turned Protestants into Gaelgeoir&iacute;, we have simply given people the facts about Protestants and the Irish language, which allows them to accept the language as part of their heritage without compromising them politically or culturally.</p><p>  For many from the Protestant community, there appears to be an innate interest in the language and when it is depoliticised and taken outside of the Nationalist, republican sphere, they naturally warm to it, realising that it was also the language of their forefathers.  However, I will relate a recent event which illustrates the reaction of some Protestants to the language.  On St. Patrick's Day this year, along with members of the congregation of East Belfast Mission who are also members of the Irish classes, I led a prayer in Irish during the morning worship service.  The prayer was from the Church of Ireland's <i>Leabhar na hUrna&iacute; Coitinne</i>  and I asked the congregation to participate in the prayer by reciting &quot;molaig&iacute; an Tiarna&quot;, &quot;praise the Lord&quot;, after every couple of lines of the prayer.  The prayer was put up on a PowerPoint slide at the front of the church in both Irish and English.  I was informed a few weeks later that three women had left the church because they were so offended.</p><p>  As someone who loves the Irish language, that seems to me ridiculous, but it is important to remember that many people from my community do not regard the Irish language in a positive way.  Unfortunately, the only words of Irish which would be instantly recognisable to many Protestants in Northern Ireland, are &quot;tiocfaidh &aacute;r l&aacute;&quot;.  For them, it is not simply a language, but the language of the enemy, a republican weapon which they feel has been used against them.  Interestingly, as part of my job as Irish language development officer, I have also come into contact with people from Nationalist backgrounds who have told me that they avoided learning Irish at school because they regarded it as too politicised and they believed that by learning Irish one was making a statement about one's own political viewpoint.</p><p>  Despite my own desire to promote the Irish language and for the language to be protected through an official act of Parliament, I believe that to push through legislation which would give the language official status in Northern Ireland would be ill advised at this time and could be potentially harmful to the language.  I fear that a negative reaction by the Protestant Unionist loyalist community to the Act could be exploited by certain politicians for their own political gain.  Over time an effective programme of education and depoliticisation, along with events which seek to increase the popularity of the Irish language making it more mainstream and equally accessible to both communities, will neutralise the language and create an atmosphere which will allow members of the PUL community to take ownership of it.  The likelihood of the Irish Language Act having the potential to become another contentious issue would greatly subside and the Act could then be passed with little or no opposition.  Overall, I am in favour of the Act, but at present my opinion on the Act is &quot;Yes it should be introduced, but not yet.&quot;</p><p>  I have spoken to a number of key loyalist organisations and their responses are as follows: John Kyle, from the Progressive Unionist Party, said: <blockquote>In my opinion the current political climate is not conducive to the introduction of an Irish Language Act.  The events of the past year have heightened Unionist fears and increased hostility towards the Irish language.  Considerable spadework needs to be done to persuade Unionists that they have any historical connection to the Irish language and that its promotion is not simply a means of replacing British culture with Irish.</blockquote>An unofficial spokesperson from the Ulster Volunteer Force said: <blockquote>It would be unwise to try to introduce an Irish language Act at present due to the dissatisfaction and resentment of hard-line loyalists to what they perceive as the undermining of their position in their own country, being carried out by Sinn F&eacute;in and aided and abetted Whitehall.  Within the membership of the UVF there are those who would be sympathetic to the Irish language, but in the present toxic atmosphere, the introduction of a Language Act would be counterproductive and could put back the cause of the Irish language within Unionist communities.  A policy of education and depoliticisation to neutralise the language should be put in place before any government action could be brought about.</blockquote>  Charter Northern Ireland stated:<blockquote>What the Irish Language Act entails needs to be explained to the Protestant people and the working class Protestant community in particular.  Charter N.I. concurs with the Good Friday Agreement and for a language act as part of that agreement and we fundamentally support the ultimate introduction of the act after a period of effective education.  However, at this time when Protestant communities feel that their British identity is under threat, we feel that a common sense approach must be taken by all involved.</blockquote></p></speech>

Ta m&eacute; iontach bu&iacute;och as an deis cur i l&aacute;thair a dh&eacute;anamh os comhair an choiste inniu.  I am the director of Carntogher Community Association and Gl&oacute;r na nGael Charn T&oacute;chair and I thank the committee for this opportunity to make a presentation.  I realise time is short so I will focus on one aspect of the Irish language in the North, which relates to the intolerance towards it in some quarters and the absolute necessity to deal with this issue if we are to have a lasting peace process.  I will also look at the opportunity of the special PEACE III programme, which, although it is still open, is being squandered.  An opportunity still exists to do something about it.</p><p>  Carn T&oacute;chair is a small rural area in south County Derry in the Sperrin Mountains.  It was an Irish-speaking area until 100 years ago, with native speakers surviving until living memory.  We have had a long history and heritage of the language and of Gaelic sport for more than 100 years.  For the past 20 years Coiste Forbartha Charn T&oacute;chair and Gl&oacute;r na nGael Charn T&oacute;chair have focused on developing a range of physical, economic, social, environmental and cultural projects to reassert the Irish language.  These have at their core the revival of the Irish language and its reinstatement as a community language in the area.  We have been very successful.  We tie the Irish language in with every aspect of community development and it works exceptionally well.   The Gaelscoil in the area is attended by more than 100 children and it has more than 100 former pupils.  We also have quite a few adult learners and families bringing up their children through the medium of Irish.  We are the only area in Ireland, North or South, outside the official Gaeltacht where the majority of primary school children are educated through the medium of Irish.  We have made massive steps forward.  We are a re-emerging Gaeltacht and have a young and vibrant Irish-speaking community, which is a real example to everyone.</p><p>  In our community we provide a rich cultural and linguistic experience for this young generation of Irish speakers.  Unfortunately, this is not the case outside our community.  Speaking from my own experience, it is very difficult.  I raise my family through the medium of Irish and for my children Irish is an integral part of their existence and is how they know the names of townlands, places, rivers and mountains.  It is part of who they are.  It is very difficult to explain to my children that outside our area the Irish language does not really count and is effectively being oppressed.  There is no Irish language road or public signage and very few visitor attractions have interpretation or any level of written material in Irish.  My children must grow up with the realisation that to speak Irish in the wrong place at the wrong time could lead to physical harm, which must be addressed if we are to have a long-term peaceful society in the North.</p><p>  I mentioned interpretation and I have cited as an example in my written statement the Navan Centre in Armagh, which is one of the most important Gaelic sites in Ulster.</p> <p>Its interpretation is based around Gaelic folklore.  I visited it one year because I saw an advertisement for a multilingual interpretative exhibition.  I went there with my family.  It was in French, Italian, German, Spanish and English but not in Irish, which is ridiculous.  It is not just that the centre cannot be bothered to have it in Irish, because it has it in so many other languages.  Ironically, it appears to be the Equality Commission that is driving this.  Local authorities must carry out what is called an equality impact assessment, which looks at objectives to do with good relations.  It gives credence to those who hold strong views of opposition to the language in the interests of promoting good relations.  Often that means that signage and interpretation is not implemented.  This week the Committee for the Administration of Justice took up this point.  It recently published a document which addresses this issue.</p><p> The Human Rights Commission has also identified in a number of publications evidence of hostility towards the language.  It cited it in a document for the Council of Europe, in which it said: "The Commission remains concerned at examples of intolerance, hostility and even demonisation of speakers of the Irish language."  It referred to a debate in the Northern Ireland Assembly in which a motion was brought forward by MLAs to ban the use of Irish in the chamber.  There were some really disgusting comments, which I have included in my written submission.  They show the depth of opposition to the language among Unionist politicians.  The fact that the motion was defeated by only two votes demonstrates how deep the opposition is.  That makes it more difficult to break through to the grassroots Unionists and loyalists who, more than their political leaders, had shown an openness to the language.  In the same document I mentioned, the Human Rights Commission said, "Given the level of hostility and stereotyping facing the Irish language, the Commission foresees a need for significant measures in order to promote tolerance and respect for the Irish language."  It cites the example of Wales, where this has taken place.  The Committee for the Administration of Justice, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Council of Europe recognise the need to promote cultural tolerance of the language.</p><p> A European fund, the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, was set up under the Good Friday Agreement.  Its aim is to promote tolerance and understanding and to reinforce the peace process.  To date it has spent almost &pound;1 billion, but virtually none of that has been spent on promoting tolerance for the Irish language.  In a recent consultation exercise under the PEACE IV programme, which is due to be launched over the coming months, the SEUPB invited submissions from different organisations.  Quite a few organisations came forward and approximately 26% of those who responded to it pointed out the intolerance of and prejudice against the Irish language and the need to have initiatives under the peace process to deal with this.  However, in the SEUPB's summary of the consultation exercise it failed to mention anything about the prejudice against the language or the need for initiatives to promote tolerance and understanding of the language.  This is the last opportunity to do something about this through the PEACE programme.  To date it has been ignored.  Opposition and hostility to the language and cultural intolerance has built, and the SEUPB has done nothing about it.  It is planning to do nothing about it in the last round of the PEACE programme.  I urge all members who have any influence over the SEUPB to bring that influence to bear on this.</p><p> An Irish language Act is essential and a date must be set for implementing it.  All of the issues that Ms Ervine mentioned must be addressed in the interim.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1033" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aod&aacute;n Mac P&oacute;il&iacute;n" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013061300006#F00200"><p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat as ucht an cuireadh go teacht seo.</p><p>  I will give the committee some background information first.  For the last 23 years I have been the director of the Ultach Trust, a cross-community Irish language organisation based in Belfast.  I live in the Shaw's Road Gaeltacht in Belfast and am a former chairman of the first Irish-medium school in Northern Ireland and of Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta.  I spent eight years as a board member of Foras na Gaeilge.  I will briefly mention five topics, some of which have been dealt with in great detail in the draft report that has been circulated to the committee.  The members probably have not read it because it is a big beast of a thing.  I will summarise the points made.</p><p>  My organisation believes that the draft Irish language strategy published last year by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has not given due attention to the cross-community imperative identified in the Northern Ireland programme for government, which is focused on reconciliation.  This imperative is also implicit in the Good Friday Agreement's commitment to promoting respect, understanding and tolerance regarding linguistic diversity, in which Irish and Ulster-Scots are specifically mentioned.  There is a great deal in our report on that.</p><p>  No matter how desirable it might be to have an effective Irish language Act and no matter how strong the case for it is or what shape an effective language Act could or should have, we believe there is little prospect of a language Act in the short to medium term given the political configuration in Northern Ireland.  In other words, if it is not passed in Westminster, it will not be passed.  We are working on the assumption that Westminster does not want to do it.</p><p>  Third, we believe that the draft Irish language strategy, which is an enormously important step towards supporting the language, depends too much on the language Act we will not get and also depends too much on the model of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 in the South, which was designed for a society in which the constitutional, legal, social, political,</p><p>  These statements may be a bit bald, but the sometimes complex analysis behind them can be found in the report.  It is still in draft form but I hope to have the final form available by the end of next week.  I will send a copy to the members.</p><p>  There are two other topics I wish to cover very quickly.  The first is the future of the Irish language broadcasting fund.  My organisation campaigned for this fund for 13 years.  It was finally established in 2003-04 and is worth &pound;3 million per annum.  It is one of the most important support infrastructures for the Irish language in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The fund derives from a commitment made only by the UK Government in the Good Friday Agreement.  The funding comes from Westminster and is not part of the block grant.  It is anything but secure.  Each time the fund came up for renewal the UK Government tried to back out of its commitment in the Agreement which has the force of an international treaty and on both occasions the funding was renewed only because the crisis coincided with one in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The crises gave Sinn F&eacute;in the leverage to get the fund back on the agenda.  In both instances it took a political crisis to have it renewed.  The next renewal date is in 2015 and I am suggesting we should begin to prepare now.  The committee is a in a position to ensure the issue is placed on the agenda of the UK Government.  The Department for Culture, Media and Sport should know about the issue at the highest level.  Northern Ireland Screen has already made representations, but it is moving at a lower level.  The committee can move at the highest possible Government level in order to have this madde made relevant and considered before there is another crisis.</p><p> The final topic relates to the core funded Irish language sector in Northern Ireland.  I will declare an interest by saying I am one of those involved in the core funded Irish language sector.  It is in my interests, as well as those of the Irish language.  The North-South Ministerial Council, as advised by Foras na Gaeilge, will reduce the number of core funded organisations from seven to two.  The two remaining organisations will be a local radio station and an organisation that produces school textbooks.  The other core funded organisations, some of which have considerable expertise in lobbying, advocacy, cross-community work and education provision in the Northern Ireland context, will cease to exist or be subsumed into organisations that do not have expertise and will be based in Dublin.  I have nothing against people in Dublin, but they do not understand the complexities in Northern Ireland.  They cannot direct this issue from Dublin.  Such a loss of experience, specialised knowledge, good will and contacts will do untold damage to the language movement in the North and the savings will be negligible.</p></speech>

To understand what is happening in the North, we can outline what is happening in the South.  I come from the west and learned Irish compulsorily for 14 years at school.  Like most of my counterparts, my knowledge and use of the Irish language are very limited.  Surveys suggest 42% of people can use the language, but it is more fantasy than fact.  Where I live, we are much closer to the attitude of people in east Belfast in our approach to the language, despite claiming an ability to speak it.  After 14 years of learning Irish at school, it was a mitigated failure.  An awful lot has been done and will be done.</p><p>  Three years ago I was appointed to the Front Bench as spokesman on community affairs and the Irish language was part of that brief.  What happened proved why we had not had success where I lived.  A letter was written to a newspaper asking Deputy Enda Kenny to dismiss me from my role because I was not an Irish language speaker.  It was written by so-called academics, artists and writers who were well meaning and well intentioned.  However, they did not represent people on the ground.  The people I met through Conradh na Gaeilge and Comhdh&aacute;il na Gaeilge and other Irish speakers were understanding and facilitative.  There are anomalies that need to be addressed and I thank the people who showed faith in me.  T&aacute;im ag foghlaim chun mo chuid Gaeilge a fheabhs&uacute;.  We have much more to do.</p><p>  Ms Linda Ervine is very welcome.  We went to the Skainos centre in east Belfast, where brilliant work is done.  On the committee there has been a lack of involvement by Unionist and loyalist politicians.  It would be more beneficial for all sides if they were to contribute to it.  It would create a better balance.</p><p>  This issue has been committed to under the Irish language Act, but we are in another situation where the fight is never what it seems to be about.  What do the delegates think we should do?  Should we have a timeframe for implementation?  It seems to be a political football.  Where I live, the Irish language was not fully embraced as it was seen to be the preserve of militant nationalism.  I have been in the cultural centre in west Belfast and much has been done to preserve the Irish language.  Sometimes, however, there is a knee-jerk reaction and people may think the fact that we are speaking Irish is linked with militancy.  People disagree with me and have their own opinions, but I can only tell them how tens of thousands of young men and women like me felt.  I am proud that we can move forward on this issue and would like to work with each and every one the delegates to ensure the position on the Irish language goes back to what it was 100 years ago.  We must take a holistic approach.  What has been done in south Derry, as outlined by Mr. &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in, is wonderful and exceptional.  It is the way forward.  The gaelscoil approach has been very successful, which is great to see.</p><p>  After 14 years at school, we allowed the Irish language to be the preserve of elites and so-called intellectuals.  What we are doing today is trying to take it back in order that it is spoken by the vast majority of people with no political or intellectual agenda.  The agenda should be to increase fluency in the language.  We do not have to be expert because we can hardly speak English properly.  All we need is a c&uacute;pla focail and we should not be afraid of getting it wrong or criticism.  I look forward to hearing the views of the delegates.</p></speech>

Each of the speakers is committed to the promotion of the Irish language, but there is a different emphasis on the part of each of them.  The 20 year strategy was published three years ago and promoted by Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  He attended the meeting earlier but had another commitment at 1 p.m. and was not able to return.  The 20 year strategy supports the introduction of an Irish language Act in Northern Ireland.  It is something I fully support.  Much preparatory work and homework must be done and perhaps it might be accelerated in order that it will not be an imposition on those who do not want to speak the language but a support for those who want to speak it.</p> <p>It should be a support for people who wish to speak the language and have the different supports in place that Mr. &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in mentioned that are lacking in different communities with regard to signposting etc.  For those who do not wish to speak the language or are not supportive of it, has enough work been done in trying to persuade those people that it is not an imposition?  An Irish language Act would underpin the rights of people who want to speak and use the language, along with having it promoted widely in the community, no matter what is the tradition.</p><p> Along with Deputy Martin I was in Belfast City Hall a number of months ago attending an exhibition detailing events from 1912 to 1922.  I was struck by the reference and clarity with regard to the commitment, particularly of Presbyterians, in the promotion of the Irish language and their fluency in the early part of the last century.  That is often forgotten throughout our island.  Mention has been made of the special EU programmes body and the lack of enthusiasm for supporting projects but over the years I and others who represent southern Border counties have seen programmes of support and investment by both the Irish and British Governments, supported by the European Commission.  The outcome of some of the spending is questionable.  A small amount of money could make a meaningful difference, and that is the type of project that the special EU programmes body should be supporting.</p><p> The mention of hostility to the language alarms me and the comments of a particular MLA in Stormont were deplorable and despicable.  It is important to assure and reassure the community which does not want to use the language that an Irish language Act would not be about imposing on people but underpinning the rights of people who want to use the language.  Is enough being done at official levels and within civic society to bring such a persuasion about?  I know that none of the process is easy and it does not happen with the speed with which we would all like to see it happen.  We want to lay particular emphasis on the area.</p></speech>

L&eacute;igh m&eacute; na p&aacute;ip&eacute;ir a bhaineann leis.  I was interested to hear about the position of education in Gaelscoileanna, and I saw a note that more than 4,500 children are in Irish medium education in the North.  That is something to be welcomed across the country.  I read about the rebroadcasting of TG4 across the North and although it is welcome, it is not available in some parts of the greater Belfast area.  Perhaps the committee could make some strong representations on that.  The issue of media is very important, whether it is Raid&iacute;o na Gaeltachta or TG4 broadcasting programmes in Irish.</p><p>  Acht na Gaeltachta has been referred to and there is a feeling, as mentioned by Mr. &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in, that the British Government must make an announcement as the feeling is it will not come from any other quarter.  There is an issue about encouraging the Irish language.  I take the point by Deputy Feighan that sometimes people can be particular about the can&uacute;int, grammar or the way the Irish language is spoken.  It is great to see people having a go at speaking the language.  To take Deputy Smith's point, there can be a certain hostility about the way people deal with it.  We are often told that Irish thrived because the British Government did not want us to speak Irish and the hedge schools came about because were not meant to have our religion or language.  That is why they thrived so well.  If there is hostility or at least no encouragement, could Irish thrive?  Overall, there are a number of proposals that our committee could make with regard to TG4 or Raid&iacute;o na Gaeltachta and there could be more coverage of Irish programmes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1041" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013061300008#H00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation and I apologise for missing the beginning.  The Irish language interests me but I also find it massively intimidating.  One of the biggest problems is that a person can make an idiot of oneself when trying to speak it because there might not be much coherence.  The word "n&aacute;ire", or embarrassment, comes to mind, and among my close friends, it is a major factor stopping them speaking Irish.  There is no item in the room for which I would not know the Irish word, and I could give the Irish equivalent to any verb in English, and that level of knowledge would be the case for many people I know.  Nevertheless, putting together the jigsaw is very difficult because of the abstract nature of learning the Irish language; if a person is not immersed in it, it becomes very difficult.</p><p>  I have met many people through the years who have struggled with languages in school, particularly Irish, and they may have gone to Germany and Spain, where within four or five months they are almost fluent in the local language.  The biggest challenge facing the Irish language is finding places where people can immerse themselves, and there is a massive opportunity in technology that could change the issue.  There is a phone application called "Anseo", and it can be followed on Twitter and Facebook.  It is a virtual Gaeltacht and one can find out where there are Irish-speaking individuals in the area by using the application.  One can find out if these people are eight or nine miles away, ten miles away or 50 miles away.  One can even see how many Irish speakers are in the area, and such information can be used to pull together people in a group.  There are opportunities for immersion that have never been there before so are these being considered?</p><p>  I made a suggestion at a meeting of the environment committee, which takes in Irish language, that there should be a day in which texts are sent only in Irish.  Perhaps some of the phone providers could come on board.  It is an area I have found that with a couple of friends we have developed and progressed.  One friend is completely fluent in Irish and can speak and write old and middle Irish; he knows every form of Irish there has been, even that which does not look like modern Irish.  We have sent texts to him and he has replied, with all the texts in Irish.  A person is caught on the hop speaking Irish and does not know how to reply in many instances but in a text one can use a downloaded dictionary and use any fancy words that one can think of.  One can be more articulate than one would ever be in English.  For approximately two years I have been texting only in Irish with this person and a few others.  It has been a big help so could this idea be considered?</p><p>  I will take up Deputy Feighan's comments.  When I heard Deputy Feighan was to become the Irish spokesperson for Fine Gael and the stick he was getting because he was not fluent, I thought of how this is one of the major problems.</p> <p>I do not think he would have the right understanding of the very people to whom we are trying to get by being fluent in Irish because he would be speaking to those who had already got the message.  When Deputy Frank Feighan was chosen as the Irish spokesperson, he was in a position which the vast majority of people were in.  They love Irish, would like to be able to speak it, pine for it in a way and feel like I do that we somehow failed.  Those are the very people at whom we need to get.</p><p> If the spokespersons for Irish in all of the parties were not that great at Irish, they would be able to empathise with those people.  I learned how to swim when I was 30 years of age and I teach quite a few people who have not learned to swim until a later age.  Many people say it is easy but if it was easy, everybody would know how to swim in the first place.  If people can empathise with those who have come at it from the same angle, it would be a big help.</p><p> In terms of Irish being elitist, the reality is that when I was growing up, only the rich kids could go to the Gaeltacht.  It is a bit like bread.  In the past, when we did not know how good brown bread was for one, the rich ate white bread and the poor ate brown bread.  It has been reversed.  It is the same with the Irish language.  When it was deemed the language of poverty and starvation, the poor and very few of the rich spoke it.  Then it switched around.  </p><p> We need to create a situation where it is possible for people to go to the Gaelteacht.  I would have loved to have gone to the Gaelteacht.  It was not a case of poor me as none of my neighbours could afford to go either.  The people who had gone to the Gaeltacht were infinitely better at Irish and one was at a disadvantage.  It was then the language of the elite.  My parents ran it down and said it was all very well for those who could afford to go, etc.  There was kind of a negative attitude to it.  With my kids, I tried to be positive about and use phrases such as "l&eacute;im isteach sa charr", "scuab do fiacla" and so on.  I thought I was being positive and they loved it.</p><p> However, it was like someone flicked a switch in the class when they moved on from playing bingo and having games in Irish and started down what I would call the "An Droimeann Donn D&iacute;lis" road where one must talk about the symbolism of the lost heifer and the lost province and one does not actually know how to say n&iacute; thuigim.  I thought it had changed but it seems like there is a point in our education system when overnight everyone of my kids' classmates seem to hate Irish even though the loved it when they were playing bingo in Irish or living it and when it was real.  </p><p> There must be a future for Irish.  What Deputy Michael Kitt said was interesting.  Irish might have been more popular when we were not allowed to use it.  I do not know whether it is thriving in the North but I imagine it might have a better chance there than here.  People there might feel they had to fight for it whereas it was kind of rammed down our throats.  Have the witnesses looked at the digital side of it because there are considerable opportunities for it?  There is a considerable love for the Irish language and we must tap into it.  </p></speech>

The idea of Acht na Gaeilge and that legislation for people's rights has to wait for those who are opposed to those rights to be comfortable with the idea of legislating for them is really putting the cart before the horse.  People's rights have to be legislated for because other people oppose those rights.  While I very much appreciate the work which is being done in Unionist communities in particular and by gaelgeoir&iacute; across the North to open up the language and ensure people feel more comfortable, the reality is that there is a requirement for rights-based legislation for it.  It cannot wait until everybody is completely comfortable because if everybody was completely content and happy with the language, there would be no need for rights-based legislation to protect it and those who want to speak it.</p><p>  There is a requirement to press ahead with it.  It was part of the St. Andrews Agreement.  The British Government fudged the issue.  We put it very clearly to it that if it did not legislate for it in Westminster and kicked it back to the Assembly, it would not happen.  It messed about with it on the basis that it had no political will to pursue it in Westminster.  It needs to go back there because as has been said, it was part of a sovereign agreement between two Governments which was an extension of the Good Friday Agreement.  It would be useful for this committee to raise this issue with the Taoiseach given that it is now an outstanding matter of the St. Andrews Agreement which developed the Good Friday Agreement.  </p><p>  The issue of SEUPB funding was raised.  I read the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the criticism of the Equality Commission and the way it has dealt with Irish language issues.  I find myself in agreement with the Comptroller and Auditor General's criticism of the Equality Commission in its approach to this.  There is an opportunity for this committee to raise with the SEUPB the approach of EU funding in regard to Irish language projects.  </p><p>  The broadcasting fund and the plans being developed under the North-South Ministerial Council, as advised by Foras na Gaeilge, are issues which this committee could raise and perhaps receive a presentation from the people in involved in the NSMS.  In terms of the St. Andrews Agreement, I am aware the broadcasting fund was very much on the agenda but I agree that a position might not arise.  We do not want the broadcasting fund and the contribution of the British Government to be the subject of crisis negotiation.  It should be something committed to and followed through on.  Those are three areas which it would be quite useful for the committee to pick up on, namely, EU funding, the broadcasting fund and the approach of the NSMC to the Irish language.  The outstanding issue of Acht na Gaeilge is one for the Taoiseach to raise with the British Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1044" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francie Molloy" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013061300009#J00300"><p>I am the MP for the area.  I have visited the site which is a very important one and in which very good work is going on.  It is an example of how work can be developed.  The point raised about EU funding is very important.  If there is work to be done to deal with and reconcile the issues, this body should be used to do that in addition to supporting the project so that it is sustainable and a good example of the development of the Irish language.</p><p>  I go back to the question Mr. Aod&aacute;n Mac P&oacute;ilin raised in regard to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.  I find it a little strange that the only Department in the Assembly which has done anything to promote this is the one which is criticised.  I am not speaking on behalf of the Department but the Act was voted down by the Assembly because of the hostility and reaction of Unionists to it.  The only way to bring it in was through the Department and try to move as far as possible.  That is something for which it should get credit and not criticism.  </p><p>  We should not give up too quickly because to say that it is most likely it will not be passed is the best way to defeat it.  The St. Andrews Agreement is part of the Good Friday Agreement and all the parties signed up to it.  The British Government gave a commitment under it.  This committee's role is to secure the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  We should say it is up to the British Government to implement it and ensure the Act is enacted because it could do so.  The St. Andrews Agreement is a binding agreement.  I do not think we should give up at this early stage and let any Government off the hook in regard to the agreements made.</p> <p>There are many other aspects of the Good Friday Agreement that have not been fully implemented.  We need to deal with this and ensure we pursue the Agreement and its full implementation.  The whole issue of the development of the language should not have to wait.  Connolly said, "Labour must wait", but I do not believe the language should have to wait until we have everything else in place.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh na finn&eacute;ithe.  T&aacute; f&aacute;inne &oacute;ir agam, ach n&iacute;l mo theanga fh&eacute;in ar bharr mo theanga.  T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och don Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh mar fuair m&eacute; an f&aacute;inne &oacute;ir uaidh.  T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och d&oacute; as sin.  Nuair a bh&iacute; mise ar scoil, c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin, m&uacute;ineadh na h&aacute;bhair ar fad tr&eacute; Ghaeilge, stair, t&iacute;r eolas agus gach &aacute;bhar eile ach amh&aacute;in B&eacute;arla.  Bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge &aacute; labhairt freisin nuair a bh&iacute;omar ag imirt cluiche peile sa chl&oacute;s n&oacute; sa ph&aacute;irc.  Bh&iacute; ceithre n&oacute; c&uacute;ig scoileanna n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta sa cheantar agus sin mar a bh&iacute; s&eacute; i ngach scoil sa cheantar.</p><p>  Chaill m&eacute; mo theanga, ach nuair a th&aacute;inig m&eacute; go Teach Laighin c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin, thosnaigh m&eacute; ag freastal ar rang Gaeilge anseo agus de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile t&aacute; an teanga ag teacht ar ais chugam.  T&aacute; sc&eacute;al gearr agam a bhaineann leis an t&iacute;r seo.  C&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin, bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag caint le pr&iacute;omhoide scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  B'fh&eacute;idir go raibh an m&uacute;inteoir c&eacute;anna ag an duine seo agus a bh&iacute; agamsa.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; liom go raibh &aacute;r teanga ag f&aacute;il bh&aacute;is.  Bh&iacute; br&oacute;n orm &eacute; sin a chloisint agus d'fhiafraigh m&eacute; de cad a bh&iacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh aige i dtaobh sin.  N&iacute; dh&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; dearmad go deo ar an fhreagra a thug s&eacute; dom.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; nach bhfuil s&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh faic faoi.  Ceapaim nach bhfuil an tsuim c&eacute;anna ag an chuid is m&oacute; de na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; in &aacute;r scoileanna n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus a bh&iacute;.  Inniu, lasmuigh de doras an T&iacute; seo, chuala m&eacute; m&uacute;inteoir - cail&iacute;n a bh&iacute; inti - ag caint Gaeilge lena dalta&iacute; scoile.  Bh&iacute; Gaeilge iontach ag an m&uacute;inteoir seo, absolutely fantastic and I butted in to ask a question.  As often as I can, I ask pupils from scoileanna n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta here c&eacute;n contae as a dtagann siad agus mar sin de.  Bh&iacute; Gaeilge iontach ag an dream seo, taobh amuig den doras seo.  Bh&iacute; &aacute;thas an domhain orm iad a chloisint.</p><p>  Caithfidh m&eacute; &eacute; seo a r&aacute; i mB&eacute;arla.  We must make our native language fun to learn sna scoileanna.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag caint le fear at&aacute; p&oacute;sta ag a bhfuil c&uacute;igear p&aacute;iste aige agus a bhfuil c&oacute;na&iacute; air sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe.  He is a man who has been through university and has a degree, an MBA and the lot.  I asked him who was the best teacher he had ever come across and he said it was the man, an fear a bh&iacute; ag caint liom agus a d&uacute;irt nach raibh s&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh faic maidir leis an Ghaeilge a bheith ag f&aacute;il bh&aacute;is.  I asked why he chose him and he said that it was because, "He made it fun to learn."  I am convinced by that.</p><p>  I have a suggestion to make.  I have a f&aacute;inne &oacute;ir, ach b'fh&eacute;idir nach c&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; agam mar n&iacute;l an Ghaeilge ar bharr mo theanga agam.  Caithfidh m&eacute; smaoineamh a dh&eacute;anamh roimh gach abairt.  T&aacute;im &aacute;balta an Ghaeilge a scr&iacute;obh i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr n&aacute; &iacute; a labhairt.  Everybody who has a c&uacute;pla focal should have some emblem, perhaps not a f&aacute;inne &oacute;ir, ach brat &eacute;igin a thaispe&aacute;nann do gach duine eile go bhfuil c&uacute;pla focal acu.  T&aacute; an f&aacute;inne &aacute; chaitheamh agam agus nuair a bhfeiceann daoine a bhfuil c&uacute;pla focal acu &eacute;, labhra&iacute;onn siad c&uacute;pla focal liom agus freagra&iacute;m le abairt as Gaeilge.  Sin an rud at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh agamsa don Ghaeilge.</p><p>  I understood Irish was fl&uacute;irseach in the North agus ag dul i m&eacute;id and that more people were speaking it.  The Deputy Commissioner of the PSNI suggested in an article that c&uacute;pla c&eacute;ad duine in the PSNI were &aacute;balta Gaeilge a labhairt.  An bhfuil sin ceart?  I read an article in a newspaper saying that everybody should make it his or her own language.  Ceapaim go bhfuil rud &eacute;igin le d&eacute;anamh againn go l&eacute;ir.  An t-aon difr&iacute;ocht idir sinne agus aon t&iacute;r eile n&aacute; &aacute;r teanga f&eacute;in.  </p></speech>

Breathna&iacute;m  &oacute; Thuaidh i gc&oacute;na&iacute; &oacute; thaobh eiseaml&aacute;ir maidir le cur chun cinn na teanga.  Le bheith pointe&aacute;ilte faoin d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo inniu, ceapaim go bhfuil Acht na Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh t&aacute;bhachtach sa chomhth&eacute;acs idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, &oacute; thaobh na teangacha eile at&aacute; faoi bhr&uacute;, agus go h&aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh an chaoi ina bhfuil an G&aacute;idhlig in Albain.</p><p>  I saol eile, bh&iacute; mise ag pl&eacute; leis an dr&aacute;ma&iacute;ocht agus na me&aacute;in agus ceann de na h&aacute;iteanna is m&oacute; a ndearna m&eacute; taisteal chuige n&aacute; na hoile&aacute;in siar in Albain, &aacute;it a bhfuil Eile&aacute;n Le&ograve;dhais, Eile&aacute;n na Hearadh, Beinn na Faoghla agus &aacute;iteacha eile mar sin ina bhfuil formh&oacute;r pobal Protast&uacute;nach iontu a labhra&iacute;onn an G&aacute;idhlig &oacute; l&aacute; go l&aacute;.  N&iacute; raibh aon cheist riamh in Albain an pholait&iacute;ocht agus mar sin de a ard&uacute; &oacute; thaobh an teanga de.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom sin a fheice&aacute;il anseo chomh maith c&eacute;anna, ar fud an oile&aacute;in seo.  Caithfimid dul i dtreo an rud sin, nach bhfuil an pholait&iacute;ocht bainteach leis an teanga agus nach bhfuil s&iacute; dl&uacute;thcheangailte le&iacute;.  </p><p>  Is c&oacute;ir go nd&eacute;anfadh an coiste seo iarratas maidir leis an SEUPB, go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute;dh achain&iacute; ar an choiste, mar at&aacute; luaite ag Niall &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in, maidir le taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt &oacute; thaobh na togra&iacute; a bhfuil an teanga bainteach leo.</p> <p>S&iacute;lim go bhfuil s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go n-eiseodh an coiste seo r&aacute;iteas, n&oacute; so scr&iacute;obhfaimid chun an Taoiseach, maidir le Acht na Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh.  S&iacute;lim go bhfuil iarrachta&iacute; f&oacute;nta ar bun agus go bhfuil dul chun cinn &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh faoin Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on agus F&oacute;ill&iacute;ochta.

T&aacute; mise an-ch&aacute;inteach i dtaobh cur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise &oacute; Dheas.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm mar is ceart.  Mar eolas don choiste, t&aacute; athbhreithni&uacute; le d&eacute;anamh ag fochoiste anseo ar an gcaoi ina bhfuil an strait&eacute;is &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm.  S&iacute;lim go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach don choiste s&uacute;il a choinne&aacute;il ar sin.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go mbeidh leasuithe agus l&aacute;idri&uacute; le d&eacute;anamh ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003 anseo.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; i gceist sa reachta&iacute;ocht sin &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm.</p><p> T&aacute; an ciste craolt&oacute;ireachta, a luaigh Aod&aacute;n Mac P&oacute;il&iacute;n, thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.  Mar dhuine a d'oibrigh sna me&aacute;in, feicim an leas a rinne TG4 &oacute; thaobh &iacute;omh&aacute; na Gaeilge ar fud an oile&aacute;in agus ar fud an domhain.  T&aacute; m&eacute; anseo le dh&aacute; bhliain, agus n&iacute;or chuala m&eacute; aon duine f&oacute;s ag c&aacute;ineadh TG4.  Chuala m&eacute; neart daoine ag c&aacute;ineadh na craolt&oacute;ir&iacute; eile ar cheisteanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la, ach is ard-mholadh a fhaigheann TG4.  Is teistim&eacute;ireacht &eacute; sin ar an dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta &oacute; thaobh TG4.  T&aacute; obair an-mhaith ar bun ag na craolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la - BBC Tuaisceart &Eacute;ireann, mar shampla - &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.  T&aacute; an obair sin bunaithe ar an taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;n gciste craolt&oacute;ireachta.  Mar a d&uacute;irt Aod&aacute;n Mac P&oacute;il&iacute;n, t&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn a chinnti&uacute; go bhfaighidh an ciste craolt&oacute;ireachta an taca&iacute;ocht agus an t-aitheantas cu&iacute; agus an lean&uacute;nachas at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il.

N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil an pr&oacute;iseas sin thart go f&oacute;ill.  N&iacute; fheictear dom go mbeidh s&eacute; thart ar feadh tamall.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach ag na heagrais sa phl&eacute; at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh le go dtiocfaimid ar an r&eacute;iteach ceart.  T&aacute; an comhth&eacute;acs Eorpach f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach.  T&aacute; r&oacute;l na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach.  Rinne Jim Higgins MEP cur i l&aacute;thair sa Seanad c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin.  T&aacute; an-amhras air go bhfuil st&aacute;das na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach i mbaol mar nach bhfuiltear &aacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id.  S&iacute;lim go bhfuil s&eacute; sin bainteach le Chairt Chomhairle na hEorpa um Theangacha R&eacute;igi&uacute;nacha n&oacute; Mionlaigh.  Nuair at&aacute; aitheantas tugtha in Albain do Ghaeilge na hAlban, agus sa Bhreatain Bheag don Bhreatnais, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go dtabharfar aitheantas don Ghaeilge sna S&eacute; Chontae chomh maith c&eacute;anna, mar chuid den picti&uacute;r idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  Bheadh tionchar aige sin ar an gCatal&oacute;inis agus ar teangacha eile ar fud na hEorpa at&aacute; ag troid ar son a gcuid cearta teanga chomh maith c&eacute;anna.</p><p> T&aacute;thar ag iarraidh an sc&eacute;im l&iacute;ofa a leathn&uacute; amach ar fud an oile&aacute;in.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil ag &eacute;ir&iacute; go maith leis an sc&eacute;im sin &oacute; thaobh daoine a mhealladh i dtreo na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; r&oacute;l againn &oacute; Dheas d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go dtabharfar ar bord &eacute; sin chun an sc&eacute;im sin a leathn&uacute; amach agus daoine a mhealladh i dtreo na teanga.  Ba mhaith liom focal n&oacute; dh&oacute; a r&aacute; faoin r&aacute;iteas is m&oacute; a chuaigh i bhfeidhm orm anseo inniu.  Chuaigh Ms Muller go dt&iacute; cro&iacute; na ceiste nuair a d&uacute;irt s&iacute; "the Act is an important means to depoliticise the language".  S&iacute;lim go nd&uacute;irt Ms Ervine a mhalairt nuair a luaigh s&iacute; gr&uacute;pa a mhol "policy of education and depoliticisation" a dh&eacute;anamh ar dt&uacute;s.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom beag&aacute;in&iacute;n eile a chloiste&aacute;il uathu faoi sin.  C&eacute;ard at&aacute; i gceist acu?  Ar g&aacute; an Acht a dh&eacute;anamh ar dt&uacute;s ionas go mbainfeadh s&eacute; an pholait&iacute;ocht as an gceist?  Bh&iacute; tuairim eile ag Ms Ervine.  S&iacute;lim gurb &eacute; sin cro&iacute; na ceiste anseo.  M&aacute;s f&eacute;idir linn oibri&uacute; ar sin, b'fh&eacute;idir go rachadh an cheist seo ar aghaidh.  Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe ar&iacute;s faoi teacht isteach.</p></speech>

N&iacute; bhaineann s&eacute; le haon aicme, aon reiligi&uacute;n n&oacute; aon phairt&iacute; polaiti&uacute;il ar an oil&eacute;an seo.  N&iacute; ch&oacute;ir go mbainfeadh aon teanga riamh le haon cheann acu sin.  Dhein m'athair staid&eacute;ar sa leabhar <i>Hidden Ulster</i> ar an ceangal agus an cur chuige a bh&iacute; ag an pobal Preispit&eacute;ireach ar an oile&aacute;n seo i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Ba l&eacute;ir &oacute;n staid&eacute;ar sin gur minic go raibh na Preispit&eacute;irigh chun tosaigh ar an gcuid eile den t&iacute;r maidir le cosaint a dh&eacute;anamh ar an teanga nuair a bh&iacute; s&iacute; faoi bhr&uacute;.

Bh&iacute; an cruinni&uacute; iontach suimi&uacute;il agus t&aacute;imid f&iacute;or-bhu&iacute;och don choiste go l&eacute;ir.  We are very grateful for the invitation to address the committee and for all the comments that have been made.</p><p>  The Irish language Act is an attempt to depoliticise the Irish language; it is about removing it from the political arena and placing it in the administrative arena.  We have seen that happen in the North around the implementation of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.  The British Government in the Good Friday Agreement gave a commitment that it would look at that and it subsequently ratified the charter.  When that was first introduced, there was a great deal of negative reaction from some quarters, with some people saying they would not implement the charter.  Legal advice was sought and it was made clear that the charter had to be implemented and that it would bring benefits, clarifying the duties of civil servants and public bodies.  It contributed to a more peaceful and forward looking society and the charter is now implemented to a certain degree.</p><p>  The difficult with the charter ironically is that those who are opposed to an Irish language Act say that because we have the charter, we do not need anything else.  These are the same people who at one stage said they would not implement the charter.  There can be a progression in people's minds as long as the understanding is there that continual delay is not an option.</p><p>  One of the weaknesses of the charter is that it is not enforceable through the courts, although it has given a level of awareness of and status to the Irish language.  Much of the preparatory work, therefore, for an Irish language Act is already in place through the implementation and introduction of the charter.  All language legislation is compensation for damage that has been done to a language.  Dominant languages do not have legislation.  Although legislation cannot be a panacea for the needs of a language, there is no language that has gone from being in a disadvantaged and threatened position to being significantly restored without legislation.  The Irish language Act is a crucial piece of the jigsaw when it comes to the promotion of the Irish language.  It will create space for the language within all sections of society.</p><p>  We have heard a number of issues brought up today.  Those who are favourable to the language, particularly in the North where we do not have domestic protection for the language, can continue to deal with those issues on a piecemeal basis, which we have done and will do, but that is not a solution.  Pobal deals today with the same issues that were coming up 14 years ago.  We can and will continue to do that for as long as we are funded and are able to do it.  An Irish language Act would save so much time and frustration and difficulty for ordinary Irish speakers</p><p>  It is extremely important a timescale is put in place for a strong, comprehensive, rights-based Irish language Act.  If it was to be introduced within a three year timescale, much of the preparatory work, the educational work and awareness work could be undertaken straight away and the ongoing work could continue.</p><p>  The Act should make the Irish language an official language in the North.  It should create a broad range of guaranteed rights and services within a wide range of areas, such as in the courts, where it is currently illegal to speak or write Irish.  It is the only language that is effectively banned from use in the courts.  There should be a framework for the Irish language in the courts, in education, in the public services, in the political institutions and in the media.  There must be a strong enforcement and implementation mechanism and we suggest it should resemble the enforcement mechanism in the South and in other countries, with a language commissioner with strong duties and rights.  We are very supportive of the role of Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in in that field.</p><p>  Educational and awareness raising work is ongoing.  I want to link that to the issue of core funding for the language organisations.  We are one of the key organisations that has spearheaded the issues around legislation, monitoring, research and community rights.  We were instrumental in the work by the Committee on the Administration of Justice published on the Irish language recently.  Niall &Oacute; Cathain referred earlier to the support we enjoy from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission but our funding for that work ends on 30 June.  That will be the fifth time our funding has ended and we have been forced to issue redundancy notices to our very small team of workers.  It is difficult for the core funded organisations to continue on this basis.  We must deal with this ongoing issue with Foras na Gaeilge arising from the North-South Ministerial Council so I support Aod&aacute;n Mac P&oacute;il&iacute;n's comments on that.</p><p>  We would ask the committee to press for a timescale for the implementation of a comprehensive, rights-based Irish language Act, and for pro-active action on education and awareness raising work in the light of that commitment on an agreed timescale.  If the timescale is not agreed before, we are no further along, and we have already waited seven years for the commitment made at St. Andrews to be fulfilled.  We support and congratulate the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North for the steps it has taken on a strategy for the North and supporting an Irish language Act.  That standing has not been without difficulty for the Department and Minister and the support of this committee would be very important for that.</p></speech>

That is my understanding and I have no inside track on that.  I believe that the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is working through a series of discussions and working through the Assembly process.  Our difficulty is that there is no guarantee of Assembly agreement on that strategy.  Some very negative comments have been made.  As onlookers in that process, we are supportive of a strategy but we are concerned about its eventual implementation.  That is something that we would be concerned about with an Irish language act too.  It is absolutely true and right that the ultimate commitment to enact legislation was given by the British Government in the St. Andrew's agreement.  That is an international treaty which places a binding obligation on the government, which it must fulfil.  However, we do not want to continue to have what we have had to date, that is, to-ing and fro-ing between the Assembly and Westminster.  Westminster must accept its responsibility and must act.  I thank the committee for its support in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1064" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aod&aacute;n Mac P&oacute;il&iacute;n" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013061300013#N00400"><p>I will follow on from what Ms Muller has said, but from a slightly different angle.  Our understanding is that some time in the summer a new version of the strategy will be published.  Consultations are taking place at the moment with different Departments in terms of the implications.  This second version of the draft strategy will then have to go to the Executive for consideration because this is an Executive strategy rather than in internal departmental strategy.  Once it goes to the Executive it will be eviscerated because an Irish language strategy or an Irish language act has the same effect on the politics of Northern Ireland as taking down the Union flag from City Hall.  This is what we are facing into.</p><p>  I must point out that I praised the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure for being the first institution in Northern Ireland to develop an Irish language strategy, but there are flaws in it.  One of the flaws is the lack of consideration of the cross-community perspective and the other one is the fact that a lot of the strategy is predicated on an Irish language act but such an act is not going to happen.  We cannot wait to develop a strategy until a language act is in place.  The actions outlined in one and a half chapters of the strategy require an Irish language act in order to be implemented.  This is a real problem.</p><p>  My analysis is that it is something that the Minister cannot do because the Minister has to pursue both the language act and the strategy but these will not happen within the same time scale.  That is why I am proposing a plan B.  The Minister cannot make progress because she is being pulled in two different directions.  More flexibility is required.  There are also genuine flaws in the strategy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> its interpretation of what language planning involves.  I do not think the strategy takes that issue on board fully.  </p><p>  Another issue of concern is the general perception of the language situation in Northern Ireland.  We have a very strong, coherent and fairly effective language revival movement or community.  I started learning Irish in 1968 and the language has never been as healthy as it is now.  I used to know every Irish speaker in Belfast but now, every day, I meet new speakers whom I have not met before.  It is blooming.  I wish to put this in the political and social context.  In the last census, 10.6% of the population claimed a knowledge of the Irish language.  As committee members will know, if one has only a tiny bit of Irish, one cannot say one has no knowledge of the language.  In other words, there is a spectrum of knowledge there.  We have no analysis of where people are in terms of fluency.  The figures are useless in that regard but they are useful in one way because they allow for a sectarian analysis.  In that context, 21% of Catholics claim to have a knowledge of Irish, while only 1% of Protestants do.  Given the high correlation between political identity and religious identity in Northern Ireland, that basically means what we all know anyway, namely that the language is associated with, in both fact and public perception, the Catholic/Nationalist community.  I published P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Snodaigh's important book, <i>Hidden Ulster, Protestants and the Irish Language, </i>which was the first major study of the issue of Protestant Irish language identity, which is not necessarily a political identity.  It was a very important book which has been followed up by books by Rory Blaney on the Presbyterian tradition and Dr. Ian Malcolm, among others.  </p><p>  There is a big divide in terms of knowledge of Irish between the two communities.  The situation in the North cannot be compared to that in the South.  Everybody in the South is taught Irish - possibly badly - for 14 years.  Everybody in the South has had exposure to Irish and if they see the word t-e-a-c-h, they know it might mean teach - the Irish word for house - as opposed to teach.  In Northern Ireland hardly anybody studies Irish at school and then, generally speaking, unless they are attending an Irish-medium school, they only study it at second level.  It is almost entirely confined to the Catholic population and the Catholic school system and even then, it is not universal.  The level of exposure to Irish through the education system is massively different.  There are two major differences between the two societies.  First, there is the fact that the language is deeply divisive along the political/religious identity spectrum and second, very few people in the North have had exposure to it.  We have a very vibrant but very small Irish language community.</p><p>  I was fascinated by the discussion earlier between Deputies Feighan, Flanagan and Senator Brennan from which I noted an ambivalence but also a deep sense of goodwill towards the language.  They suggested that everybody loves the language but hated having to study it at school.  I know that does not apply to everybody, but it certainly applies to many.  That is very different to the situation in Northern Ireland.  The hostility towards the language in the Republic cannot be compared to the hostility in Northern Ireland.  The hostility in the South comes from some bad experiences at school but in the North, the hostility comes from a sense that the language is designed to undercut the society.  That is the perception and that is what we have to work against.  However, campaigning for an Irish language act will intensify that hostility.  If we had an act in place, it would make the situation better.  Once there is a support structure in place - Jim's analysis is totally correct in this regard - the Unionist parties will oppose it initially, then learn to live with it and discover that the sky does not fall.  If we had a good Irish language act it would be very good for our society.  However, getting there could do an awful lot of damage.  I do not know how we will deal with that dilemma.  We must be very careful because there is no simplistic answer to this.  Well, actually, there is - Westminster should pass an Irish language act.  If an Irish language act emanated from Westminster, everything would be far better.  Failing that, it will be a hot potato that will make the whole issue of the Irish language worse than it currently is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1065" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Ervine" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013061300013#N00500"><p>As a member of the Protestant/Unionist community, I have been embarrassed many times over the years by the behaviour of people who claim to represent me and my community because they do not represent me when they sit down and say "No, no, no" to everything and when they block moves that I consider to be positive.  I do not want committee members to presume I will take a negative stance on this issue and that I will adopt the predictable stance of a Unionist politician and say that my community does not want an Irish language act because the other community does.</p> <p>I am certainly not coming from that position.  The lovely thing about my job is that I am working every day with many people from the Protestant community who would be in agreement with me, not with what the politicians say.  The reality is that I cannot be 100% positive about the outcome should the Irish language proposal go ahead.  That is not how it is.  The Unionist community will not say it is wonderful.  Some people will be happy with it because they are very interested in the Irish language, others will be neutral and will not care but for many others, it will be another "flag" issue.  That is what worries me.  Everybody present at this meeting is here because he or she cares about the language and wants a positive outcome for it, which I certainly do.  If this proposal was to be brought forward tomorrow, it could potentially be very harmful.  I agree that people have waited a long time and are impatient, which I understand - the proposed legislation should be progressed - but the issue is how to bring this about.  It should be brought about in a sensitive and sensible way that acknowledges that some people are frightened by it and that some are very hostile to it.  They need to be told in layman's, not academic, terms what the proposed legislation, when enacted, will mean for them and their community in order that other political parties cannot use it for political gain.  If people understand they can accept or reject the provisions based on what is included in the proposed legislation, it will be a period of education.  A great deal of work will need to be done to bring the Irish language to the Protestant community in a way that will make it more neutral for them.</p><p> It is a fact that 100 years ago the Presbyterians led the way in the promotion of the Irish language.  There are good reasons people ended up rejecting the language.  Its politicising alienated people from it.  There is a particular Republican dissident group which uses the Irish language as its name.  I know a person who went to speak to it in Irish and did not have a word of the language.  That is an example of the language being used in a negative and political way; I want to see it used in a positive way to bring in both communities.  It should not be used to alienate, annoy or torture people.</p></speech>

Without question, it has been a very positive experience for our community, as well as education through the medium of the Irish language.  There are other positive steps such as the L&iacute;ofa campaign and the strategy, which without the legislation will be difficult to implement.  There has been a real benefit to our community and many others across the North.</p><p>  I appreciate the point Ms Ervine makes on the impact of the Irish language on the work she does.  She is doing great work in a very challenging environment, but her concerns are not mutually exclusive to bringing forward the legislation.  It is a matter of preparation and setting a date for its implementation and then dealing with all of the issues Ms Ervine raised.  It is a pity we have squandered the past 15 years through the special support programme with a constant refusal to see this as an issue.  I would like the committee to communicate with the SEUPB as this would be of great help.  It would also help in dealing with the issues Ms Ervine has outlined.  There must be certainty, as nothing will focus the mind of everyone concerned more than the setting of a date for implementation of the legislation.  All efforts must be brought to bear to put pressure on Westminster such as those of European, American or international bodies putting pressure on it to bring forward a Bill.  A twin-track approach must bw taken of promoting the language, in addition to promoting cultural tolerance and understanding, which will be important elements in enacting the legislation.</p><p>  I certainly reiterate the need for core funding, as outlined by Mr. P&oacute;ilin.  Pobal has done invaluable work on the proposed legislation on the Irish language.  I do not know where we would be without it.  I would hate to see the Irish language movement in the North without an organisation such as Pobal to fight for it.</p><p>  On the use of the Irish language by dissidents who politicise it, dissidents use English more than Irish.  There is an issue with perception.  I raised a point on the Equality Commission which puts too much store on perception.  When somebody has an objection to the language and is opposed to it, it is either an irrational fear of it that needs to be dealt with or, possibly, bigotry.  These are real issues that need to be dealt with.  We must address them, as opposed to not promoting language equality, which is most important.</p></speech>

The meeting has been invaluable, as members have been given an insight into where the challenges lie.  There are two aspects to the solution - the importance of reaching a solution in a timely fashion and also the issue of how to allow people the space and time to deliberate without damaging the language.  The delegates and members have come up with proposals, on which we should formally follow up.  We have written formally to the SEUPB inviting it to appear before the committee; no doubt members will be able to make a direct intervention on behalf of the delegates.  </p><p>  On the second issue relating to the broadcasting fund, subject to the agreement of members, we can write formally to the Taoiseach who has continual engagement with the British Prime Minister.

An across-the-board rather than a local approach is needed because this is not a local issue.  The joint committee's letter to the Special EU Programmes Body should highlight the need to address this issue across the project area, namely, the Six Counties and six Border counties.  The most appropriate organisation for dealing with the issue is Foras na Gaeilge, which is a cross-Border body.  If this issue is not highlighted in the letter, the Special EU Programmes Body will bounce back a letter stating it does not have a problem as it is completely open to the Irish language.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding this, we should be conscious of groups such as Gl&oacute;r na nGael and Coiste C&eacute;im Aniar in my parish of Rosguill.  If Gl&oacute;r na nGael believes Foras na Gaeilge, an Irish language umbrella group, has expertise in accounting and finance and would be able to provide prudent financial management, the committee will certainly convey that message.</p></speech>

It is important that the next round of funding is allocated based on the needs of the area.  Often, programmes are put together first and communities subsequently try to match their needs to them.  It is important at this stage to include needs in the programme as this would make it easier to process applications.</p></speech>

On the issue of the North-South Ministerial Council and possible cutbacks in funding for representative groups in Northern Ireland, the appropriate persons for the joint committee to contact are the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, and the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n.  I am aware that funding has been extended until the end of this year and deliberations and negotiations are set to continue.  I propose that the joint committee formally write to the Ministers on the issue.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The joint committee tries as best it can to promote itself as an honest broker in terms of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are a little handicapped in this respect as we do not have Unionist representation.  However, the absence of Unionist representatives makes us more conscious of the need to strike a balance.  What we can offer to the groups before us is constant involvement and engagement.  Significant dialogue appears to be needed to achieve the outcome our guests are seeking.  If the committee can assist in this conversation, those present should feel free to contact us as part of their deliberations.  As Mr. Mac P&oacute;il&iacute;n pointed out, his organisation is meeting increasing numbers of Gaelgeoir&iacute; and Irish language groups.</p></speech>

The First Minister, Deputy First Minister and British Prime Minister, who also have a duty in this regard, should be circulated with the letter.  The primary duty for an Irish language Act lies with the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, because they signed the Agreement.  It is their responsibility, even if the duty for implementing the legislation falls on the Assembly.</p></speech>

It is intended that in the next week or two the joint committee will consider adopting a report on this matter under the stewardship of Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick who has kindly volunteered to be the rapporteur for the committee on this subject.

We also thank Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor for her introduction to the committee.  We are grateful for this opportunity to have the voice of the children of Ireland heard in the report on obesity that is about to be published.</p><p>  I will begin by contextualising our role in childhood overweight and obesity.  I am a paediatrician and the clinical lead on the W82GO! childhood obesity programme which was established eight years ago by a group of committed, enthusiastic health care professionals in Temple Street Children's University Hospital.  The W82GO! programme, including my position as clinical lead, is funded entirely by the Temple Street fund-raising arm, Children's Fund for Health, and a research grant awarded to one of our team members by the Health Research Board.  When the grant expires the service, the only one of its kind in Ireland, will be forced to cease.  We have joined forces with the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute in the belief that, together and with the support of the Oireachtas, we can address the obesity catastrophe with the urgency it deserves.  </p><p>  I propose to provide some facts and figures on childhood obesity.  Recent figures show that 31.8 % of Irish seven year olds are either overweight or obese.  This accounts for more than one in four of our schoolchildren, which translates as 100,000 children who are obese and 300,000 who are overweight.  The problem begins in childhood and is beginning earlier and earlier.  Currently, 6% of three year olds are obese and the figure increases to 10% among lower socioeconomic groups.  </p><p>  Ireland ranks fifth highest among 27 European Union countries in terms of the incidence of childhood obesity.  As with many other things, childhood obesity disproportionately impacts on lower socioeconomic groups.  This fact must be considered when addressing potential solutions.  Given the catchment area of Temple Street, the children's hospital probably deals with the largest proportion of children in the lowest socioeconomic group of any hospital in the country.  The position in respect of childhood obesity is becoming steadily worse and is not stabilising in any way.  Moreover, we know that 70% of obese children will become obese adults.</p><p>  With regard to co-morbidities, the essential and extremely worrying fact is that children are already showing the ill-effects of overweight and obesity in childhood.  We do not wait for them to become adults because they are already in trouble.  Unless these children are provided with the treatment they need when they need it as a matter of extreme urgency, they will have a shorter life expectancy than their parents.  Having worked for so long to achieve longer life expectancy, we are set to reverse this achievement by choosing to do nothing. </p><p>  Over the past five years, the W82GO! team has collected data on the co-morbidities in children who have attended for treatment.  By co-morbidity we mean conditions with which the children suffer and which are related to their obesity.  We found that 70% of the children in question, who are aged under 15 years, have musculoskeletal problems; 40% have high cholesterol levels; 50% have high blood sugar and insulin levels, which means they are about to develop early type 2 diabetes mellitus; and 30% have breathing problems.  It is a matter of grave concern that in respect of the mental health of these children and young people, we found that 60% reported psychological difficulties such as poor self-esteem and depression, with 11% reporting severe bullying.  If left untreated, these children will become adults who are obese, in whom the complications of obesity such as stroke, heart disease, infertility and increased risk of multiple cancers are well recognised.  This possibility can be prevented.</p><p>  As with all health issues, tackling childhood obesity has cost implications and we are aware of the cost concerns that arise.  The allocation of funding to the pandemic of childhood obesity is patchy and wholly inadequate.  I do not believe any official funding is provided for childhood obesity.  The cost of adult obesity to the State is in excess of &euro;1 billion per annum.  This cost will continue to rise unless childhood obesity is addressed.</p><p>  If left untreated, the average child who is obese, of whom there are 100,000 in Ireland, will cost in the region of &euro;5,000 per year as a result of direct treatment for co-morbidities, in other words, attending for various medical opinions, surgery and other interventions arising directly from their obesity.  Addressing the problem reduces costs and produces savings.  Service provision for the treatment of childhood obesity is urgently required. </p><p>  We sometimes skirt around the fact that childhood obesity is a highly complex issue.  If the problem is not addressed as a matter of extreme urgency, it will have far-reaching consequences for the children in question, their families, future generations and a health care system that is already under massive pressure.  </p> <p>We must recognise that there are multiple stakeholders involved in the epidemic and all of these must share the responsibility when it comes to treatment.  Stakeholders such as the food industry and advertising agencies need to be encouraged by Government to play a role.  Additionally, resources such as education which have such wide-arching listenership in childhood and have such great influence on our children need to be facilitated to play their part in addressing the issue.  We are aware that alone we cannot tackle this, we need everybody on board.  </p><p> Adult studies and experience show that sustainable weight reduction is extremely difficult in adults who are obese but data so far available indicate that the right programme can in fact achieve sustainable weight reduction and improved cardio metabolic health in children. </p><p> A gap analysis conducted by the INDI showed that in spite of almost one in four of our children being overweight or obese, 88% of these children and their families do not have access to an overweight or obesity treatment programme.  They do not even have access to being measured to find out whether they are obese or overweight.  There is one acute hospital based programme, our W82GO! programme, in Temple Street.  It is research grant funded and has a waiting list of 12 months which is growing daily.  We know that children on these waiting lists get worse and that co-morbidities increase.  Treatment needs to be available for all children when they need it and where they need it.  Evidence shows that the earlier the treatment, the more likely it is to be successful.</p><p> The children of Ireland urgently require treatment programmes at community level to treat overweight and ultimately prevent it and in the hospital setting where specialised multi-disciplinary treatment is available to address the current crisis of childhood obesity and its co-morbidities.  We know that a piecemeal approach to a complex problem of this size will not work.  An integrated, strategic approach is required so that the same evidence based, cost-effective care which has been carefully evaluated is delivered to all children in the community who need it and even more urgently to the 100,000 children with co-morbidities who cannot afford to wait a year for specialised hospital care.  </p><p> My colleagues will now present two such programmes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1096" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma Ball" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061300004#E00200"><p>As Dr. Sinead Murphy has mentioned already, a gap analysis carried out by the INDI in March 2013 showed that 88% of the country has no access to a community based obesity treatment programme for children and their families.  While children who are obese can be referred for individual dietetic consultation, this service is not available in all parts of the country.  We do however have programmes developed in the community which reflect evidence and best practice, national and international.  I shall provide an outline of the Up4it! programme which is a cross-Border prevention and management childhood obesity programme led out by Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, and funded as part of INTERREG IVA funding.   HSE West - Letterkenny, Youth and Family Services and HSE - Dublin north east, Cavan and Monaghan and the Border Counties Childcare Network, BCCN, were two pilot sites in Republic of Ireland with a further two sites in Northern Ireland.  This was a multi-disciplinary programme with nutrition, physical activity, emotional well being and behavioural change components.  There was a healthy lifestyles for families, prevention programme, with a child under five years.  It was an eight week programme with two follow-up sessions at week 16 and week 36.  There was also the Making a Difference management programme for families with an overweight-obese child aged eight to 11 years.  This was a 12 weeks programme and had four follow-up sessions up to 48 weeks.  Both parent and child attended the management programme.  The programmes were designed to suit the families' needs, were skills based, for example, had cooking components, food labelling, shopping and were delivered in local community settings.  More than 585 families participated over two years from 2011-2013.  For the management programmes, 61% of the referrals to the programme were classified as either self referrals, community or voluntary group referrals, with 41% of participants referred by nursing staff, primary care teams or general practitioners.  The programmes were fully evaluated by CAWT.  Data analysis was completed by the Northern Ireland Centre for Food and Health at the University of Ulster.  Its analysis of 146 children enrolled to management programme during quarter three to quarter 5 of the CAWT project showed statistically significant reductions in both body mass index, BMI z score and waist circumference z score levels over the course of programme and follow-up sessions to 48 weeks which showed a longer-term sustained weight change.  There were also statistically significant improvements in their perceptions of their body image over the course of the programme and all other targets set at the beginning of the project were achieved.  To see the human benefits of investing now and for the future of our children, we will let the words of our patients speak for themselves.  The following quote is from a 12 year old girl who attended the programme in Cavan-Monaghan:<blockquote><br />What I liked was finding out what was wrong with my diet.  I was eating too much of everything; not eating enough fruit and vegetables and eating too much junk like all children my age!  I liked knowing how to fix my diet and the dietitians helped with that.  Since completing the UP4IT! programme, I have joined the athletics club but before the programme I would never have wanted to do anything like this.  I am also playing indoor soccer and thinking of joining the local GAA club.  My diet and the family's diet is also healthier.<i></i></blockquote>From an effective treatment view a community programme costs approximately &euro;600 per family per year based on 15 families per programme.  For every family going through the programme there is a multiplier of beneficial effect.  The positive effects of the psychology, nutrition and physical activity affects others in the family.  So taking the average family of two adults and two children, the actual cost is &euro;150 per person. This represents very little investment for a huge potential saving in both human and monetary terms.</p><p>  The reality is that even though we have evidence-based, best practice programmes on our doorstep, they are not being sustained.  The Up4it! CAWT funding ended in March 2013.  While there are small pockets of local funding being provided in a number of locations throughout the country to promote obesity programmes there is no dedicated, sustained funding to tackle this issue.  In our local area, HSE west in Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim is exploring ways to sustain the project using a community development approach partnered with primary care teams but we urgently need for the Department of Health and the HSE to commit to resourcing the roll-out of successful models of best practice in the community and to ensure these programmes are incorporated into the policy document.</p><p>  In Northern Ireland the project's programmes, CAWT, have been extended for a further one year delivery by the Public Health Agency while it puts in place in place its longer-term plans. The project's programme approach and outcomes will however shape the Public Health Agency's future specification for children's programmes.</p></speech>

To put that into context, the average 9 year old child in Ireland weighs 34 kg, 5 stone 5 lbs.  The average nine year old attending our clinic is 55 kg, 8 stone 9 lbs.  We have seen over 400 children to date and as of today there are 150 children on the waiting list.  These children have the greatest need for urgent holistic care.  As outlined by Dr. Murphy they have myriad physical and mental health complications.  We know from other EU experiences they are most effectively managed as outpatients of a paediatric hospital where they have access to the multiple specialties they require.  More than 40% are from deprived to severely deprived areas, therefore, we see at first hand the effects of inequality on health outcomes.</p><p>  Our patients range from 18 months to 16 years old and we receive referrals for specialist management from all over Ireland.  From a study of 196 children who attended our treatment programme we have seen a significant reduction in obesity in line with best practice internationally.  The obesity levels of children on our waiting list however continue to rise.</p><p>  The W82GO! programme is delivered in the evening as a family-based group programme and uses facilities in Temple Street and in a nearby school.   The group programme is delivered to children aged six to 12 years and aged 12 to 16 years.  For children who are under six or who are not appropriate for the group programme, we see them on an outpatient basis.   Unfortunately, due to the HSE staff embargo this service has had to be cut back significantly.</p><p>  The treatment aims to improve nutrition, improve fitness, increase physical activity levels, improve emotional well-being and family functioning.  We deliver educational and practical sessions to improve health literacy and empower families to make healthy lifestyle choices.  Families learn how to shop and to read food labels. </p><p>  At a European Union level it is clear that the Irish State is not meeting its duty of care to its children.  Denmark, a country with a population of 5.5 million people, has an annual spend in the region of &euro;10 million on childhood obesity treatment whereas in Ireland currently the spend on childhood obesity treatment is zero.  Unfortunately, treating the problems of childhood obesity, as outlined by Dr. Murphy, has a cost.  Approximately &euro;5,000 per child is the current cost of treating co-morbidities such as breathing problems, or surgical orthopaedic issues.</p> <p>We know from UK data that if we invest even a small amount - the W82GO! programme costs &euro;600 per patient per year and is cost effective - we can reduce the burden of chronic disease and increase life expectancy.  However, our team has struggled to meet demand.  We have exhausted attempts to work smarter, reconfigured clinics and our programme and introduced technology as an adjunct to treatment to try to meet service demand.  We regularly receive requests from practitioners all over the country to provide training and have linked with the HSE in regard to a proposed training programme.  We would be delighted to share our experience.  However, without funding support, it is likely this recommendation from the obesity task force will not be met.</p><p> As outlined by Dr. Murphy, our programme has been funded until the end of the year by the fund raising arm of Temple Street hospital.  Our team works one day a week on this issue and we are all attached to other teams and do not work full time on it.  The majority of parents we meet are trying their best to improve their children's health, but often they do not have the resources to do this effectively.  They are often confused about the messages they receive on health.  For example, when one parent was asked what type of milk her child was drinking for calcium, she replied that she gave her a bar of chocolate daily because there was &quot;a glass and a half of milk&quot; in every bar.</p><p> I would like to focus attention on one girl who presented to our service at 13 years of age.  She was morbidly obese, had signs of fatty liver disease, had high cholesterol and was pre-diabetic.  She did very well through treatment, losing 15 kg and reversing her pre-diabetic condition.  We received a letter from another patient recently stating:<blockquote>My love for food had brought my weight to an all time high when I became a teenager and as a result, my self-esteem had gone down the drain. Growing up as an obese teenager had affected me in so many ways both physically and mentally.  I was barely able to walk to school comfortably and I often lacked concentration at school.  Now I feel completely transformed in ways that are indescribable - I'm now able to run and walk up and down the stairs and I now wear clothes that I could only dream of wearing before and this has made me a more confident person than I was prior to starting the program.</blockquote>We do not need to waste more time finding out what we need to do.  We already know what we need to do.  We need a concerted effort to provide treatment for those children who desperately need care.  Recently the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, outlined the Irish Presidency's call for an EU action plan on childhood obesity, stating the initiative reflected the importance that he and his colleagues attached to the issue of childhood obesity.  I am delighted that the Minister and all members of the committee consider this issue important enough to call for pan-European action.  There is no doubt that this epidemic presents the most challenging threat to child and population health in the 21st century.  However, in all honesty, the Minister's statement rings like a soundbite of rhetoric.  We recommend that annual funding from the Department of Health and-or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs be used for the treatment of children who are clinically obese and that sustainable Government funding for the evidence-based Temple Street Children's University Hospital W82GO! programme be secured.</p></speech>

It is clear that early childhood is a critical time in assessing the beginning of the movement towards obesity.  The figures and statistics provided are startling, particularly the fact that Ireland is the fifth worst of the 27 EU countries and that one in four of our schoolgoing children is either overweight or obese.  This has rightly been described as an epidemic which is in urgent need of attention.  Our attention must be given to the fact that currently there is no treatment.  I commend the Temple Street fundraising committee for the work it is doing voluntarily to tackle this issue.  Am I correct in my understanding that by the end of this year no funds will remain to deal with it?  That is a concern.</p><p>  No single initiative will solve this problem.  We must look at a number of steps to tackle it such as physical activity, healthy eating, education of both educators and parents, marketing and the media.  As legislators, we must embrace the issue and give it the priority it deserves.  Very little, however, can be done without funding.  The delegates have cited Denmark as a country of a similar size to ours.  It is spending &euro;10 million per annum in this area.  If the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs were to ring-fence &euro;10 million a year to deal with the issue here, would that be adequate to tackle the problem we are facing?  If we do not invest this money, could the problem end up costing us &euro;1 billion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061300005#F00400"><p>I join the Vice Chairman and my colleagues in welcoming our guests.  I acknowledge the useful and important audiovisual presentation made recently in the AV room in which many of those present participated and which was organised by Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor.  The testimony of the young women who presented their stories - the young girl from Carrickmacross in my constituency and the other young woman in her teens whose testimony has been mentioned again this morning - was powerful.  The more people who hear their testimony the better.</p><p>  The timing of this discussion is hugely important, not only in the context of the committee addressing the issue.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, as rapporteur, is dealing with the preparation of the committee's report.  I welcome this, but it is regrettable that we have not had an opportunity heretofore to hear these relevant voices.  The timing is also hugely important in the context of the upcoming budget.  As the date of the budget is being brought forward to October, this is a key and crucial time to impact on the Department of Health's proposals for health funding in 2014.  This is not just about influencing our report but also about flagging to the Minister the importance of providing continued support.  The support is not coming from the Department, but it is important that it take responsibility for funding the programme addressed by the Temple Street initiative which is the only programme addressing the issue of clinically obese children.</p><p>  I am mindful of and more familiar with the community aspect of this issue.  Community supported projects such as the CAWT supported Up4It project need to be rolled out universally.  We will never get beyond the top of the iceberg unless we build in necessary supports.  This comes down to the provision of resources.  We need a bold and definite commitment on the part of lead voices in political life if we are to see a reversal of the trend outlined.  We must recognise that if we do not provide the resources, we will build up a requirement for significant and ever more limited public funding in the future.  Provision of resources to tackle this issue will result in a huge saving in the future.</p><p>  I have a few questions about the statistics cited by Dr. Murphy.  In terms of the committee's engagement with the Minister and its opportunity to impact on the real decision makers, we are just advocates, not a decision-making body.</p> <p>Dr. Murphy quoted recent figures indicating that 31.8% of Irish seven year olds were either overweight or obese.  She is talking about one in four children in that instance.  On what are we basing that information?  What is the information flow?  What is its source?  The answers to these questions could give us certainty in referencing the information provided.</p><p> Reference was made to one hospital based programme, but Temple Street Children's University Hospital simply cannot address all of the needs identified.  That is simply not within its gift.  The programme must be replicated in other settings.  The panel might wish to elaborate on that issue.  Has there been outreach work done in other hospital settings that might be able to replicate what the panel has imaginatively and courageously spearheaded at Temple Street hospital?</p><p> I have acknowledged the Up4It! programme and the correspondence received from a young woman in Carrickmacross who said we urgently needed the Department and the HSE to commit to resourcing the rolling out of a model of best practice in the community.  She stated this was crucial because if we were to arrest the situation leading to clinically obesity, we had to try to address it at a far earlier stage.  I see this as crucial.</p><p> I refer to the points made in Ms Flanagan's closing appeal which we have only in text.  Perhaps she might wish to elaborate on behalf of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute.  She referred to co-ordinated and sustained funding of an evidence-based community treatment programme such as Up4It!  It has supported co-operation and working together.  I know how difficult it is to get the Department to take up this issue in current economic times.  Has Ms Flanagan had the opportunity to present her case directly to it?  Can she give us an insight into the responses she may have received?  Where does she envisage the person who fills the national post for obesity management working within the current HSE and Department structures?  Can she provide some sense of this?</p><p> Reference was made to referral pathways and consistency in the delivery of treatment services.  To what extent are general practitioners who presumably are at the beginning or the early stages of the referral pathway tuned in?  Is there sufficient awareness of what is happening in terms of Up4It! and other programmes and ultimately the Temple Street operation?  Do GPs across the board have knowledge of and are they committed to all that the panel is arguing for?  I wish the panel every success.</p></speech>

Perhaps some of our colleagues who do not work in the health service might have missed the nuance of it.  There is no statutory funding available for the provision of the obesity service at Temple Street hospital.  It was set up completely through voluntary fundraising and moneys raised for research resources.  I know what the answer will be, but this is the most profound point that must be made today because it underlines how remarkably lacking in seriousness the service provision part of the health service is in tacking this problem.  Has any consultant been appointed in paediatrics or paediatric endocrinology with a special interest in obesity who is funded or has a clinic devoted to the needs of children with weight problems?  I have an ancillary question, although it may not be a fair to catch Dr. Murphy with it on the hop.  Does she have any idea of the number of paediatric specialists or paediatric endocrinologists per head of population in Ireland compared to the European averages?  I imagine it is rather low.  I know in the case of paediatric surgeons that the numbers are absurdly at the bottom of the charts.</p><p>  My final question is more of a medical or psychiatric question.  Does Dr. Murphy believe there has been a subtle cultural effect as a result of the probably misguided focus on the causes of eating disorders in the previous medical generation in making parents afraid to talk about weight, weigh their children or raise concerns about issues to do with being overweight?  People probably erroneously believed one could take a psychiatrically or mentally healthy child and convert him or her into an anorexic by giving him or her a focus on such issues.</p><p>  I may have to step away for a while to go to the Seanad and apologise if I do not hear the reply in person.  I hope the panel will not take it as disrespect.  I will be coming back to hear it later.</p></speech>

He heard it exactly and clearly.  There is no funding available.  It is entirely from research funding, that is, from a grant given by the Health Research Board to one member of the team.  It is funding various parts of the work, including the technology aspect, and trying to bridge the gap.  It is excellent research.  There is also fundraising by the fundraising body in the hospital at Temple Street.</p><p>  There are no appointments, medical or otherwise, to this programme.  There are no consultants with a special interest in paediatric obesity.  I do it as part of my work.  As Ms O'Malley said, the allocation is, at most, one day a week.  One would need 14 days per week to begin to address this issue at Temple Street hospital alone.  We are grossly under-resourced.  Traditionally, paediatric endocrinologists would have dealt with this issue, but, as Senator John Crown has pointed out, there are approximately 1 million children and six paediatric endocrinologists in the country.  That is the answer.  They are dealing with paediatric diabetes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and all of the thyroid and growth issues.  Clearly, paediatric obesity does not get the time it deserves because there are not enough paediatricians appointed to deal with the issue.  That is clear.</p><p>  Senator John Crown referred to cultural effects.  There are parents who are fearful of mentioning being overweight in case they might turn their children into children with anorexia.  Part of our role as advocates for children and as health advocates is to educate parents in order that they know this is not the case.  I have sat in clinics with a child weighing 120 kg while the mother behind the child was signalling to me not to mention the issue of weight.  When such children go out to play, everyone they meet calls them fat and does not talk to them.  This is not right and it only makes matters worse.  Certainly, we need to be able to address this issue properly and educate parents in order that they know that it is an unhealthy lifestyle.  We need to move the focus from weight onto health.  That is what our programme and the Up4It! programme are about.</p><p>  That brings me to the need to educate GPs.  At Temple Street hospital we run several evening sessions at which we educate GPs and invite them to attend interactive information evenings.  We have made a conscious effort at these sessions in recent years to concentrate on this issue and inform them about our service, although now we almost have to keep them a secret because we cannot deal with the influx of referrals.  We also talk to them about how to talk to their patients.  Should a patient present with something else we would like to be able to encourage GPs to have the time and resources to measure him or her, plot him or her on centile charts and, in a completely non-blaming way, explain to the child and parents that in terms of growth the child is doing well in one direction but in another is not healthy or where we would like him or her to be.  However, one must have an option.  </p><p>  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned drawing the attention of GPs to this problem and whether they were aware of the Up4It! programme.  They are not because it is not available as the funding is not available any more.  It is a difficult issue because, on the one hand, we can educate GPs on how to bring the issue to the attention of parents, but then, on the other, GPs have to explain that the parents and children must go off and deal with it.  There is nowhere to send them to and that is the subject of our appeal to the committee today.</p> <p> It would be fantastic to have a programme manager in charge of childhood obesity services only.  We are aware that is a tall order, but we see it as important that this be a strand of the paediatric programme rather than adult chronic disease or adult diabetes because, unfortunately, otherwise children who have no voice will not be heard.  We feel strongly that it should be part of a paediatric strand.</p><p> With regard to replicating the programme in hospitals and the community, we feel certain that our programmes would work in both places and would welcome the chance to pilot either programme.  The Up4It! programme would work in any community setting and the W82GO! programme would probably work also.  </p><p> With regard to the acute hospital setting, we should probably aim for having a minimum number of four specialised centres to deal with the children with the co-morbidities.  Our evidence shows that the programme works.  We would be very happy if we were resourced to train willing people to provide the service in the centres.  We welcome the support we sense to support programmes.</p><p> In response to the question about from where the data came, it comes from the Growing up in Ireland study from 2011, which is a representative sample.  It probably is accurate.</p><p> We thoroughly agree with Deputy Roberty Troy that we need an input from all angles.  We are aware that we cannot do this on our own.  For sure, we are an important part of it, but we need an input from the food industry and infrastructure.  We see parents and families who know what they need to do, for example, increase activity levels.  They want to walk to school; they know they should walk, but there is no path on which they can walk.  That problem needs to be addressed.  The food industry has a huge role to play.  Schoolteachers play a very important role in children's lives and it is important to educate the educators in order that they can educate the children.  We were asked if &euro;10 million would be enough.  That would be a fantastic and a most welcome start.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Richelle Flanagan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061300007#H00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to make a presentation and its very informed questions.  I reiterate what Dr. Murphy has said.  In respect of the figure of &euro;10 million, that would certainly be a very good start and would allow us to put into action the outcome and evidence based programmes we already have in place.  I read in the newspaper on Tuesday that the Minister had talked about moving to an outcome-focused health system.  We have programmes that show outcomes; therefore, let us start using them to tackle the obesity epidemic.  To put the figure of &euro;10 million in context, it costs approximately &euro;10,000 to see 15 kids; with that money one could have 1,000 programmes and see 15,000 children who were overweight or obese.  There is a multiplier effect because this is a family-based programme; therefore, we are not dealing with the child and the parent but extending into the family - two parents and two children, for example - who also benefit.  The cost per session in the Up4It! programme is the same as in the weight programmes in communities that do not have a multidisciplinary focus.  It is very good value for money, providing outcomes that, as Dr. Murphy has mentioned, have long-term effects.  We know that it is much more difficult to keep the weight off adults with obesity.  It is better to get in early with children.  It would be a very well spent &euro;10 million and most welcome.</p><p>  For some reason people tend to think obesity is not a disease.  It is.  If one's child was suffering from any other disease, one would be at the door hollering to have him or her treated.  It is scandalous that there is no HSE-funded childhood obesity programme in the acute setting for children who have fractures.  It beggars belief.</p><p>  In reply to the question about whether we have had the opportunity to present to the Department of Health, we have been banging on the door about several initiatives with regard to chronic disease and obesity and consider our call is falling on deaf ears.  We want to see some action taken for these children.  The talk is all of prevention and we understand prevention is the best approach, but the clinical services to manage children's obesity have been missed out on.  That is one of the points we want to get across today: kids who are suffering from adult disease in their childhood need treatment.</p><p>  On the question of a national post, we agree that there should be a focus on childhood obesity in the paediatric stream.  We need an overarching national post to deal with obesity in general for adult and paediatric services.  That is part of the problem.  We have a very fragmented and small service; in 88% of the country there is no access to childhood obesity treatment programmes; in 73% there is no access to prevention programmes tailored to meet the needs of obese children.  Part of the problem is that there is no one driving the agenda.</p><p>  With regard to referral pathways from GPs, Ms Ball said GPs were referring children to the Up4It! programme, but as Dr. Murphy said, it is not available.  If it is not in the mind, there is nothing available to which people can refer to.</p><p>  In response to Senator John Crown's question about the misguided focus on eating disorders, <i>safe</i>food has compiled reports to show that parents do not recognise obesity in themselves, let alone in their children.  That is the problem and we have to help them.  This is not blaming people but about putting the supports in place.  That is a very important point.  Research shows that GPs are unsure about how to have the conversation with parents.  We all need to step up to the plate in our clinical services to deal with this issue.  We want Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick to recognise in his report that we would like to see the clinical services integrated with prevention programmes.  The two have to be part of tackling the problem.</p><p>  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned the roll-out of the Core programme.  It would make sense when there is a programme that costs only &euro;600 per family to roll it out.  Similarly, the W82GO! programme is evidence-based and we call on the Government and the HSE to start funding it.  Providing &euro;10 million would be a fantastic start.</p></speech>

That is an interesting figure.  When these families, particularly parents or guardians, are told about their children's health difficulties, what is their reaction?  How do the parents feel about this?  Do they take any responsibility?  Do they feel it is their fault?</p><p>  It is a pity Deputy Robert Troy has left because I wanted to ask him from where he would get the &euro;10 million.  I wonder for the past 15 years when Fianna Fail was in government why it did not bother putting money into these services, but I will not dwell on that issue.</p><p>  I am delighted to see a full panel of women.

We are all experts.  I do not know how many of the delegates are married and have children, or are not married and have children, but I am interested.  I grew up in a poor area, somewhat similar to the Temple Street area which I know very well.  I do not remember seeing any overweight children where I grew up.  I cannot even remember seeing any in school.  People were on small wages, if they had any.  There were no sugary drinks, except perhaps once a month if the lemonade man - that is what he was called - came around and we had a bottle of white lemonade.  There was no such thing as Coca Cola or orange at the time.</p> <p>Sweets cost one penny for ten caramels every Friday, if one was lucky and one's father was working.  I do not remember such a thing as a power drink.  The only power drink we had growing up was water.  The streets were full of children playing soccer, kick the can, rounders and other games.  We had community games and youth clubs where one did not go in and pick up a Wii to play tennis on television; one played in a hall with a bat and ball.  We had soccer clubs.  When my children were in school 20 years ago the principal introduced a healthy eating regime.  She was before her time.  Lunch boxes had no junk in them and there was a tuck shop where one could buy apples and oranges but nothing else. </p><p> Our culture has changed.  We have more money whether we like it or not.  People may not think that is the case, but it is.  Takeaway food has become part of the consumption of an everyday household, particularly in poorer areas.  I recently read a report on the consumption of takeaway foods in poor areas which found that the rate had climbed through the roof.  </p><p> One of my daughters is 20 years of age and is an Irish dancer.  I go to feiseanna, which I hate, and I am flabbergasted to see young children drinking power drinks, such as Red Bull, which they should not be drinking.</p><p> I still have a dinner table where we eat dinner.  Many families do not have one and never sit down and have a conversation together.  Their dinners are eaten on their laps looking at television.  It is about responsibility.  </p><p> I have no problem with money.  If we had it to give to the delegation that would be great, but we need to examine how parenting is done in this country.  Parents need to take responsibility.  I do the shopping every Saturday morning and sometimes I am accompanied by one of my daughters.  I know what I do not put in the basket.  Thank God they know as well.  Unfortunately, not every family is like that.  I am very interested in knowing how parents feel when they are told their children are overweight.</p></speech>

I am delighted they are here because their presence is important.  She made the point that we spend &euro;1 billion on adult obesity and if some of that money could be allocated to childhood obesity it would be a good thing.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne referred to parents.  There is an ideal world, but in reality there are parents who are struggling.  It is very difficult to deal with a child who is overweight.  Sometimes it starts at birth.  A baby can be very large and a mother may not be able to breastfeed or may not be educated on what to do.  It is not just about what children eat around the kitchen table.  It is difficult for working mothers who do not arrive home until 7 p.m. to have to put something on the table.  We should educate them. </p><p>  I wish to address a question to Ms Moroney, who is a paediatric dietitian.  How can her message get to parents?  One delegate said something which really hit me, namely, that sometimes it is not about losing weight.  Any of us who struggles with weight knows how hard it is to lose one pound.  It is very difficult to starve an obese child in order to lose one pound.  The point was made that children's weight should be maintained and they grow into it.  It was a positive message to convey to parents, rather than telling them to starve their children to lose a pound.  I would like the delegates to make that point in a more professional manner than me. </p><p>  A delegate sent me an e-mail which I read.  I understand &euro;5,000 was sought.  I could not believe a group of professionals were begging for &euro;5,000 to roll something out.  The issue is very important and I hope we can get &euro;5,000 to start the summer camp the delegation wants to run to train trainers.  Dr. Murphy mentioned educating the educators.  I come from a teaching background.  We probably need to go into the colleges of education.  I know what goes on. </p><p>  We all know about vitamins, fats and what we should be eating, but we need to examine how we translate that message to children in a classroom.  It is very difficult for a teacher at the top of a classroom who sees two or three children who are very overweight to teach that subject.  Other groups have said children should be weighed in classrooms.  I am totally against that.  Visiting nurses conduct hearing and other tests in schools.  I understand that in the past they weighed children.  Perhaps children could be followed up in a systematic, professional manner.  If there is a problem, let us all deal with it.  It should not be something we never mention.  </p><p>  I would like the delegates to comment on the smartphone application.  I do not know what they are talking about.</p><p>  GPs should mention weight as a matter of course when patients visit them.  I tabled a parliamentary question asking the Minister about the education of our young doctors and saying they should be trained in how to deal with children presenting with weight problems.  </p><p>  We should try to make sure the delegation has a budget and that we deal with our children who have morbidities.  We are constantly discussing cyberbullying, the suicide epidemic and mental health issues.  As somebody who has dealt with children I have seen girls or boys in the classroom who dip their heads and do not want to engage with classes such as swimming or PE.  They do not want to go into a swimming pool in front of their classmates, and I do not blame them.</p></speech>

It was an interesting presentation and it is an interesting issue. The INDI has done super work in bringing this into the public domain.  The evidence would show that no country has managed to reverse the trend of obesity.  This is an international issue.  I accept the delegates' point, but it is a European issue as far as Ireland is concerned. </p><p>  I have a couple of specific points on funding.  At this time of the year we start to get a lot of pre-budget submissions.  Last year we received submissions from TASC and Social Justice Ireland, who suggested the introduction of a fat tax on certain products such as carbonated drinks.  What is the view of the delegation on the introduction of such a tax?  I ask them to comment on ring-fencing the proceeds of such a tax for the provision of services relating to childhood obesity, from the point of view of prevention and the administration of services for children who require clinical services.</p><p>  I refer to the report of the INDI arising out of its proceedings in March relating to carbonated drinks and their availability in schools.</p> <p>For example, we have a tax on plastic bags.  If we are not in a position to ban vending machines, what would the witnesses think of a tax on vending machines and ring-fencing of the proceeds of such a tax for the provision of services to tackle obesity?</p><p> Unfortunately for people on low incomes, cheap food is processed, sugary and fat food.  That is a problem.  I believe the food education children receive in schools is hopelessly inadequate.  In terms of the food pyramid, we should get a grip, because it does not relate to any child's life, particularly when children are trying to deal with complex packaging and processed foods.  Their attitude is that home cooking is warming up a pre-cooked packet of pasta and emptying a jar of sauce on top of it.  We have a real issue with education in schools and it is my belief - I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on this - that we need a revised national programme of education in schools that encompasses both the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

In the past 12 months we have heard what they said in their contributions, but we need action.  We all agree there is an urgent need for obesity treatment services for both adults and children who are overweight or obese.  The programme at Temple Street children's hospital and the Up4It programme are a great start but we need to find ways of funding those programmes and many others.  In my report I will make suggestions on how to find those funds outside the box, so to speak.  It is all very well for Deputies to come in here and ask witnesses if &euro;10 million would solve the problem.  The bottom line is that the money is not available and therefore we must think outside the box to find ways of raising the money.  As rapporteur, I have many suggestions as to how we can do that, and I will consult with the Minister on that.  There is little point in members' simply listening to the witnesses' contributions without promising some action.  It is important that we realise that the country is bankrupt.  We have a major issue with people being obese and overweight.  We can talk morning, noon and night about that but we must come up a national plan on how to raise the funds to tackle it.  I have many suggestions, and that is the only way to go forward.</p><p>  We know that 100,000 children between the ages of one and four are obese, while 300,000 children are underweight.  The problem begins in childhood.  During my election campaign two and a half years ago I visited many estates and, as Deputy Catherine Byrne mentioned, I did not see any children playing football, running or playing tennis in the streets.  When the parents opened the door I could see the children inside the house playing on PlayStations or other devices.  In my area of Dundalk I met a man who was 29 stone.  He asked me for help and I told him I would try my best to help but I asked him what he was doing about his problem.  He replied that he was waiting for help but I told him that he had to start helping himself by getting out and doing some exercise.  He thought I was being abrupt but I did not mean to insult him.  I simply told him that he cannot just press a switch or lift the phone to look for help.  I met that man 12 months ago and his weight has since dropped from 29 stone to 21 stone.  He lost eight stone in 18 months and the only thing different he did was to get up out of his chair and begin walking in the estate.  That man is a father and a grandfather.  People think they can just lift up the phone and get help for this problem but they do not realise that they can help themselves.</p><p>  The information the witnesses have given today is excellent, but it is alarming and people do not want to hear it.  They said that 70% of the children they mentioned will become obese.  If a child's parents are obese they continue that trend and follow their parents.  We must try to get the parents and children to work together on the problem.  The witnesses frequently referred to the family.  It is important that a child gets into a treatment programme but it is great if they can get help from their mother, father or grandfather also.  That is a fantastic support.</p><p>  The witnesses said that the treatment required costs &euro;1 billion a year.  The health budget is &euro;13 billion and &euro;1 billion of that is going on treatment for people who are obese and overweight.  The Minister will have to examine that.</p><p>  The witnesses hit the nail on the head when they said that the food industry and the advertising agencies have a role to play in this area.  That will be part of the funding requirement.  A total of 88% of these children and their families do not have any treatment programmes available to them.  When we get the funding we must organise these programmes but, as the witnesses said, it is important that these programmes are done throughout the country.  There is little point in telling people they must attend Temple Street children's hospital or a cross-Border programme.  That is an important point, and the Minister realises that.  We have fantastic hospitals in Ireland ranging from small to medium to large.  It is important that whatever funding we get is given to those hospitals and that clinical treatment programmes are opened up.  The witnesses mentioned people being given a diet or health programme.  The programmes the witnesses cited have been excellent.  </p><p>  I remember as a nine year old in school being asked to weigh myself, and I was an active child.  I note that an average nine year old now weighs 34 kg, which is roughly 5.5 stone.  When I was that age I weighed 6 stone and I thought at the time that I was overweight.  From the age of nine to 12 I did not gain much more weight.  I am now in my fifties and I am lucky that my weight now is the same weight as when I was in my twenties.  We can all look for programmes and for this, that and the other to deal with this problem but people must want to address it themselves.  When I meet friends they ask me how I keep myself healthy and fit and I tell them that I make sacrifices.  If one goes to the pub and drinks four pints of Guinness, one could cut back and have three pints, or cut back on going to the chip shop for chips three or four nights a week.  We have all had to cut back to look after ourselves.</p><p>  Can the witnesses give me their top five ways to combat obesity and being overweight?  It is fine to come in here and talk about this, that and the other but we need to keep everything simple.   Most of the people who are obese or overweight come from deprived areas.  The Government is not going to give any handouts.  People need not think they can lift the phone and ask the Government to provide funding of &euro;10 million, &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million to tackle this problem.  I give a guarantee that in my report I will set out methods of funding and people will have to pay to help to fund these programmes.  If Ireland as a society wants to go forward in tackling this problem, we have to think about ourselves.  We must combat the problem of obesity and of being overweight.  As I said here from day one, it is important to treat children and adults who are obese and overweight.  I ask the witnesses to give me their top five ways to combat obesity and being overweight.  The report will be out in two weeks' time.</p><p>  I was very interested in a few of the statistics the witnesses gave.  Their presentations were excellent.  The time for talking is over and now we need action.</p></speech>

The figures presented are shocking.  As a country we need to wake up and recognise that we have a problem.  This is an issue that has been largely ignored but it is an extremely important one.</p><p>  A number of the points I wanted to raise have been covered.  I want to highlight the importance of education both at home and in school, to touch on a few points that Deputy Catherine Byrne raised and to speak about how society has changed.  When I was a child there was no daytime television and therefore we were out all day.  People spend a good deal of time sitting in front of the television today and with all the time young people spend on PlayStation and other devices they are not engaged in as much outdoor activity as they should be.  Many parents lead very busy lives and often do not get home from work until late in the evening.  Compared to the dinners we had as children when mothers worked in the home, dinners today, when many mothers do not get home some evenings until 7 p.m., may consist of fast food two or three times a week.  Pizza and chips are the order of the day.  Cakes were a treat when we were young but they are not so much of a treat today.  We did not have fizzy drinks when I was growing up but they are the order of the day today.  Therefore, society has greatly changed.</p><p>  I wish to refer to the point about education in schools.</p> <p>The level of obesity is higher in children from poor socioeconomic backgrounds.  It could be a problem even to understand food labels.  One possibility is the use of colour codes that children could easily recognise.  It might be helpful if they were educated in school so they could say to their parents that they should not be eating such foods because of the colour codes on them.</p><p> Those involved in "Operation Transformation" came before the committee some time ago.  They pointed out to us various measures that could be taken in schools.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor that children should not be weighed in the classroom, but they should be weighed in a similar programme to the school dentist system a number of times during primary school.  It would be useful if pupils could be seen by a doctor or nurse, but not in the classroom.</p><p> I wish the witnesses good luck with funding in the forthcoming budget.  There is a 12-month waiting list for the hospital-based programme.  Are supports available to families when children and families go on the waiting list?  I am referring to such things as nutritional advice, DVDs and a list of dos and don'ts on which they can work while on the waiting list.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kizzy Moroney" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061300010#L00200"><p>I thank members for their questions and for inviting us before the committee today.  The meeting has been great.  Members are all very well informed.  There is so much to say and it is difficult to condense it.</p><p>  I am grateful that the issue was raised about how parents feel when they come to us and how we approach the situation by saying things in a gentle way.  It is frightening that we regularly sit opposite parents who do not know why they have been referred to us, so we are left with the challenge of explaining why they are present.  Their faces drop.  The child is present for the meeting.  As Dr. Murphy said, growth charts are fantastic for GPs and practice nurses.  The focus is on them and the issues are outlined so one does not even have to mention specific words.  It is a case of bringing matters to a factual level.  From a dietary point of view there is a lot we can do to address the issues.  In terms of waiting lists, millions of resources have been developed and we can send out information.  All the work has been done and the information is ready to go.</p><p>  We often introduce food from a healthy eating point of view.  Initially, we introduce more food involving healthier options.  With high-sugar foods the appetite is satisfied in the short term but then the hunger kicks in again.  One introduces foods from which energy is released more slowly.  In effect, it is more food, which is a comfort for parents.  It is not the case that one gives them too much.  When one is educated on the food pyramid it is a handy resource, similar to the plate model in the UK.  When one ticks all the healthy eating boxes, some of the unhealthy foods just subside naturally.  When Dr. Brinkley speaks she might refer to behavioural change that one sees six to eight weeks before the proper behavioural change takes place.</p><p>  We support parents and reassure them that there are 40 reasons why children are overweight today.  For example, it could have to do with not being active, not having safe areas outside in which to play and not being allowed to run in schools.  Food Dudes was a schools programme which Ms Flanagan might speak about.  Because of technological developments children are not as active anymore.  Cheaper food is higher in fat.  We address food labelling in simple ways on the programmes.  We give simple take-home messages along with the top five tips such as having less than 5 g of fat or sugar per 100 g of a treat food.  We have little take-home messages on the programmes we run.  We go through budgeting and what is achievable in the supermarket.  If one is dealing with a large family, one focuses on bulk buying.  We help families with budgeting as well.  We try to encompass all such matters.  Does Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor want a further response to her question about what one says to parents during the first consultation?</p></speech>

It is managed closely.  Low-calorie diets are not validated for children as they are not appropriate for them.  For younger children the aim is weight maintenance.  It might take four or five years for them to reach proportionate height-to-weight ratios.  It is a long process.  As Ms Flanagan pointed out, the more people one educates the more it transfers to cousins, grannies and other grandchildren, and they will all start to come on board.  That is the benefit of the multidisciplinary approach and lifestyle intervention programmes.</p><p>  There was a question about waiting lists and what happens in the interim.  Currently in Temple Street some children who might not be suitable for the programme go into an outpatient service.  Again, there is a year-long waiting list for it.  There are no community services and they might only get one appointment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Grace O'Malley" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061300010#L00500"><p>I will answer a couple of questions together.  The first question relates to parents' reactions.  Sometimes we have parents who are utterly upset because they have been trying to manage their children's weight themselves but they do not have effective resources.  We all take for granted that we can look after ourselves and we can manage ourselves but a lot of people do not have the emotional resources to do that.  Many parents are depressed or have a low IQ.  Instead of saying they can do something themselves, we need to empower parents, patients and citizens.  We must help a little.  We get either parents who are upset or parents who have been banging their heads off the wall trying to encourage their children - who are mostly teenagers - to change.  No teenager listens to his or her mother or father.  Sometimes coming to a health professional can really help because the child then takes the message on board.</p><p>  The situation is replicated around the western world.  It is not unique to Ireland.  We have issues of increasing food poverty.  Through evolution and foraging for food our bodies are able to store fat when we need to find food.  Now, we have an abundance of calories all around us with unregulated access.  Our brains are not able to deal with that.  We want this and we want that.  We want sugar.  That is what human beings do.  It is a biological problem.</p><p>  We do not have areas that are safe for children to play in.  Many of the children in our catchment areas cannot go outside because the streets are unsafe, because of needles in the park or because they are teased by people in the neighbourhood.  We have a breakdown in society and this is the physiological symptom.  Our children are getting obese and depressed and it is a symptom of society as a whole.  We have a perfect storm.  That is why we all need to work together to make a change.</p><p>  Fast food and takeaways are an issue.  At the moment there is no regulation of the location of such retail units.  Often they are very close to schools.  We know from international research that if one has takeaways and fast food units close to schools one will have increased obesity in those areas.  That is evident.  Sugar-sweetened drinks are not recommended for children.  The American Academy of Paediatrics does not recommend them for any child under 12, yet they are being shoved down children&rsquo;s necks through advertising.  We support the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s recommendations to limit the advertising of non-nutritious foods on children&rsquo;s television and the Internet.  Such advertising must be regulated.  We already spend &euro;1 billion on hospitals in this country.</p> <p>It is more about being smart about the money.  The money is being spent because these children and adults are coming in for orthopaedic surgery, respiratory problems, glucose tolerance testing and so on but we need to examine the budget and see if there is a small amount we can put towards treating children to ensure they do not become obese adults.  We know that parents are the gatekeepers in terms of their child's health.  As the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, mentioned on a Newstalk programme on childhood obesity some weeks ago, parents do not love their children any less now than they did 50 years ago but they are bombarded by confusing messages that do not focus on the health of their family or of their child.  When advertising and marketing pushes a certain way of life in the absence of any health messaging from public health, we cannot compete with that.</p><p> Regarding the levelling off of obesity, in an area in the Aquitaine region of France there was a huge push to have prevention and treatment working together, and it has levelled its obesity rates.  That is something to look toward.  That is only one area in Europe but, thankfully, there are many examples.  I attended the European Congress on Obesity last month where there were many examples of that but it takes a huge effort.</p><p> With regard to ring-fencing funding in terms of taxation, this is a huge issue.  Why can we not trial something regarding taxation for 12 months?  Why do we always decide we cannot do something just because industry says "No"?  We can trial something and if it does not work we can reverse it.  There is no reason it has to be set in stone forever.</p></speech>

We need to incentivise the consumption of healthy foods.  It depends on where one lives in the country but a bottle of Coke in, say, a shop in inner city Dublin will be far cheaper than a bottle of water.  If one wants to buy vegetables they will be far more expensive than a big bag of crisps and if one's children are hungry, one will give them something that is just calories to ensure they are not hungry.  That is a problem because it leads to the creation of chronic disease.</p><p>  We must be serious about front of label packaging.  We can look to the United Kingdom for evidence of that, and we know that traffic light labelling works.  I worked for a period with stroke rehabilitation and people who are rehabilitating, particularly those who are morbidly obese, must believe that they can change before they change but many of our clients who are morbidly obese have pain.  They have biomechanical reasons they cannot exercise and therefore we need to encourage and help them.</p><p>  With regard to the top five issues, from my point of view we have to look at treatment and prevention.  First, we have to train people on the ground who want to be able to work in this area.  We have general practitioners and practice nurses in place already but there is no training for them.  That must be addressed.  Second, we need to treat children who are obese because they will become adults who are obese.  Third, we must regulate the food environment in terms of the advertising of non-nutritious foods.  We must incentivise the consumption of healthy foods.  Fourth, we need to seriously examine education and make sure that physical education is on the curriculum and that it is mandatory.  Cooking skills should be on the curriculum to ensure that our children, the next generation, know how to cook for themselves.  We are amazed that many parents do not know how to cook.</p></speech>

That is an important issue.  Those of us in this room, as clinical experts working in this area and as public representatives, have a responsibility to understand this issue.  For parents, the issue of blame is devastating and as they become aware of the issue when they come in to hospital services, for example, they quickly take on that blame.  That can be devastating for a parent and can make it very difficult for them to address the issue in an effective way.  We have a responsibility to address that.</p><p>  The issue of self-blame ties in to the issue of weight bias.  As a society we are biased towards children and adults who are overweight.  There is evidence for that internationally and in Ireland.  As clinicians we often hold that bias.  As parents we may hold that bias.  We must be aware of that, and we must fight against it.  One of the ways we can do that is to communicate the fact that this is a complex issue.  It is not a simple issue.  It does not have a simple solution.  If we buy into the idea that it is simple and straightforward for parents to address this issue, that in itself can make the issue worse.  If parents, in trying to address the problem, meet a clinician for a once-off consultation, is given advice and sent off to put that into practice, they are likely to fail.  Some parents will succeed but if there is a complex background to the child's obesity, they are likely to fail.  That means they are less likely to try to address the issue again in the future.  The message that gives to the child is also very difficult and devastating.  </p><p>  We must understand that this is a complex issue.  Many of the children we see come with myriad difficulties associated with and underlying their obesity.  From my perspective, the emotional and psychological issues are paramount in the work I would do and they can represent significant barriers for the child and for the family in tackling this issue.  If children are self-conscious about their weight or have experienced teasing, which the majority of the children we see have experienced, they are less likely to feel able to go out and play, go for a jog in the park or go for a run because they are well aware that other young people the same age as them may target them and call them names, point to them or talk among themselves and exclude them.  Those are the real issues with which these children are dealing.</p><p>  I reiterate that we have a responsibility to understand the complexity of this issue and the need for a complex response, not just simple messages.  Obviously, they have a role to play but the children already obese and overweight need multidisciplinary input.  They need input that recognises the psychological impact of the difficulties with which they are dealing, and the parents need support in dealing with what is a complex issue.</p><p>  On the issue of clever funding, we are well aware of the restrictions on available funding.  From our perspective in Temple Street children's hospital, we have had queries about information and training from professionals working within other hospitals, public health nurses and people working in the community.   We cannot provide that currently because of the limit in our own resources.  What we can provide is not sufficient.  We need resources and funding to roll out that training.  That is one way of providing clever funding because it is a minimal spend for a large impact.</p><p>  On the issue Ms O'Malley mentioned about schools, because of the complexity of the issues we need multiple responses.  There is a role for schools to play.  There is a role for us as clinical services and for community services to play.  There is also a role for prevention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma Ball" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061300011#M00700"><p>Yes.  I want to pick up on some of the points discussed, the first of which was the comment about the 61% of referrals for the Up4It programme.  That should have included self-referrals plus community and voluntary group referrals.  That was quite significant.  The approach taken with the CAWT programme was that it would be a community development led programme and not the statutory organisation delivering a programme.  Part of that was looking at the experience of other programmes in terms of retention rates.  We can have a fantastic programme but people drop out of it.  Also, it is important to consider the hard to access clients who do not attend, DNA, for their appointments but who may have health risks.</p><p>  The project went through a procurement process.  In our area in Donegal a community and voluntary group, the Letterkenny Youth &amp;amp; Family Services, co-ordinated and delivered the programme in partnership with the health professionals.  As a result, we saw there was a significant number of self-referrals because they were based in an area of Letterkenny.  They already had after school services for families.  They were already involved in parenting programmes.  They had the knowledge in terms of bringing in and capturing those clients and as a result we had very good retention rates, both for the completion of the 12 week programme plus the follow on.</p> <p>It is very important for any community programme that the community and the voluntary sector are included therein in partnership with the HSE and the primary care providers.  At a local level, we have a children's services committee, which has prioritised tackling obesity for the next three years in County Donegal.  We have brought in all the various community groups such as, for example, the Lifestart Foundation, the local sports partnerships and so on.  Again, this pertains to creative funding and what these organisations can give to the programme.  It may be they can provide a room in which to run the programmes and therefore one need not pay to rent out a room.  Similarly, they may have kitchen facilities because, again, it is a skills-based programme in which we seek to have a cookery element.  While there is a certain amount of goodwill funding we can gain from working with different groups, we need the statutory organisations, that is, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Department of Health to provide some element of funding.  I agree that &euro;10 million would be a fantastic start.</p><p> Another point to mention pertains to getting out the message to parents and again, this is looking at it being a positive programme.  It is not being marketed as something like Slimming World or a weight loss programme but rather, the point is it is a healthy lifestyle programme.  It is a skills-based programme that should be both fun and social and one would know this from the testimonials of those children who attended the programme, which were that they made friends and came back, that it was active and the children were doing something every week and it was not just about listening to someone talking at them.  It is very important to have this fun, positive element to the programme, as well as it being skills-based, in order that the participants learn how to cook and the child learns with his or her parent how to make meals and how shopping can be done.</p><p> Another point I wish to mention relates to the weighing of children and the involvement of general practitioners, GPs.  Nationally, a weight management treatment algorithm for children was developed by the HSE and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.  It is available and there probably should be a little more training in respect of that.  However, on the measurement of children, I must mention the public health nursing service and the school public health nurse service.  Again, there are issues around the country in this regard.  Because of the moratorium and the HSE embargo, this service is not available throughout the country.  However, where school nurses are available, part of their remit is to measure the children at least twice - I think it may be in junior infants and in fifth class.  In my local area, a questionnaire goes out to parents, prior to them coming into the school, asking whether they have issues.  One question is whether there are issues with regard to food and nutrition.  In addition, after the measurement and the health check take place, a report goes out to the parents that includes the child's weight and height and which ticks the box as to whether there should be any concern in this regard.  In my area, the parent will be contacted and there is an option for the children to be referred through to the individual dietetic service.  Unfortunately, either the school public health nurse is not available nationally or the dietetic service is very limited.  Ideally, while an individual dietetic consultation can have a role, we would love then to be able to refer those involved onto something like the 12-week programme, perhaps after the first assessment.  While some structures potentially are in place, it is not countrywide and has not been rolled out.  I reiterate that much of the groundwork has been done and there does not need to be a lot of work done on developing programmes or systems.  It simply needs to be implemented at this point.</p></speech>

I still believe that no matter where one lives in the city, one can buy decent vegetables and so on.  I visit supermarkets all the time and there always are three-for-two bargains on sale.  I see people buying cans of carrots for &euro;1.75, when one could buy a bag of carrots that would last a week instead.  This is the basic point in this regard.  I have one question in respect of school meals and breakfast clubs.  I was part of a parents group that introduced the first breakfast club in the country in Inchicore and Goldenbridge, where I live.  It was because we had seen children coming to school who had nothing.  What is Ms O'Malley's opinion on school meals and schools that deliver them?  Does she think it is of benefit to children or is this a case of going to the extreme and doing things the children's parents ought to be doing?</p></speech>

However, teenagers do look at them and parents can set a good example.  I acknowledge that when children are aged between 13 and 21 or whatever, they go through a stage of rebellion.  However, if one looks at them in later years, they will have carbon-copied what their parents have done.  Consequently, it is extremely important that the parents help in this regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sinead Murphy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061300012#N00800"><p>In respect of breastfeeding and weaning, there is no question but that breastfeeding is protective and is the best start a child can have from a nutritional point of view.  It is somewhat strange but we do not do well with breastfeeding in Ireland.  It is very socioeconomically dependent, like everything else.  However, we certainly should be encouraging it, as well as encouraging facilities and so on for mothers to be able to breastfeed where at all possible.  While breastfed children are less likely to be obese, there are so many contributory factors that it is very hard just to pull out breastfeeding.  This just brings me back to exercise and children having the wherewithal to exercise and providing that for them.  Exercise has become elitist in this country because there are not the facilities for children to go and play if they so wish, to walk to school if they so wish or to cycle to school if they had a bike.  These are the types of children with whom we are dealing and we must bear that in mind.  However, that is an aside.</p><p>  Weaning is very important and we are bad at it.  Children will be weaned as early as three months in some cases.  Moreover, a little scarily, mothers will be advised to wean children at three months.  This is a case then of educating, in that we talk about educating the educators and they are the pure educators, namely, the teachers.  There also are the health care professionals who are going out and giving advice to these parents.  They need to know what the advice should be and certainly, weaning at three months is not part of it.  Moreover it happens and we hear frequently enough that mothers are advised to do this.  This certainly is something that really requires quite a lot of attention.  This will be very important from a prevention point of view as these are babies and hopefully we can prevent them from turning into overweight or obese children.</p><p>  As for intolerance, I do not believe there is much of a relationship between food intolerance and being overweight or obesity.  There is food excess and lack of exercise and as Ms Kizzy Moroney stated, there probably are 40 different factors - that probably is conservative - all contributing together.  Food intolerance occasionally may play a part but I do not think it is one on which to concentrate.  As for the Deputy's question on thyroid problems, that is one thing for which we screen.  As members will be aware, all children are screened at birth for congenital thyroid problems with the Guthrie test.  However, other thyroid problems can come on at any point in life and can contribute to being overweight.  It is one thing that certainly should be checked for and again, that is part of education.  In our programme, we screen all children for thyroid problems because one sees it and I can think of lots of cases in which children would come in and be battling and in which it is a case of thyroid problems.  Unfortunately, most of the time, it is not an endocrine problem but is a problem pertaining to the toxic environment in which they live and the fact they are not enabled or empowered to do anything about it.</p></speech>

It may be a co-morbidity of their obesity as such but when someone addresses and looks into his or her diet, he or she may find there is a little bit of intolerance.  However, one finds that when a person's diet is being addressed, his or her hydration is improved.  Consequently, that might be the bigger benefit for people, in that with improved hydration on foot of addressing their diet, eating regularly and all of that, they get better results from their intolerance symptoms.</p> <p>Therefore, it is secondary to their weight management.  It is definitely a relevant point but, as regards childhood obesity and the bigger picture, as Dr. Murphy stated, probably not that important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-13a.1145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Richelle Flanagan" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061300013#O00200"><p>I have a couple of points.  In response to Deputy Fitzpatrick's question about breastfeeding, he may like to take it up with one of our research dietitians, Ms Roslyn Tarrant, who has done a great deal of research in the area of breastfeeding and weaning within the Irish female population.  Our rates are definitely at the lower end.  Those who are breastfeeding are the more well educated and those who have thought it through before they give birth, during the antenatal period.  It is very much the case that we need to hit that point before they give birth, during the pregnancy and even before.  It is shown that even grandparents have an effect on the child's level of obesity down the line.  We need to get in as early as possible.</p><p>  As Dr. Murphy stated, there is definitely research to show that people are weaning far too early.  The FSAI has launched new infant feeding guidelines, which are supposed to be rolled out through the public health nurses.  The problem is that there are not enough public health nurses because of the moratorium on recruitment in the public service, as is the case with other health professionals.  With regard to weaning foods, mums are using packaged products.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  There are guidelines about the safety of these weaning foods for babies but there are no guidelines about the levels of sugar, fat, etc.  That might be something to be examined.</p><p>  I read a report that stated that according to the legislation one can breastfeed in the workplace but one must give notice six weeks beforehand.  Often, there is a lack of access to a place suitable for breastfeeding.  Embarrassment is a big blockage.  In that regard, one will also see in Ms Roslyn Tarrant's research that there is a fear that breastfeeding is not something that is acceptable.</p><p>  One point I must make about breastfeeding is that the mums are blamed constantly for different things.  We must be supportive and encourage them.  The WHO supports exclusive breastfeeding, but it comes down to choice.  Many working women are under a great deal of pressure in this economic time, and they must be given more choice.  We must support them in their choices and encourage them to breastfeed as much as they can, whatever that may be.  We need to have a more helpful society when it comes to breastfeeding.</p><p>  On the comment made about the food guidelines, as the committee will be aware, the food pyramid and the healthy eating guidelines were relaunched last June through the Department of Health, the FSAI and the HSE, with the involvement of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, INDI.  They are a fantastic resource.  They are not a weight-loss guide but I can guarantee that if people followed them they would naturally lose weight.</p><p>  We were asked about the top five issues with regard to obesity.  One can say the top issue is the food on the top shelf.  People are snacking too much on high-fat or sugary foods and drinks.  Portion control is another.  The food pyramid tells people about appropriate portions.  I gave a talk only yesterday in a workplace and it is always the case that people are astounded when I tell them that a portion of rice is 25 g.  That is nothing.  Thirty strands of spaghetti is a portion of carbohydrate.  The messages we need to get out to people are about portion sizes and about the top shelf.  Alcohol is another issue; people do not understand the amount of calories that are in the alcohol they consume - that is, 100 calories per 100 ml of standard drink.  These are many of the messages contained within the food pyramid.</p><p>  With regard to the food pyramid, it is wrong to denigrate something that is a public health document.  When the delegation from &quot;Operation Transformation&quot; appeared before the committee, they did that.  It was incorrect.  They also mentioned that dietitians were not up to date.  I represent dietitians and clinical dietitians, who are regulated by the statutory body CORU, the Health and Social Care Professionals' Council, which deals with protecting the public from poor information.  We represent the expert view, just as physiotherapists and behavioural psychologists do, with our paediatric consultants.  It is quite a complex issue.</p><p>  The food pyramid is only for those aged five years and over.  We do not have food guidelines for under fives.  That is something else that should be put in the committee's report.  I ask that there be food guidelines for under fives, along with a food pyramid and portion controls for children, because we need to start early.</p><p>  With regard to what is available for children, much work is being done.  There are websites such as <i>littlesteps.eu</i>.  Members said that parents were listening in to this meeting.  That website is a fantastic resource from <i>safe</i>food.  There is also an initiative called <i>way2live.eu</i>, which is a combined initiative from the INDI and <i>safe</i>food.  They are both great resources for empowering parents.  The Food Dudes programme has proved to be fantastic.  It is parents who affect children's choices, but when it comes to teenagers, their peers also have an influence.  Children are affected by their parents' choices, but within the school setting, that programme, under which children bring in a fruit and vegetable, has been shown to be extremely successful.  Like other programmes, however, it has not been supported enough.  Breakfast clubs were mentioned.  There is the Healthy Food for All initiative, under which HSE dietitians have helped to develop a resource for breakfast clubs in deprived areas.</p><p>  There is much fantastic work going on, but we always come back to the crux of the issue - that is, the need to co-ordinate and replicate those initiatives that are working, which is not happening at the moment.  There is funding, but if one wants to find better ways of utilising the funding, one should examine the programmes and move the funding to areas that are working.  It is criminal that we are saying we need to find funding for something that is preventative.  As we stated, 25% of the adult population are obese.  By 2030, which is only 17 years away, the rate will almost double, to 47%.  All of the chronic diseases are a direct result of obesity.  To my mind, it is a no-brainer that one should provide the funding by finding it wherever one can.  This will solve many of the other problems that are coming down the line.</p></speech>

The programme is working, but we need to ensure we are providing children with the healthiest options and that there is proper oversight of what is in the meals.</p><p>  Of course, parents are the biggest role models for all children and they are the most important people in the life of a child or teenager.  When we are faced every day with parents who are struggling to do their best for their teenagers, we can see they need support.  I do not mean that children do not listen to their parents - of course they do - but when one has a teenager who is dealing with changes in his or her own body and trying to be mature enough to deal with the fact that he or she is clinically obese, the parent needs help and extra support.</p><p>  We need to be really clear about the fact that six months is the best age for weaning.  It needs to be a message that everybody hears.</p><p>  According to Dr. Anne Dee and Professor Ivan Perry in the <i>safe</i>food report, the majority of costs related to obesity and excess weight were indirect costs, and 60% of these were due to absenteeism.  There is an opportunity to invest in human capital, which is the most valuable asset in the country.  If we do not have healthy people we will not have an economy, because there will not be anybody working.</p><p>  For patients who are waiting for services, there is a website, <i>w82go.ie</i>, which also has a section for clinicians.  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor asked about smartphone applications.  We have developed an Android app called Reactivate to try to bridge the gap in treatment and we have looked at providing remote treatment.  It is a behavioural change app for teenagers which uses goal-setting to improve nutrition, activity levels, fitness, sleep and emotional well-being.</p></speech>

In summary, in order to tackle this issue effectively, we need progressive policy and adequate legislation, as discussed here.  From our point of view, we need access to appropriate clinical services at community and hospital level.  I hope we have demonstrated that there are services worthy of support which are making a difference.</p><p>  Children who are obese with co-morbidities have a right to timely treatment.  As with any child with a life-threatening disease, children who are overweight and obese have the right to timely identification and treatment in the community to help prevent the development of adult diseases during childhood.</p> <p>While we welcome the development of initiatives such as the weight management treatment algorithms for children and the idea of screening, the reality is that service provision for the management of referrals is inequitable around the country.  While it is satisfactory to produce a piece of paper, one must question the reality of to where one can be referred if there are no services available.</p><p> Treatment for persons who are overweight and obese must be delivered by the appropriately skilled health care professionals to manage the issues that arise in a sensitive manner.  We have demonstrated that the matter is very sensitive and must be dealt with by the right professionals.  We ask that the committee include in its forthcoming report a reference to the urgent provision and co-ordination of necessary obesity treatment services for overweight and obese children in the community and obese children with co-morbidities in the acute setting.</p><p> The following initial steps have been recommended by the INDI and Temple Street hospital:<blockquote>1. Sustainable Government funding for the evidence based Temple Street hospital W82Go! treatment programme for children who are clinically obese;<br />2. co-ordinated and sustainable funding of an evidenced based community treatment programme such as Up4it! that will be rolled out nationwide over a targeted time period that builds capacity through multi-stakeholder delivery partnerships and utilisation of local engagement models and resources [We know that is what works];<br />3. appointment of a national post for obesity management to co-ordinate the clinical service delivery of obesity treatment in an integrated pathway between hospital and community [A big problem is the lack of integration in order to be able to grasp the nettle; Ireland is a small country but could be a poster boy like the Aquitaine region in actually starting to show reductions];<br />4. consistency in delivery of treatment services using service frameworks, referral pathways and professional staff with performance management and evaluation;<br />5. engagement of the Government and the HSE with the clinical experts working with children such as consultants, dietitians, physiotherapists and psychologists in the development of a co-ordinated, integrated pathway for the management of obesity.</blockquote>As outlined at the Taoiseach's launch of Healthy Ireland, we want to see a whole-system approach to improving population health and well-being that includes the goals of increasing the number of people who are healthy at all stages of life and reducing health inequalities.  We need to start with the most vulnerable who need treatment right now.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

The committee's remit covers both the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Unfortunately, the under-fives have been neglected during the years.  We have been dealing with some very disturbing stories that have emerged in regard to some cr&egrave;ches in Dublin.  The Government, for the first time, has formulated an early years strategy.  The delegation should consider having an input into the strategy on healthy eating guidelines for the under-fives.  It is stark that we do not have such guidelines.  I encourage the delegates to make a submission in the coming weeks, which the committee would support.  I thank them for attending and members for their patience.
