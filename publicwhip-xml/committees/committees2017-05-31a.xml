We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness at the committee.  We will continue looking at the 2015 appropriation accounts, Vote 20, for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dealing specifically with the interim internal audit report on financial procedures in the Garda College.  We met on this matter on 4 May 2017 and the issues discussed are of such concern that the committee has decided that further engagement is required.  We will be keeping today's meeting to the matter of the interim audit report, and expect to meet with the Commissioner and others in respect of the same topic on 14 June.  We will deal with the rest of the Vote on 13 July, when the Commissioner will be before the committee again.  While the report refers to matters that have their history in events that span at least a couple of decades, the primary focus of today's meeting will be on what happened since 2015.  I ask members and witnesses to co-operate in maintaining this focus.</p><p>We are joined today by the following witnesses from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: Mr. Niall Kelly, head of internal audit and author of the interim audit report; Mr. John Barrett, executive director, human resources and people development; Mr. Michael Culhane, executive director, finance and services; Mr. Ken Ruane, head of legal services; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer; and Mr. Michael Howard, former head of the Garda audit committee.  From the Department of Justice and Equality, we are joined by Ms Anne Barry, principal officer, policing division; and Mr. Paul McDonnell from the policing division.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be turned off completely or put into flight mode as they interfere with the recording equipment.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> Before I call Mr. Niall Kelly to make his opening statement, I wish to point out that we have asked for only one statement from the head of internal audit and other people will also be questioned.  I apologise but there is a change to the schedule for today.  We had originally scheduled the meeting to commence this morning and to resume at 5 p.m. following a break in the afternoon.  Due to commitments in the House, we have had to reschedule that.  We will meet from now and my plan is that in two hours, we will take a short break for ten minutes, and continue until approximately 2 p.m.  We will then break until 5 p.m., when we will return for an evening session, as originally intended.  We may have indicated we were bringing that forward but, due to other commitments in the House, we are proceeding with the original plan.  I hope people will appreciate that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017053100002#G01200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak again today in regard to the internal audit report on the Garda College.  I do not intend going into the detail of the report, which speaks for itself, but rather to advance some of the discussion points from our previous meeting.  The report contains 19 recommendations, which were fully accepted by the Garda executive committee when I presented it with a draft of the report on 6 September 2016.  The findings and recommendations in the report are robust and stand up to scrutiny.  I would like to add that the Garda internal audit section, GIAS, has recently undergone an external review by a firm of accountants which concluded that the section is fully in compliance with the international professional practice framework of the Global Institute of Internal Auditors.  This is the internationally recognised best practice standard for internal audit.</p> <p>  I started work in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as head of internal audit ten years ago in June 2007.  At that time and for the next two years approximately, I reported to Deputy Commissioner Fitzgerald, who is mentioned in the report in the context of the Garda Boat Club issue.  From 2009 until his retirement in 2014, I reported to Deputy Commissioner Rice.  It was Deputy Commissioner Rice who stated in a note to the Commissioner on 18 September 2009, &ldquo;I strongly believe that any surplus money does not belong to the State but rather is owned by the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from whom they were collected and I equally hold that any money cannot be used except for the welfare and development of the facilities for members at [An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na]&rdquo;.  Deputy Commissioner Rice did not seek my advice in regarding this issue prior to sending his note to the Commissioner in 2009.  Had he done so, I would have pointed out that this was contrary to section C5.19 of the Public Financial Procedures &ndash; the blue book - which, under the heading "Exchequer Extra Receipts", states, "These are receipts that the Department of Finance directs must be credited directly to the Exchequer and cannot be retained by Departments for their own use".  The position of deputy commissioner was occupied by Kieran Kenny from mid-2014 to the end of 2015, when D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in took over.</p> <p>  In regard to interference, non-co-operation and withholding information from internal audit, there are three periods of time that should be considered: first, the period from 2008 to 2011; second, the period from July 2015 to March 2016; and third, the period from September 2016 to March 2017.  I will deal with the period 2008 to 2011.  In this period, it is apparent that some people did not want the newly-appointed and very independent internal auditor from looking too critically at the Garda College.  These people included my direct superiors during the period in question.  When I did make inquires and attempted to get information, this information was withheld from me, as apparent from the strings of emails between the chief administrative officer, the executive director of finance, the chief superintendent and the administrator at the Garda College on 15 April 2010.</p> <p>  I will now deal with the period from July 2015 to March 2016.  On 27 July 2015, all managers from chief superintendent, head of section or principal officer grade upwards attended a briefing session in Templemore on the modernisation and renewal programme.  At a break in this session, Mr. Ken Ruane, head of legal affairs, asked me how the discussion about the Garda College at the audit committee meeting of the previous week, on 15 July, had gone.  I told Mr. Ruane that no discussion took place at the audit committee meeting.  He informed me that there were serious issues in the Garda College that I should be aware of and that Mr. John Barrett had prepared a document for Mr. Cyril Dunne, the then chief administrative officer, to brief the audit committee.  Later that day, the meeting between the Commissioner, Mr. John Barrett, the two deputy commissioners and the executive director of finance took place - this was the meeting discussed at the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  It should be noted that I was not invited to attend this meeting or informed of the outcome.  The following day, at a break in another meeting in Westmanstown, County Dublin, I raised the issue with Superintendent John Keegan of the office of the deputy commissioner for governance and strategy.  I spoke again with Superintendent Keegan at more length the following day - 29 July - at Garda headquarters.  I have a contemporaneous note of these conversations, written in my own hand on 4 August 2015.  I wrote, "Superintendent Keegan was of the view that these issues were similar to concerns that were expressed several years previously and which had been audited by GIAS and the executive director of finance and had been resolved".  The Garda College issues were raised at the audit committee meeting of 30 September 2015 by Mr. Cyril Dunne.  However, this discussion took place under the heading "any other business" at the end of a long agenda, with no documents circulated either before or at the meeting.</p><p>The chief administrative officer, CAO, had not sought to put the issue on the agenda of the meeting, even though he had a detailed report from Mr. Barrett since July of that year. <br/><br/>A working group was set up in the summer of 2015 to consider the issues in the college.  I was told by Cyril Dunne, CAO, John Keegan, superintendent, and Kieran Kenny, deputy commissioner, on numerous occasions that internal audit should not be involved in the working group.  This was because internal audit may be required to audit at a later stage.  I had no difficulty with this.  I was also informed that legal issues were being advanced with regard to the land and employee status at the college and until these legal issues were resolved, it would be unwise to commence an audit.  I now know that I was misled with regard to the legal issues as the head of legal affairs, Mr. Ruane, was advising from July 2015 onwards that internal audit should be requested to commence an audit immediately. <br/><br/>The former chief administrative officer, Mr. Dunne, indicated to the Garda internal audit section, GIAS, as part of the consultative process that he wanted to check the issues presented to him by Mr. Barrett and gather more information.  In response to this point, I state as following on page 15 of the report:</p><blockquote>While GIAS acknowledge the contribution of the former CAO in progressing the issues we conclude that GIAS should have been informed immediately and that the report of the Executive Director HR&amp;amp;PD should have been put on the Agenda of the Audit Committee meeting in July 2015.  GIAS with the backing of the Audit Committee were better placed to do the investigative and information gathering process that was taken on by the former CAO in July 2015.</blockquote><p>From September 2016 to March 2017, when a draft reports was concluded, I consulted widely with persons that could possibly be identified in the report to ensure that fair procedures were observed.  That was the reason for the gap at that time.  As a result of this process some changes were made to the body of the report but these did not affect the audit opinion and main findings and recommendations contained in the executive summary to the report. <br/><br/>Two of the responses were from the executive director of finance and services, Mr. Culhane, dated 13 October 2016 and 20 February 2017.  I understand he also wrote to the chair of the audit committee, Mr. Howard.  I find these two letters totally unacceptable because Mr. Culhane questions my motives and my professional integrity and competence.  I can only view these letters as an attempt to undermine the report or to try to get me to change my audit opinion, findings and recommendations. <br/><br/>The audit report is entitled &quot;Interim Audit Report&quot;.  This is because it is envisaged that further audit work would be required.  The report gives a wide panoramic view of the financial controls in the Garda College from 2009 to 2016.  It should be noted that I plan a series of audits on aspects of the Garda College over the next two years or so.  I can assure this committee that I will persist in reviewing these issues until they are all satisfactorily resolved.  Since the last meeting with the Committee of Public Accounts, we have commenced two specific audits on EU-funded projects and programmes concerning the college going back to 1998 and on current controls of cash in the college restaurant, shop, vending machines and bar, as well as current banking arrangements.  I hope to have these two audit reports completed by the Committee of Public Accounts meeting on 13 July. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I wish to make points on two issues at the heart of the findings from the report and its surrounding discussions, namely, governance and culture.  The report and issues around it identify failures of governance as exemplified by the correspondence between the then Commissioner Fachtna Murphy and the then CAO, John Leamy, on 25 April and 8 May 2008, when six action points were agreed and instruction given to implement these points by the Commissioner, that is, the Accounting Officer.  I do not need to tell this committee but for the record it should be noted that in the public service, the role of Accounting Officer comprises all the responsibilities of the board of directors in the private sector.  That the instructions of the Accounting Officer were not followed but another investigative process initiated between Deputy Commissioner Rice and the chief superintendent in the Garda College is a failure of governance. <br/><br/>Having concluded this audit and gone through all the discussions and analysis of the issues over the last two years, I am convinced that there was and may still be in some parts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a culture of not admitting to problems and, when these problems persist, trying to keep them in-house and away from transparent public scrutiny.  This is apparent from the reluctance by senior management to get internal audit involved in the period from 2008 to 2011 and the period from July 2015 to March 2016. <br/><br/>There is also evident a culture that thinks An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is different from other public sector bodies and that the normal processes of financial procedures and transparent democratic accountability do not apply, as in Deputy Commissioner Rice&rsquo;s letter of 18 September 2009, for example.<br/><br/>I again thank the committee for its time and its assistance to me as internal auditor of the Garda Vote.</p></speech>

The first speaker will have 20 minutes, the second speaker 15 minutes and every other speaker has ten minutes.  I will be keeping tightly to that timescale in order that everybody has an opportunity to get in.  There will be further opportunities during the course of the day.</p> <p>  There was one point I wanted to take up directly before we proceed on the opening statement and it concerns Mr. Kelly and Mr. Culhane.  Mr. Kelly says in his opening statement, referring to a letter of 20 February 2017, that he finds this letter unacceptable because Mr. Culhane questions his motives, professional integrity and competence.  I would like to ask Mr. Culhane about that letter, I am sure that he is familiar with it.  We will get it up on the screen.  This is the letter dated 20 February 2017. There is such a volume of documentation here today that it is going to be difficult to get it up on the screen but I will read the particular passage.  It is Mr. Culhane I want to ask here because Mr. Kelly has specifically referred to that letter as totally unacceptable.  I want to deal with that if possible.  </p> <p>  Does Mr. Culhane have the letter to hand?  There are two points I want to take up in it.  I am reading from the end of page two.  This is a letter addressed from Mr. Culhane to Mr. Kelly on the draft interim audit report just before it was finalised.  In the fourth paragraph, at the end of the second page, Mr. Culhane writes to Mr. Kelly that at a meeting in the college he, Mr. Kelly, stated to Superintendent McCabe, the college administrator, that he, Mr. Kelly, believed that the college had offshore bank accounts.  Did Mr. Culhane say that?</p></speech>

Mr. Culhane was not at any meetings in the college that I attended.  The second thing I would say is that I spent a lot of time in the college last summer.  From roughly mid-June to mid-August, I was up and down to the college and I stayed over in the college.  During that time, I talked to a lot of people.  This is a normal process of doing an audit - one talks to a lot of people.  I would not be doing my job properly if I had not broached the possibility, given the number of bank accounts that were presented and that evolved from the audit, that some of them could have been offshore.  At the end of the day, I did not find any offshore bank accounts but I had to broach that possibility and I had to discuss that with management in the college.</p></speech>

As far as I can attest, this letter appears to be from where the reference came.  If Mr. Kelly is satisfied there are no offshore accounts, I would like him to confirm that because before the witnesses' arrival today, many people were of the view, as a result of this issue being raised in correspondence, that there may have been offshore accounts.  Mr. Kelly is confirming that, to his knowledge, there are no offshore accounts.</p></speech>

In the second last paragraph of his letter to Mr. Kelly, Mr. Culhane states: "You have effectively set yourself up as "judge, jury and executioner" by your refusal to amend your report to reflect the additional correcting information given to you."  Is that a fair comment?  Would Mr. Culhane say that today?  Does he still believe that?</p></speech>

In terms of looking at the college now, with the current corporate governance focus, one would say that what happened in the college is not acceptable.  The college was set up with those arrangements.  That developed over time so I am just trying to draw on the point that if one looks at the historical development of the college from today's corporate governance eyes, it certainly is not acceptable.  However, to give people a reasonable chance to defend their reputations, one has to reflect that they were operating under a regime which, by today's corporate governance practices, is not acceptable.</p></speech>

When he received the draft of the report in September he objected to many of the recommendations being included in the report.  We received the responses he gave in which he objected to many of the recommendations being included.  At that point, he said that legal advice would be required before the recommendations should be included in the report.  I think that is the gist of some of Mr. Culhane's objections.</p></speech>

I was aware of a lot of the issues that Mr. Kelly had identified.  Before the recommendations could be implemented, a lot of legal advice would be required.  Some of the recommendations included in the report still have not been implemented because the legal position still has not been resolved.</p></speech>

The opening statement refers to the fact that legal issues remain to be resolved.  Mr. Culhane seemed concerned about even including some of those recommendations in the report itself.</p></speech>

I accept Mr. Kelly is an independent individual so he will reach his own conclusions.  He does not need my imprimatur to include or exclude whatever he wishes in his reports.  That has been my experience of Mr. Kelly since he joined the organisation in, I think, 2007.</p></speech>

We have a copy of this report in relation to the draft recommendations.  In relation to recommendation No. 8, Mr. Culhane wrote: "Until the legal position is resolved, it is not possible to implement this."  Mr. Culhane has no problem with the recommendation being in the report but there might be difficulties implementing it.</p></speech>

As I said, even today some of the recommendations have not been implemented because legal advice is still outstanding.</p></speech>

Looking through all the documentation, at all stages, Mr. Culhane has maintained that the Department of Justice and Equality was aware of the situation in the Garda college in relation to the money being used from the restaurant and going into the company and so on.  He maintains the Department was aware that profit was being made.  He made that point repeatedly.</p></speech>

We should take the recommendations of the interim audit report and ask Mr. Culhane questions about the implementation of same and whether we have learned and whether we are going forward.  That is what we tried to do on the previous occasion.  Then we received correspondence from Mr. Barrett and Mr. Kelly and an extraordinary opening statement.  Forgive me, but I will come back on track.</p> <p>  I believe people are swimming to save themselves at this point and I will take back that statement if I am proved wrong.  I have seen correspondence from Mr. Culhane to the Commissioner in which he suggested that Mr. Barrett be charged under the Official Secrets Act.  Did I misread that?  </p></speech>

I do not believe it is necessary to prepare an independent report and then send it to oneself by registered mail.  If there are issues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be dealt with, they should be dealt with openly.</p> <p>  Not to go off on a tangent or anything like that, we had a tax audit in, I think, 2010, which resulted in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having to pay penalties and charges of &euro;12.7 million.  I dealt with that issue.  That was never a subject of a section 41 disclosure.  It was dealt with in the normal course of events in terms of the management of the organisation.  There are so many issues that come along on a daily basis or on a regular basis that one deals with them as best one can at the time.</p></speech>

I have asked three times, myself personally, four times through my solicitor to have the document - which has just been referred to and was released to this committee yesterday - given to me.  Some 85% of the document that was eventually released under freedom of information - consider how this might play - was redacted in protection of the very issues the finance director has not discussed.  That reflects the situation in its reality.  This correspondence will be made available to the committee; it is important that it has it.  I discovered the existence of that letter almost a year to the day after it had been written.  The interesting inversion of trust that was presented to the committee appals me.  We requested, legitimately, a letter written about me that I had no knowledge of, which alleges a potential criminal offence.  Rights of natural justice, constitutional procedure - none of that existed.  I discovered it yesterday as being included in the pack to this committee.</p></speech>

The questions I asked were not answered to my satisfaction.  In my youth I did a BComm and for a while I tried to teach management accounting, so I have a very vague and distant knowledge of it.  I have used it throughout my career by virtue of necessity.  However, the questions were not satisfactorily answered.

Mr. Culhane was at the meeting as were Superintendent Nolan, Chief Superintendent Anne Marie McMahon, Cyril Dunne and myself.  Mr. Ken Ruane was not at that meeting, but the suggestion was that he would be joining that steering group.  At that point, even though it was pretty clear that the complexity demanded internal audit, the view was taken by Cyril Dunne that we should not at that point engage with Niall Kelly.</p> <p>  There was a series of discussions.  There is a very comprehensive chronology of those discussions through the month of July in my engagement with Mr. Ruane, largely because I went to him for advice.</p></speech>

I am the line manager for the Garda College, but there is a range of activities going on, if one likes, outside the scope of my control and they are significant.  In the early stages of this I had some very good help from Barry McGee.  He was the author of the 2008 report.  It was very quickly visible that despite the reports of 2008 and 2010 - this was now 2015 - the issues remained extant; they were there.  I have to say I had never envisaged that arrangements so repugnant to the blue book were, in effect, allowed to continue and, as I said in my report, in plain view.</p></speech>

There are a couple of general points that I would like to get across.  Before I say anything else, in case I do not get an opportunity to say this, the audit committee has formally commended Niall Kelly on his work in relation to this.  I think that I should say that.  In approaching this, I cannot ignore the fact there has been some controversy and debate.  I want to make it clear that Mr. Kelly was performing a task assigned to him by his employer.  There is no question that he ever had any motivation other than to do that task impartially and objectively.  Given the scale of the issue as it subsequently emerged, I devoted an enormous amount of time to this, way out of what one would normally devote as chair of an audit committee, to reviewing the work of the internal auditor.  Niall Kelly was always completely open with me.  I am satisfied and my committee is satisfied that the conclusions in his interim report are very firmly grounded on fact.  I think I should say that before I say anything else.</p> <p>  I would, if I may, briefly skip through the narrative as it emerged from the point of view of the audit committee.  In case anyone is a little unclear of the role of the audit committee, I am a retired civil servant.  There are five people on the audit committee, a deputy commissioner who sits there permanently and four outside members, one of whom has to be chair.  In addressing the members I want to say that the committee addressed this as an issue on which we had consensus.  There were no divided opinions.  I should start by saying that the matter was raised first with the audit committee on 30 September but it was raised verbally as an AOB item.</p></speech>

Again, I want to be very careful because I am going to stick entirely to the facts as they were revealed to me.  The normal business of audit is conducted in arrears, so in the routine, Niall Kelly would complete audit reports, they would be brought to the committee, they would be reviewed, we would approve them, we might question them and we would go on.  Our role is to advise the Commissioner on matters of finance, audit, risk, governance and so forth.  Obviously we address other things at meetings.  There was a very busy agenda that day and at the end of the meeting this was raised verbally as an AOB item.  There was no briefing given to us.  I have reflected on how I will phrase this: neither I nor any of the other outside members of the committee took from that briefing any sense of the importance of this issue as it subsequently emerged.  Ultimately, this issue was so serious that the Accounting Officer had to amend the statement of internal financial control.  I do not believe that has happened before on the Garda Vote so, objectively speaking, this was a very serious issue.  It was raised, we discussed it a bit and we were asked if we would include it in the 2016 programme of work, which was done - that was Mr. Kelly's report in its time - but no indication was given to us that this was different.  I will again confine it  to what was my impression and I will put this in these terms: I worked in the Civil Service for 35 years.  I do not believe that I was a na&iuml;ve or uninformed listener to that briefing.</p></speech>

It was mentioned as an AOB item in September, mentioned literally as a one-liner at the next meeting in December as something to keep an eye on; I mentioned it as one of a list of nine items that we were keeping an eye on, so we did know the issue existed but we had no notion as to what was entailed in it.</p></speech>

That was one year later.  Again, I will synthesise this as best I can.  Up to that point in time - I know there is a danger that we read history backwards, partly due to what Niall Kelly has said to me and very much elaborated by John Barrett &ndash; I had previously thought this was an issue that pertained primarily to the ownership of land.  If I could put in grossly over simple terms, that it was a static issue.  The land was not going anywhere.  In my own work I have seen this, where one can have issues about the ownership of land, so it was important but I was not aware that it was serious.  What changed for me when John Barrett briefed me was that I realised this was a dynamic issue.  This was continuing because the whole time the figures &ndash; off the top of my head it was about &euro;77 per trainee garda per week, so if one has 400 or 500 garda&iacute;, one could have &euro;30,000 odd a week.</p></speech>

I mean no disrespect.  Does Mr. Culhane see An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, from a financial perspective, as a series of pigeonholes?

Some people might even call what happened theft.  In his opening statement, Niall Kelly indicated that, under the rules and the law, money must go back to the State and that it did not do so in this instance.  Mr. Culhane was aware of it, albeit that he put it into Cyril Dunne&rsquo;s pigeonhole and it out of his own remit.  How can Mr. Culhane reconcile seeking a criminal investigation into a colleague for highlighting that these matters had not been dealt with, albeit that he had passed them to the pigeonhole next door?  Given the criteria he applied to suggesting that Mr. Barrett should be investigated - with potential criminal charges involved - is it not Mr. Culhane, who, at least by virtue of his title as finance director, should at this point be investigated with a view to possible criminal issues?</p></speech>

The default position is "There is nothing to see here", until, in the event that a colleague is criminally investigated and found guilty for trying to uphold the law, a decision is made to come clean.  Mr. Culhane calls it the environment.  I call it the culture.  The environment was twisted and corrupt and subversion was the order of the day.</p></speech>

With regard to the minute of the 7 January 2008, I was writing to the assistant commissioner in charge of strategy who had responsibility for the college.  I wrote to him to inform him that Barry McGee would be carrying out this audit and that he should make all records available to Mr. McGee.  The assistant commissioner confirmed to me that all records would be made available.  Barry McGee carried out the report and it was submitted to me.  In the documentation the committee received this morning, in the last paragraph of the minute dated 25 May 2008, I gave advice that the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Comptroller and Auditor General should be informed about the matters.  There is an action plan I set out, which is attached to that minute.  The last paragraph is headed as the disclosure to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, and I also mentioned informing the internal auditor.</p></speech>

I am sorry for cutting across him again and for being so tough on him, but these are very important matters that deal with large amounts of taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  Having done that and having asked for the report in 2008, how in God's name can Mr. Culhane reconcile looking for, effectively, a criminal investigation into a colleague who was trying to see these matters through to a conclusion after which, when it was stuck in Cyril Dunne's pigeonhole, very little, if anything, happened?</p></speech>

I also directed Barry McGee to email Mr. Barrett a copy of the 2008 report.  I was being open with him as much as possible on the issues surrounding the college finance.</p> <p>  With regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the McGee report, we encountered difficulties with Deputy Commissioner Rice.  I continued to work away on that in the interim.  When Mr. Barrett came on with executive responsibility for the college, I gave him a copy of the McGee report in the expectation that he would start to implement those recommendations since he had the line responsibility for the college.</p></speech>

The circumstances under which co-operation was not forthcoming is a reality.  This was an uphill push.  I could not understand why.  The fact that the matter has remained in existence in the period since 2008 speaks for itself.  That is clear from the Deputy's questioning.  If these matters were of the scale and urgency that they clearly are to this committee then, as a consequence, they should have been dealt with much more expeditiously.</p></speech>

It did not happen.  Why was the finance directorate conducting audits?  There was an internal audit function in 2008.  I was head of it.  Why was that work not being done by internal audit?

Barry McGee referred to the report as a shadow audit but it was a review of the structures within the Garda College.  It did not get into the fine detail that the internal audit did.  For example, with the transfer of &euro;100,000 to the boat club, we never discovered that information because we did not delve into that level of detail.  It was looking at the broad level of structures inside the college and the operation of the restaurant, the shop and the Garda College Sportsfield Company.  We looked at the issues around the golf club also.  It was not a detailed audit.  It was a review that I instructed Barry McGee to undertake.</p></speech>

Even if it was a review, I believe this should have gone immediately to internal audit and we should have been allowed to do a full audit to go in to the depth required at that stage in 2008, rather than waiting several years.  Mr. Ruane has just handed me the McGee report: "Our examination and review have uncovered discrepancies in compliance to public financial procedures and exposes the organisation to substantial risk in terms of the internal control environment and governance environment as applied to Templemore college."  Given this sentence in the report, I believe that internal audit should have been informed immediately at that stage.</p></speech>

What he has just said goes right to the heart of why we are here in relation to the period from 2006 to 2016.  He said the issue should be dealt with within the organisation.  In other words, he is saying, "Circle the wagons".  He is confirming everything that Mr. Kelly and Mr. Barrett said and his mindset was to deal internally with all the evidence which had been presented to this committee.  His mindset was to keep all this evidence in-house, away from the purview of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It was not the responsibility of any individual to keep it internal.  The people in question had statutory responsibilities to give this information to other organisations.</p> <p>  I asked all witnesses if they were aware of the role and the function of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and internal audit.  Mr. Culhane said he was aware of these functions and roles so he will understand that it was not a case of keeping these in-house or internal, but of making sure people got the information.  Was Mr. Culhane part of withholding information from any of the organisations to which I refer?</p></speech>

I am sick of hearing that from Mr. Culhane in response to every question.  I have already explained to him the historic context was dealt with in Mr. Kelly's report.  There are two sets of correspondence, one in relation to Mr. Barrett, in which Mr. Culhane attempts to undermine his work, and another in relation to Mr. Kelly, in which he attempts to undermine his work.  Mr. Culhane states in writing that the report was unprofessional, misleading and mischievous.  Mr. Culhane has a duty and a responsibility to inform this committee today why he believed that Mr. Kelly's report was unprofessional, misleading and mischievous.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Culhane is having a <i>volte-face</i>moment given what he has just withdrawn.  I find that incredible.  For me, Mr. Culhane's evidence to this committee is probably the most incredible evidence I have heard as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, and not in a good way.  I have been following the issues in regard to the Garda Training College for a long time.  These can be divided into two categories, namely, issues of process not dealt with for decades and financial transactions.  There are so many issues in regard to process that we cannot get near the majority of the transactions in the limited time available to us.</p><p>It is regrettable that Mr. Cyril Dunne is otherwise engaged and could not be here today.  He is a key component in regard to this issue.  I would suggest that when Mr. Dunne does come before the committee a number of the witnesses here today should also be in attendance in the context of the evidence we will hear.  Following on from what I have heard today and at a previous meeting which I chaired, I believe that a number of people here today and a number of those in attendance at the previous meeting are running for cover based on the evidence that we have been given.  There are a number of other people who are doing the State some service in terms of the evidence they are giving.  That is without prejudice to our findings.  That is my summation of the evidence that has been given to this committee.</p></speech>

I want now to ask Mr. Barrett a few questions.  The Garda Commissioner previously stated at this committee that once these issues were brought to her attention on 27 July she did everything in her power to address them.  She established a group.  There was also the meeting which Mr. Barrett said lasted for over two hours but the Garda Commissioner said lasted for five minutes.  Mr. Barrett stands over his statement that it was a two hour meeting, I presume?</p></speech>

The Commissioner told us that upon hearing of the issues in Templemore she set up a committee and acted promptly.

It was at that meeting that I took the action to put together the report.  It is dealt with in my cover note to Mr. Cyril Dunne dated 6 July.  I will read this for clarity:</p><blockquote>I am pleased that you intend to advise the Audit Committee / Chair and that you intend to include the Director of Finance, the Head of Legal Affairs and the Director of Training on the Steering Committee.  For me, the devil is in the detail and I recommend that we adopt a prudent and transparent approach to our work and that you as Chair of the Steering Committee take the necessary time to brief all the key stakeholders whose support we will need to rely upon.</blockquote></speech>

I thank Mr. Culhane for being prompt.  This is very important.  We now have a situation where the Commissioner said she acted promptly after being informed on 27 July, but we have Mr. Barrett giving conflicting evidence stating that there was a meeting of the steering group on 2 July.  This group met for the first time not after 27 July, but on 2 July.  Mr. Culhane agrees with Mr. Barrett's statement.  Two members sitting across from me, the head of HR and people development and the head of finance, are saying that there was a steering group set up, which met on 2 July, and which was the steering group to deal with the issues in the Garda Training College in Templemore.  I ask Mr. Barrett and Mr. Culhane if there is anything inaccurate in what I have just said.  I will take that silence as a "no".</p></speech>

Mr. Barrett told me that on 30 June and it is documented.</p></speech>

We have now gotten through the evidence of the two witnesses, and effectively they are saying that there was a meeting on 2 July.  Let us be honest about it, there are certainly issues in respect of how the evidence given here previously relates to the witnesses' evidence.  To be fair to the two witnesses, they agree that there was a 2 July meeting of a steering group set up to deal with the issues in Templemore.  Despite this, the Garda Commissioner said she acted promptly when she was told, and set up the steering committee that met after 27 July.  For the record, there is a direct contradiction in evidence.  Furthermore, Mr. Ruane is now telling us that on 30 June he was given information by Mr. Barrett.  Will Mr. Ruane repeat what he said?</p></speech>

That is why he is needed here with the other witnesses.  For the record, we have a complete contradiction in evidence between that given on 4 May and that given today.  Evidence has been given that there was a 2 July meeting at which this steering group was set up.  We also have a letter from 30 June which says that the Commissioner had been informed.  Obviously, we will have to tease these things out but that is a direct contradiction in evidence.  Mr. Ruane has read out a letter dated 30 June.  If that does not raise serious concerns for each and every one of us, and indeed the Oireachtas, nothing else will.  I know we have a job to do.  I accept what Mr. Ruane is saying in respect of privilege and I know his role.  I will only ask him about facts and his opinion, rather than legal advice.  Is that okay?</p></speech>

In terms of distinguishing what advice I gave as opposed to how I felt at the time, I certainly felt it was a significant and serious issue.  If I can put it that way.</p></speech>

I know he is trying to distinguish between advice and what he felt.  I will read out section 41(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005: "The Garda Commissioner shall keep the Minister and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform fully informed", and the Act then lists off everything including issues of accountability and issues in respect of significant developments relating to public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Section 41(1)(d) mentions "any other matters that, in the Commissioner&rsquo;s opinion, should be brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention".  It was under that section that Mr. Ruane felt necessary, given his concerns and worries, to write to the Commissioner.</p></speech>

Again, it is confirmed in a note in the documents.</p><p>I would add that I had been part of the process that was conducted by Mr. Justice Fennelly at the time.  I took what I could from that in terms of how both I and the organisation might learn from his examination.</p></speech>

Distinct from his legal advice, does he feel that the issues that were being revealed and confided to him, as he stated, by Mr. Barrett were of such serious consequence to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that, if not acted upon immediately, they would be to the detriment of the Garda College and the force?</p></speech>

By September, I had serious reservations as to whether genuine progress was being made on these matters.  I reflected on it in the context of the Fennelly report.</p> <p>  The committee members have my documents before them.  The section that deals in particular with this has the heading "A Critical Inflection Point".  It pertains to the meeting in the college on the 27th and the scale of the issues arising.  Ultimately, I begin to deal with what Fennelly deals with by way of effective communication.  We heard Mr. Howard a little earlier describe the meeting in respect of any other business and what was, in effect, non-effective communication.</p> <p>  I took some considerable time over writing this note.  A period has elapsed since 2 July when I originally prepared a report to go to Mr. Howard through Mr. Dunne.  We are reaching now into the third week of September and I have concerns that the thing is not being treated in the multi-million off-balance-sheet, as Mr. Michael Culhane described it, activity that is continuing.  It is an active, ongoing enterprise within an organisation for which I have line responsibility.  In setting it out very clearly, I too go through the specific issues that Fennelly raises in respect of what a section 41 is intended to do and how this applies absolutely to the matters of gravity that I dealt with in my report of 6 July.  I was very deliberately putting it on the record.</p></speech>

I do not want to give a mistaken impression.  When I spoke to the Commissioner first, I presented the conferrings.  Yes, I did refer to Mr. Kelly and to Mr. Barrett, obviously.  I did voice my reservations, not just at the delay in respect of this.  I did discuss with her the manner in which this had been presented and my disappointment that it had passed.  I also expressed my serious concerns about the fact it seemed to have been in the organisation since 2008 and nothing had been done about it.  I emphasised to the Commissioner the absolute urgency of tackling it now.  That was the basic message that I wished to give to the Commissioner.  I believe, and the committee may question the Commissioner on this, that I brought with me and left some passages from the public financial procedures about the responsibilities of the Accounting Officer.</p></speech>

I look at all of these checks and balances such as the independent audit committees and internal audit.  A structure was put in place to carry out checks and balances and, clearly, that structure did not work.  Throughout Mr. Barrett's report that he wrote on 12 October 2016 one repeatedly sees the phrase "lessons to be learned".  Heavily, it falls back on the culture and why it happened despite all of the checks and balances.  Does Mr. Barrett believe that this could happen again?</p></speech>

The internal audit organisation would normally be one which would be given absolute co-operation and there would be no suggestion that reports of the order done in 2006, 2008 and 2010 would be denied to internal audit.  That could not happen, in my experience, but it happened here.  I began my particular efforts to address these issues in the knowledge that Niall Kelly was not aware of that history.  If anything, it sharpened my antennae to the prospect that perhaps there is not a great anxiety to deal with these matters, hence my letter of 20 September.</p></speech>

This was 12 days later.  I discovered at the meeting there was no such briefing and Mr. Howard has confirmed that.  I discovered that the substance of the meeting was, essentially, on foot of the letter written by Mr. Ruane to the Commissioner attaching the 2008 report concerning the Garda college, the so-called McGee report, and we were discussing the advices as given by Mr. Ruane to the Commissioner, which were very clear and very explicit, as I remember them.  That was the purpose of the discussion getting together on the 27th.  At that meeting I put my hand up and I said that the basis on which Ken has advised is the ongoing work that I am doing.  It was at that point that Cyril told me that he had not given the report to Mr. Howard.

Money was transferred in when fewer people visited the restaurant due to an embargo.  The money was transferred back in, if I remember correctly, from a credit union account.

I go into, in one section, cross-subsidisation and equipment being bought by the State but actually going into the shop or the kitchens in the restaurant, which are being operated as a kind of a private enterprise rather than a State-controlled canteen or shop.</p></speech>

A lot of this was put in the hands of people who did not have training or were inexperienced.  The diagnosis or solution is that a number of courses will be designed by the Institute of Public Administration.  I address the following question to both Mr. Kelly and Mr. Barrett.  Is that diagnosis correct?  I mean inexperienced people opening up bank accounts and moving money around.</p><p>It seems to me to be quite structured rather than inexperienced.

The way they were managing it was that every time they dreamt up something new, they opened another bank account and that would compartmentalise all the expenditure and receipts in relation to that issue rather than putting in a proper accounting system.</p></speech>

In my opening statement I said that we have two jobs going on at the moment - two audits currently - one of which touches on what Deputy Murphy is talking about, the cash management within the restaurant, shop and vending machines, and the bar in the college.  That is a current piece of work that we are doing at the moment.</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly has been there since 2007.  That must have been evident in the internal audits.  Did Mr. Kelly conduct an internal audit every year into every component or would it have been more occasional?</p></speech>

We have an audit plan based on a risk assessment of the whole organisation and we have limited resources so there is no way we can look at everything every year.  First of all, the McGee report was not forwarded to me.  If that had been forwarded to me, then I would have worked on it earlier.</p></speech>

That was my information up to that point.  That was the assumption I was making.  I had not seen the bank accounts.  I was unaware of the McGee report.</p></speech>

The money was voted as part of the justice Vote.  It would then have transferred to the college.  The money was to be used for recruits.  Not all of the money was being used.  It was being siphoned off and it was going off into the Sportsfield account.  If one was doing a basic balance sheet and looking at what was spent and what was taken in, surely that would have shown there was an amount of money going somewhere else?</p></speech>

I perceived it as low risk.  I was not aware of the background to these situations and I perceived it as low risk.  Maybe I was wrong but that was the perception.  Therefore I did not instigate audits in that area.</p></speech>

That is how it all happened.  The solution was to improve skill sets.</p></speech>

Let us be clear about it: we are talking about opening 50 accounts in a situation where it is understood that ministerial approval is required for the opening of an account.</p></speech>

In our discussion of 2 June, one of the things that stuck with me was, as the former Secretary General of the Department of Defence, Mr. Howard pointed out, the entire Defence Forces operated on either six or eight accounts.</p></speech>

It is difficult to comprehend that there were so many bank accounts.  I cannot understand how that was missed in the normal course of events and why it needed to take three reports to find some of that.  I find that very difficult to accept given all the checks and balances we have.  I have heard this since-----</p></speech>

Mr. Barrett quoted something which I heard from someone I know personally, who is a former senior person in the Garda from a long time ago.  He used the same language so it jumped out at me.  He spoke about what goes on when nobody is looking.  Essentially, there is a culture and Mr. Barrett goes into it in some detail.  I share his concerns.  Nobody was changed.  Despite the change in, for example, the senior ranks, the same behaviour or set of circumstances continued.  Various Commissioners had sight of the three reports, two of which were seen by previous Commissioners.  Does Mr. Barrett have any advice on the cultural issue?  He focused on it very heavily.  There are checks and balances but they do not seem to have mattered.  What is Mr. Barrett's advice?</p></speech>

There is no doubt about it; it is not a series of happenstance or accidents that the reports of 2006, 2008 or 2010 essentially got nowhere.  I refuse to believe that.  I do not think that is a tenable argument.</p></speech>

I did not know it was going to become an issue.  I probably should have explained it to him.

I was becoming aware of various frictions and difficulties that might arise in relation to Mr. Kelly's interim audit report.  I was conscious of the need to maintain a distance because of my role as independent reviewer and quality assurer of the work carried out by Mr. Kelly.</p></speech>

They will always be high-ticket items in terms of being public events.  One of the recommendations was that the land would be transferred to the OPW.  That would have been picked up in the OPW's accounts and an explanation for where the land had come from would then have had to have been provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It was always going to be the case that the resolution of these matters would be in the public domain.  As such, I did not seek to hide it or minimise the importance of these events.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.700" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017053100002#Y01500"><p>Listening to the evidence here this morning and what has been said to my colleagues, what is most striking, from this last exchange in particular, is the divergence of views, especially in that last exchange between Mr. Ruane and Mr. Culhane.  Sometimes the early exchanges were bordering on hostility towards each other, with people needing to make freedom of information, FOI, requests to get information.  This is all from people who are supposed to be on the same side, which is the side of the people, in order to give proper evidence and ensure ultimately the correct expenditure of public money in order that people can be satisfied their hard-earned money is spent appropriately and accounted for.  If we as committee members are surprised, one can imagine that people looking in are aghast at that last exchange and what has transpired here this morning.  This is from the civilian side of the force, not even the officers.  Mr. Barrett said he had spent a lifetime ensuring the proper expenditure of money in multinationals and that it would not happen there, but it is unreal that it happens repeatedly in the public sector, with these issues being illuminated.</p><p>At the heart of this is the misappropriation of funds in the force that is responsible for justice in this State.  As Mr. Culhane said, it was a culture that went back to the 1960s.  It is fair to say that the swinging sixties seem to have been kept going to the present day.  If Austin Powers had turned up in his time machine in Templemore, he would not have known that he was in a different decade given the testimony we have listened to.</p><p>Keeping to the report around which the Chairman has asked us to frame our remarks, recommendation No. 4 says that, &quot;Garda Staff assigned to administrative roles in the College had no training or experience in administration ... no knowledge of Public Financial Procedures (the Blue Book) [as Mr. Howard said, the roadmap] and associated governance codes [for] Public Procurement ... Risk Management&quot;, and then it goes on to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government Accounting Unit.  Being fair, does Mr. Kelly believe this is a simple case of the people who were <i>in situ</i>not being skilled and not having the necessary competence rather than a wilful misappropriation of funds or maybe even corruption?  Did they in fact believe that the surplus money was their money, as he pointed out at the beginning of his opening remarks, quoting Deputy Commissioner Rice at the time?  Is it the result of the arrangements that were in place, which Mr. Kelly touches on, and the effect of these arrangements going back to the 1980s?  In terms of capitation grants and at a time when things were going well and surpluses were being accumulated, as Mr. Kelly said, every time a scheme was dreamed up, there was another bank account and things were kept on an individual basis rather than a cumulative one.  Does he believe it is fair to paint everyone with the same brush, that there was wilful misappropriation, or was it the case that there was incompetence?</p></speech>

The basic legislation in this regard is 1866.  It is not as if there is some sort of new governance code that has just come in in recent years.  This is going back a long time and people should know about it.  However, the fact is that when I went to audit the college, I found staff who were trained as garda&iacute;, effectively with no or very little administrative training, who were running large-scale enterprises with a lot of money flowing through them, and with no real assistance.  One could sympathise with them.  They were put into these jobs, they did not have much training for them, and they muddled through as best they could, but that was not adequate.</p></speech>

I asked whether it was wilful misappropriation or incompetence because, going back to Mr. Culhane's letter to Mr. Kelly from February 2017, in point No. 1 on the second page of the letter, he says that on several occasions Mr. Kelly was reported to have stated in relation to college personnel that people would be led away in handcuffs.  Who were those people if it was not a case of corruption or wilful misappropriation but of incompetence?</p></speech>

In Mr. Culhane's letter of October 2015 to the Commissioner and deputy commissioner, he used several adjectives in respect of Mr. Barrett in that letter.  The journalists sitting in the Gallery can tell him the difference between a factual straight report and a colour piece.  I suggest that Mr. Culhane's letter is a colour piece because he laced it with adjectives.</p> <p>  I will elaborate.</p><p>The letter dated 24 October 2015 from Mr. Michael Culhane to the Commissioner, the deputy commissioner and CEO, refers to the meeting of 14 October.  In referencing Mr. John Barrett, Mr. Culhane referred to his usual sweeping style.  For anybody who practises journalism or deals with the importance of words, Mr. Culhane is creating a theme using words such as "his usual sweeping style", "he did not believe him" and "he just stopped short of calling the deputy commissioner a liar".  Mr. Culhane talks about a "palpable shock of silence in the room", "Mr. Barrett's irrational behaviour" and a "lack of respect for an acting deputy commissioner".  He has framed that in a very particular way.  He has laced it with adjectives.</p><p> Was there a silence in the room because these guys were making things uncomfortable and getting to the heart of the job they were supposed to be doing? </p></speech>

He refers to a person's lack of respect for an acting deputy commissioner.  It is as if Mr. Culhane was defending the force rather than defending the integrity of the job that was supposed to be done.</p></speech>

There are some journalists in the Gallery who will explain that to Mr. Culhane.  They have to write factual reports about what happens here today.  If the editor tells them to write a colour piece they will use adjectives.  Mr. Culhane is an executive director of finance and services yet he has laced his letter with adjectives that create a negative impression of a person sitting beside him.  I want to get to the heart of why he would do that.  Was it a character assassination?</p></speech>

Mr. Culhane refers to Mr. Barrett's "usual sweeping style" and what one elicits from that is Mr. Culhane has a prejudice against this man from the get go, using words like "stopped short of calling him a liar" and "a palpable shock of silence in the room".

He said earlier that as an extensive part of his audit, he spent three months at Templemore, talking to people - not just looking at the balance sheets - and getting the background behind the figures.  Mr. Kelly said in his opening remarks that the culture may still exist.  Given his strong beliefs, his statement that this culture might still exist, his background checks, can he tell me who is responsible for fuelling this culture?  Fuelling a culture has to come from a central point.  I do not want to hear about culture as an abstract idea, that is not the job of this committee.  If at the end of all these hearings, we have a nice tidy package, that it was just the culture going back to the 1960s.1980s, we will have achieved nothing.  Mr. Kelly will have done himself a disservice if this falls under "culture".  Who was fuelling that culture?  Who was keeping the information suppressed?  Who was making sure that people such as Mr. Barrett were having to put in FOIs?</p> <p>  There is a fear here that by attacking the force, we are attacking every junior garda.  We are not.  We are trying to find out who is fuelling that culture because Mr. Kelly's report speaks for itself.  What I believe people want to hear from this committee is the chain of command of how the off-balance sheet activity and "enterprise", as Mr. Barrett called it developed and existed.  I would appreciate if Mr. Kelly could start to categorise the chain of command for us in that culture and to make it real and tangible for us today.   </p></speech>

I am afraid the issue will be put under one big umbrella.  There is a very clear divergence of views on the work that Mr. Kelly is doing but there is no good in saying that it was just the culture.  Were successive Accounting Officers ignorant of what was happening?  Would Mr. Kelly agree or disagree with that statement?</p></speech>

There is a problem in what Mr. Kelly has just said.

It is being packaged as an historical legacy issue.  An audit will happen and that is fine.  The point I am making is that it has been extrapolated here that Mr. Kelly and Mr. Barrett, having uncovered various issues were then being thwarted in their work, having got on a path that was uncomfortable for people.  I was asking Mr. Kelly who was thwarting him, if it was the gentleman who is sitting beside him, was Mr. Culhane trying to thwart him and who else was trying to thwart him?  I would like to hear that, because otherwise it gets put under an umbrella and we are not able to do a report on it.</p></speech>

What Mr. Kelly is saying to me is that the fact that information was not forwarded to him is hindering him and not allowing him to do his job.  If Mr. Kelly is saying to me that the executive director of finance and the deputy commissioner are not providing him with information required to do his work, what I am trying to get to here is the chain of command.  How high does this go?  Who is trying to stop Mr. Kelly from doing his job of uncovering what was obviously a misappropriation of funds?  Where does this stop?</p></speech>

It is clear in my minute of May 2008 that I tried to advance this as much as possible.  I submitted my report to the chief administrative officer, who in turn submitted it to the Commissioner, who in turn agreed with the recommendations in my report.  In parallel to that then, it was given to Deputy Commissioner Rice who was the deputy commissioner SCM at the time.  It is clear from his minute that he did not agree with the report.  He is quoted here about holding the moneys within the college.  Chief Superintendent Nolan, who was the director of training at the time, did a report in 2010 where effectively he introduced easy recommendations but did not fundamentally alter the structure of the college.  When chief administrative officer Leamy retired or resigned I was reporting to Deputy Commissioner Rice for approximately two years.  I also encountered the same resistance, so I certainly want to put it on the record that I am not thwarting Mr. Kelly in his work.  In terms of what I have done and tried to do to address these issues, I did the best I could.  If the organisation decided that it did not want these reports or my report to get the visibility it got, it decided it, not me.</p></speech>

The witness is saying that there is evidence for this in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the only thing he is citing to this view today is a letter from eight years ago.  Does the witness take my point?  He has expressed confidence in the deputy commissioner and the Commissioner.  I am trying to be exact here now.  I could understand that sentence if it read that there was this culture.  Mr. Kelly however is saying "is", as in today.  Now he is saying that he has full confidence in the Commissioner.

He pointed out that he was accused of a number of things and that he wanted to put on record that he acted in 2008 and reported it.  Am I correct in saying then that Deputy Commissioner Rice came back to Mr. Culhane and said that he disagreed with the report and that that was the end of the matter?  Is it fair to say that Mr. Culhane has done nothing since then?</p></speech>

In 2009 I wrote to the Revenue Commissioners seeking charitable status for the sports field company.  There are emails about the restaurant staff and redundancy in March 2009.  There are emails to Chief Superintendent Nolan seeking an update on the training activities in the Garda College, again from March 2009.  There is also an exchange of emails between myself, Mr. Leamy and Mr. McGee about the financial controls in the college from June 2009.  There are emails from 2009 about potential tax issues in the college arising from various activities, and again in 2010, also regarding tax.  Jumping ahead a bit, we met PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2016.  There are more emails between myself and Superintendent Nolan about the report, and then in September further emails about the restaurant, the shop and the sports field company.</p> <p>  During that time as well then, when the recession came and the college closed down for a few years, this item, while not quite put on hold, did not perhaps have the same urgency that it should have had.  I was dealing with many other issues at the time.  This was not the only item on my agenda that required my time.  I had a large number of items to attend to.  So there was action in the intervening period as well. </p></speech>

In that length of time cover ups, mismanagement and non-existent corporate governance were occurring in a college that we all had great faith in and through which we put our future garda&iacute;.  Here we are and it took until last year to come to the evidence we now hear around the litany of mismanagement.  With report after report, the Walsh report, the Fennelly report and the McGee report, it has taken until now to find out what is wrong.  It is totally unbelievable that this could be allowed to happen in a modern society and that the system was left in place for so long.  We could go through it all day but I will not review what everyone has already said.</p> <p> Let us go back to previous reports back in 2008 where the CEO noted that the director of finance be authorised to conduct a full and comprehensive audit of all financial activity in the college.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Internal Audit Service, GIAS, was not informed of the proposed audit at that time.  Recommendations put in place at the time included that 13 bank accounts be closed; a new college administrator role was to be established at superintendent rank; and new processes were to be put in place and reviewed at weekly performance accountability framework meetings.  Of the 12 specific recommendations from the director of finance's report, only two were implemented.  Of the six points agreed in correspondence between the commissioner and the chief administrative officer, none was implemented.  Why was this? Why did they not happen, after all the reports down the years?</p> <p>  In 2012 - and I have all the recommendations marked off here - compliance with public procurement requirements was implemented on the recommendations of the Garda inspectorate at the time and the development review group.  On 16 July 2015 another report stated it was not happy with the system but the system was still not fixed.  I ask Mr. Culhane to explain why not. </p></speech>

There is a structure where it is an assistant commissioner who reported to the deputy commissioner.  They would have been charged with the responsibility of putting the necessary structures in place.  I advised on what structures were required.  If they had failed to put the correct structures in place they, rather than me, will have to account for themselves.</p></speech>

I can only give advice.  If people refuse to accept my advice then what can I do? I could not say to a deputy commissioner who is superior to me "I instruct you to do this".  With regard to what I can do, I urge that the necessary controls be put in or amended in the organisation, and that they be pressed on that.  I have written many reports repeating my recommendations.  At times all I can do is to offer the advice and I hope they would see the benefit of it, accept it and implement it.</p></speech>

Is there total mistrust within the whole organisation at the moment, both among the civilians who are here, all working for the good of the Garda, and among the garda&iacute; and the Garda authority itself?  Can each one of the witnesses answer that much, given what we are looking at in the evidence today?  Is there a total breakdown of communications and trust in the procedures and in the way the whole thing is handled?  Are they all at loggerheads with one another or is there any unity of purpose?</p></speech>

I think this is a very significant issue.  I think, around this, I have a very substantial difference of opinion with the finance director.  I think there is a very significant difference between outputs and outcomes.  There may be memos and there may be meeting details, as Mr. Culhane outlined, but it changed nothing.  The show went on.  On my arrival in Templemore, I just could not believe what it was that sat in plain view and, despite all the memos and all of the history Mr. Culhane has referred to, that it continued in plain view, contrary to the blue book.  While Mr. Kelly may be able to point to the fact that garda&iacute; may not have had the training, the finance directorate cannot hide behind any such lack of knowledge.  That is my concern.</p> <p>  This is not personal.  Let us be clear.  I want to respond to Deputy Cassells because I think it is a really good point.  This is not some kind of Orwellian, four legs good, two legs bad - those who wear uniforms, those who do not.  It is nothing to do with that.  This is a fundamental issue about accountability around the public purse.  We have an obligation to come before the committee and tell it the truth.  The truth as I know it is written in the document that I shared with the committee.  It is documented in real time.  I have had contemporaneous discussions with Mr. Ruane throughout this and he has minuted those meetings.  If the committee members want to take all of those details, and I would encourage them, they will see the sequence of events in its minutiae.  However, the reality is I did not create this.  I stumbled upon it.  I did not get, "Let us resolve it", as the first response.  That is a reality.  Those who I would have imagined were statutorily responsible for dealing with matters like this did not race to my aid.  No more than that do I need to say.</p></speech>

He is one of the people I trust.  I am not saying I do not trust others but fair play to him.  Every word he said, I accept it.</p> <p>  I want to move to recommendation No. 7.  Was it Mr. Barrett who met Superintendent Pat McCabe?  He was dismissive, and when Mr. Barrett met him first, he said, "You have been doing a bit of digging".</p></speech>

Let me put this in context, and, again, I am using Mr. Culhane's word "context".  Superintendent Pat McCabe is a long-serving, respected officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I think Superintendent McCabe in many ways became the administrator of this on inheritance.  This structure had been set up before Superintendent McCabe's term as administrator began and he continued it - there is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

I said, "Explain this to me".  None of it was accusatory.  This is not about levelling accusation.  This is seeking to understand where it all began.  To discover that these very same issues were well understood and documented way back, for many years, but were still, for better or for worse, allowed to continue, that is the bit I find the most shocking about this whole thing.  It had a life that continued in the dynamic, as Mr. Michael Howard described it, and that continued almost to the current date, until such time as Mr. Kelly-----</p></speech>

Did he feel there was any mismanagement of funds?  Was there anything untoward, given all the different bank accounts we are talking about, some 48 to 50 bank accounts, some of which were closed down and some of which were kept open?  The number was supposed to go down to three and six were then kept open.  That is all in Mr. Kelly's report, although there is too much to take in.  I was trying to go through this last night and just could not take it all in as there is too much.  Overall, as a general view, after all his auditing and all he did last year, can he say categorically there was no mismanagement of funds overall?  There might have been dealing within banking, and moving of funds from one account to another - the golf money being paid into restaurant bank accounts, and all this kind of thing - but was there any misappropriation of funds?</p></speech>

We have referred several times to Mr. Culhane's letter to Mr. Kelly dated 20 February concerning the internal audit report.  I draw attention to something else Mr. Culhane said a moment ago.  The letter included various complaints to Mr. Kelly, one of which related to offshore bank accounts, which we have clarified do not exist.  There may have been a reference to them but we are satisfied that there is no evidence that they exist.</p><p>Point 2 of the letter is as follows. </p><blockquote>In front of junior staff in the Finance Section you stated on the phone that what was going on in the College was comparable to what had gone on in the charity, <i>Console</i>.  Your indiscretions are a source of concern. </blockquote> <p>Did Mr. Kelly make a comparison with Console?</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly stated a moment ago that there was no personal gain.  This is why I am homing in on the Console issue.  I do not know if Mr. Kelly made a comparison with Console but if he did, that can only have meant in the eyes of the public that there was personal gain by someone.  He is now saying he has no evidence of personal gain, which I accept.  Let us all hope that the evidence backs up that statement.  If, however, Mr. Kelly is satisfied that there was no personal gain, any reference to, or comparison with, Console, if he made one, would have been utterly gratuitous.  I do not know whether he made such a comparison.</p></speech>

Maybe we will ask Mr. Culhane about these serious allegations because there was lots of personal gain in the Console case.  If it is being suggested that what happened in Console happened in Templemore.  Mr. Kelly is happy it did not happen and there was no gain.  I ask Mr. Culhane if he can recall who gave him the information he put in his letter.</p> <p>  In the same letter, at point 5 on the final page, Mr. Culhane states: "You stated to Superintendent McCabe that there was evidence of fraud in the College and that you were looking for evidence of wrong doing in the College."  I know Mr. Kelly will say that is hearsay but did he make any remark about fraud?</p></speech>

This is third party information which he included in the letter because it was relayed to him.  It is hearsay and putting hearsay in letters such as this poses a serious risk.  Mr. Kelly indicated that most of the allegations Mr. Culhane has made about him on these matters are based on hearsay and information from unidentified persons.  This creates a difficulty when somebody is challenging an internal audit report and we go through the letter and find that the bulk of the reasons for not being happy with the report are possibly based on hearsay.  Mr. Culhane will understand that the committee has a difficulty when we receive letters, the content of which we cannot back up in terms of who said what, when or where.  Mr. Kelly states he did not say some of these things or has no recollection of saying them.  Does Mr. Culhane understand that these letters cause the committee difficulties?</p></speech>

He put these matters in a letter in response to the draft interim audit report.</p><p>I want Mr. Culhane to produce evidence about how he came to write that letter.  It is a serious letter and we need to see how he came to write it and what evidence or information he had to allow him to write it.  If those elements of hearsay cannot be backed up it is a very serious issue.  It adds to a view people have about trying to get the audit report accepted.

I have pointed out how dangerous it is to send letters that are substantially based on hearsay.  The audit report is based on facts and evidence and the contrary letter - we are now fairly well satisfied - is based on hearsay.  Mr. Culhane might be able to back it up.  I am not saying he will not but we need to be able to get to the bottom of it.  What is important about this letter, for the public, is this is not 2008, 2006, 2010 or 2015.  It is only a couple of months since the report.  This is not a legacy issue; it is a very current response to the report that is in front of us.  We have a job to do at the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of items that might have happened in previous years.  A module will be dealing with the current issue.  This is very current and we need to get to the bottom of it.  Will Mr. Howard comment?</p></speech>

I was advised it is not for me, as chairman, to interfere with anybody's right to comment on the report while it was there.  In March I wrote a brief email to Mr. Culhane simply saying to him that I considered the letters were an inappropriate intervention.  They had been copied to me and there was a letter sent to me which made certain requests of me, which I felt were not appropriate for somebody who was the subject of the audit.  When our process completed, I wrote to the Commissioner as my term was ending because I felt I was under a duty to protect the independence of the internal audit function.  I should inform the committee I have written to the Commissioner and handed it on as an issue to Dr. Cyril Sullivan, who has replaced me as the chairman.</p></speech>

It is a serious issue if it has to be withdrawn after it has been put out there during this process.  Mr. Howard has indicated he came to possibly a similar view as chairman of the internal audit committee and was very concerned about the contents.  He wrote to Mr. Culhane about that letter.  It would have been helpful if Mr. Howard had told us about it but we know now.  Mr. Howard has written to Mr. Culhane expressing his views and has also written to the Commissioner and we are now awaiting a response.

He is the internal auditor of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and cannot wash his hands and say that this is a separate entity about which he does not want to know.  He should be asking how these people are being employed, what the structure is, how they are being paid, how the tax is being returned, what bank accounts they have, what name are the bank accounts in and how much is in the bank accounts.

Mr. Ruane made me aware, as an aside at the meeting in Templemore, that a document had been prepared by Mr. Barrett on 27 July 2015.  This is in my opening response.  The report provided by Mr. Barrett was not given to the audit committee at its meeting on 15 July 2015.  How could I have known?</p></speech>

The biggest criticism I have of Mr. Kelly's office is that if I read the content and detail of that document back in 2011, I would have been suspicious.  Mr. Culhane is equally guilty because he was writing things that are not true in this document.  He has not checked or had the details vouched.  I am hugely concerned about the procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is very clear that the process was not followed by either the witness or Mr. Culhane.</p></speech>

I got a report from Mr. Culhane which provided assurance to me.  It reduced the level of risk that was apparent.  At the same time, the college operation effectively closed shop.  From 2011 to 2014, the college did not have any apparent risk issues.</p></speech>

What the witness is saying to me is ridiculous.  From my perspective, if I was auditing a company in the private sector and the group financial controller said to me that there were no issues and that the bank balances were okay, I would not just walk away.  The witness was relying on Mr. Culhane.  His job was to challenge people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to make certain that processes were followed to ensure there was evidence to assure him that the organisation's practices were operating as desired.  The Revenue Commissioners should also check this in terms of the number of tax numbers.  The witness cannot tell me how many tax numbers are in operation in this entity, which is even more damning.</p></speech>

My understanding is that some of those proceeds are not being spent.  They are being spent on non-core Garda issues, if one likes, and the moneys are not going where they should be going.  We would like to get information on that soon.  Obviously it is relevant to the Committee of Public Accounts.  If there are other accounts, we should be made aware of those as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The ten minute slots will give everybody a chance to contribute in the next hour and people can ask a further line of questions after that.</p> <p>  I again thank the witnesses for being with us here today.  Depending on the time, and I do not how long it will take, but it is 5 o'clock now.  In about two hours, if we are not near finished, I propose that we take a short ten minute to allow people to stretch their legs.  We will not sit here for an unfair period, from that point of view.

Can I be very honest with the Deputy and cut to the end of it?  I have found this an extremely demanding and difficult thing, personally, to do.  I will put it as honestly as that.  When I took on the chairing of the audit committee, and I say this in no critical way, it was suggested to me that it is just something where one comes along and one chairs four or six meetings a year.  For the first part of it, it was busy and there was a lot of work done.  Then this detonated.  I was simply being very honest and saying, yes, this is very difficult, even today.</p></speech>

All of that feeds into the pattern of "let us keep this internal and outside the purview of others".  I know that is not what has been said here.  I am saying that it is difficult to take anything other than that from the note. </p></speech>

I will be completely forthright about matters in all areas."  I vested my trust, quite frankly, in Mr. Howard.  I did so at the meeting on 2 June.</p><p>I did expect that he would return to me but in the circumstances, when I sought advice on this, one of the things that emerged was "he is the statutory office holder, do not sweat it".  In fairness, as I learned subsequently, he acted his part completely with honour.</p></speech>

The vital paragraph he removed was the one that referred to giving assurances on financial controls.  Removing that paragraph was a dereliction of Mr. Kelly's duty.  He felt when he wrote the paragraph that he could not have confidence in the financial controller yet he removed a paragraph, which gives us the impression that there is no problem and he had confidence in the assurances.  Can he understand how difficult it is for me to reconcile that with his earlier testimony that he was frustrated and that information was being withheld?</p></speech>

We have seen multiple contradictions between Garda management, among themselves and with the Commissioner.  We have seen evidence that two members of civilian senior management do not have full confidence in their colleagues.  We see issues across the board over financial procedures to the point where we do not even know if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is tax compliant.  We are talking about the Garda College and Garda finances but it is symbolic of a whole range of issues in the Garda.  It is GUBU territory as far as I am concerned.  This is a crisis for our country.  The evidence that has been given here today means we have a crisis in our country with the Garda and the justice system.  There is no way, given the evidence we have heard over ten hours or so, that I, as a public representative, could have confidence in senior Garda management or how the Garda is run.  There is absolutely no way; it is impossible.</p> <p>  I will restate some evidence from earlier and then I will do a quick fire round.  I would appreciate if people could be quick because otherwise I will keep coming back in all night.  Mr. Barrett gave evidence earlier which I will repeat because it is critically important.  We have two issues here.  We have the process, which is the issue we are really dealing with, and then we have the issues on the finances.  We are not even getting to the latter because there are so many questions about processes going back decades.</p> <p>  As a result of my concerns about how the Garda is run in the State, I need to zone in on up-to-date processes.  I will sum up what Mr. Barrett said in his evidence and he may correct me if I am wrong.  The Commissioner appeared before the committee and said the first time she was made aware of this was 27 July.  We heard that from the Commissioner.  The evidence she gave as a witness is she acted promptly.  There had already been a committee set up to deal with the issues in Templemore on 2 July.  It met on 2 July and both Mr. Barrett and Mr. Culhane were at it.  I asked Mr. Culhane if he agreed with what Mr. Barrett said and he said he did.  This is very important.  We now have evidence, which is a complete contradiction of what the current Garda Commissioner said about when these issues were being investigated.  To be fair, the Commissioner will appear before us in the coming weeks.  She says it was 27 July and that she acted promptly.  Two witnesses here have confirmed the committee had already been set up on 2 July.  The committee met after that.  I will ask questions about that.  </p> <p>  The second issue was raised by Mr. Ruane.  He has notes, as the legal representative, which state he was informed by Mr. Barrett that Mr. Cyril Dunne, the head of administration, had informed the Garda Commissioner about the issues in Templemore.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

In terms of full disclosure to the committee today, I received an e-mail from Mr. Dunne asking me to consider the draft I had prepared as I had gone into an inappropriate level of detail.  I did redraft the note, but I did it on the basis that I would keep the earlier draft on my file, and it is available for the committee.</p></speech>

I should explain in terms of the sequence of who served, the chief administrative officer left in December.  Assistant Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in took up office towards the end of 2015 so he would not have been involved in the initial briefing of the committee.  The Deputy asked me what I said to him.  I would have urged upon him the need to deal with this urgently and the view that I had taken it very seriously.  Mr. Kelly and I had talked about notifying the Comptroller and Auditor General.  To be fair to Mr. Kelly, I offered to make the first call-----</p></speech>

Did he express a view that this was incredible stuff, it had been going for years, he was very concerned about it and believed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had real issues here and that it would come out?  He was an assistant commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is sitting on the external audit committee, which has not been told about all of this stuff, which has been going on for a decade and more.

Was there a meeting or any conversations regarding preparing for this committee?  When Mr. Nugent was gathering evidence or looking for information, did he write and speak to every witness here to gather up that information?

People in my office would have sought information and materials that are there.  We would have continued a process of looking beyond even the individuals who are here to get that material.  In respect of preparing for the meeting today, I suggested a meeting on Monday of the people here - not for the purposes of discussing what their evidence would be but for the purposes of ensuring that they had access to all of the materials that were needed for the meeting today.  There were individuals who were concerned about meeting so we did not have the meeting and the meeting did not proceed.</p></speech>

Is there any document in any shape or form of which Mr. Nugent as the conduit bringing it to the committee is aware that is relevant and is not in the possession of this committee?  I ask Mr. Nugent to think before he answers.</p></speech>

Management did supply us with two documents, one dating back to 1989 which would suggest that we would have had some involvement in investment accounts and another document relating to 2008.  Our view is that since the Secretary General of the Department was the Accounting Officer, the Department would have been aware of the arrangements that were put in place back in the 1990s.  Of course, we were involved in the Walsh committee which led to the establishment of the college as an institute of education.  We were involved in a number of project groups around the implementation of the Walsh report.  Our assumption is that we were involved in the development of the arrangements but we do not have any records ourselves.</p></speech>

I was concerned because I was invited to that meeting at the tail end of the chiefs' meeting that happened in the college that day.  It was not in my diary as a formal meeting.  It lasted well into the evening as we discussed the advices that  Mr. Ken Ruane had furnished to the Commissioner.  That was the basis on which the meeting was called.  Appended to those advices was the 2008 report written by Mr. McGee.  The discussion was a detailed one around that.  I went through, from a process perspective, the report that I had written for Mr. Cyril Dunne of the 6th.  It is a very simple seven by three, 21 item agenda and we discussed that.  My certainty around the impact and importance of that meeting was based on the fact that there was a view taken at the meeting that this section 41 was not required but frankly, that is not at all how I felt about it.</p></speech>

I saw it - and I described it in my note - as an inflection point.  I did so because in the room there was a very real discussion.  I had provided Mr. Dunne with the report, dated 6 July, which deals with 21 items.  It had the quantum in there of the amount of money.  In the very first box I make the point quite clearly, based on some certain experience, that I felt, as a consequence of these matters, that the accounts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were compromised.  That is how I would have viewed it if I was looking at a due diligence exercise in the private sector and I do not think the Comptroller and Auditor General would disagree with me.</p></speech>

When I walked out the door after that meeting, I was concerned to ensure that I wrote a note when I got home that evening of what had transpired.  Hence, I do not lightly say that the meeting ended on the 37th minute because as I walked out the door, I checked my watch.  I think I had a discussion a couple of days later with Mr. Kenneth Ruane so that I had briefed somebody of the seriousness.  It was an inflection point, no doubt.</p></speech>

The witnesses have been very clear with the committee that the returns have been filed.  If a return is filed, the quantity &ndash; the amount &ndash; is on the return and it is very clear whether it was discharged or not.  That is black and white stuff.  It does not wash to say the issue is being discussed with Revenue.  It is not a discussion point.  If one makes a return, one makes an assessment and one quantifies the amount that is due.  It is black and white whether that has been discharged or not.</p></speech>

This comes back to this general issue that it was not a company, but it was being considered as an entity in its own right.  Deputy Connolly asked the question, when are we going to resolve this.  Part of the issue relates to the fact that the staff who are employed in the restaurant are associated with that entity.  The reason why we have not been able to close down the bank account associated with that entity is because we have to regularise the position of those employees in the first place.</p></speech>

There are arguments about words and including paragraphs, but as responsible citizens to the State in relation to tax, I have not seen attention given to that.  We want that.  Regarding the organisation's liability to the State, the internal audit report states that under the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2010, officeholders in the public service over a certain grade or rank are required to make an annual declaration of interest, including any directorships held.  This includes garda&iacute; of the rank of superintendent and above, and civil servants of the rank HEO and above.</p> <p>  How many people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are required under that legislation to make an annual return of their interests and directorships to SIPO?

The outputs was a 2008 report, another output was a 2010 report.  We are all very determined that the internal audit report is now going to have an outcome.  That is the infuriating thing.  I concur with the witness's sentiments.  I am infuriated that nothing happened as a consequence of all of these outputs.  It is typical case of a report on the shelf gathering dust. </p><p> Mr. Culhane just told us that the Sportsfield account is separate.  It did not seem to be separate when it came to transferring money into the restaurant, from the restaurant into the Sportsfield account.  That was public Vote money that went into a private entity.  Mr Kelly was asked earlier if this was all incompetence and he answered that yes, his assessment was that it was incompetence.  That is completely at odds with what he gave us in his opening statement.  He is drawing attention to something here: "I strongly believe that any surplus money does not belong to the State but rather is owned by the members of AGS from whom they were collected."   This continues.  There are a number of references in this opening statement to not being told about things.  That is not incompetence.  I ask Mr. Kelly to come back and think about what he has said in describing that as incompetence.  There are things here that were done for a very deliberate reason and Mr. Kelly has referred to them in his opening statement.  Can I ask that Mr. Kelly come back to me with his initial response to this?</p></speech>

I have outlined in my audit report and in my opening statement that there was a lack of transparency and a lack of information coming to me.  I have outlined that fairly well.  What the Deputy is asking me is whether that was deliberate or was that an oversight.</p></speech>

The way that things were set up in the college, they were effectively set up outside the Vote.  We have reviewed and discussed that.  With regard to how the college was funded, there was a stipend per week per student.  That went into the restaurant account.  The restaurant account was effectively the engine within the Garda College which then distributed money to other activities within the college.  Currently it is the college administrator who has responsibility for these entities but previously it was the director and the college administrator.</p></speech>

The restaurant was the vehicle through which money was sent to a private company, the Sportsfield company, which Mr. Culhane has no responsibility for.  Is that right?  Mr. Culhane knew all of this.  He referred to his own 2008 report.  He had an overview of this.  Returning to the point about outputs and outcomes, did it never occur to Mr. Culhane that this should not be continuing?  That this is wrong, that this money is voted for a specific purpose and it is not being used for that purpose.  Where was Mr. Culhane's responsibility in that?</p></speech>

I had a meeting yesterday with Niall Kelly on a couple of IA reports and issues.  He again raised the issue of the Garda College Finance Reports.  After a lot of tooing and frooing he agreed holding off completing the college IA report for a period of 3 months.  I reckon that is enough time for us to sort out the taxation and any other financial issues and get a final report to the Commissioner.  Will you work to that deadline and get all the outstanding issues resolved, say end of July?  Thanks, John.  </blockquote></speech>

I want to go back to the 2008 report, Mr. Culhane.</p><p>In respect of the 2008 report we heard about Revenue and it was disclosed that the Garda Sportsfield Company was also used as a vehicle to develop the Garda college golf and leisure club.  Revenue disallowed the claim because the club did not contract to develop the golf course.  I do not know if anyone here was ever in a company that the Revenue Commissioners audited.  It is an awful feeling and not something one ever forgets.  They go through absolutely everything.  Do the witnesses recognise that?  They make it really uncomfortable and one would never want to put oneself through that again.  The idea of talking about not being able to be sure about Revenue and compliance after having that experience beggars belief.  I know the Sportsfield Company is a limited company and I am not sure if Mr. Kelly has a function in that but would it not have really heightened his concerns about the kind of interrogation that was needed in respect of the accounts presented? </p></speech>

To be honest, at the very beginning of this entire process I had every faith that Mr. Dunne was of like mind about where this thing was going, so it was not in any way creating a scenario of four legs good, two legs bad, and I am right and you are wrong.</p><p>I was saying to Mr. Cyril Dunne that there were some serious guidelines laid down by the Fennelly report that we needed to apply to this particular issue arising in the college.  It all surrounded the issue of effective communication.  We heard Mr. Howard talk earlier about the September meeting when there was an item under any other business, AOB, that made reference to the college.  Despite the fact that my report had been sitting there since 6 July, it was an AOB oral delivery and it clearly did not catch the imagination of the chairman.  That was his testimony earlier.  From 27 July - when Mr. Dunne had said it in that meeting in the college with the Commissioner, the acting deputies and himself - I became conscious that the material I had prepared for 6 July had not been given to the audit committee.  My antennae were tweaking a little bit as to why that had not happened.  By September, when I had this meeting with Mr. Dunne, I called him out and said that the Fennelly report should be read.  The report talks of the need for effective communication and how the section 41 issue should be interpreted.  I was conscious of the fact that on 24 July, Mr. Ken Ruane had written a letter saying that it was a section 41 matter and this was the advice over which privilege was being claimed.  I know that because I sat in on the meeting of 27 July where these issues were discussed.<br/><br/>By September I was beginning to feel concern that we were not making the kind of progress that we should.  That is the basis of the lengthy note, which I believe speaks for itself - <i>res ipsa loquitur.</i>It is very clear in terms of my concerns to Mr. Dunne.  I went to him, as my boss, and said that there are some issues that need to be addressed.  That is the genesis and the theme of the whole thing.  I draw members' attention to my note to Mr. Cyril Dunne, specifically to the chapter heading Interim Report of Justice Fennelly:</p><blockquote>Having carefully read and re read the Interim Report of the Fennelly Commission, I am very much clearer on the approach required in dealing with serious issues which may fall within the terms of section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  I am satisfied that the matters which first came to my attention in June from Mr. McGee&rsquo;s report and subsequently, need to be very carefully and forensically investigated and do, on a prudential basis fall within the terms of [section] 41(1)(b) and (c) in particular and as advised by HOLA [head of legal affairs].  Justice Fennelly makes clear that a [section] 41 is to be used for matters for which the Commissioner judges to be &lsquo;significant&rsquo;.</blockquote><p>I go on to explain why I believe these matters are significant.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy asked me earlier about the nature of the documentation.  At this point in time, I genuinely believed that the light had been shone on this and we had to go forward and deal with it transparently, which can be seen from the notes I have circulated.  When this began, my thoughts were that there was only one way to deal with it.  We would deal with it openly, transparently and with the stakeholders.  That is referenced in my discussions on 2 July at the very first meeting and in the cover note to my report on 6 July.  My concern was that the transparency might not have been appreciated in the same way by others.  That was my concern.</p></speech>

This is something I had made six requests for when I had become aware of it.  I have already told the committee that I have a redacted copy with about 85% of it blacked out.  This is all news to me.  I have never been interviewed, I have never been advised and I have never been cautioned.  I do not know if any actions were taken on foot of that.  I will be making further inquiries.</p></speech>

Are there other financial areas properly under his control in respect of his function such as the control of cash by other financial sources within the organisation, charge-back for Garda support operations for the races or concerts, grant applications, vending machines in Garda stations or in headquarters and so on?  Where does that cash go?  Is this Mr. Culhane's remit and can he outline this for the committee?</p></speech>

The process is that the local superintendent would look for a financial sanction to undertake the duty.  The sanction would be granted by my office and then the number of hours required to discharge the duty would be calculated.  A rate per hour is applied and billed to the event organiser.  The money is received by us and is accounted for in the appropriations-in-aid.</p></speech>

Mr. McGee asks how Mr. Barrett is doing and goes through some of the issues.  He then says: "I think the problem in approaching the solving of this, is that because of the potential negative reputational risk for the organisation - in that once this starts to be sorted out it hits the public media, either through audit etc., it could have very big ramifications - like the accounting officer appearing before the PAC etc. - so it is how to solve this quietly without risking exposure - again this is just my opinion - so this report was quiet sensitive - Michael..."  - presumably this is Mr. Culhane-----</p></speech>

I sought, therefore, to dig deeper.  As I did so, a number of matters came to my attention about people who were not, as it were, in the Garda Vote and those who were serving in the restaurant or doing other activities who I understood up to that point were civil servants and employed in the Garda College.  Immediately I began to get sight of what was, essentially, a private enterprise operating within the Garda College.  I raised my concerns about this.  Barry McGee very kindly, and I did not understand it was Michael at the back of this, gave me a copy of a report, because I asked him to assist me.  It was a copy of a report he did in 2008.  When I got that, I read it.  It is about 18 pages and I scanned through it very quickly.  I rang Cyril and said, "Cyril, just got this.  I have asked Barry to make a copy for you."  Cyril had not seen it up to that point in time.</p><p>That is what he assured me, but the Deputy herself can ask him the question.  He and I began a dialogue about what to do about this.  Then we discovered there was a 2010 report done by Assistant Commission Jack Nolan, and Jack was very forthcoming and very helpful to me in my inquiries around this.  The lineage of the issue became clear to me.</p><p> I met with Mr. Culhane and Mr. McGee in my office at 14.15 on 30 June - this is in the report, at page 38 - and we discussed this quite openly.  My minute of the meeting is contemporaneous - it is right there.  The meeting began with my summary of the concerns on the general financial controls in the college, the need to appoint a qualified accountant and for that accountant to report, solid-line, to the CFO and, dotted line, to me as executive director.  This was seen as a good idea by the CFO, though it immediately pointed to a limited number of senior personnel to draw upon.  In response also, the CFO outlined the independence which the college had historically exercised.  This was all news to me.  I could not, quite frankly, get my head around the idea that we had these independent operations within the Garda college.</p><p> The meeting examined the need to seek a link between activity and cost in a meaningful system of accounting, like ABC, activity based costing, which would seek to hold resource managers to account for their stewardship of staff and all other types of resources.  I expressed the view that finance and HR should collaborate around that initiative so that we could better link deployment of operational choices to some kind of standard efficient measures.</p><p> My approach to this was entirely open-handed.  I assumed we were all in this-----</p></speech>

I accept that Mr. Howard is no longer in position and appreciate he is here to assist us with our inquiries.  However, this is off-the-wall stuff.  Maybe those of us on the outside have different expectations of those on the inside who carry such significant responsibilities.  Mr. Culhane directly and openly challenged the authority of Mr. Kelly, the internal auditor, on issues that Mr. Howard knew were serious, troubling, worrying and all of the other adjectives that have been used.  The fact that this challenge was made is absolutely extraordinary but the fact that those charged with oversight were silent is absolutely disgraceful and inexplicable.  I do not know in what kind of organisation that happens.  Much has been said about culture but that does not even capture the toxicity of what we are seeing here.  It is astonishing and, as a member of this committee, I am not satisfied with the answer Mr. Howard has provided or his stewardship of this series of events.  As for Mr. Culhane-----</p></speech>

We are talking about the bar and the restaurant, the two bigger ones I would think.  In the audit report, Mr. Kelly pointed out that the last set of accounts was 2009 and he mentioned that the independent accountant had audited them.  On page 25 of the interim report, it states that Mr. Kelly had discussions with the accountant regarding what qualification means and whether the accountant had any suspicion regarding possible misappropriation of money.  Mr. Kelly also noted that the control and record keeping was inadequate in terms of stock control and poor management.  He met with the accountant regarding further investigation he had done on the preliminary work on these accounts and he was reluctant to give an audit opinion from 2010 onward.</p> <p>  From 1 January 2014, Mr. Kelly was talking to the restaurant manager.  A small sample of transactions was audited in that case, including wage slips for work in the bar, a lodgement, a number of payments to suppliers, lodgements that were verified by lodgement slips, till receipts, etc.  Controls were noted to be weak.  Moving on to the restaurant, on page 26 of the report, he noted that restaurant expenses such as food, wages, and Revenue and pension contributions were paid from the restaurant account and all energy costs were paid through the Garda Vote.  Further down on page 26, he stated that the audit took sample payments from 2009 and 2015.  For supporting invoices and documentation in regard to each payment sampled, he was provided with all invoices and also provided with satisfactory explanations for payments to the account.  On the work carried out on those two entities, which had a tax number, at any stage did Mr. Kelly ask were their taxes up to date?</p></speech>

What I am finding hard to understand is that in the course of that investigation, when Mr. Kelly is talking to these two heads, would he have got P35s and reconciled wages with them to see if there was a discrepancy?

I know that potentially internal audits might not be as robust.  On taxation, I would have thought that, for argument's sake, that if one was doing an interim audit, one would get a statement from Revenue for each of those tax numbers.  It is a very simple thing.  It takes about two working days to do it on Revenue online.  One puts in the number, request a statement and it comes out in the post.</p></speech>

I cannot understand this.  We have an internal report.  We are hanging our hat on the major discrepancies in accounts, the major balances where the private accountant said there was concern regarding cash, and we do not have a statement from the Revenue Commissioners as part of our audit work.  Is that not an unbelievable set of events for an internal auditor?</p></speech>

Payment of all is one of the most important issues to be assured.  We are talking about over &euro;400,000 that accumulated in the bar.  As we know, VAT is a transaction tax.  To amass that type of money over the years suggests there was a significant level of turnover.  As a transaction tax, the risk that it was misstated in the absence of accounts for these years is significant.  I do not understand why this has not been done.  I am very frustrated when I hear the responses to this.</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly and I had lengthy discussions when he became involved in the process and he made it clear he had not been involved in anything other than an A03 audit in the college.  The A03 audit is a simple audit of fees paid for courses but the fundamental enterprises within the college were unknown to him in the extent of their operation and he had not seen the 2006, 2008 or 2010 reports.  In my note back to him, I wondered aloud whether that was accident or design.</p></speech>

The money that was going to the Garda College would have appeared in the appropriation accounts prior to 2006.  In terms of the issues that have now been raised, they appear to have been raised in an incomplete report in 2006, another report in 2008 and an updated report completed in 2010.  All those reports were produced after the Commissioner took up the role of Accounting Officer.  Prior to 2006, there was no visibility of the issues in the Garda College.</p></speech>

He told us earlier today, before Ms Barry attended the committee, of when he was made aware of wrongdoing in the running of the Garda College.  Can any witnesses comment on why he was not notified sooner?  He is the overall auditor of the other auditors and has to sign off on all this.  I will ask Mr. Culhane if there was any reason the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General was not drawn to the 2006 report, the McGee report of 2008 and the Nolan report of 2010?  Perhaps Mr. Kelly could also comment on that issue.</p></speech>

I have got to stress this point.  It is not a garda-civilian thing.  It is not four legs good, two legs bad.  There is a requirement to look at the standard that is required of us.  I think you have referred it to yourself in your most recent remarks.  I am particularly conscious of the obligation we owe, given the role that we play in Irish society, to be whiter than white.  It is particularly apt in our case, that our processes, procedures and standards of governance can be above reproach.</p></speech>

I do not know how early but we all know that in September the draft report was out.  The Minister would have come in towards the end of last year, I presume, or early this year looking for the Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2017.  Okay?  One would expect that one would not allow the Minister to come in here without a briefing on this issue in case these issues were raised with the Minister, and the Minister had no answers, and the Minister would not look good looking for an Estimate.  It would appear to me that a proper briefing note on the Templemore issue would have had to have been prepared for the Minister coming to the annual Estimates meeting.  She might have said some of those issues had she been asked but she had to have information.  Can Ms Barry give us the briefing note that the Department prepared for the Minister coming to the annual Estimates meeting for 2017?  In light of the fact that the Department and the Minister were aware of this issue, it is quite possible there was a full blown discussion with the Minister.  I do not know whether there was or was not.  I will not say it was remiss but it would have been putting the Minister in a very awkward spot to arrive without a briefing note on what was clearly known in the Department.  Does Ms Barry get what I am coming at?</p></speech>

I represent Templemore.  I am very proud of Templemore.  It is a fantastic town, to which the Garda College is central.  I want to see the college grow and investment is necessary to provide specialist training to Garda and a whole range of other things.</p><p>While there is huge public confidence, in the last few weeks there have been changes in the relationship with the people of Templemore.  The local community no longer has access to the swimming pool.  The ladies' football team has been thrown off the pitches.  There are a number of other issues.  In fairness, on 4 May Mr. Nugent said he needed to get his ducks in a row as regards the issues.  I agree with him on that because they are probably <i>ad hoc</i>at the moment.  For God's sake, though, could he put in some interim procedures to allow the people of Templemore access to facilities, particularly when the garda&iacute; are not using them?  That is the right thing to do.  The Garda College contributes hugely to the local economy.  The local people embrace the college, welcome it and work with it, and do everything in that spirit.  Could Mr. Nugent please ensure they have access to the facilities?</p></speech>

I did not have time to ask Ms Barry from the Department of Justice and Equality any questions today.  I am sorry about that.  I find it incredible that the Department of Justice and Equality did not know about these issues.  I find it unbelievable, to be honest.  I would like Ms Barry to go back and ask who approved the setting up of the sports club.  We were told by the Department that it first became aware of the issues in Templemore in October 2015.  Does anyone here believe - or rather, have any evidence that the Department was aware substantially of these issues prior to that?</p></speech>

I will make a few statements and if anyone disagrees with them, they should say so.  This is the easiest way of dealing with it.  It seems to me that the OPW did not actually know what it owned in Templemore, in Clonmore actually.  The Garda College was renting it out.  The OPW did not know it was not getting rent.  I have submitted parliamentary questions on this.  It is incredible.  It did not know it was not getting rent on something it owned.  The Garda College was renting it out and getting money.  I cannot understand how, in the whole budgeting and Estimates process, somewhere down the line, there was not a note to say there would be a deduction of &euro;38,000 or whatever the figure was because they were actually collecting the rent, so there could be some counterbalancing somewhere.  That is farcical.</p> <p>  I found Mr. Culhane's evidence today unbelievable, frankly.  It was incredible and not in a good way.  It is not personal; it is Mr. Culhane's role.  I have read his letters and, to be fair, he has referred issues up the chain.  I accept that.  I can see the emails etc.  I do not know at what velocity he did it but I can see the documentation.  However in his position, as far as I am concerned, he needed to go further when action was not being taken, especially in 2008 and 2010, whether by notifying Mr. McCarthy or his predecessor, or going through internal audit.  On the basis of today's discussion, that raises very serious questions.</p> <p>  The last issue is also for Mr. Culhane.  We have heard here that in respect of four of the tax numbers, we do not know if the lads will be able to make sure that they are meeting requirements and tax compliant.  We have heard so much evidence over the 12 or 13 hours.  Mr. Culhane has said that in fairness, he had a reputation for getting things done and all of that.  There was a tax audit report done in 2010, is that correct?</p></speech>

At the suggestion of one of the Deputies during the break, I want to make it clear that if some of my answers seemed a little unprepared, it is because I was only invited on Friday afternoon and I was brought it yesterday to read the papers.  I want to express my appreciation to the staff who were here.  In normal times I would have had more time to prepare, reflect and check up on records.  I wanted to put that on the record.  Arising from that, I want to say that in the course of this evening's session, something has occurred to me.  I am going to be suggesting to Mr. Nugent to look for a letter that I wrote at the end of October as chair of the audit committee to the Commissioner in respect of the failure to brief and adequately inform the audit committee about these matters.</p></speech>

The committee members are the elected representatives of the people of Ireland.  I hope to leave today's meeting having answered the committee's questions fully and thoroughly.  I see this as a very significant matter for an organisation that must enjoy the trust of the people of Ireland.  The powers that can be exercised - caution, arrest, detention - are of such constitutional significance that we need to have our house not just in order but in absolute order.</p><p> I sit here with a sense of embarrassment that we do not have it in order but with no sense of personal regret that I raised this issue.  I continue to believe that I did the right thing in persisting.  There is credit due to people on my right and on my left for their assistance in this regard.  However, as I think is clear, I feel, quite frankly, that I did not have universal support.  That reality is a reality that I want members of the committee to consider.  As I said to Deputy Cullinane previously, I look for no bouquets in this.  I feel that I am doing my job, but I want members to understand that it is not easy.  The assistance this committee can give in ensuring that the standards that are required of us are demanded by it consistently and that we deliver will embolden others to do the right thing and to step forward in difficult situations.  That is a key cultural change that this committee can help make.</p></speech>

My name is Mindy O'Brien and I represent the Environmental Pillar, which is a national network of 26 environmental organisations.  We have three proposals that we would like to bring forward and they reflect the four priorities the Government has embraced, namely, waste prevention, the circular economy, the polluter-pays principle and the UN sustainable development goals, particularly goal No. 12, which deals with sustainable consumption and production.</p> <p>  The bonus is that all three proposals would bring money into the environmental fund.  I will discuss the environmental fund briefly.  It was established in 2002 and was funded through the plastic bag levy and landfill levies.  At its height it yielded approximately &euro;264 million and has now dwindled down to &euro;46 million.  We have been the victim of our own success.  We have changed human behaviour, which is great.  As people are not using plastic bags any more, we are not getting revenue from them.  Additionally, landfill levies are down.  We would like to see that the levies we are proposing would go into the environmental fund.  The environmental fund is used to fund the enforcement office of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, research and development by the agency and its waste prevention office, as well as anti-litter campaigns, environmental awareness and the environmental network.</p> <p>  First, I will talk about waste prevention.  I would like to tell the committee a little story.  I work with my local GAA club.  We do coffee and tea every Saturday and sell the coffee for a euro.  We had ceramic cups but all of a sudden we started to use disposable ones.  I asked people if they would pay 15 cent for the disposable cups and started charging them.  Within two hours I had over 50% of the people take the ceramic cups to avoid that 15 cent charge.  However, one father came up to me to say he was really good at recycling at home and did not need to do it when he was out and about.  That reflects the society that we live in, whereby we are all getting used to recycling at home and separating our waste but do not do it when we are out and about.  We do not bring our waste home and it ends up as litter on the street or on beaches all around, or in the bins and it is just burned.  The plastic bag tax shows that economic incentives work. </p> <p>  As an illustration of the amount of litter we are accumulating, spring cleans took place recently in Kerry and Limerick.  They did a waste characterisation study and found that of the 160 tonnes they captured, 300,000 coffee cups were gathered.  That is in just one week in two county councils.  We propose to put a levy on single-use, non-compostable items such as coffee cups, plastic clam shells, takeaway containers and plastic cutlery.  This would encourage people not to use them and to prevent waste.  We also propose a deposit refund scheme for bottles and cans because they are not easily replaced.  It is not easy to go into a shop and refill a bottle of Coke.  We propose a 10 cent deposit on those bottle and cans, which would be refunded once returned.  This is a great way to capture that material.</p> <p>  The second initiative which supports the circular economy is our proposal for a &euro;2.50 levy per tonne on aggregates.  The UK currently imposes a &pound;2 levy on aggregates.  It has created an imbalance between the North and the South.  I note the D&aacute;il is currently considering the Minerals Act and creating an omnibus Bill dealing with how to set royalties.  There are no royalties with aggregates.  Nothing is brought into the national coffers by this non-renewable resource.  The problem with quarrying is that it de-waters aquifers, leaves sedimentation in streams and rivers, causes dust and vibrations to communities and increases damage to the roads from heavy trucks.  There are many external costs which are not accounted for by the quarries.  We also propose this to promote the circular economy.  In the UK, 25% of construction and demolition waste is recycled.  Here it is only 1%.  This levy would encourage the development of a new recycling industry.  In Ireland we produce about 32 million tonnes of aggregate a year, which we feel would bring in about &euro;80 million.  </p> <p>  The third issue is the polluter-pays principle.  Diesel fuel has been identified as a leading emitter of greenhouse gas and pollution and this air pollution has caused 1,200 premature deaths in Ireland.  This link between air pollution and premature death was identified during the smoky coal ban for Dublin back in the 1990s, adapted for the rest of the country in 2015.  The benefit received by diesel should be removed.  Diesel is charged at 11 cent less than petrol.  What has happened is that we in Ireland are increasingly purchasing diesel cars because they are cheaper to run.  This is bucking the trend throughout Europe.  Purchases of diesel cars have gone down in most countries.  Belgium, France and the UK have equalised excise tax between petrol and diesel.  We are calling for such an equalisation.  The Asthma Society supports and recommends this, as do the OECD and the EU semester programme.  This proposal also embraces the polluter-pays principle.</p> <p>  Lastly, Ireland signed up to the UN sustainable development goals.  Goal No. 12 deals with sustainable consumption and production and our three proposals fall well within that goal.</p> <p>  I thank the committee and am open to questions.  </p></speech>

I have a number of questions on the aggregates levy.  At present there is a serious issue with pyrite around the country.  It was confined to Dublin for some time but is beginning to emerge all over the country.

As I understand it, the regulation of quarries is very light-handed and is done by local authorities.  There is supposed to be a register of quarries.  The EPA has a list but there are no data on each quarry in terms of how much it produces and so forth.  This is something we need to examine.

In this case, the law of unintended consequences is relevant.  It was introduced because of the climate impact of carbon emissions from all fossil fuels for motor vehicles and it had a very positive impact in terms of behavioural change, in that consumers considered the carbon emissions per kilometre when choosing new cars, even though the price difference was not huge.  It operated a bit like the plastic bag tax.  When consumers were faced with VRT bands, they chose to go for the lower one.  The car tax changes had a really positive educational effect.  The day after the changes were introduced, in the face of some initial hesitancy on the part of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, that body produced and sponsored a brochure in the <i>Irish Independent</i>showing all new cars listed by their VRT band.  It would have cost the Government a lot of money to run that sort of education campaign.  The change had a very positive impact but we underestimated the local air quality impact of increased diesel use.  At the time it was hoped that diesel technology would improve faster than it actually has done in terms of pollution.  It has also transpired that motor manufacturers have been less than honest with the public and with regulators about the pollution caused by their cars.<br/><br/>It is a cautionary tale but the lesson is not that we should not move forward with regulations that improve consumer choice and reduce pollution.  The lesson is to make sure that we look at all of the possible consequences, as in the example of agriculture as referred to by Deputy Calleary.  It is fair to interrogate but the next iteration of motor tax and VRT reform being planned by the Government should take this into account, while not losing the gains that we have had in terms of reduced CO<sub>2</sub>emissions. </p></speech>

The main reason for the reluctance among the public to make the switch is that the charging infrastructure and everything that goes with it is not in place.</p></speech>

In Ireland it can often be difficult to get infrastructure in place before we do deployment - housing estates in the 1970s being a good example.  In this case, however, we have seen a commitment from the ESB to roll out infrastructure and that has happened around the country.  Are we at a point where if everyone switched to electric cars tomorrow they would all have ready access to charging stations?  No, not yet, but we are moving in the right direction.  Improvements in battery technology will also help.  It is fair to say that we have not had the take-up that we had hoped for and the Government's own targets are not going to be met by 2020 at the current rate, for example.  That said, electric cars have a significant role to play.</p> <p>  We are not advocating petrol over diesel; this is simply about equal treatment of equal pollution, so to speak.  We are arguing that diesel should not get special treatment as it does now because while it may be better for the climate, it is worse for local health.  In that sense, there is no reason for it to have special treatment.  Even leaving aside whether people move to electric cars, if they at least do not continue the rush to diesel, that is better.  Ultimately, if the Deputy buys a car tomorrow, it is probably better that he buys a new, efficient petrol model rather than a locally polluting diesel one.  </p></speech>

I must record my deep concern at the shocking news that President Trump is apparently pulling out of the Paris Agreement, which is a shame on that Administration.</p> <p>  I agree with the three cases being made by the witnesses but I want to widen the discussion out a bit.  I am not asking for an immediate response but am sharing some of my own thinking on these issues.  First, with regard to the introduction of a charge on disposable cups and a refund on items that are recycled, it seems to me that we have reached that stage now.  We had a similar experience to the example from Kerry that Ms O'Brien outlined.  We had a similar clean-up of our own local river recently and we did a scientific assessment of what was in it.  The river was clogged with bottles and cans.  That was what was in it - litter.  It is actually a litter problem as well as a resource-use problem.</p> <p>  Similarly, if one surveys what our supermarkets are selling to us, one finds that many items are wrapped in non-recyclable materials and that has to stop.  We can stop it by some of these signals.  One reason that has not been done in the last five or ten years is that in a sense, the Repak system we put in place always argued against it.  Repak argued that it would undermine its system of recycling.  My view is that everything has changed because we are starting to incinerate our waste - 600,000 tonnes in Poolbeg and there is also an incinerator planned for Cork.  That is all madness, to my mind, if we want to go towards a circular economy.  In making their proposals, what would the witnesses say to Repak who have always said that such a refund may undermine its recycling system?</p> <p>  I agree with the proposal for an aggregates tax.  I was at a meeting in Teagasc yesterday to discuss land use and aggregates form part of that but there is a wider issue of land use that we must address.  We need a national land use management plan that is quite radical in terms of how we address climate change here.  One of the strong signals in that has to be a reward for farmers who are, for example, supporting biodiversity.  There is some land that we will have to stop farming and stop draining.  We must provide for flood management, water storage and carbon storage.  To make that work, we need to go beyond the current GLAS system or any of the other farm payment systems to specifically support certain types of land use in a land use management plan for biodiversity, flood management and climate reasons.  Have the witnesses considered where the income for such a signal on land use, to support good land use management, might come from?  While I welcome the aggregates charge, we are going to need more than &euro;80 million.  This is a multi-billion euro tax change.</p> <p>  On the transport issue, I agree with Mr. Coghlan that we are not going to have electric vehicles all over the country tomorrow.</p><p>If, however, we are serious about climate action and air pollution, we need to do what other countries, including Holland, are doing, namely, saying there will be no more petrol or diesel cars sold in ten years' time.  That is where we need to go.  It is the end of the internal combustion engine motor car.  Other countries are doing this.  It is not as impractical as it may seem.  That is the scale involved.  The alternative is a better car.  Electric vehicles are becoming absolutely standard and are coming down in price.  The maintenance cost is but a fraction.  It would be absolutely valid for us to set such an ambition. </p><p> The one interesting point on the tax side is that we must start thinking about how to replace the multi-billion euro revenue we get from excise and petrol taxes at present.  Have the witnesses examined that bigger picture?  They should forget about equalising.  I acknowledge we need to equalise in respect of petrol and diesel but we need to start having answers as to how we equalise our loss in tax revenue that will accrue as we switch away from the use of fossil fuels in the motor industry, which we have to do at the desirable speed.</p><p> We were out today proposing a just transition.  The IMPACT trade union was out yesterday looking for something similar.  Would the witnesses agree with the calls that have been made for switching away from the PSO levy on the operation of peat-fired power stations to a just transition fund that would fund jobs, particularly in the midlands, in retrofitting and other energy efficiency areas?  If we shut down the peat-powered plants in the next year or two, we could access about &euro;120 million for such a fund.  Would the witnesses support that just transition proposal to switch off the peat plants and instead switch on a retrofitting industry in the midlands with the funds that we would save?</p></speech>

Repak is against the deposit refund scheme.  It feels the incremental collection of bottles would not justify the cost of setting it up.  We calculate it probably would cost about &euro;40 million to set it up.  It will take a while for people to switch over to bringing their bottles back.  As a bottle-collection rate of 98% is reached, there would be surplus money that could be used to offset the set-up of the project.  Repak does not fund litter clean-up, nor does it fund street clean-up.  I have asked it specifically whether it helps with the separation issues and litter and it says it is not its job.  The problem is that many of the bottles, cans and coffee cups become litter.  It is the on-the-go society that we need to address.  Repak is sponsoring the bottle banks and helping to offset the cost of recycling but not litter.  We are spending &euro;90 million per year on street cleaning and litter collection.</p> <p>  There is a campaign called the conscious cup campaign.  We are encouraging caf&eacute;s and coffee shops to give a discount when people bring their own cup.  We calculate there are more than 250 million cups per year.  If there were a 10 cent tax on those, it would yield &euro;25 million.  We do not just want to bring the money in, however; we want to change behaviour.  What was so beautiful about the plastic bag tax is that it was imposed at the till.  It was very visible.  People said they had a choice as to whether they wanted the bag.  If they did not, they did not pay the 15 cent.  People would have a choice between bringing their own coffee cup and paying for a disposable one.  This affects people at the till.  That is the best way to change human behaviour.  A problem with Repak is that it does not differentiate between packaging.  It charges the same rate for plastic composites that are not recycled and paper that is recyclable.  Therefore, there is no differentiation in the charges to its members.  In addition, the cement kilns will be taking a lot of the rubbish.  That is a matter of which we need to be mindful.</p> <p>  We were asked about land use.  The Environmental Pillar stands behind taxing the environmental bads and promoting the environmental goods.  Unsustainable consumption is what we should be taxing.  With regard to land use, the issue that arises is one I have seen with water.  It is a question of who owns the aggregate below one's land.  I am trying to find this information out from the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI.  No one really knows.  I believe the people who own the land own the aggregates.  If, however, I have land with minerals underneath, the State owns it.  It is a very nebulous area that needs to be reflected upon.  The same applies to water.  Who owns the water?  This is a debate taking place here.  What about the Ballygowan enterprise, which extracts all the water for free because it is not treated?  With regard to land use planning, is the State the owner?  If we are polluting something that is owned by the State, should we pay something for that?  Similarly, if we are doing something to promote the health of the resource, we should get a benefit.  How that balances out is something I will leave to economists and others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2590" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017053100002#D00300"><p>On the Repak issue, there is a rationale in Repak's concerns about a deposit return scheme.  The system is set up to do what it says, as Ms O'Brien has outlined.  She has shown how we can move past that.  There is no good rationale, however, to Repak having an objection to a levy that would reduce the amount of packaging waste from supermarkets, for example.  I refer to the single-use items going into flow.  If Repak's business model is an impediment to waste prevention, it makes no sense and would need to be addressed.  As it does not say it does not want any less waste coming out of supermarkets, there should not be any opposition to levying on the single-use items at the retail level.  Ms O'Brien has addressed the issue of the deposit return scheme well.</p> <p>  Before dealing with the questions on motor tax and vehicle registration tax, I will respond to the question on land management.  We have two nationally set climate targets, one for reducing emissions by 80% from buildings, transport and energy together by 2050, and one for achieving carbon neutrality in agriculture and land use.  The latter is an easier target as it does not require necessarily as high a reduction.  It requires, however, significant land use change and land use management.  Essentially, the target is that any carbon pollution from agriculture by 2050 will be offset by enhanced bogs, sinks or grasslands, as long they meet international standards.  That will involve, as mentioned, some sort of national plan.  This is only a minor tweaking but it is a step and it is obviously important to see it in that broader context.  One obvious place from which the money would come for realising that kind of plan is the Common Agriculture Policy, CAP, which is now under mid-term review.  It was striking to hear the current Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, our own Phil Hogan, say the greening of the CAP had not succeeded as hoped in this current round and that more work needed to be done to achieve what was required.  Given that Ireland has a tradition of defending the CAP and seeking to structure it in a way that maximises current income and given that the Government has adopted a national target, rather than one imposed by the European Union, of having carbon neutrality in agriculture and land use by 2050, it behoves us, as we enter this mid-term review of the CAP and the next iteration in the 2020s, to make it a national priority in the negotiations to focus on structuring the CAP in a way that promotes sustainable land use at national level.  Another possible source of funding is the carbon tax, which will need to increase over time.  It is not ring-fenced or hypothecated in the way the environment fund is but it certainly should be a source of income for transition of all kinds over time.</p> <p>  I refer to the specific question of how, if we move to electric cars in ten years, we could replace the income we get from motor tax and vehicle registration tax.  Over time, some of the privileges that are now given to electric vehicles may need to be considered, as with the differential between diesel and petrol.  Over time, I do not believe electric car use should be free.  While much less would be paid for fuel, one would still need to pay to use the roads.  Therefore, motor tax will over time have to reflect this if 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more of the cars are electric.  We then would need to be able to raise revenue from the drivers to maintain the roads.  It is right to consider the ten-year horizon and not make the mistake we made with diesel, which was ten years ago.  We should consider how we can maintain a sustainable level of income through continuous reform over time.</p> <p>  On the just transition question and the PSO levy on peat-fired power stations of &euro;120 million, we should stop subsidising the burning of peat.</p><p>A fossil fuel subsidy award was recently organised by the Climate Action Network at a European level.  Ireland won the "sneaky special treatment" gold medal for subsidising peat burning for fossil fuel.  It is the least efficient way of making electricity.  It produces 22% of our pollution from power generation but only 9% of our electricity.  There is an issue in that we cannot close the stations overnight and put people out of work.  That is not politically or humanly responsible.  However, it has been 19 years since we were first told by Government advisers to get out of peat burning to meet our climate targets.  We have had time to organise this but have chosen not to until now.  We would agree with some form of just transition forum being set up.  It is really good to see the trade unions, both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and IMPACT, engaging very seriously on the issue.  The public service obligation is one obvious source of income.  We would argue that while perhaps half of that should go into the just transition fund, we will probably also need some of it to finance community energy and rooftop and community solar.  We need to make sure that everyone benefits from the transition to renewable energy.  I do not think we can put it all into worker protection, as it were.

What I am coming at is that the witnesses want to tax everything.  People are hard pushed enough.  I get a coffee in the morning that costs &euro;2 and the witnesses want me to pay &euro;2.10 or bring my own cup.  That is practical but we would need a reasonably long lead-in time.  When the plastic bag levy came in, a constituent of a former colleague of mine made plastic bags.  The levy came in so quickly that the business was devastated.  It had to come in but would have needed a couple of years' lead-in time.</p> <p>  There are opportunities for business here and I would love to hear the Environmental Pillar address that.  The witnesses have looked at just one aspect.  If Cork and Kerry county councils collected 300,000 cups in rivers and fields just from rubbish, we can safely assume 500,000 were used, 300,000 of which ended up being collected.  It would be interesting to hear a business case for that from the witnesses.  Then there is all the coffee residue, which is a fertiliser, and all those little wooden stirrers, which are recyclable.  There is a whole business possibility there.  Rather than tax everyone up to the armpits with stuff, we should look at ways of generating enterprising ideas for dealing with this.  A local businessman in my constituency was thwarted in his efforts.  He had got to quite an advanced stage of setting something up but one of the coffee takeaway companies wanted to charge him for taking the coffee residue because he was taking so much of it.  He was doing that company a favour by recycling and so on, but that scuppered the whole thing.  While tax is one aspect, enterprise has to be included as well.</p> <p>  We need to dig down more deeply into the question of electric versus diesel and petrol cars.  We were told ten years ago that diesel cars were the way to go because they were more efficient in respect of emissions and our car tax was rated accordingly.  Then we found out that Volkswagen and others were lying through their teeth about emissions.  We do not know who is telling the truth now.  I am sure it is not just Volkswagen but other car manufacturers as well.  Have we any statistics about the manufacturing impact of producing hybrid or electric cars?  I am not being a denier.  I just want to drill down.  What is the cost of and how do we generate the electricity that powers all these cars?  What is the price to the environment of that electricity?  A study comparing the Hummer and the Prius found that although on the road the Hummer is much more damaging to the environment, the manufacture of the Prius and its huge battery pack also causes great environmental damage.</p> <p>  A close fried of mine worked in one of the energy agencies here.  Returning to the issue of plastic versus paper bags, we all welcome the fact there are no plastic bags littering the countryside.  However, some shops are now charging 70 cent for a bag, because if they charged a lower price, they would have to pay Revenue.  They have pitched it at such a level that one can buy a more heavy-duty plastic bag for 70 cent but the State gets nothing out of it.  Many people are using these bags.  The plastic bag levy did not apply to takeaways and places like that either.</p></speech>

I am not an economist but if one increases demand, supply will correspond and when supply increases, prices come down.  They had more people buying the compostable containers.  All the coffee shops were using paper or sugar cane or some sort of compostable container.</p> <p>  We may need an economic nudge to encourage people to go into other businesses.  It is also worth considering changing VAT in order that compostables would have a lower VAT rate than items made out of worse material.  There are business opportunities for compostable packaging.  I agree about paper bags.  When I go to my local cafe, I bring my own container and just say no.  I do not need any bag or plastic cutlery.  It is a behavioural shift but we should encourage people to bring their own containers.</p></speech>

Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Holland, 11 states in America, parts of Canada and Australia have deposit refund schemes and Scotland is also looking to set up a scheme.  The EU is looking at the possibility of doing a deposit refund scheme for aluminium cans.  I argue, however, that if we look around on the streets, we see plastic bottles, aluminium cans, glass bottles and coffee cups.  Those are the huge polluters.  We find that there is so much plastic in the marine environment, we are going to have more plastic than fish.  As an island nation we really must be cognisant of that.</p></speech>

I know that Deputy Lahart is probing us appropriately and testing our case.  With regard to the view that we want to tax everything, I believe that is a simplification.  People talk of environmental tax reform, as it is often referred to, but it can be a tax shift.  These happen to be consumption taxes, but even when carbon tax was introduced, VAT was reduced at the same time and not much was made of that.  One regressive indirect tax went up or was created and another tax went down.  In the first year those two taxes more or less balanced off.  This can be done in a revenue neutral way if desired.  That is easier for national taxes than for consumption levies, but it is not necessarily about taxing everything.  It is about shifting tax onto environmental pollutants, in the case of carbon tax, and reducing USC or PAYE.  All the economic arguments show that this is more economically efficient for the country as a whole and the impact on economic activity is much less if carbon is taxed rather than taxing labour.  Growth is helped in the shift of tax from labour to carbon.</p> <p>  For the past two to three years we have attended, as a pillar, the national economic dialogue in Dublin Castle in July.  Towards the end the chairman pointed out that every single attendee who came to the meeting spoke about increased spending and he asked if anyone had any revenue ideas.  We said that we did.  We are some of the few people who come to the table with suggestions for how the State can raise more taxes.  That is not necessarily always the most popular thing, but after an era of Ireland having to close a gap between our taxes and our State revenue and when the European Commission and the OECD have pointed out the need for Ireland to broaden its tax base and not become reliant, as we did before the bust, on a very narrow set of income streams, and although some of them are small fry in comparison with stamp duty in the mid 2000s, these kinds of taxes are worth seeing in this broader picture.</p> <p>  Reference was made to cars.  On the issue of Volkswagen, while it pulled the wool over our eyes on emissions, there is no doubt that from a carbon sense diesel is less polluting than petrol.  That was not a fraud.  The Volkswagen fraud related to how much particular pollution it was putting into the local atmosphere.  It was outrageous that this happened but it did not undermine the case for diesel being lass climate polluting.</p> <p>  I had not seen comprehensive evidence between hybrids and diesels.   I believe it is one of these things that gets thrown about to muddy the waters.  It is my understanding that, overall, the hybrid car will give a better environmental performance than a diesel car.  The Deputy asked a very interesting question about where the electricity comes from and if it matters.   The answer is that it does matter.  In Ireland, about 27% of electricity comes from renewable sources.  The ESB gave me some figures recently - I cannot remember them precisely - showing the performance of an electric car in Ireland being already substantially better than the performance of a fossil fuel car in respect of carbon emissions.  Of the electricity fuelling such a car, one quarter is from renewable energy and three quarters of the power for that car comes from fossil fuels.  It still gives a much better performance overall in pollution per kilometre for an electric car than a diesel or petrol fuelled car.</p></speech>

There are a couple of interesting things that strike me in respect of the proposals the witnesses are making.  I agree with some aspects, and while they take account of the environmental side of things, they sometimes seem to miss completely the impact on communities and individuals, especially on communities or individuals who do not have the necessary disposable income in the area in which to make a move.  I will give some examples.  Let us consider the coffee cups.  The price of a cup of coffee moves vastly.  People pay ridiculous prices and I suggest that &euro;1 for a cup of coffee is a very good deal.  Ms O'Brien's local club should be very happy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2620" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017053100002#F00500"><p>At that price, it helps to place a 15 cent tax on it as a proportionate amount to influence behaviour.  If a person is paying &euro;3 or &euro;4 for a coffee, 15 cent will not make a difference to him or her.  It is the same with tin cans.  People buy cans of Coke, for example, ranging from &euro;1 for a can to &euro;1.20.  They do not care.  The proportionate amount of the charge that the representatives want to introduce to make a difference would need to be very high.</p> <p>  One of the consequences relates to the section of society who, for a variety of reasons, choose to not participate.  This is a consequence that does not seem to be looked at but we have had some really bad experiences of it.  Deputy Lahart and I represent the same constituency and are in the same county council area.  This is about people who dump illegally.  We brought in bin charges but we ended up with a situation where, in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains, everything is being dumped.  I am not condoning it.  I would be much more in the business of objecting to this behaviour, but there is a whole section of society that feels excluded, and because middle Ireland decided it wanted to bring in all the charges, these people feel that their solution is not to be environmentally friendly, not to participate and to step outside the whole thing.</p> <p>  This ties in to the next point.  With regard to the changes being looked at around diesel and cars, from my knowledge of it, the actual cost of running an electric car is very low.  The buy-in point to electric vehicles is very high.  While it is a nice thing for people who have large amounts of income to be able to go environmentally friendly with the electric car, even with subsidies, there are electric cars, such as a new Renault electric vehicle I saw in the Sunday newspapers, that cost nearly double the price of a conventional diesel or petrol car of equivalent size.  A host of people are being excluded with regard to their ability to get into this.</p> <p>  When we brought in the changeover to diesel, we also brought in the incentivised scrappage scheme and so on, but the point was made, quite rightly, to a number of public representatives that there were people who did not have the money to engage with that scheme at the time.  People have said many times to me as a public representative that they are driving, for example, a 1.4 litre ten year old car and paying &euro;800 a year in road tax, yet the person down the road is driving a 2 litre diesel car and he or she pays &euro;120 for road tax.  We need to bring people with us, so I am less in favour of where the witnesses are going with their levies and taxes and I am more into incentivising people.  I would be of the view that there should not be a levy or tax on someone using a plastic box in which to put a sandwich.  The box should just not be available.</p> <p>  The San Francisco comment was interesting.  We are an island nation and it is very easy to implement a measure and have an impact by phasing it in over a period and by making something unavailable at a manufacturing level.  There are very fancy shops selling very expensive things 100 yards down the road from this venue.  They wrap the items in paper and people pay twice the odds.  There is no necessity for something to be in an individual plastic box.  I would much rather see this issue dealt with through the prohibition of its use rather than through a tax, which is easily absorbed by those with money and which continues to allow the practice, and where those who do not have money just continue to pay too much for their lunch.</p></speech>

The authorities in New York and California have also banned polystyrene.  It has been completely banned there.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the portion of the cost of a cup of coffee.  What Deputy Brophy said was right in that 15 cent on a &euro;3 coffee is far less than 15 cent on a &euro;1 coffee.  However, the 15 cent levy on plastic bags never varied.  It was always the same and people did change their behaviour.  The idea is to change behaviour.  People would have the choice to bring their own cup.  I have no wish to discriminate against anyone on the basis of income bracket.  People can bring reusable cups.</p> <p>  Illegal dumping is a major scourge in this country.  It is horrible.  I know there was a "Prime Time" programme on the problem.  The question is whether we should charge for waste.  If we do not charge for waste, then there is no incentive to reduce the amount of waste we are dumping.  There is no incentive to recycle and no incentive to take out compostable matter.  Right now, if a person puts everything into one container, it will simply be burned or put in landfill.  Organic matter is the biggest polluter of CO2.  In fact, the real problem is methane, which is 25 times more potent than CO2.</p> <p>  It is a tough situation.  We need more enforcement in respect of fly tippers.  We also need to encourage people who are clearing out houses.  Some will get the man with the van who charges &euro;50 to remove things.  We know he will not put it into a licensed facility and that he will dump it in the Wicklow hills.  When people clear out a house, they need to ensure the people providing the service are licensed waste collectors.  It is a whole education process.</p></speech>

My apologies, Chairman, for coming back in but this is the point I was making.  We created a pricing structure that made people feel excluded.  As a result, they stopped caring.  I do not know exactly how we address this.</p> <p>  The first time I met Ms O'Brien at a committee meeting we were dealing with water.  Ms O'Brien knows where I am coming from on this question.

On the other hand, we need to be careful if we are creating structures around cost that make sections of society feel that it is so expensive for them to the extent that they simply opt out of any responsible behaviour.  Sometimes that point is missed in the argument.</p></speech>

Deputy Brophy suggested it would be more costly.  The thing about cans is that we are proposing a deposit refund scheme.  People could pay 10 cent and then bring it back and get it back.  If a person does not want to do that, a scout group or a person who needs the money will collect it.</p></speech>

Deputy Brophy's concern was that in making it high enough to make a difference, we could end up really punishing those who have no easy alternative.</p> <p>  Let us suppose, in the case of coffee cups, there was a levy of 15 cent.  If a person drank one coffee per day, the cost would come to approximately &euro;5 per month.  I have no doubt about what coffee shops would do &ndash; they do it already but they do not promote it.  There would be a keep cup for &euro;5.  When a person goes in on the first day of a month, the person would have the choice of starting to pay 15 cent each day.  Alternatively, the person could buy a cup for &euro;5 on that day and will have saved the same amount as the levy in a month.  There are easy ways to avoid the levy on the coffee cup.  The cost of 15 cent for any given day might not be enough to disincentivise a person.  However, if there is an easy alternative that allows a consumer to make the money back in a month and then start saving money, I believe people would opt for it.</p> <p>  On Coke cans, the point Ms O'Brien made was that we do not need a levy or price differential on the soft drink can that is enough to put people off buying an individual can.  All we need is a small deposit such that when a person finds ten cans on the street, it is worth that person's while to bring them back to the shop.  It is not necessarily the purchaser who does it, as Ms O'Brien has said.</p> <p>  We have had some experience of this recently.  We run a waste education programme at a major summer festival.  Last year, those involved put 20 cent on a pint of beer.  The price went from &euro;6 to &euro;6.20.  It was not enough to inhibit consumption in any way but &euro;30,000 worth of deposits were returned to us.  People collected 120,000 plastic glasses or thereabouts from around the site over the course of three days.  These were not the same people.  Different people went to collect them.  Basically, we created a market for plastic glasses in that case.  In this case it would be cans or bottles on which there is a deposit.  The amount of the deposit does not have to be enough to inhibit purchase.  Unlike the plastic bag tax, it does not have to be high enough to inhibit a consumer from buying the thing.  It need only be high enough to make it interesting for someone else to collect it if it is dropped.</p></speech>

The next item is to record the decisions of the joint committee.  The first petition for consideration is No. P000024/16, submitted by Mr. Thomas Mackey, regarding the criteria to qualify for a primary medical certificate.  It is proposed, first, to correspond with the Ombudsman and seek his views on the scheme as it currently stands and to request an input on the actions that could be taken to address the needs of the petitioner and, second, to correspond with relevant advocacy groups seeking observations regarding the current eligibility criteria relating to primary medical certificates.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition is No. P000036/16, which was submitted by Mr. Neil Tolan and which proposes the establishment of a regulator for the gambling industry.</p><p>It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and advise that the petition will remain open.  The secretariat will correspond with the Department periodically to seek an update on the progression of legislation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next petition for consideration is No. P00001/17 regarding the responsible service of alcohol.  It is proposed to correspond once again with the petitioner informing him that, if a response is not received within two weeks of the date of the correspondence, the petition will be closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next petition is No. P00008/17 from Mr. Martin McGowan.  It is proposed to correspond once again with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government outlining that while the committee welcomes the progression of the Mediation Bill 2017, that Bill does not address the issue of the absence of legislation to tackle overhanging trees.  The committee further requests that the Department examine current legislation and regulations in the UK with a view to considering a system similar for Ireland.  The committee also requests that the Department report back to it.  It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and advise of further steps being taken by the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next petition for consideration is No. P00015/17 on widening the eligibility requirements for Irish citizenship by descent.  It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and to close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next petition is No. P00017/17 from Mr. Mark Llewellyn, entitled "Introduce refundable deposits on bottles and cans in Ireland".  It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and to close the petition.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

As part of that review, the introduction of a refundable deposit scheme for bottles and cans was considered.  However, the report concluded that the scheme would be inappropriate because there was a scheme in operation by Repak.  I agree with the Deputy in that there may be recourse for further examination of what Repak is and does.  Perhaps a more appropriate course would be through the line committee responsible for oversight of these matters, if I might make that suggestion.</p></speech>

My name is Catherine Bond and I am the chief executive officer of the Irish Foster Care Association.  I have over 30 years of professional experience working in the area of children and families.  I am accompanied by Ms Breda O'Donovan, director of finance, HR and communications, IFCA.  Ms O'Donovan has worked with IFCA for over 15 years and was a foster carer for many years.</p><p>I do not propose to read through all of the information on the Irish Foster Care Association, IFCA, and fostering in Ireland as this information has been provided in our full opening statement.  In the interests of saving time, I will give a brief overview of what we do and then I will move quickly on to the issues and challenges in foster care today.</p><p> The IFCA is the representative body for foster care in Ireland and promotes excellence in foster care.  It has 1,600 members comprised of foster families, social workers, social care workers, academics and those with an interest in foster care.  The IFCA advocates for excellence in foster care and services to members include advocacy, a national support helpline, learning and development and support to members involved in local branches and regions.  </p><p> Foster care is the backbone of care for children who are in the care of the State in Ireland.  We need to celebrate the fact that the majority of these children are growing up as happy, confident young people who attend school every day.  Indeed, some will be focusing on the upcoming State exams in the coming weeks.  Children in foster care are thriving and foster families are offering secure, happy and fulfilling childhoods to children, supporting them to reach their full potential in life.</p><p> Our national support helpline, which offers callers information and support, is the pulse in terms of issues which impact on foster carers as well as social workers and others involved in foster care.  The national standards for foster care set out a range of standards to be attained for the child, the foster carer and Tusla.  Specifically, there is a requirement for the child to have a dedicated social worker who is responsible for the safety and welfare of the child.  There is also a requirement for the foster carer to have a dedicated link social worker who provides support to the foster carer.  In March 2017 approximately 6 % of children in general foster care and 8% of children in relative care did not have a dedicated social worker.  This equates to over 400 children.  At the end of 2016, 18% of general foster carers and 20% of relative foster carers did not have a link social worker.  It is critical that this situation is addressed.</p><p> Foster care is complex and involves many stakeholders.  The IFCA&rsquo;s national support helpline statistics frequently cite poor communication as an underlying factor in the relationships involved.  Foster carers often express a lack of respect for the role which they offer.  It is critical for proactive, respectful and trusting relationships to be fostered, promoted and maintained.  The majority of children in the care of the State, many of whom have experienced traumatic early life events, reside with foster carers who offer stability and consistency to them.  It is also critical to have a robust infrastructure which supports foster care.  The IFCA advocates for the development of policies and procedures which underpin the work of Tusla and to provide a consistent approach to all aspects of foster care.  The IFCA is aware that Tusla has commenced a review and redevelopment of policies to inform practice in foster care and welcomes this.  It is critical that when policies are developed that they are disseminated throughout Tusla fostering teams, that staff are trained in the understanding and implementation of those policies and that regular monitoring and reviews of implementation are conducted.</p><p> The IFCA welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, of the introduction of the provision of after care plans for every child preparing for adulthood while in care.  The IFCA made a comprehensive submission to Tusla on the development of the after care policy and welcomes its implementation.  Many children who grow up in foster care continue to live with their foster care family.  Foster carers will require additional supports, for example, a carer's allowance where the young person remains living with them and who may not attain complete independence in adult life as a result of complex emotional or social needs.  One way to prevent homelessness among this group of vulnerable adults is to offer a financial incentive to foster carers to modify or build living accommodation where a young adult can live independently, but with the safety net of the wider foster family surrounding him or her, as is normal in many households across Ireland.  </p><p> During 2016, a predominant theme coming through on our national helpline was the handling by Tusla of allegations of abuse made against foster carers.  There were inconsistencies in the way such allegations were handled and the time it took to complete investigations was far too long.  Research indicates that allegations can be made against any foster carer.  This is a distressing event for everyone involved - the child, the foster carer, the foster carer&rsquo;s own children and the birth family.  It is therefore essential that the process is open and fair and underpinned by the rules of natural justice.  For many years the IFCA has advocated for one national policy in responding to allegations made against foster carers and welcomes the publication of the policy in May 2017.  It is vital that this new policy is implemented consistently across all Tusla areas, that social workers are trained in its implementation and that there is continuous assessment of its implementation.  </p><p> Research indicates that prior to the making of an allegation of abuse against a foster carer by a child, the foster carer noted increased behavioural problems and many requested respite support prior to the allegation being made.  Similar circumstances occur prior to placement breakdowns.  Responses to such requests are not always provided but it is critical that foster carers receive timely supports by social workers and other professionals when they seek such support.  They know the child, are aware when behaviour changes and when a timely intervention, such as a time away during the day or a short respite will alleviate the tension within the placement.  Foster carers must have access to ongoing support, information and training and the IFCA plays a central role in this within the confines of its budget.</p><p> The recent development of placing children with foster carers long distances from their place of birth has introduced a new paradigm into foster care.  The placement of children great distances from their home of origin requires foster carers to travel long distances to support access arrangements.  The shortage of social workers has also resulted in foster carers being requested to supervise access arrangements which is not part of the foster carer&rsquo;s role.  The IFCA has highlighted the inappropriateness of such requests with Tusla.</p><p> The IFCA welcomes this opportunity to share its knowledge and experience of foster care in Ireland with the committee.  We believe that focus on the following areas will assist in supporting all of those involved in foster care in Ireland: policies and procedures which are developed, fully implemented and monitored; timely supports to foster carers to enable them to care for children with very complex problems, on behalf of the State; and the allocation of dedicated social workers for all children in care and the allocation of link social workers to foster carers.  We would also suggest that the IFCA's national support service be enhanced to offer longer opening hours and a wider range of supports to foster carers.</p></speech>

My name is Karla Charles and I am the policy manager in EPIC.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Fidelma Guinan, who is an advocacy officer.</p> <p>  EPIC is an independent organisation established to advocate with, and on behalf of, children and young people in care and with care experience.  A core part of the work of EPIC is the provision of an individual advocacy and support service for children and young people with care experience.  EPIC welcomes the opportunity to discuss issues of foster care with the committee today.  EPIC would like to draw member's attention to a number of issues that we feel merit further attention.  These issues have been brought to our attention through our direct advocacy work with children and young people in care.  </p> <p>  The first issue is the cost of private versus Tusla-registered fostering.  There are a number of private foster care organisations operating in Ireland.  Placing a child through one of the private foster care organisations costs the State an average of &euro;58,000 per child per year versus &euro;17,900 for children fostered with foster carers registered directly with Tusla.  EPIC would encourage the committee to look into the disparity of cost between private providers and State agencies.  We would like to see greater analysis of costs versus service provision for children.  Currently, it seems to be more attractive for foster carers to register with private providers because they offer services like 24 hour phone support, which is particularly helpful for new carers and link foster care workers seem to have smaller caseloads.  Therefore, they are able to provide a higher level of support to foster carers.</p><p>I would like the committee to bear this in mind.<br/><br/>Placement breakdowns are sometimes inevitable but in order to learn from such breakdowns there needs to be greater oversight on the number of placement breakdowns, the reasons for the breakdowns and what could be learnt from such breakdowns.  It is imperative that such data be collected and analysed as a matter of priority.  EPIC is calling for a national review of disruptions to maximise early intervention, and that all have a foster link worker.<br/><br/>Placement breakdowns should also be challenged.  In EPIC&rsquo;s experience some breakdowns can and should be avoided.  Lack of training and poor management of difficult behavioural situations can lead to damaged relationships.  In foster families this can sometimes result in placement breakdown.  More consistency needs to occur when matching the needs of the child with the strengths and abilities of the foster carers.  Unfortunately this does not always occur.  Furthermore, adequate supports must be provided to children and foster families to ensure that stability and placements are maintained, where possible.<br/><br/>Many foster families have lifelong relationships with the children that they foster even after the children leave their home, but some placements do break down and come to abrupt endings.  EPIC believes there should be built in support mechanisms to prevent this from occurring, and that where it does, young people are supported through this difficult transition.  Children approaching their 18th birthday are particularly vulnerable because they are going through a lot in their own lives from sitting leaving certificate exams to aging out of the service.  It is a turbulent time.  They may be pushed to make independent decisions with little support or preparation.  EPIC has experienced several cases of children approaching their 18th birthday and having to abruptly leave their foster placements and move back in with their birth parents on some occasions, who were previously deemed unsuitable carers.  The fact that such decisions cannot be challenged or that supports or interventions did not occur at an earlier stage is unacceptable.  All children experience difficulties and challenges during their teenage years, particularly in the home setting, but these can be more difficult for children and young people in care.  Such problems should be pre-empted and relevant supports provided to avoid the tragic abrupt ending of placements at a crucial time in a young person's life.  If a placement is going to end, child-centred planning must be a priority.  It is not simply a matter of finding another bed for a child.  <br/><br/>EPIC is aware that Tusla runs targeted recruitment drives for specialised carers.  Similarly, compulsory training for foster carers does occur but it is EPIC&rsquo;s opinion that more of it should be of a specialised nature.  EPIC recommends for example that Tusla develop a training module on LGBTI issues.  The need for such training is evident through our advocacy work and our publication on this issue entitled &lsquo;Coming Out in Care&rsquo;, which was a collaborative piece of work between EPIC and BeLongTo, was extremely well received.  More consistent support of targeted recruitment of foster carers would be beneficial as children placed in foster care often have specific needs.  More options, for example, for older adolescents going into care, such as supported lodgings, should be promoted.<br/><br/>Through our practice, EPIC has noticed that there is an increasing number of younger children under the age of 12 years old being placed in residential care.  We are aware of nine, ten and eleven year olds being placed in residential care.  While there was a dip in the number of younger children going into residential care for a number of years, this appears to have reversed of late.  There was a clear practice by Tusla not to place children under the age of 12 in residential care because it was deemed inappropriate.  If would be of grave concern to EPIC if this was no longer the case.<br/><br/>If a child is in care under a voluntary care agreement, Tusla must consider the parents&rsquo; wishes in relation to how aspects of the care are provided.  It is EPIC&rsquo;s opinion that a child who has been in care for a number of years should have their voluntary care agreements reviewed and a decision should be made as to whether or not it is in the child&rsquo;s best interest to remain on a voluntary care agreement or if a full care order should be sought.<font color="#FF0000"></font>The birth parents of children on voluntary care agreements can adversely disrupt the lives of their children in foster care, and there are instances where the mothers and fathers, often due to their own personal difficulties, may seek to disrupt their child&rsquo;s foster care placement.  Keeping children on voluntary care agreements in the longer term does not provide the child with a sense of security or permanency in their foster care placement. The following are examples of where birth parents sought to exert control over the lives of their children and the foster family, causing disruption to the detriment of the care placement: a mother insisting that permission should have been sought from her before giving her daughter a birthday cake on her third birthday; a mother insisting the foster carers use her buggy and not the one they already had; a mother refusing to allow her son&rsquo;s very long hair to be cut; and a mother refusing to sign passport forms because she did not want her child going on his first holiday abroad with the foster family. <br/><br/>Gaps are noticeable in aftercare planning and service provision for those young people on voluntary arrangements versus full care orders because these supports and services can be court-appointed.  That is very important for young people's transitioning out of care and into aftercare.  Parents of children growing up in foster care have been a largely neglected group in policy, practice and research, in spite of the fact that these parents are often vulnerable adults themselves who experience a profound loss and threat to their identity when their child is taken into care.  Parents&rsquo; involvement through contact is also likely to have an impact on children&rsquo;s stability and security in the foster family.  Where foster parents and birth parents have a good relationship, research has shown that there is a far better outcome for those children.  Birth parents should therefore receive greater supports in dealing with the trauma of having their child taken into care, as well as learning coping mechanisms to help them to focus their attention on what is in the best interests of their child. <br/><br/>The recently published HIQA inspection report of Dublin South Central found that foster care reviews were not taking place as required and this presented a significant risk.  This is unacceptable and reviews should occur sooner and more regularly to ensure that the child is being well looked after and that any difficulties are overcome before they escalate.  All children and their foster families should be treated equally in terms of the minimum level of supports that they receive.  Unfortunately this does not always occur with some people receiving a better level of support than others.  Where children require extra interventions the foster families should be supported in providing these.  EPIC recommends that Tusla is adequately funded to have the full complement of staff nationally and that staff receive adequate training to provide these interventions and adequately support young people and their foster families.  <br/><br/>All young people should know that they are entitled to make a complaint and how to go about making one.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has developed an outstanding resource known as TACTIC, Teenagers And Children Talking In Care.  These are  packs which should in fact be distributed to every child in care.  These packs are a tremendous resource for children in care, be it residential or foster care.  However, EPIC is aware that this does not always occur.<br/><br/>Some 15 fora have been set up around the country by EPIC with the support of Tusla to hear the voice of the child in care.  These are proving to be a great success. One fora with 11 children and young people based in Donegal, for example, is creating and producing a booklet that will be given to all foster carers to fill in prior to a new child or young person moving into their home.  The booklet contains questions and information that young people feel is needed to help support them in moving to a new placement and to alleviate some of the stress and anxiety about the move.  Some of the questions in this booklet include the following: &quot;Do you go to mass and, if so, is this expected of me?&quot;.  &quot;If there is Wi-Fi, what is the code?&quot;.  Who visits the house regularly that does not live there?&quot;.  &quot;Can I decorate my room?&quot;.  &quot;Is the house in the country or in a town?&quot;.  &quot;Do I get extra pocket money if I do chores?&quot;.  &quot;Can I go to events like discos or school trips?&quot;.  &quot;What activities, sports clubs or youth clubs could I join?&quot;.  &quot;What are the top five house rules?&quot;.  These are simple things that young people themselves feel would make their transition into a home easier.  <br/><br/>Where possible siblings are placed together in a foster family, but this is not always possible, especially with larger families.  A good level of access with a sibling is considered to be about one visit a month, perhaps for a few hours at a time.  This is not, in our opinion, nearly enough time on which to build a strong and lasting relationship with a sibling.  Siblings should be placed within a maximum radius in order to maximise the opportunity for sibling contact.  This is of particular significance in rural foster care placements because it can greatly impact on the foster carers' ability to support access.  Financial considerations should not be a limiting factor to maximising sibling contact.  This contact is invaluable and must be given greater focus.  For example, 18-plus year olds who are no longer in foster care may not be financially supported to attend sibling contact with younger siblings in care and this makes contact difficult for them to maintain.  <br/><br/>EPIC has had experience of several cases where situations were allowed to reach a crisis level before funding was found by the HSE disability services to provide full-time disability support for a young adult leaving care.  It is very welcome that Tusla and the HSE have recently agreed a joint protocol for inter-agency collaboration between the Health Service Executive and Tusla Child and Family Agency to promote the best interests of children and families.The new Child Protection and Welfare Strategy also clarifies and sets out the respective roles, duties and legal requirements of the HSE and Tusla in relation to children and vulnerable adults with a disability or mental health issue.  This will help to address many of the co-ordination difficulties and will improve inter-agency working between Tusla and the HSE.  This strategy is a central part of Tusla&rsquo;s ongoing programme of transformation and Epic supports this transformation.  It includes a new national approach to practice, the Signs of Safety.  EPIC looks forward to seeing the impact of such developments on the ground.</p><p>EPIC looks forward to seeing the impact of such developments on the ground.  However, EPIC would also like to see dedicated mental health teams, for example, for children in care who should receive a priority on CAMHS lists.  Provisions should always allow for exceptions and flexibility if it is deemed in the best interest of the child and this should be borne in mind in any holistic system.</p><p> We have highlighted many of the challenges around foster care that have been brought to our attention through the course of our advocacy work.  However, we also acknowledge the positive developments that continue to occur in foster care in areas such as cultural awareness and identity.  These improvements should be highlighted and EPIC acknowledges all the positive work being done by foster families, foster care organisations, including the Irish Foster Care Association, Tusla and the social workers working directly with these children and families.</p><p> I will close our presentation with the words of some children and young people about the positives of foster care: "I have two families"; "My foster brother is funny"; "There is another foster child here"; "Having someone to talk to"; "Getting more presents"; "Someone else to talk to"; "Having no worries and feeling safe"; and "Knowing someone is there for you when things go wrong".</p></speech>

I am surprised that some information on best practice, even unofficial or informal, is not provided for foster families, for example, booklets or brochures for households that foster children or information on "dos and don'ts" or what can or cannot be done.  I ask the witnesses to excuse my ignorance if I am using the wrong terminology.  Do private organisations provide such information?</p> <p>  Ms Charles stated that fostering a child costs on average &euro;58,000 per annum when done through a private foster care organisation and &euro;17,000 when done through a foster carer registered directly with Tusla.  Do the private organisations operate a business model that provides, for want of a better term, a five star service when compared with the benchmark?</p> <p>  Different models of parenting apply.  Some parents will shelter children more, while others will take a much more liberal approach.  Where does Ms Charles find the dividing line?</p> <p>  From listening to Ms Charles, there does not appear to be hard data or research on the reasons children move into foster care in the first place.  What are the triggers and issues?  What are the specific reasons?  Are they drug and alcohol addiction, physical and emotional abuse or a combination of factors?  Are there any data available on this issue?  From my work in mental health, I know we are struggling for data and we need to put some analytics behind it. </p> <p>  Ms Charles spoke about matching children with the needs of a foster parent.  This reminds me of my work as a recruiter for eight years.  We used to refer to matching as introducing people to people to see who fits with whom and with what job.  Is there any kind of due diligence around that?  Are there any contingency criteria that would best match this or is the system struggling for numbers and trying to find the best place for the child, as opposed to finding the five star treatment, to which I referred, in other words, an exact match?  In other areas, one will always find a 70% or 80% match in terms of culture but obviously when two bodies come together they grow into a new culture.  </p></speech>

I want to follow up on some of the points made by Ms Bond from the Irish Foster Care Association.  We all support her view that there is a need for more social workers.  She has made the point that 6% of children in general placements and 8% of children in relative care do not have a dedicated social worker.  I want to follow up on that point and another she made about it being critical to have robust infrastructure in place to support families and ensure knowledge is disseminated among Tusla's staff.  In dealing with crises will she give us a picture of what happens, say, at a weekend when one of the major issues is that there is not an appropriate out-of-hours service available?  I understand that while there is a telephone line service available to access a social worker, the social worker on-call is not part of the local team who might know the circumstances of the family involved.  Could either or both groups give us a picture, from their experience, of the shortcomings in the service and why it is so important to allocate social workers to all children and to have an out-of-hours service available?  A report published this morning by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, highlights the fact that 75% of the calls made to Childline are not made between the office hours of nine-to-five but at other times, including weekends or in the evening.  I want to get an understanding of what it is like for the families and children who find themselves in these circumstances.</p> <p>  I also want to follow up on the points made about after-care plans mentioned by both groups.  I can only imagine what it must be like for a young person who has already had a traumatic life having to leave a home on reaching the age of 18 years.  Ms Bond suggested that, in some cases, a carer's allowance or funding to assist in the provision of accommodation attached to a home might be provided.</p></speech>

I have said at previous hearings that our care system would effectively collapse without foster carers.  We are all grateful to them and to EPIC, which is an excellent organisation.  I have had some engagement with it.</p> <p>  I have some questions on a few different topics.  The presentation touched on the difference between the costs in the provision of public and private fostering agencies.  There could be two things going on there, or it could be somewhere in the middle.  Is it that it is a wasteful expense and, perhaps, that we are spending too much on these private agencies, is it the case that we are under-investing in the publicly-provided fostering agencies or is it somewhere in the middle?  This would help to get a sense of approximately what it is we should be spending or what would be appropriate.  I would imagine there is an element of under-investment at the very least.</p> <p>  The IFCA presentation referred to modifications to homes, which is an interesting point.  Is this along the lines of converting a garage adjacent to the home to accommodate partially independent living?  This is an interesting proposal and would probably not require a huge amount to bring such a policy back into operation.</p> <p>  The foster care committees are obviously a big part of the entire regime.  There are major obligations under section 7 of the Child Care Act 1991.  It came across in both presentations that perhaps individual foster carers do not feel they have the kind of support that they necessarily need and that they could go for significant periods without being inspected or visited by foster care committees.  Do our guests feel that the foster care committees are meeting their statutory obligations, is the regime that is in place adequate and do the people on those committees have sufficient training and qualifications to allow them to fulfil their obligations?  It seems that this is a potential weakness in the system.</p> <p>  I agree with EPIC.  I would very much support the idea that children under the age of 12 should not be in residential care.  That is not appropriate.</p> <p> My final two points relate to aftercare and regulation.  Would the witnesses have a view in respect of the requirement that someone who is leaving care would have to be in full-time education in order to receive aftercare and aftercare payment?  There seems to be a very sharp cut-off point for a person who, hopefully, would have been receiving a substantial amount of support and then, on reaching a particular a birthday after, he or she receives very little support.  This is an issue.</p> <p>  My other point comes off the back of the previous set of hearings on this topic with HIQA.  The latter certainly seems to feel that the area of fostering requires regulation, an issue which is outstanding.  It has restricted HIQA's ability to escalate matters where it felt there was risk and to follow up on risks.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on this.  I am mindful of the fact that, obviously, it is important to ensure that children are safeguarded and the highest possible standards but that balance is also in place.  We want regulation to be such that it does not totally discourage people from entering into fostering, particularly as it is such an important function.</p></speech>

My colleague from EPIC, Ms Karla Charles, will take the other questions.</p> <p>  The national standards for foster care require that children are matched to foster carers.  Every child who enters foster care must have a care plan that outlines all aspects of his or her needs.  Equally, foster carers who are approved through the foster care committees should have certain skills or expertise.  They might be parents of mature, older children and have a lot of parenting under their belt.  They might be parents of younger children with particular expertise in that.  One is, essentially, matching the needs of the child with the skills of the prospective foster carers.  Current regulations allow that a child is placed with foster carers and then a match is made.  What we really need to see is the match happening before the placement occurs.  If a child is coming into care in circumstances where we know his or her explicit needs and where we have a set of foster carers with the skills to meet those needs, this would be the optimum in terms of best practice.  The reality is, however, that often there are not enough foster carers and there are children constantly coming into care.  If we receive a child into care today under an emergency care order, he or she needs to be placed somewhere.  The social work fostering team will see who has capacity today and see how, within the pool of capacity, the child's needs can best be met.  Often the most immediate needs of the child relate to safety and security.  The child is then placed with foster carers.</p> <p>  The matching process takes place at a later stage.  The optimum for best practice would be that matching takes place before a child is placed.  If one is looking for a long-term foster care placement, then one is looking at the long-term needs of the child.  However, many children actually come into care on the basis of an emergency care order.  Initially, it would be classified as a short-term placement but then move into long-term placement.  If we have all the resources in place, then we can go for the best practice and go for the gold, but sometimes - on the day and in the moment - we must work with what we have.  If we are working with what we have, then it is about identifying and discussing the needs of the child with the foster carers and discussing how best those foster carers can be supported in meeting the needs of the child.  That might be by attending an additional training course or by higher levels of supervision and support from their link social worker.  This is why it is critical that every foster carer has a link social worker.  If they are experiencing stress in respect of a placement, the foster carers should be able to contact their social worker to discuss the problem and look to see how the foster family can meet the needs of the child.</p></speech>

IFCA looks at the wider infrastructure such as the educational needs and the mental health needs of children in care.  Looking at the core needs, every child coming into care is required to have his or her own social worker.</p><p>The child's care plan identifies the needs of the child including any additional educational needs such as a special needs assistant, mental health needs, speech and language therapy or occupational therapy.  When the State takes a child into care, it becomes the corporate parent of the child.  All parents work to ensure that one's child's needs are met.  That should be the standard for every child coming into care.  We would consider the wider infrastructure in that regard.</p><p> In terms of dissemination of information, we strongly feel that while policy development is critical and necessary, it does not stop there and there is a process to it.  Everybody who is using a policy needs to know what it is about, what it means, how it is understood and implemented and whether there is a clear and consistent application of the policy across different areas.  There needs to be a parallel process of training of everybody who is going to be using policies along with an evaluation of the policies' impact and whether there is an equal application of policies across the board.</p><p> The current practice in regard to emergencies out-of-hours, as noted in Mr. Shannon's report, is that section 12 gives the Garda power to respond to crisis situations after hours.  Tusla has an out-of-hours policy and out-of-hours support is also provided by the Five Rivers private fostering agency.  In a crisis situation, the Garda and the out-of-hours services have responsibility.  Tusla has acknowledged that this is an area it is working on.  The aspiration is to have out-of-hours support across the board.  If a child in foster care absconds, significantly self-harms or has suicidal ideation, there needs to be a common sense approach to consider what is needed for the child.  If he or she has absconded, it is not practical for a foster carer to go roaming the streets looking for him or her; instead, the Garda should be called.  If a child has self-harmed or had suicidal ideation, the most sensible option is to bring the child to the local hospital.</p></speech>

People from some areas where that has occurred have said that when such a number is given out, it does not get a huge number of calls and is only contacted in emergencies.  However, the Deputy is correct in what she says.  I was a foster carer for many years and all the issues seemed to happen at 6 p.m. or  7 p.m. or over the weekend.  That is when one needs access to a social worker to bounce ideas off.  I had a social worker friend in Cork who I contacted several times.  She helped me out on several weekends and advised me where to go but that was just between friends rather than her acting in an official capacity.</p></speech>

It is an emerging trend for many of these young people, while they might be chronologically 18 years of age, to not be at that level developmentally or emotionally because of their adverse early years experiences.  As Ms Charles of EPIC said, a person's chronological age should not be the cut-off date for deciding on their future needs.  In the recent past, several of our foster carer members faced that dilemma.  When Tusla's aftercare policy was developed, the lead implementation person for Tusla came and met with those foster carers to hear of their most immediate needs.  One situation involved a young person with mental health needs who was coming up to legal adulthood and required mental health services.  It went right to the wire, the week of her 18th birthday, before her onward placement was identified.  We are aware from the development of the aftercare policy that aftercare planning will start when the young person is 18 and it is very clearly identified that it is not a one-time life event but a progression.  We need to normalise foster care and children in foster care homes.  We need to ask ourselves whether, if it is good enough for a child in care, would it be good enough for one's own child?  All families naturally have a conversation with their own child regarding what subjects he or she will take after the junior certificate, what his or her interests and hobbies will lead to and what he or she thinks about the leaving certificate and what will happen thereafter.  Those conversations need to be had with all family members in a very natural home environment.  Unfortunately, children in care, when they reach the age of 18, unless in full-time education, are not the responsibility of the State.  However, responsibility must be taken for them because many young people do not have the capacity to be independent at that stage.  The experiences of our foster carers is that such young people stay in the foster care home placement and do not move out because they are still part of the family even though they may not be in full-time education.  That is the dilemma because aftercare is very much centred on the young person remaining in full-time education until he or she is 23.  There are one or two very good models that foster carers have initiated on their own behalf.  A foster carer in Wicklow has built an annex onto the back of her home and has two young women living there who grew up in her foster care and are now mothers themselves.  They are living their own lives independently but still have the wider family network that most families enjoy.  Many children in care do not have the same depth or density of family networks.  We propose that a cost-effective solution be found.  Several years ago, a grant for childminders was made available under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme.  The Government was trying to increase the number of childminders.  Small grants were made available to modify, for example, a garage at the side of a childminder's house or perform another modification to allow them to provide a childminding facility.  This would be a good solution to the continued support of these young, vulnerable people.  Currently, if they move out of home and it is not successful, they become homeless.  Sometimes they go into apartments and forget to pay their rent because they have not developed self-management skills.  We must remember that sometimes the journey for these young people is longer and that while they may be chronologically 18, they are not quite there in terms of their development.  It is a solution in terms of protecting the most vulnerable in our society.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked about the foster committee.  It is charged with the responsibility of approving foster carers.   Once a foster carer is approved, he or she is allocated a link social worker or that is how it should happen.  The social worker links the fostering department of Tusla and the foster carer.</p><p>The role of the link social worker is to provide support to the foster carer, identifying the carer's needs in terms of meeting the needs of the child and also his or her own ongoing training and development needs.  The training of foster care committees was mentioned.  Tusla has just conducted a review of the foster care committee procedures and policies.  Again, IFCA made a comprehensive submission to the development of that policy, highlighting a number of issues in respect of the previous policy.  One of them was the 40-year age gap rule which the Minister, Deputy Zappone actually directed be removed from that policy.  The foster care committee has responsibility for approving foster carers, hearing the outcome of allegations made against foster carers and reviewing placement breakdowns.  It does not have responsibility for day-to-day work with the foster carer.  When a foster carer runs into difficulty, the link social worker is the point of contact.  They play a significant role if we find ourselves in the position of placement breakdown or of an allegation being made against a foster carer. </p><p> The new revised foster care guidelines for foster care committees were mentioned.  There is one per Tusla area.  We would certainly recommend that training takes place for all foster care committee members.  When the original policy was developed in 2014, training was rolled out but of course membership of the committees will have changed since then.  It is critical that foster care committees are trained regularly because they play a critical role in deciding whether a foster carer can remain on the panel or whether someone can be approved as a foster carer.  Does Ms. O'Donovan want to add anything?</p></speech>

Deputy O'Sullivan raised the need for more social workers.  I am sure the members saw the "Prime Time" programme the other night.  There was a social worker on it who said she had a case load of 50 children of whom she was only able to see, on average, about 25 in a month.  That is a clear indication of how many cases she should have.  She should be able to see every one of her young people at least once a month in order to develop a relationship.  We all know that such relationships are key to ensuring the safety and well-being of young people in care.  They should have somebody to go to if they need help or assistance or want to disclose something.  That takes time and investment.</p> <p>  Deputy Neville was wondering about the caseload that a social worker should have.  It obviously depends on the complexity of the cases, which will vary.  That is where good management and support should come in.  If someone has 15 extremely complex cases, it is enough.  They may have 25, 30 or 40 cases if the needs of the children are less complex.  There are many very happy children living in foster families who are very well supported and looked after.  At certain stages in their lives, they may not need a huge amount of intervention by a social worker.  That relationship still needs to be maintained, however.  Coming back to my point about the turbulent teenage years, if the relationships start to become tumultuous within the foster family, it is important that the young person has developed a relationship with the social worker, who in turn has a relationship with the link worker, who has a relationship with the foster carers.  If these relationships are in place, we can deal with issues, have early intervention and provide training and support to those families.  It is common sense.  It is what all of us would do in our own family situations if our children had problems or issues that needed to be dealt with.</p> <p>  In terms of numbers, it comes back to management and support depending on the complexity of the cases.  The social worker on Monday night's "Prime Time" had 50 cases, which was clearly too much.  We solve the problem not only by recruiting more social workers, but also by investing in them and supporting them.  We have a lot of young social workers who have not been on the job very long and lack experience.  They get overwhelmed because they are not supported.  They are at the front line of raw, sometimes brutal, sensitive and traumatic situations.  They need support in order that they do not burn out, and in order that they are able to develop their expertise and learn to handle situations better as they progress in their careers.  Instead, we have social workers leaving because it is just too much and they get overwhelmed.  We need to retain social workers by way of a number of measures.  Obviously, we need to make sure they are being adequately remunerated.  More important, however, we need to ensure that the infrastructure and supports are there so that they receive proper management and support in dealing with those difficult cases.</p> <p>  In terms of aftercare, I concur with everything that Ms Bond has said about supported accommodation for 18 year-olds and the transition period.  We have made numerous submissions on aftercare over the last years.  We brought a group of young people in to the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Senator James Reilly.  He had a very frank discussion with them directly.  It is a big problem for EPIC that young people leaving care who are not in full-time education only receive supports until the age of 21.  They are generally the most vulnerable group.  They are the ones who had tumultuous childhoods, were probably in different residential homes and foster families, had very broken educational experiences, may not have done a leaving certificate or, if they did one, did very poorly.  They are not in a position to continue on in education and have not been shown any examples of what areas they could pursue instead.  We have always said that this very vulnerable group of young people needs to be better supported.  To be giving them less support than those in full-time education is counter-intuitive.  It is going to create greater expense for the State and greater problems further on.  Scotland has invested much more significantly than we have and is a good comparative example.  It is now supporting young people up to age 25 and 27 in terms of aftercare supports.  That is a minimum.  Under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, BOBF, we are supporting young people up to the age of 25, yet we are no longer supporting the most vulnerable of our young people in care at 21 or 23 if they are in full-time education.  I would be very happy to provide more information on this.  We have material up on our website.  We would be very happy to meet with the Deputy in respect of aftercare at another time.</p> <p>  On the cost issue of public versus private foster care, the main point I was trying to raise has to do with analysis.  We just need to look at what is being provided by the private foster agencies and what is being provided by Tusla.  The priority must be the well-being of the child in question, regardless of the cost.  If it is going to cost much more in terms of what the private foster companies are providing, then that is what is needed.</p><p>However, it has definitely been noted that foster carers prefer to be with a private foster care organisation because they receive better helpline support after hours and their link workers tend to have smaller case numbers.  Therefore, they are going to receive more support.  In terms of the foster carers themselves, they get more support from the private providers than from Tusla currently.  What we really need is greater analysis and a breakdown of what is being provided in those figures.  This is information I have footnoted in my opening submission as coming from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>recently.  What we need is a great analysis of what that includes.  Does it include the cost of the social worker and payments to foster carers?  It would be beneficial for the committee to raise this as an issue to find out what is being provided and what value for money is being obtained.<br/><br/>EPIC sits on two foster care committees.  Our advocacy manager sits on one and another of our advocates sits on the other.  Their feedback is that it is hugely beneficial and that the committees are extremely thorough.  A great deal of time and effort goes in from everyone on them and they are an invaluable resource to have.  I concur with what IFCA said.  It is about ensuring the members on the committees are up to date and are given time.  There is a great deal of background reading and investment from the individuals involved which must go into preparing for each committee meeting and they should be supported in that regard in order that the decisions they make are the right ones.<br/><br/>Deputy Neville asked about triggers for young children moving into care.  There is a body of research and data which I will not go into.  Generally, the hard data relate to emotional, physical, sexual and neglect issues.  They are the common reasons.  Tusla holds data on this.  There is a wide and broad body of available data.<br/><br/>On the booklets and best practice, we should have all this sorted by now, but we do not.  There is certainly very good practice.  I will defer to my colleague, Ms Guinan, who will talk a little bit more about some of the work we have done in EPIC through some of our fora.</p></speech>

Our fora are doing fantastic work in line with Tusla.  Dublin north city is developing an A to Z of words for children who are taken into care.  It is sad in a way what happened in Donegal where the Donegal forum had so many placement breakdowns and emergency moves.  Social workers in that position have two different stresses.  They have to find a bed for a child and to ensure he or she is safe with child protection guidelines being followed.  All the young person wants to know is that he or she is going to another place, what the Wi-Fi code is and whether he or she can eat his or her own food.  It is the things that get lost.  We have to remember that child-centred placements and planning must come first.</p> <p>  We tried to get the following clarified before we came.  It is a question we want to ask.  TACTIC and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs developed an amazing booklet which was launched two years ago.  It is a story booklet containing guidelines for children entering care.  It is age appropriate for two different levels of younger and older groups entering foster and residential care.  We would love to see that.  Tusla committed to giving the booklet out for any admission to care but we are not sure that is happening.  We would love if the committee could look into it.  We are just waiting on the answer.  It is an unbelievable resource which, and this is key, was developed over two years by care leavers and people in care who are the best experts.</p> <p>  We would love if young people coming into care were told about EPIC and of their entitlement to an independent advocate.  We would love to see our materials forming part of any booklet sent out when admissions to care occur.  That is not happening currently and we have trouble, as do all our sister organisations internationally, accessing children in foster care because of data protection and the gatekeepers.  We have direct access to every residential and special care unit and we provide a visiting service at Oberstown, but we would like to see improvements around our access to children in foster care.  The core work we do is listening to children in care, and we would love that to be mentioned.</p></speech>

The main point about regulation, which the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, brought up recently before the committee, is that it only goes so far.  We support a certain amount of regulation.  However, while one can regulate for infrastructure elements, one cannot regulate for the qualitative aspect.  It is about quantitative versus qualitative and what one can and cannot regulate.  Some of it cannot be regulated.  It is not a panacea for everything.  While we support HIQA in its drive to have regulation, it is only one element.</p></speech>

Having listened to the questions and answers, I will turn to detail.  How many visits do members of the Irish Foster Care Association receive from social care workers annually?  I am sure all these data has been built up by the organisation.  How many visits do children in care receive annually?  If there is a child there for 12 months, has he or she received 12 visits?  There have to be standard guidelines and best practices.</p> <p>  Has the IFCA highlighted regularly the lack of resources and consistency?  Page 10 of its report refers to the lack of correspondence from social care workers.  Surely, the IFCA is part of the chain of engagement and follow-up.  How much social care interaction does it actually get?  We talk about the link worker, but that is for the foster carer.  I am talking about the social care worker for the child in relation to the communication IFCA is getting.  That communication seems to be vital because what came out of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report yesterday was the lack of communication and consistency within the various organisations.  We are dealing with complex cases which may involve not only the family but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other bodies and we need to know the dots are connecting.</p> <p>  I attended EPIC's conference last year.  On the voice of the child, they are very clear that we do not listen and that their voices are not being heard.  The one thing that struck me at the conference related to aftercare.  There is nothing there for the child who chooses not to go to school and who wants to take the year out.  I have heard Ms Bond and Ms Charles advocate for that.  What can the committee do for that gap year if we want to normalise it?</p><p>We give the children a gap year in normal circumstances to see what courses they might want to take up, but if they do not proceed to third level at 18, there is nothing for them.  Reference was made to private foster care organisations.  I do not understand the distinction in this regard.  Is it that private foster carers offer a home as opposed to children being placed in an institution?  I need to understand that because that will help me to understand the placement of 12 and 13 year olds.  A 17 year old and a 13 year old are quite different and there is also a significant difference in cost.  When they hit 18 and foster parents want to keep them because there is a bond, they can build an annex and so on.  Does that mean foster children do not get the same opportunity in another set-up?  Where lies the duty of care to the children not just at 18 but into the future on the part of the State?  What is EPIC's vision in this regard?  What proposals has it made to the Department on it?</p></speech>

Their compassion and passion for our vulnerable children comes through clearly.  Does EPIC agree with the statement that, given the emotions of children, institutional care is of a lesser quality than direct foster care in a home?  There has been an increase in the number of children under 12 being placed in institutional care.  Is that due to the lack of foster carers or is there another issue?</p> <p>  I refer to difficulties for foster carers with birth parents.  In my experience, if a birth parent has an addiction, for example, the child often ends up with a relative as his or her foster carer.  The carer then gets a knock on the door at 4 a.m. demanding money for drugs or demanding the baby.  That is stressful and frightening and if this happens every two weeks, I imagine the child becomes fearful of his or her parent coming along trying to take him or her away if there is no money.  It is almost like a ransom situation.  It sounds odd but it happens frequently.  The need for foster care is greater in disadvantaged communities, much more so than in other communities, and it is intergenerational.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the 3,000 children who are homeless?  I looked out for two families who were sleeping in their cars when the crisis was beginning to dawn on us several years ago.  If I rang the local authority on their behalf, I was told social workers would be sent out and the children would be taken into care.  That was a frightening response and they treated it as a threat.  That prevented many homeless parents reporting where they were sleeping.  It is different now as these people are accommodated in hotels.  However, I imagine the need for foster care is high among homeless children and I would like the witnesses to clarify the position.  Are there many demands on EPIC's services from homeless families and agencies advocating for them?  I also include refugee children in this regard.</p> <p>  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report was shocking and distressing.  He urged us all to become aware of the extreme heartbreaking cases that exist, as parents and as a nation.  This raises the issue of whether HIQA needs more enforcement powers in certain circumstances in centres.</p> <p>  With regard to the privatisation of foster care, my ideological outlook is that such services should be provided by the public sector in order that they are accountable.  There is a dearth of social workers, nurses and other health and social care professionals in the public system.  The private system seems to have the capacity, especially in nursing, with more terms and conditions and less chaos and stress.  Who would not take a job in this sector?</p> <p>  What about investment in the public system?  Linn Dara mental health facility is closing half its beds.  How easy is it for children to access mental health services given it is tough for the adult population?</p> <p>  It was well said by Ms Bond that we do not abandon our own children at 18.  They all rely heavily on family networks and we allow them to explore their future from a safe distance.  That has to happen for children who reach the age of 18 in foster care.</p></speech>

What would be the top three issues to raise with them regarding children in care and foster carers from the perspective of both organisations?</p> <p>  What is the witnesses' source of funding?  What support, if any, do they receive from Tusla?  Following the commentary in recent times, do they have confidence in the agency which has come under a great deal of scrutiny?</p> <p>  Are the witnesses aware of the work being done by Maria Lotty in UCC on early childhood trauma?  If so, do they have a comment on it?  If not, that is fine.  It is a new development and it represents a breakthrough for the future in investing in children while they are in care to deal with trauma, and equipping foster carers in how to recognise that and so on.</p> <p>  Would they favour abolishing 18 as the age at which foster care ceases, given it is an arbitrary age?  Perhaps it should not be provided for in legislation.  As Senator Devine said, in this day and age, none of us as parents abandons our children at 18.  Many of us know children who stay at home until they are aged 30.</p> <p>  I am interested in Ms Bond's comments on aftercare and providing on-site accommodation.  Many children in care do not have the wherewithal to live independently.  For example, a foster parent came to my clinic.  She had an adult child exiting care at 18 and was worried about her future.  She had saved every penny of the allowance she had received from the State to buy an apartment for her foster child in order that she could live independently near her.  That is an extraordinary commitment from a foster carer by any standard.  However, the aftercare issue needs to be tackled because every child is headed that way.</p></speech>

We have made numerous submissions to the Department on the importance of increasing the age of support for those aged under 21 who are not in full-time education.  We neglect to think about the learning that all of us as service providers need about the effects of trauma and neglect on the education of these adults.  They are not the same as their peers in the general population who grow up in loving homes.  They are predominantly late to education and sometimes aged over 23 and, therefore, not entitled to services.  They take courses that they do not necessarily want to access aftercare funding.  This needs to be examined.  We can forward to the committee recommendations that we have made.</p><p>The provision regarding the age of 18 should be abolished.  These are the most vulnerable children in our society.  We have a responsibility and a duty.  It is not only services across Departments that have a responsibility but society as a whole.  We are not doing a good job of looking after these children and we all have to look at ourselves, including statutory services, and consider how we can improve the provision of services to those children.</p></speech>

What we can do is provide exactly the same supports up to and beyond the age of 18.  At a minimum, we should be looking at 25 or 27.  If we look at the general population, they tend to leave home, on average, seven to eight years later than children in the care system yet these children have been brought up in supportive and loving environments that have been structured, have been attending school and have been given options, possibilities and examples of how to be confident and contributory members of society.  For the most part, children in care do not have this or have had a certain element of it if they have been lucky enough to get into a wonderful foster family.  Therefore, they need greater supports.  EPIC does not have an upper age limit, so anybody who has had care experience can contact our organisation and receive support.  That is the way it should be.  Even a young person in their late 20s who has been in care and suddenly finds himself or herself at a difficult point in his or her life should have somewhere to turn in order to receive support.  There should be no upper age limit and a downward slope of supports should be provided as young people find their feet.  We should be looking at the individual needs of the young person in a holistic fashion and taking it from there.</p></speech>

They always tell us that as soon as they turn 18, it is a case of it being up to them to take up support and that aftercare is voluntary - they did not answer their phone for the past three weeks so, therefore, they missed their meeting and might then miss an aftercare payment.  There is so much pressure and responsibility on the day they turn 18.  The language relating to aftercare needs to change and the support around aftercare definitely needs to change.</p> <p>  A new aftercare policy is being drawn up.  The Minister said that, from September, all young people will be entitled to an aftercare plan.  While an aftercare worker will be guaranteed to those leaving care, there is no guarantee that aftercare workers will be allocated to those leaving foster care.  From what we can tell, the policy is saying that they will have access to a drop-in service but they will not be guaranteed access to aftercare workers.  We think this needs to be changed as well and we recommend that this take place.</p></speech>

That was the origin of private foster care agencies.  Foster care is foster care.  It is a child being placed in a home with a family.  The distinction is that the private agency is a business - a company - that employs staff to deliver services.  Tusla has its own direct services.  I am trying to draw a parallel.</p></speech>

If someone applies to a private company, he or she then deals with the company, which allocates a link worker to the person and manages his or her affairs as a foster carer.  The approval of a foster carer for the private company or Tusla is managed by Tusla but people can foster through a private company which issues a payment to them and so forth and deals with the social worker.</p></speech>

The child may not be placed.  In respect of a foster carer with a private agency in Limerick, the child could have come from Dublin or any part of the country and the child's social worker may still be placed on that team in that area so it limits the contact with the child but the wraparound service is with the private agency.  The foster carer's support is with the private agency.</p></speech>

There are many players on the field.  Every child would have a children-in-care social worker, who is a Tusla-designated social worker, and every foster carer is allocated a link social worker.  No requirement is set down for the number of visits, for example, that there must be 12 visits per year.  In respect of the journey of a placement, if a child is moving into a placement, the initial stages would require high levels of support on the part of the child's social worker with the child and by the link social worker with the foster carer if a foster carer has one.  When the placement has settled down, it might go nicely and contact could involve phone calls or visits.  It would be very important for the child's social worker to see the child at all times.</p> <p>  It is important for the child's social worker to come into the family home, to see the environment in which the child is living and to have an opportunity to speak to the child and hear his or her views about his or her placement, such as whether he or she is happy and whether his or her access visits with his or her family are frequent enough.  Equally, it is important for the foster carer to be able to say how things are.  Things could be fine for the moment but, as we know, in family life, we can hit bumps on the road.  A child might be having separation or anxiety problems.  He or she might be experiencing attachment difficulties and he or she may generally be displaying behaviours.  This is, again, when the level of support would need to go up.  One is essentially looking at the level of support for the level of need.  Generally, when children become very settled in placements, it is then that they begin to think "This is okay, I can be my real self here".  Sometimes the true self steps up and children can then display all levels of behaviours because they are pushing the foster carers to see whether they will still want them.  It is a case of "If I do this, will you still want me?" or "If I push it another little while, will you still want me?"  It is about the foster carers and children, particularly the children, finding themselves within the foster care home and finding out where they fit , how much they are wanted and the degree to which this adult will fight for them.  It is complex.  What we are essentially saying is that the needs of the children must be central to everything and all services should be led by the needs of the child.</p> <p>  In respect of foster carers and their correspondence with their link social worker, they would not have direct correspondence with the child's own social worker.  Communication would take place through their link social worker.  Foster carers around the country have different experiences, from very high levels of communication to very poor levels.  If I have a difficulty today and need an answer such as whether my child can get consent to go on the school trip next week or an answer regarding a specific aspect of my care, I need it today.  Next week will probably be too late.  What we are asking for is that systems of communication and protocols be developed in respect of how people communicate and are communicated with in return.  Everybody is working to ensure that the placement is successful for the child.  That is everybody's role.</p><p>That is an area that has been highlighted through our members on our helpline.  It is probably the source of most frustration.</p><p> In terms of the gap year and flexibility, perhaps we should consider not having cut-off ages for children in care.  Again, in terms of normalising, we should always be looking at the norm for every other child when we are benchmarking for children in care.  Often it comes down to the child and his or her ability to engage.  In terms of the aftercare policy on continuing education and a continuation of financial support up until the age of 23, IFCA is clearly stating that we need to see the criteria involved.  Is an apprenticeship acceptable, for example?  If a person starts a course but does not like it - as is the case with many young people - can he or she switch to a different course?  We need to have a degree of flexibility.  A huge amount of thought and consideration has been put into the aftercare policy that has been developed by Tusla.  There has also been extensive consultation on the policy.  Tusla has offered consultation to IFCA members around the country in recent weeks and months.  When the policy is implemented, we will be assessing its impact on the ground.  This comes back to the point we made earlier, namely, if we develop a policy it must be streamlined, people must be trained-----</p></speech>

It is quite disappointing to hear about 12 year olds in residential care because we had moved away from that kind of care provision.</p> <p>  Senator Devine asked about relative care and the system to protect relative carers.  Relative carers, like general foster carers, need to have link social workers and to have the same support structures around them.  As we know, the dynamics of family relationships can be quite complex and if a foster carer is caring for his or her grandchildren, for example, a higher degree of protection is required within that relationship.  Families need to be supported and homeless families need higher levels of support.  Children growing up in homelessness is a real tragedy for our society.  Families should not be fearful of having their children taken from them.  We need to be supporting families with their own children.</p> <p>  On the issue of HIQA and the regulation of foster care, as EPIC has stated, this is positive and has contributed significantly to improvement of services, particularly for the most vulnerable in our society.  However, regulation in itself does not improve all aspects of services.  Foster care, given the complexities of the relationships involved, is based in relational dynamics and sometimes it is difficult to capture the quantum of what that looks like.  However, recent Government policies including Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the well being indicators for children, children's position within the Constitution and their participation in society should all be taken into account in the context of placing children in care.  There is learning from the implementation of the pre-school regulations, which are now almost 20 years old.  There were lots of teething problems with that because initially it was about regulating the infrastructure.  However, when one is talking about children, one must focus on relational dynamics.  One is actually talking about the quality of relationships and the same is true for foster care.</p></speech>

It is challenging for foster carers to gain access to mental health services for young people in their care.  It requires a high level of advocacy on the part of foster carers to provide access for children to a service which is their right.  Children in care are the most vulnerable children in our society and it should be a matter of right for them to receive services rather than having to lobby or advocate for them.  Does that answer all of Senator Devine's questions?</p></speech>

Another important issue is the promotion of strong working partnerships.  IFCA works very well with Tusla but that is not something that can be taken for granted.  Tusla must proactively work to ensure good relationships with partners.  The other main issue for foster carers would be the allocation of link social workers and children-in-care social workers.  Again, we are aware that Tusla is engaged in a recruitment drive.  As the EPIC representatives have said, it is difficult at the moment to recruit social workers.  Recruitment is challenging and then when social workers are recruited, retention issues arise.  We need to evaluate the caseloads of social workers because their work is challenging.  There is a lot of trauma involved and, at the end of the day, social workers are only human.  We need to support our social workers in the work they are doing.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about confidence in Tusla.  We respect the fact that Tusla is a relatively young agency and that it inherited a lot of systems from the HSE.  A transformation process is taking place.  Tusla issued a statement yesterday acknowledging that while a lot of changes are taking place, more work needs to be done.  We need to stick with it.  We need to work with Tusla and support our colleagues in that organisation.  There are people in Tusla who are working incredibly hard but it is not perfect.  We have data on the services provided to foster children and their carers and we are the conduit for channelling that information to Tusla.  It is by working in partnership that we can address the issues.  As long as we have open, trusting relationships that are respectful and we all work in the best interests of children, then I am confident we will get there.</p> <p>  My colleague, Ms O'Donovan, will answer the questions on funding.</p></speech>

That is our core funding, which covers our office overheads, staff salaries and enables us to provide our services.  We have a service level agreement with Tusla that we complete annually, based on our operational plan and our plans for the year.  We also receive funding through Pobal by way of its scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, programme for 2016 to 2019.  That covers the salary for our head of support services which allows us to expand on that service.  Funding also comes from our own activities and from membership fees from over 1,600 members.  We obviously develop training materials, including the pre-approval training for foster carers and the foundation for fostering that is used by most Tusla areas as well as by private agencies and we have a very small stream of income from the sale of that material.  That is an outline of our funding, more than 60% of which comes directly from Tusla.</p></speech>

The service is demand driven.  If we are to ask for more social workers to be provided, we will have to be able to give a cost.  If the delegates do not have an opinion or figures, that is fine.  It is not a witch hunt; I am merely trying to educate myself.  Is the ideal ratio 1:20 or 1:25 or is there an ideal ratio?  Are the private companies finding it difficult to hire social workers?  I understand they have their own.  Are they finding that there is a shortage of social workers?</p></speech>

Is there a danger that foster carers will be lost because of the difficulties in providing support for them?  We can make a strong argument for putting more resources into the system, whether it be people or money.  Many children leaving care will end up becoming homeless at a later stage in their lives.  That raises the argument about the need for after-care plans.</p> <p>  As a committee, we want to make recommendations.  Are there other issues the delegates want to add that would strengthen the case we want to make?  Reference was made to Scotland.  Are there international models of best practice to which we could point and, if so, to follow up on Deputy Tom Neville's question, how much more would it cost?</p></speech>

Ms Bond spoke about regulation assisting matters.  We heard from the Health Information and Quality Authority two weeks ago that, essentially, the area was unregulated, whereas, if I understood Ms Bond correctly, there is a degree of regulation.  To what extent is the area regulated?  What exactly is the shortfall to which HIQA was referring?  I want to understand the position better.</p></speech>

I hope we will cover all of the questions raised, but if we do not, members can let us know.</p> <p>  On the provision of services for young people seeking to access mental health services, it is a matter of matching the needs of young people with the services provided.  The provision of mental health services is crucial for children in care.  EPIC would like to see dedicated mental health teams for children in care who should receive priority on CAMHS, child and adolescent mental health services, lists.  We sometimes find it very difficult to gain timely access to mental health support services for children in care.  That is simply not good enough.  If children in care have to wait six months to one year to access such support, it is too long.  The trauma they have suffered is, therefore, not being dealt with adequately.  Foster families or children in residential care receive support on a day-to-day basis from those around them, but they also need specialised support and intervention services and should not have to wait so long to receive them.  </p> <p>  EPIC is a member of the Children's Mental Health Coalition.  I strongly encourage the committee to consider the submissions it has made on mental health needs and into which we have fed with respect to children in care.  We have strong ongoing concerns about sending children outside the State to avail of specialist mental health services and raised the issue many times.  There may be occasions on which it is the best idea to send a child out of the State, but we rely on this option too much when we should be developing greater expertise, if there is a specific mental health issue within the State.  One of the big issues in sending children out of the State for a number of years to receive treatment and support involves their reintegration when they come back when often there is no reintegration plan.  If they return at the age of 18 years, aftercare issues arise.   </p> <p> On whether Tusla is fit for purpose, we have all been digesting Geoffrey Shannon's report on the findings of the audit of the use of section 12 of the legislation.  Tusla which is a relatively young body is on the road to reform.  We must have confidence in it because it has made progress.  It is reaching out to agencies such as ours.  It is trying to learn from us and our expertise and that of other agencies.  It is happy to work with us in that regard, which is all very positive.  Unfortunately, however, the rate of progress is a little slow and the public perception is that the agency is constantly reacting to crises.  That is unfortunate because a great deal of good work is being done.  Tusla is on the road to where we want it to be and we have to support it.  That includes support not only from organisations and agencies with which it works but also cross-departmental support.  The review of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures that is taking place should involve an examination of how the HSE, the disability and education sectors can be reinforced to support the work of Tusla, as opposed to people having the view that it is not their job, that it does not involve them, and keeping it all separate because life does not work like that.  The statement it made yesterday is to be supported.  We must ensure it is provided with everything it needs financially to ensure we can put behind us the child protection horrors the country has witnessed in the past and try to move forward.  Unfortunately, there will always be incidents that are unavoidable, but we need to try to ensure they are kept to a minimum.  We can only do that by all working together and supporting this relatively young agency.</p></speech>

If representatives of Tusla are to come before the committee, I would raise three points with them.  When we meet young people, they always tell us that they believe they are not listened to and that they are not part of the decisions made about them.  All children in foster care should be listened to and be part of every decision made.  It is about their lives.  Social workers and foster carers move on; the children are the only ones who are static in the process.  Second, as stated by the Irish Foster Care Association, all children in foster care should have a social worker, with whom they would have regular contact, and they should all have a linked social worker.  Third, a quality service of a national standard should be provided - it is evident from our work that there is no national standard - both for the child and the foster family.  It should especially include aftercare services.  A lot of work needs to be put into the aftercare services being delivered.  They are doing great work, but it is not a national service.</p> <p>  Core funding for our entire advocacy service is provided by Tusla.  We receive philanthropic funds for research and youth engagement which come primarily from Atlantic Philanthropies.  In later years we have received funding from the Tony Ryan Trust.  We have received the odd grants for which we have applied here and there.  We are always trying to secure funding.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2736" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Bond" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017053100002#Q01200"><p>I will be brief.  </p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about other models.  There are good models in the United Kingdom in having clusters of foster carers.  It is called the Mockingbird project, as part of which clusters of foster carers come together.  Two or three foster carers provide respite care and it is a little like a wider family network.  Where a foster carer needs support or there is a crisis, there is somebody whom the child knows to provide respite care.  It is normal and natural.  That is a good model that we should consider.</p> <p>  On the recommendations the committee could make on our behalf, we certainly recommend a review of national foster care standards.  In response to Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire's question, there are national foster care standards, but they are set down in legislation and what we have is inherent in the difference.</p><p>HIQA monitors the implementation of the standards but there are recommendations for change.  The national standards for foster care are now 14 years old and we will call for a review of them to take into consideration the vast range of Government policy change in the past ten years, taking in the rights of children; children's rights within the Constitution; Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures; and national well-being indicators for children.  We could match the well-being indicators for all children and those in foster and residential care, and that would be very tangible work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017053100002#R00200"><p>I have a small point on foster carers and concerns about losing them.  We have to realise that when children are placed in foster care, it is a family home and very often there are other children in that family home.  When we look at regulation, policies and procedures, we must always the safety of the child, which is paramount, with allowing the children to live a normal family life in a family home.  Foster carers must be supported, as Deputy Rabbitte noted, and they need to see a social worker on a regular basis.  The child also needs to see a social worker on a regular basis.  There must be a relationship and every family survives when there is a good relationship in the family home and good communication, with people being able to talk openly about an issue if it arises.  A foster carer must know that no matter what concern he or she might have, whether it is small or big, he or she can go to the link worker about it, be listened to and there would be action.  The child must have a relationship with his or her social worker and be able to talk to the social worker or foster carer if there is a problem.</p> <p>  In my fostering experience, very often children in care will divulge information to other children in the family and not necessarily to a foster carer or social worker.  We need to ensure the children of foster carers are supported as well and looked after.  With all the regulation and everything coming down the line, it is getting more difficult for foster carers.  We had a consultation recently where six out of ten foster carers said they would not recommend fostering to another person at this stage.  It is a serious concern for us.  When we examine regulation, we must remember that this involves family homes and we cannot over-regulate that.  We have health and safety spectacles on when we have children in our care but we are not living in a residential unit and we must remember that.</p></speech>

The ratio issue goes back to what Ms Charles stated.  There could be a case load of five people but they could be really high level.  There should be weighted case loads, with a number and weighting, so if a complex case is being managed, it might have the weighting of two cases.</p></speech>

We must ensure that foster carers are fully supported in the role they do and are listened to.  They are living with a child 24 hours a day, seven days per week.  They know the child, its aspirations and hopes for the future.  They also know of what the child is capable.  Foster carers must be part and parcel of this.  I know foster care would not be an equal partner but such carers must work in partnership, not only with Tusla but with other agencies, mental health services and everybody across the board.  We are involved with a range of issues with our children and it would be the same with a foster child.</p></speech>

I am honoured to have been nominated to chair the National Cancer Registry Board.  In this brief opening statement, I would like to focus on the development of cancer services in Ireland over the last decade, the central role of the National Cancer Registry Board in this and the likely direction of short and medium-term developments.</p> <p>  By way of introduction I am a radiation oncologist, appointed to the St. Luke's radiation oncology network in 2006.  I succeeded my colleague and mentor, the late Professor Donal Hollywood, as radiation oncology adviser to the national cancer control programme in March of 2010 and, at the end of 2014, I took on the role of director of the national cancer control programme within the HSE.</p> <p>  In May 2015, the steering group and patient forum charged with developing the third national cancer strategy were established and they concluded their work two months ago.  It became clear through my work as a member of the steering group how much has changed in cancer services since publication of the last strategy in 2006.  The programmatic approach and the national scale of organisation and investment have been commended by an international external evaluation panel and are in perfect alignment with EU cancer control principles.</p><p>The concentration of specialist staff in the designated cancer centres has enabled multidisciplinary decision-making and the co-ordination of patient-centred care.  At the same time, there has been integration between primary care and hospital care with collaboration between the national cancer control programme and the Irish College of General Practitioners on developing referral guidelines and electronic referral systems for common cancer types.</p><p> In preparation for today&rsquo;s meeting, I have reviewed the National Cancer Registry Board (Establishment) Order of 1991, under the Health Act 1961, and the 1996 and 2009 amendments to the order.  I have read the annual reports and accounts from 2007 onwards and I have made contact with the outgoing board chair and all current board members.</p><p> The statutory functions of the NCRB are to collect and analyse information relating to the incidence and prevalence of cancer and to promote and facilitate the use of the data thus collected in approved research projects and in the planning and management of services.  By international standards, the registry has been hugely successful in fulfilling these functions.  For example, completeness of population coverage is 100%.  Registry data are used as the starting point for all local and national cancer service design projects.</p><p> Based on the work of the registry, we know that the incidence of cancer will go up by 50% between 2015 and 2025 and by approximately 100% by 2040.  These figures underline the importance of the third national cancer strategy, to be published by the Minister shortly.  From this, several things have to happen as a matter of urgency.  Approximately 40% of cancers can be attributed to lifestyle factors so we have to focus heavily on cancer prevention, good examples being the Healthy Ireland initiative and HPV vaccination.  Second, we have to stress the importance of early diagnosis, screening, direct access to diagnostics for GPs and a net increase in the capacity of the health care system to absorb the very significant projected increase in patient numbers.</p><p> The increase in the number of both patients and long-term survivors will generate a very large volume of additional data for the registry to collect, analyse and share.  To meet this challenge, there is a clear opportunity to automate and facilitate data collection from hospitals by linkage to the national medical laboratory information system, MedLIS, the national medical oncology clinical information system, MOCIS, and other clinical datasets.  The registry makes its anonymised data freely available to inform clinicians, health care providers and external researchers.  It has its own highly productive research output and this is going to expand significantly since the appointment of the current director, Professor Kerri Clough-Gorr, last year.  This is an innovative joint appointment creating a new post of professor of cancer epidemiology at University College Cork.</p><p> I reiterate the importance of the national cancer registry as a critical element of cancer services in this country.  The NCRB will become an increasingly important agency as we anticipate a return on Exchequer investment in prevention, diagnostics and treatment reflected by way of improved cancer survival rates and other outcomes.  I would be honoured to contribute to its future.</p></speech>

I read through his CV and it is extremely impressive.  I thank him for all the work he has done to date.</p> <p>  On providing services for those who have cancer, we are experiencing many difficulties in recruiting consultants in particular, as well as junior doctors and nurses.  Are we facing the same problem in cancer treatment and providing services for patients with cancer?</p> <p>  Dr. Coffey noted that approximately 40% of cancers can be attributed to lifestyle factors.  Are we doing enough by way of education to deal with that, starting in schools and moving upward?  I spoke to a coroner on Monday on a different issue and he made the point about the lack of knowledge among young people about an area that he has found himself dealing with.  Education is about preparing people for future life.  Have we done enough to incorporate lifestyle, whether it is what they are eating or physical activity - for example, into our education system from primary to secondary to third level - in trying to get that message across?  If not, what would Dr. Coffey like to see change over the next five to ten years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2770" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jerome Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#C00400"><p>I am happy to take both of those questions.  On the recruitment of professionals, I have not seen that as a real issue in the context of cancer specifically.  This is probably because there is evidence of and a sense that cancer services and the environment in which cancer specialists work as a result of significant investment on the part of the State.  Bringing people back has not proven to be a problem.  A recent example of which I am aware is my replacement as a radiation oncologist in the St. Luke's network.  Two or three posts were advertised and interviewed for at the same time.  There were 11 or 12 applicants for three posts.  That is a ratio one does not see very often in other posts in the service, which says a great deal.</p> <p>  In the context of other health care professionals, we depend increasingly on our health care nurses in oncology.  Our external panel, which I mentioned, has commented on that.  In the past couple of years, through the service planning of the HSE, we have focused on this and put money into training advanced nurse practitioners in oncology.  We are filling those posts.  We have community oncology, education posts and the national cancer control programme, so we are providing training and job opportunities at the end of it to ensure that these become attractive areas of the health service in which to work.</p> <p>  I take the Senator's point on prevention.  This country led the world with the introduction of the ban on smoking in the workplace.  That was for a particular age group.  More broadly, Healthy Ireland has been a very high-profile initiative and the cancer control programme contributes to that.  We have a cancer prevention element within the cancer control programme and my understanding, from the cancer strategy steering group's work, is that this would be developed.  It is probably necessary at this point to engage formally with the Department of Education and Skills on the strategy to see how we can contribute to the curriculum at primary, secondary and third level.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on that.</p> <p>  How important is it to place greater emphasis on and increase funding for primary care in order to enhance indirectly the services that hospitals provide for cancer and other patients?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2772" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jerome Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#C00600"><p>This is down to the foresight of my predecessors in the cancer control programme, Professor Tom Keane, Dr. Susan O'Reilly and Mr. Tony O'Brien.  From the beginning there has been engagement with primary care.  Electronic referrals are being introduced very broadly across the HSE.  However, cancer control got there first with electronic referrals to the cancer centres for breast, lung and prostate cancers specifically.  At the same time as resourcing software developments for GPs and the hard-copy referrals, there was work with the Irish College of General Practitioners and we have GPs on staff in the national cancer control programme to work out what the criteria are that mean it is urgent or non-urgent and that it should not be referred to the system.  That is very important in getting patients referred appropriately and correctly into the system in order to get diagnosed and managed.</p> <p>  The next thing we need to work on is follow-up post-treatment.  The latter is in the whole area of survivorship, which is being addressed by the cancer strategy.  When someone is finished treatment, is well and there is no evidence of any active disease, his or her follow-up should not necessarily be in a hospital.  The close-to-home principle applies.  It needs to be community or primary care but there needs to be a linkage so that the information relevant to the care is transmitted to primary care without any effort.  There needs to be a dialogue if a patient in follow-up in primary care has a problem and needs to get back into the system very quickly.  All of that is critical.  It is worth noting that the cancer control programme has made one if not two submissions to the negotiations relating to the GP contract and has made the point that resources need to be put into primary care in order to take the pressure off, but it is also more appropriate.</p></speech>

He has large shoes to fill and has done very well.  I am aware of how well he has done through a neighbour of mine.  He has done amazing work in dealing with massive tragedy for people within his field, for friends and the greater community.</p> <p>  To focus in on the human papilloma virus, HPV, vaccine specifically, one of the things I felt got most traction from a public interest point of view was when the committee discussed the impact of the fall-off in vaccinations of girls who are eight years old now.  We were able to extrapolate the data and it is a very powerful message to send to normal people going about their daily business.  Does Dr. Coffey agree that it is the way we should be going?  If we do not vaccinate correctly, many girls who are eight years old and who are walking around in flowery skirts will be dead by the time they are 40.  These are shock tactics but it is so serious that an image should be created of girls or boys walking around and the impact of not taking up the vaccine.  Is it the sort of methodology we should be using to inform people of the impacts?  There is a great deal of misinformation out there.</p> <p>  Another thing that occurred to me in my work as a community pharmacist is the importance of GPs in this area.  I did not realise that many people do not have GPs.  They go to random doctors here, there and everywhere and perhaps to consultants if they are having babies.  There is no contact with the GP unless they go private.  Sometimes diagnoses of cervical cancer and things of that nature can just fall between two stools.  I have seen it with people who are well educated and from very good socio-economic backgrounds but who do not understand the importance of having the basic level of intervention in the community.  The importance of having a core person in charge of one's health care is something that needs to be highlighted.  The GP is the person best placed to do that in the primary care setting.  What are Dr. Coffey's views on that?  How can we drive the message home?  Some of us leave it to our 30s to have children and we throw them out every couple of years.  That means some of us miss smear tests because we are trying to get pregnant and do not want to have a smear test.  I have seen cases of cervical cancer being diagnosed when the person has gone eight years without a smear test.  Cervical cancer is totally preventable and treatable.  On those two issues, is there anything the committee or the Department can do to try to offset some of the effects?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2774" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jerome Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#D00200"><p>There are a number of hugely important issues which I will try to separate out a little bit.  As a parent and as an oncologist who has treated people with advanced cervical cancer and advanced head and neck cancer, they are disasters that can now be prevented.  When one looks at other countries that have data because they started the vaccination system a little bit earlier, there has been a fall in the number of diagnoses.  That is where the benefit lies.  I agree entirely with the Deputy that the benefit did not feature in the headlines of the debate.  In a democracy, it is important to have a debate.  However, my sense is that much of the debate was based on belief and what people who may not have been highly health literate or scientifically literate felt was the case.  Girls who had vaccinations developed symptoms but the science could not link the two.  It was a complex debate.  The Deputy is right that the main issue got diluted and perhaps lost.  I would be happy to state that vaccination is important and it works.  I worry that parents who make decisions on behalf of their children are influencing other parents not to vaccinate.  We have seen a spillover from the HPV vaccination debate in other countries in Europe and in parts of the US, where people are not vaccinating against MMR.  We are seeing fatalities from infectious diseases which we do not see anymore.  It is horrific to feel we could have admissions to hospital and children dying because of the misplaced beliefs of the parents.</p> <p>  I will address the importance of the GP.  Other countries have looked at this from the angle of health literacy, which we have to start doing.  It is about doing awareness campaigns in the media about red-flag symptoms such as abnormal bleeding and lumps or bumps and telling people to go to their GP this week and not next month or a year from now.  I have seen patients who have had a problem for a while and either they had a fear or some other reason for not presenting at an appropriate time and they go from a curable situation to an incurable one.  They suffer from the symptoms of their disease simply because they chose not to present.</p> <p>  It comes back to the education programme.  We need to get people to their GPs and to get GPs to support a secondary action, order immediate diagnostics or refer immediately so patients can be seen within a week or two at the nearest cancer centre.  Health literacy should be a campaign.  The National Cancer Screening Service provides BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and BowelScreen and is very good at what it does.  It is a measure that is reflected in the numbers who attend for screening.  Uptake is never 100% because we can make something available but we cannot make it compulsory.  The challenge is in convincing people that it is in their best interests to get checked out.  Most check-ups will be negative but at least it provides peace of mind for them, their families and their health care providers that they have had the appropriate tests and do not have a serious diagnosis.</p></speech>

It is a comprehensive report looking at a ten-year vision for the health service rather than going from year to year and trying to move from our two-tier system to a single-tier model.  Does Dr. Coffey see the removal of private care in public hospitals as a positive or a negative in the treatment of cancer?  As a committee, we were looking at a system which is not really working very effectively in the global sense.  We will change it.  We are concerned that if we destabilise it, there may be negative rather than positive consequences initially.  We built a continuing review into our programme so that if changes are leading to a worsening of treatment for our patients, we will have to row back and look at the sequencing and phasing of it.  What is Dr. Coffey's view on the mix of public and private in the public system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jerome Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#D00400"><p>I have followed the work of the committee over the past year and I met Professor Tom Keane before he made his submission.  It was a very clear summary of what is happening in cancer services.  With regard to the here and now, it is important to say that the cancer registry has a statutory basis.  It has an obligation to retrieve cancer data from all hospitals whether they are publicly or privately funded.  It has all the data it needs.  There is a potential or need to modernise or apply a change.  It is for the Department and its committee to consider whether we make cancer a notifiable disease so it is the responsibility of the hospital to report to the registry instead of the registry sending staff out to retrieve cancer health files from hospitals.  To a large degree, that may not be too much of an issue if we get the technology right and export it automatically to the registry.  It is the data collection for the registry.  It will get easier as time goes by.  It will have to because the volume of data will massively increase over the coming years.</p> <p>  With regard to the public-private issue, what is important is that the outcomes are the best possible for all citizens.  Whether it is provided publicly or by a privately-funded facility, if they are applying high standards and if their reporting outcomes show that is the case, then the patient does well.</p></speech>

Obviously, data is king and the more data we have, the better we can plan our health services.  I hope the hospitals would be returning data to the registry rather than it being a case of the registry having to go out and look for it.</p></speech>

The software is primarily for scheduling and controlling machines and treatment departments but it has a dataset which can be linked.  It is already established.  It is hoped that the medical oncology equivalent, which has been procured and will be rolled out over the next couple of years to all 26 hospitals delivering chemotherapy, will serve the same function.</p></speech>

I do not want to throw any dark light on private care.</p><p>However, the public system gives much more comprehensive care in respect of cancer.  In respect of the prevention of cancer, we also have a strong section in the report about health promotion and protection.  That should start at school.  Children should be educated on healthy lifestyles, diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol, which are huge contributors to cancer.  It would appear to me that the uptake of cervical screening and mammography is poor, in the region of 50% to 70%.  That is disappointing for a population-based preventive measure.  What does Dr. Coffey think are the main factors at play?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2781" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jerome Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#E00200"><p>This year, there was a media campaign by the screening service which had a measurable impact.  When we remind people that the service is there and that it is free and beneficial, uptake increases.  There is a very visible campaign for BreastCheck and the cervical check.  That works.  While the screening service is separate from cancer control, we work very closely together.  Colorectal cancer screening worldwide struggles to get the same level of uptake as screening for other cancers.  The colorectal screening programme in this country is relatively young but it is getting there.  It will take effort to get to its target and that effort will have to be sustained.  Once one cuts back on the marketing, if I can use that term, the uptake rates go down.</p></speech>

There was an NCI all-Ireland cancer consortium meeting in Queen's University, Belfast, a year or two ago and there was a special session on this.  The other countries and jurisdictions doing colorectal cancer screening gave their experience, which was the same, namely, that it was hard to get uptake.  Perhaps patients are embarrassed to be tested in that way or whatever.  It takes continuous effort to get the rates up to a level at which they have an impact.  What is also unique about colorectal screening is that it picks up pre-cancerous lesions.  It does not necessarily find much cancer but does find a lot of polyps that would otherwise have developed into cancer over time.  That is a much longer-term benefit.</p></speech>

It is a while since I looked at it.  As far as I can recall, there have been submissions through the Estimates process in previous years to extend the programme to boys.  The Irish Cancer Society, with which I speak on a regular basis, is a very strong advocate of this and I support it.  I understand that due to the fall in uptake this year there are supplies available that could be rolled out and administered to boys.  Again, it would require a logistical probe to make that happen.</p></speech>

The National Cancer Registry is vital and important.  He and his colleagues have done amazing work in recent years dealing with cancer-related issues.  If I may say this gently, I think that in many respects they have taken a lot of the fear away from people who are scared, as many people now survive and have quite a normal life.</p> <p>  The hospice movement now plays a major role in after-care all around the country.  In my own constituency of Roscommon-Galway, Mayo Roscommon Hospice intends to develop a building on the grounds of Roscommon University Hospital.  It has raised the funds and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has agreed that the staff funding costs will be looked after by the Department.  Looking at the figures here, the difficulty is that such staffing cannot be afforded by the Department until about 2020.  That is a long time given the growing percentage of people who are suffering and will suffer from cancer.  Up to 2025 there is to be a 50% increase, and up to 2040, some 100%.  It is a shocking figure.  Is there a way in which we could fight to try to get that staffing issue sorted out more quickly?  It really is extremely important to the whole after-care scenario.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell referred to the vaccine.  The difficulty I have is that when some families speak about the after-effects on their child, it is hard not to listen and be concerned.  Obviously the vaccine is really important.  How can we reassure the growing number of parents who are deciding against getting the vaccine for their daughters?  If all of the experts are recommending it, it is very important that it is done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2789" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jerome Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#E01000"><p>I agree entirely with the Deputy on palliative care.  The hospice movement has been hugely successful here.  One of its successes has been finding alternative sources of capital funding to build facilities that were not there beforehand.  In terms of funding for the future, a couple of things need to happen.  Without betraying confidences, in the cancer strategy there is a recommendation that the cancer control programme in the Department of Health integrate palliative care.  There is a HSE palliative care programme and we work very closely with Dr. Karen Ryan, who is the lead physician on that.  We need to have palliative care integrated with cancer control programmes in order that we are not neglecting that part of the service and there is no geographical neglect either.  In terms of funding, I take the Deputy's point.  More staff means more funding.  Overall, though, the biggest driver of cost in cancer care is drugs.  The cost of cancer drugs is massive.  They are more effective than before and have fewer side effects and consequently we want to be able to fund them for our population but that is the biggest element in driving the total cost of cancer.  The provision of personnel is important and will happen.  It will not be as difficult to achieve as the funding of cancer drugs over the next 20 years.</p> <p>  On the vaccination point, it is very difficult when one is talking to parents whose child is ill and became so after vaccination.  It is also important to say that potential side effects of vaccines are reportable events.  There is a data collection process for that.  At this point, the scientific evidence and guidelines coming from the European bodies do not link the two.  If there was any evidence that added up to a note of caution or precaution, then the cost-benefit of vaccination would be entirely different.  Were we to state it is very effective at reducing the risk of various sorts of cancers in the long term but there is a 5%, 10% or 15% chance of permanent side effects from a vaccine given at a very young age, the decision to be made by parents would be very different.  Having put all that together, the scientific evidence and guidance is that vaccination is effective.  The causative link between the vaccination and the side effect that some children are experiencing has not yet been proven.  If that were to change there would be absolute urgency to change the policy.  Until that point, the cost-benefit is still in favour of vaccination.</p></speech>

In the HSE literature, there was a reference to care pathways for patients with symptoms.  He said that care pathway was not specifically for girls who have identified symptoms post-vaccine.  It was for the general population who may have symptoms.  It appears to me that if we want to increase the vaccination rate, we really need to approach the cohort of girls who feel they have been affected.  They should be examined medically.  That is the only way to distinguish between background symptoms that occur naturally and an increase in incidence occurring after vaccination.  Until something like that is done, the negative attitude to the vaccine will continue.  Pretending, or rather proposing that there is no association is not going to increase vaccination rates.  It has to be proven that there is no association.</p><p>That is something the Department should take on board.</p></speech>

Health care could reserve resources for patients who may have symptoms that arise following vaccination.  That would provide reassurance for parents and their patients that they will not be abandoned and that they will be listened to.  It might produce important data in the longer term, which would support us in refuting any possible link.</p></speech>

I have read Dr. Coffey's statement.  A couple of points arise.  I was probably responsible for having the National Cancer Registry set up in the first instance because I asked so many questions that somebody decided it was time to move on with it.</p> <p>  To what degree has the incidence of the various forms of cancer throughout the country, and any potential cause or causes, been identified and collated?  Do we have absolutely accurate information on that?  Every time I followed up on this matter previously, comparisons were made that I could not necessarily always agree with, based on my own information - comparisons made per 1,000 or the population and so on for instance.  I remember at one stage the incidences in Donegal and Tipperary were quite similar and that was not the information I was given in reply.  The populations were similar, so the only other difference there could have been was the age profile of the populations.  Obviously if data on the various forms were collated properly comparisons could be made.  In general, huge strides have been made in the treatment of cancer, which is great.  We should always try to have our statistics as up to date as possible.  If we have the statistics available on the number of incidents, the type and forms of cancer, the degree of treatment provided and which appropriate treatment was given, it gives us an advantage in terms of being able to deal with future issues.</p> <p>  The last point is in respect of vaccinations.  We have had this debate on a number of occasions.  It can be difficult.  My own layman's theory is that different people's metabolisms react differently to certain treatments.  I cannot prove that but I have seen and heard evidence to suggest that it might be so.  I know as well that in general, inoculation will have the biggest single effect on the broad sweep of cases that appear right across the community.  The side effects, however, can affect a number of people and whether they are directly attributable to vaccination remains to be seen.  We do not have information to that effect despite the exhaustive pursuit of cases such as my colleagues have referred to.  It would be useful if we did, because confidence in the system can be eroded if somebody is not able to tell us plainly that, in a given case, a person's child should not have had a particular vaccine because of its composition and the child's metabolism.  We have no way of knowing how to cross that Rubicon in the beginning because, at that particular age, the parent does not know what their child might be vulnerable to.  We await, in good faith, the best information we can get from those who are best capable of providing it.  We know that the broad thrust of the issue might be best dealt with by way of vaccination, which would have the biggest single effect across the board, but we do not know what percentage of the population might not benefit, whether it be 5%, 10% or a figure in between.  That information would be helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2797" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jerome Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#F00500"><p>To take Deputy Durkan's points in reverse order, his last point is very interesting, because we are currently at the point in cancer care where we are looking at the genetic make-up of a patient with a tumour to determine whether he or she will respond to treatment.  If he or she will not respond, we can choose not to give him or her the treatment, which would only cause side effects.  If we were in a position five or ten years down the road, or sooner, to determine from a blood test a person's genetic make-up, the likelihood that he or she will benefit from a vaccination and the likelihood that he or she will develop side effects, it would completely change and enhance the way in which we make those decisions.  That point is well made.</p> <p>  The first point was about data and geographical variation.  The National Cancer Registry is excellent at putting up on its website heat maps or distribution maps illustrating where there are higher incidences in one location compared with the national rate.  It is interesting to look at these maps.  If one looks at the slides it put up this week, which illustrates the newest data from the period up to 2014, one sees higher incidences in metropolitan or city areas for most of the common cancers.  When one looks at a report it put out a year or two ago, under the direction of Dr. Harry Comber, about inequality in incidence, it considered at a number of factors.  It looked at differences between young and old.  There is a higher incidence in the older age group.  It looked at socio-economic factors, which is probably an area in which we could have an impact if we focused education and intervention in the lower socio-economic areas where there are higher rates of lifestyle-related cancers such as head, neck and lung cancer.  The report also looked at rural and urban living as factors. There is a higher incidence of some cancers in rural areas.  People will not move to the country just to mitigate that risk but I take the Deputy's point on the importance of data and interpreting it to guide where to focus investment and where developments need to take place.</p></speech>

In his opening statement he said that the incidence of cancer will go up by 50% between 2015 and 2025 and by approximately 100% by 2040.  Will he outline the factors which influence those increases?</p></speech>

There are a number of issues here.  One is the size of the population and its age profile.  Those were all taken into account in the model.  The modelling work is quite complex and I do not understand the statistical element myself.  It says, however, that an increase such as this is inevitable.  The only way we could seek to bend the curve or reduce the number of new cases would be to focus strongly on lifestyle factors at this point.  These include smoking, and smoking rates are coming down, and reducing the alcohol intake.  These are lifestyle changes that we know about.  Unless those efforts are redoubled now, we will see the doubling to which the Chairman referred and we will see a lot more patients coming through.  We would hope that, with current treatment technologies, we will get better outcomes for those patients but one would prefer not to be a patient, even if one survives one's treatment.</p></speech>

When one thinks about alcohol, one thinks about various things, but one does not think about head and neck cancer, oesophageal cancer and other gastrointestinal cancers.  With smoking, one thinks about lung cancer, but one does not think about head and neck cancer, which is as morbid and as fatal.  One does not think about bladder cancer.  These common risk factors can cause a multiplicity of problems, both cancerous and otherwise.</p></speech>

I joined the scientific council of the International Agency for Research on Cancer last year.  It is an international organisation based in Lyon, which is run by the World Health Organization, WHO.  It looks at carcinogens.  It looks at chemicals, foodstuffs and anything else that may be causing cancer.  It looks at various parts of the world.  If an area of high incidence is found it looks at what local issues might be contributing.  In terms of foodstuffs in this country or other lifestyle issues, nothing major has been noted.</p><p>Radon in parts of the country contributes to a certain proportion of the incidence of lung cancer.  There is nothing obvious at the moment that needs to change from good status to bad status that will have an impact on incidences of cancer. </p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for re-nominating me to the position.  This confirmation process provides a welcome opportunity to discuss my vision for the future contribution of the NTPF and for my role as chairperson.  In order to do that and by way of providing the committee members with some background material I have in recent weeks forwarded to each member copies of my curriculum vitae, together with the NTPF&rsquo;s strategy and action plan for the years 2017 through 2019.  I propose therefore by way of this opening statement to deal briefly with these two matters.</p> <p>  In the first half of my career I held a variety of positions in both operating and service departments in Aer Lingus.  During that time I had extensive involvement at board level with the airline&rsquo;s wide-ranging list of subsidiary companies involved in what were then known as ancillary activities.  For much of the following 20 years, I led two national organisations as chief executive, namely, the Irish Hotels Federation and then Veterinary Ireland.  At home, this work involved extensive dealings with Departments, public bodies and the media, while abroad on the international front I represented these sectors in international organisations in dealings with a range of bodies, particularly at a European level.  In the course of this work I was nominated by IBEC to be a member of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, uniquely at a time when I was a serving general secretary of a trade union affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Having served almost ten years with the EAT, this work is coming to an end with the amalgamation of the EAT into the newly created Workplace Relations Commission. </p> <p>  On the community front, on behalf of Blessington and District Forum I have served on a F&aacute;ilte Ireland tourism destination development steering group and have particularly championed the development of a new greenway around Blessington lakes.  I have also been appointed by Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board as one of its nominees to the board of management of Blessington community college.  On the academic front I hold a masters degree in management practice from the Irish Management Institute and Trinity College, Dublin.  In addition to the above I was honoured to be asked to serve on the board of the NTPF, a body which has carried out some great work in delivering faster treatment to hundreds of thousands of patients in the public health care system. </p> <p>  While not wishing to delve too much into the history of the organisation, it is worth noting that from its establishment on an administrative basis in 2002 and on a statutory basis as an independent agency in 2004, the NTPF succeeded in reducing waiting times for public patients from their original levels of two to five years down to an average waiting time of two and a half months.  This was achieved through the direct commissioning of patient-level treatment for public patients by the NTPF, mostly in private hospitals. </p> <p>  In 2009, the nursing home support scheme, referred to colloquially as the fair deal, was established and the NTPF was given a key role in the pricing of long-term residential care.  In what is a vitally important task in terms of its importance both for the users of the system and for national finances, the NTPF has delivered consistently in setting up the system of agreeing prices with more than 400 nursing homes and achieving satisfactory results over the years.  I should say that we are currently working with both the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform in a review to ensure that viable and effective systems continue to be provided for both providers and users of long-term residential care throughout the country. </p> <p>A decision made in 2012, reflecting then Government policy, assigned additional responsibilities to the NTPF and effectively signalled the end of the organisation&rsquo;s direct patient treatment commissioning role.  It also reflected a major resulting change in the operational framework of the NTPF, as this commissioning work had represented a significant part of the activity of the NTPF since its inception.  The result was that the organisation re-focused its efforts to support the scheduled care system in areas such as data and analytics, negotiation of nursing home prices and audit and quality assurance.  Through these efforts, the organisation continued to provide valuable support services to the broader health care system at a time when it was undergoing significant change and reform.  During this period of change and uncertainty, the organisation reduced its staffing levels to reflect the changing roles and the reduction in annual budgets. </p> <p>  In more recent years the role and function of the NTPF have been clarified and have evolved in line with Government policy but the original intention has always remained the same, which is to achieve the faster treatment of patients.  On foot of the decision of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in 2016 to re-establish the individual patient level commissioning role of the NTPF, and importantly with the associated enabling funding, the organisation is particularly well placed to make again an increased positive and valuable contribution towards shorter waiting times for patients.  I say this with confidence based on the proven track record of having done so in the past. </p> <p>  In 2014, a new NTPF board was appointed.  It was one of the first selected under the Public Appointments Service process.  This board has a wide range of skills covering areas such as medical, legal, accounting, IT, procurement, personnel and general management.  While continuing to oversee the ongoing operations of the organisation, the board applied itself particularly to the task of preparing the organisation through the development of a detailed strategy and action plan, all aimed at supporting performance improvement for the faster treatment of patients.  The outcome of this work meant that the NTPF was well placed to support the commitments contained in the programme for a partnership Government of 2016 pertaining to the specific funding allocated to the organisation to reduce waiting lists in 2017 and 2018. </p> <p>  In the strategy and action plan, which I have circulated to members in advance, it can be seen that we have established six key objectives that must be achieved to ensure that we deliver successfully on our overall strategic intent between the present and 2019.  We aim to negotiate pricing agreements and purchase quality care from providers on behalf of the State.  In this regard our second strategic objective is to ensure that a sustainable and fair market exists for long-term residential care with sufficient capacity to meet the requirements of those who require such care.  We will continue to publish and share quality-assured waiting list information in respect of public health services.</p><p>This is designed to ensure our key partners and stakeholders in the health care system are equipped, in a timely manner, with the necessary data and tools to make decisions that will ultimately lead to patients being treated faster.</p><p> A further objective in this regard will be to develop performance improvement tools that will equip operational managers in the delivery system to manage resources in the most efficient, effective and equitable manner possible.  We will also provide advisory expertise for the public health service on patient treatment pathways for scheduled care and waiting lists for primary and community care.  While doing all this, as chairman leading a strong board of directors, I will ensure the National Treatment Purchase Fund governance and operational infrastructures are fit for purpose in delivering and communicating our strategic objectives for the treatment of long waiting patients.</p><p> On corporate governance, I am pleased that we now have our full complement of board members.  Using the services of the Public Appointments Service, we have recently recruited a new full-time chief executive.  This was a key part of the reactivation of the NTPF's role of commissioning patient treatment, as is the rebuilding of our staffing resources to support the work of reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients.</p><p> To deliver on the requirements placed on the organisation under the programme for Government 2016 the NTPF's budget has been increased to &euro;20 million in the current year, with a further &euro;55 million committed for 2018.  I am pleased to report that the preparatory work for the resumption of commissioning of patient treatment has been completed and detailed arrangements have been made with private hospitals to commence the work.  Day case patients are already in the system and more are being placed on treatment pathways.  A further tranche of funding will be committed very shortly to an insourcing initiative, under which up to &euro;5 million will be spent on treating patients in public hospitals for specific procedures and treatments.  In the second half of the current year a third phase of spending will be determined based on our experience with the first two elements and this may be a mixture of inpatient and day cases, all of which will be aimed at reducing the list of patients waiting for treatment for more than 15 months as at the end of October 2017.  Looking ahead, our decisions on the specific uses for next year's funding allocation will be informed by our experiences with this year's approach.</p><p> As members will realise, these amounts of money on their own will not solve the waiting list problem.  However, they will contribute to that process.  More importantly, thousands of long waiting patients will receive their treatments faster and, I hope, be enabled to get on with their lives. </p><p> I reassure the joint committee that my objective, as chairman of the board, will be to ensure the National Treatment Purchase Fund continues to be well directed and managed in accordance with all appropriate governance requirements.  We have a cohort of board members and a committed executive team and employees giving us a base of significant experience and skills.  Our aim will be to ensure the functions allocated to us by the Government are carried out effectively and efficiently and that we will be in a position to demonstrate that all funding voted to the organisation is being spent, as intended, to reduce waiting times for patients in the public health care system.  I will be pleased to answer questions members may have.</p></speech>

He referred to the nursing homes support scheme.  I have the terms of reference for the review of the system for setting nursing homes prices which is due for completion by 1 June.  In recent weeks I have received correspondence from a number of nursing homes in which they complain about increased costs.  They are being hit on a number of fronts.  For example, as a result of the revaluation of commercial rates charged by local authorities, one nursing home has been informed that its rates bill will increase from &euro;18,000 to &euro;54,000 per annum.  On average, the rates bills of nursing homes have doubled, which creates a significant drain on their resources.</p> <p>  A second cost for nursing homes arises from regular inspections carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  While these inspections are appropriate to ensure standards are maintained in nursing homes, they also give rise to costs.  Nursing homes must also compete when recruiting staff.</p> <p>  Nursing homes operating under the fair deal scheme face many competing demands.  They have also had their payments cut in recent years.  When is the review likely to be competed?</p> <p>  There is no appeals process in place when a nursing home is aggrieved about a decision setting the weekly cost of a bed.  In some cases, nursing homes operating under the fair deal scheme receive between 30% and 50% less than what is available under the public scheme. </p> <p>  The level of care required by a patient may become more intense after he or she has been admitted to a nursing home facility.  People are living longer and the level of care they require increases as they get older, but this is not taken into account when the level of payment is set.  What is Mr. Horan's view on this issue?</p> <p>  It is astonishing that a waiting list of more than 4,000 has developed for gynaecological services in Cork.  One of the issues that arose was access to theatres.  The normal procedure is that the National Treatment Purchase Fund will refer a patient to a private facility, including in Northern Ireland.  Gynaecologists and obstetricians in Cork have indicated that they have time on their hands and are prepared to do this work.  They have suggested doing it in one of the private hospitals, which would require time to be bought in one of these facilities.</p> <p>  The issue of continuity of care has arisen.  Clinicians find that when a patient is referred to another facility, there is a disconnect in providing for continuity of care.  Is this issue being examined?  If the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund is to be expanded to deal with people on waiting lists, continuity of care needs to be addressed as it appears to be a problem.  It was certainly a problem when people were referred to facilities outside the jurisdiction, for example, in Northern Ireland.  When there were complications on their return from such facilities, the issue of who was responsible for their care arose.  The issue of continuity of care needs to be examined.  What are Mr. Horan's views on the matter?  I thank him again and wish him every success in his new role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2816" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#H00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Horan and join Senator Colm Burke in wishing him well in his new appointment.  That said, I have serious ideological difficulties with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the privatisation of the health service by stealth, as well as public money being siphoned off and given directly to the private sector.  However, this does not in any way prevent me from wishing Mr. Horan well in his new role.</p><p>I will cite statements made about the National Treatment Purchase Fund by several people who are much more qualified than I am to speak about it.  Professor Louise Kenny stated:</p><blockquote>The NTPF does not build long-term sustainability ... The NTPF in its current format is not a solution to addressing waiting lists across the board.</blockquote> <p>Dr. Peter Boylan stated:</p><blockquote>The NTPF is a bad idea ... It is just bad clinical practice and it should be abandoned.</blockquote><p>It is a bit counter-intuitive to expect that handing money to private sector will somehow magically improve the public service.  It never will.  The former acting chief executive officer of the NTPF was forthright in his opinion that the private sector was much more efficient.  Members of this committee and the witnesses know that is because scheduled and elective procedures will always be cheaper than running an emergency department or a public hospital where all comers are treated.  A significant amount of money can be saved if one can cherry-pick, but that option is not available to the public system.  What are Mr. Horan's views on the performance of the public versus the private sector?  I note from his curriculum vitae that he has experience in both sectors and that he served on the public services of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as did I, and on the Employment Appeals Tribunal, as did a close member of my family.  In view of his experience, I am interested in his views on the performance of the public versus the private sector.</p><p> The witness also discussed the issue of insourcing.  There is a very small amount of money put aside for that.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long promoted a policy for a single integrated waiting list management system which it calls Comhliosta.  Officials in the NTPF are examining this possibility but only on a hospital group basis.  What are the witness's views on the nationwide expansion of such a system?  If insourcing is to be focused upon, as should be done, and if money is to be put into the public service rather than fund the profits of large multinational private sector organisations, as should be done, it should be on a national basis.</p><p> With regard to the commissioning of beds or the negotiation and purchasing of beds in private nursing homes, in Scotland, large sections of nursing homes are leased for public use.  Deputy Harty and I met the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, Shona Robison, who said it is a very cost-effective model.  If there must be privatisation in that sector, it would be important to get the best value for money for the Exchequer.  The Scottish scheme proved very effective and did away with tensions in terms of nursing homes for residents, management and workers.  We do not want a situation where nursing homes begin undercutting each other on price as that would impact on workers and residents.  No one wants to see that.  There has to be a fairer way of getting value for money for the Exchequer.  What are the witness's views in this regard?</p><p> Sl&aacute;intecare, the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, was launched yesterday.  The committee made ambitious plans as part of that report.  One key principle agreed upon by the committee is that public money should only be spent in the public interest.  The witness is aware of my views in this regard.  How will handing money to the private sector so that large and small corporations can make a profit from treating patients fit with the future vision of the health service and  how will the NTPF fit in, in view of there being cross-party agreement on a vision which does not tally with the work of the NTPF?  I am open to correction or persuasion on this matter and I am interested to hear the witness's views.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2819" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Horan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#J00300"><p>I thank members for their comments and questions.  Senator Burke asked about the review of the system for setting nursing homes prices, the first part of which is to be completed in June 2017.  There are two elements to it.  A group comprising representatives of the NTPF, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is working on one element.  A broader group involving the Department of the Taoiseach, the Revenue Commissioners and many others is working on another element.  We are well advanced in the work to be completed by June 2017.  The terms of reference are to continue to ensure value for money and the economy with the lowest possible administrative cost for clients and the State and the lowest possible administrative burden for providers, to increase the transparency of the pricing mechanism in order that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible, and to ensure the adequacy of residential capacity for residents who require higher level or more complex care.  That is the section on which the NTPF is leading .  Work is well advanced in this regard.</p> <p>  I am conscious that when we were asked to carry out the review, the Minister of State at the time, Kathleen Lynch, referred to the review carried out in 2015 about the financing of the scheme and concluded that the NTPF had done an effective job in introducing and managing a pricing system for long-term residential care facilities.  She said it accounts for a very substantial amount of State funding, and the way the scheme is priced has critical relevance not only for the Exchequer but also in securing the long-term adequacy of residential bed capacity for older people.  It is acknowledged that we did a good job.   When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act was passed in 2009, we were given a greenfield site and asked to get on with it.  Very quickly, we had contracted more than 400 nursing homes to provide the service.  This was done by negotiation and agreement, not with a group of them or a body but with each individual nursing home, and the process has continued to date.  That is not to say that a system that we think is working well cannot be improved.  That is what the review is about and we are working on it.</p> <p>  The question of complexity of care was mentioned.  That is one aspect that is being looked at because, as residents are in nursing homes for longer periods, their needs become greater.  We need to consider how that is dealt with and it forms part of what we are doing.</p> <p>  The appeals mechanism was mentioned.  There are currently a number of stages in the appeals process.  If a nursing home does not agree with the price negotiated with it, it can appeal.  The case is referred to a new account manager, for a peer review, as it were, who takes a fresh look at everything and decides whether an adequate price has been offered.  If the nursing home is still dissatisfied with the outcome of that, it can appeal to the finance director of the NTPF who will take a further fresh look at the case.  If it is still not satisfied, it can further appeal to the chief executive officer of the NTPF.  There is an argument for an independent appeals mechanism but there would be a legislative difficulty with that as the NTPF is the body set up by legislation to negotiate and agree prices with nursing homes.  To allow a third party to conduct appeals might require a change of legislation.  That is not necessarily a bad thing but, as things stand, it could not happen without a change in the legislation.  We have made significant progress in the review and are working with the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will soon be coming back to the broader steering group involving the Department of the Taoiseach, the Revenue Commissioners and others.</p> <p>  Gynaecological waiting lists in Cork were mentioned.  That is a specific issue.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, acknowledged it is an issue.  Members might recall that I mentioned there is &euro;15 million for patient treatment at our current funding levels.  That has been divided into three tranches.</p><p>The first is &euro;5 million which we have now begun to spend.  That is being spent on day cases, all in private hospitals.  The second &euro;5 million comes to Deputy O'Reilly's point.  It is to do with insourcing, that is, spending money in public hospitals.  We have dealt with private hospitals and are now dealing with public hospitals.  Within that, a specific element is being committed to the gynaecological problem to which Senator Burke referred.</p><p> There is a slight concern that people generally have regarding insourcing.  If there is a problem in a public hospital system with waiting lists and we are giving more money to it through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, people will ask whether we are paying on the double for something.  If we spend &euro;5 million, which we will, in the public hospital system, we have to be sure it is not going into a black hole.  Rather, it must be identified for specific items and people, as is the case in private hospitals.  For every &euro;1 we spend we can relate that back to a patient.  Similarly, in terms of the vast bulk of the &euro;5 million going back into the public system, we will, due to the way things are being conducted, be able to ensure the same level of traceability in public hospitals.</p><p> I am going on the notes I have made.  Deputy O'Reilly referred to her serious ideological difficulties with private versus public hospitals.  I fully understand her thinking on that.  She asked me for my thinking.  My answer is that it is a case of whatever works.  People are on waiting lists.  There are individuals who have families around them.  They are all suffering and do not want to be on waiting lists.  If we can end their suffering, improve their situation and help them to get on with their lives through buying treatment in a private hospital, we will do that.  If we can do so in a public hospital, let us do it that way.  Let us do things in the most efficient way possible.  I do not have any hang-ups about public or private hospitals.  My phrase is "whatever works".</p></speech>

Money is taken from the public sector and put into the private sector.  There are many people who cannot afford to access the private sector and jump the queue in the way that some people do.  It is proposed to put money into the private sector where money is top-sliced off for profit and the responsibility of a chief executive is to shareholders rather than patients.  The responsibility of the people who run the public service is to patients, the public purse and the Minister.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Horan take my point?  The acting chief executive said, in his opinion, that the private sector was more efficient.  I do not believe that is the case.  There are all sorts of reasons one might be able to say that, but it has to do with cherry-picking rather than efficiency.  The very existence of a mechanism to siphon money from the public sector and put it directly into the private sector is hampering the public sector.</p> <p>  In the long term, we will not address waiting lists in the public sector, even if such a policy has a very temporary short-term impact, as it did several years ago.  However, it did not have a long-term impact.  We are dealing with the aftermath of what was most definitely not a long-term solution.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct.  When the NTPF was first established, we had a Government directive that we had to spend a minimum of 90% of our funding in private hospitals.  That is gone.  It is now open season.  As I said, wherever we get the best value for money is where we should spend our allocation.  We do not have a huge allocation, so we have to spend it wisely.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned people who will never be able to afford to get into the private system.  In effect, over the years where the public system has not met people's needs.  We have taken money that was allocated to the NTPF for this purpose and used it to put public patients into the private system and pay for their care.  We managed to blur the lines.  We are now putting our first &euro;5 million into the private sector and our second &euro;5 million into the public sector.</p> <p>  As I said in my opening statement, we will evaluate the outcome in determining where the third &euro;5 million goes.  More important, we have &euro;50 million next year for public patient treatment commissioning.  Where we spend that &euro;50 million will be very much informed by our experiences this year.  We are learning as we go and we will base our decisions on that.  We have no ideological hang-ups.  We have waiting lists because hospitals do not have capacity.  There is capacity in private hospitals.  That may not always be the case.  If we can incentivise them or whatever, that may work.</p> <p>  That leads me on to the Deputy's question about the integrated waiting list management system, on which she is very keen.  At our level, we have started that process and it is under way.  I can tell her that, as of now, all stakeholders have been identified and have been written to.  We have asked various experts and stakeholders to nominate nominees to participate in a project in the group study we are doing.  The project approach has been outlined and the scope has been done.  We have defined the review and so on.</p> <p>  We have commenced the socialising of a project charter which is due for sign-off this week.  I know the Minister has committed to talking to the Deputy during the summer recess and to meeting her separately on that.  The process is under way.  It is a start.  I know the Deputy wants it done on a national level, and we may well get there.  At least we have made a start.</p> <p>  The approach of Scotland is interesting in that large sections of nursing homes are leased.  Does that means one part of a private nursing home houses private patients and the other public patients?  I wonder about the benefit of that.  The system we have is seamless, whether someone is being paid for out of their own funding, their families' or from the State purse through the nursing homes support scheme.  The lines are blurred.  One does not see those lines when one walks into the door of a nursing home.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2823" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#K00400"><p>I may not have made myself clear.  The system in Scotland is designed to ensure the constant availability of beds.  We have a problem with delayed discharges.  Part of the problem is finding a bed in a nursing home.  If the vast majority of nursing home beds are provided by the private sector and the State leases a chunk of it, the system is operated by the State.  Therefore, there can be throughput and it makes for efficiency in hospitals as well as in nursing homes because nursing homes know a wing or unit has been leased.</p> <p>  The Scottish health Minister was a proponent of the system.  It is not intended to create a kind of "Upstairs, Downstairs" nursing home but rather to give the hospitals and health system the certainty of knowing that beds are available.  When a patient is ready for discharge to a nursing home bed, it is available and he or she is not waiting three, four, five or six days or wrestling with fair deal forms or anything else.  A person can be discharged in a timely fashion.</p> <p>  It is an aid to the hospital as much as anything else because they know they can put hands on beds, as it were.  I would like to see that system investigated.  If international best practice suggests it works, we should not busy ourselves trying to reinvent the wheel.  If something works in another jurisdiction, we should be take the research and run with it if it is suitable for us.</p></speech>

We made a detailed submission to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and I was pleased to see some of our thinking coming through in sections of the report, particularly sections on the continued use of measures such as maximum wait times to ensure patients are treated within pre-agreed timelines and so on.  If, as the committee report very clearly does, one sets out a maximum wait of 15 weeks for inpatient, ten weeks for outpatient and ten days for diagnostics, one is going to need some way of measuring it.  One is going to need somebody to keep the score.  THE NTPF is particularly well-placed and that is what we do.  We gather information from all the hospitals and we validate it.  There were a number of points there, including extending the concept of maximum waiting times for hospital treatment to cover primary and community-based services, for example, and again we are well-placed there.  We are a strong and independent agency so we can ensure that kind of data and information is available because if one is going to try to implement that system, one needs somebody to keep check.</p> <p>  I will address the final matter, which was in appendix 4 to the committee's report on the waiting list management.  The Chairman referred to this earlier in the context of the National Cancer Registry Board and this is the whole issue of e-health, waiting lists and using e-systems, including services like a patient portal where people can go straight on and look at their own referral, status and position on the waiting list.  That is good.  I do not want to keep harking back but we had a system previously that worked very well where, if a person was on a waiting list for more than three months, he or she could ring the NTPF lo-call number, we took their details and straight away we would go and arrange the person's treatment in a private hospital.  This is a further extension of that. </p> <p>  Very often, part of the suffering of being on a waiting list is not knowing where one is on the waiting list, for example, am I No. 99 or No. 599?  Reminder services by text, integrated referral management systems, and digital discharge solutions can all help, as can, to get back to Deputy Louise O'Reilly's point, a single integrated hospital waiting list management system.  These are all the sort of things that the NTPF has the experience of having done, can make better and can be part of the future.  I am pleased to see the report and I am pleased to see a general cross-party approach being taken to it so that we do not start chopping and changing, because we have suffered from that in the past.</p></speech>

Consequently, elective work is being squeezed continually.  Mr. Tony O'Brien, in his evidence to this committee, said that in one or two years time it will be almost 100% emergency work carried out in our hospitals and that less and less, if any, of the elective work has the bed capacity to be delivered in our general hospitals.  I would like to hear Mr. Horan's views on that because if that is the case, the National Treatment Purchase Fund will actually be the only vehicle through which we can supply elective care to our patients.  When we spoke to the Scottish health Minister, she also spoke to use about how in Scotland the NHS has bought a private hospital in Glasgow which has been designated as an elective-only hospital.  That has been so successful that they are building five additional elective-only hospitals in Scotland: a second in Glasgow; one in Edinburgh; one in Aberdeen; one in Inverness; and one in the west of Scotland.  Certainly, unless the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare is adapted, we are going to run into the situation where only emergency work will be supplied in our hospitals.   Our elective lists, as we can see, are getting longer and longer, as are our outpatient lists.  It is essential that our system changes.</p> <p>  We are conscious that if we start changing this ineffective system we could destabilise it and start to make our patient outcomes worse.  There has been a lot of opposition this morning to the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare with regard to disentangling private care and public hospitals.  We are doing that with a view to freeing up capacity in our public hospitals for public patients.  I would like to get Mr. Horan's views on those comments. </p></speech>

I was quite frightened to hear Mr. Coffey say that the incidence of cancer is likely to increase by 50% between 2015 and 2025.  What are the implications of that for the health service?  It is a huge task.  I cannot sit here and say that I have all of the answers.  I like a lot of what I scanned in the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  Many of the ways forward are there, including points about taking the pressure off emergency departments, some of the points about primary care, and many of the points about dealing with matters in the community rather than in hospital settings.  There are many good points there. I do not think I have all the answers, but many of them are in that committee's report.</p></speech>

I can tell him that we are very well advanced towards an early June date but that is one stage.

I cannot say what they will do.  Our part of it will be done in coming months.</p></speech>

This is not a problem caused by the nursing homes.  When there was a huge problem with many people in beds waiting to be discharged, for example, nursing homes had over 750 vacant beds at the time.  There seems to have been very little connection.  Nursing Homes Ireland tried to get involved and give assistance, but there was still a very poor response from the HSE.  Following on from Deputy O'Reilly's point, there must be a faster mechanism for dealing with this.  It is not the fault of the nursing homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2838" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Horan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#L01200"><p>I have to fall back on this point.  The NTPF has a very narrow and clearly defined role under the legislation, which is to agree the maximum prices with each individual nursing home.  We are not really involved beyond that and I would almost be going <i>ultra vires</i>to tread into that.  I might have my own views on it but I do not think it appropriate that I should necessarily express them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2839" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#L01300"><p>We might end up not having to buy facilities or operating time in private hospitals if we had beds freed up in public hospitals.  It is therefore a matter that should be Mr. Horan's concern since the faster we can get people out of the hospital system and into step-down care, the better and more efficient it becomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2840" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Horan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#L01400"><p>It might well be a matter of concern to me but as I said, under the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act we have a very specific targeted role.  We do not go beyond that.  I am not saying that we do not care.  We do care but it is really not appropriate that I get involved in that policy area and start expressing views about it because it is outside our legislative role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2841" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#L01500"><p>I welcome Mr. Horan for appearing before the committee and for his introductory remarks.  Unlike my colleague, I believe that both the public and the private health sectors should be cost-effective, efficient and responsive.</p><p>There is no harm in having competition between the two in respective areas.  I favour the public health sector and I want to see it develop and grow.  When comparisons are made, it should not be possible for the private sector to make a profit and deliver the service more effectively, more efficiently and more cost-effectively.  That should not be the case.  Questions need to be asked about that or we would seem to be bolstering something that is not efficient and effective at all.</p><p> From Mr. Horan's own observations, where does he think the incapacity has occurred in the public sector, which in turn causes the overflow to go into the private sector and in particular circumstances that cause the National Treatment Purchase Fund to be called in?  For example, as the Chairman pointed out, members have been looking at these issues as they have been sitting on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare for quite a long time now.  Incapacity in certain areas seems to be a key issue.  What happens next will be determined by others who are outside but who have looked at this.  In Mr. Horan's direct experience - in dealing with both sides on the ground, over quite a period of time and in the good times and bad times - why does he think the logjam is caused?  Is it a lack of theatre facilities?  Is it a lack of nursing staff or a lack of consultants or GPs?  Is it a lack of theatre availability?  What is it?  There must be something causing the problems.</p><p> I welcome the move to have the purchase fund in both the public and private sector.  That will be a good thing and will sharpen both sides and maybe the patient will become the issue everybody focuses on.  That is the way it should be.  Long waiting times are not good for the public or the private sector, they are certainly not good for the health sector in general in its public appeal and they are certainly not good for the patient.  Waiting times of four or five years, which we have had many times in the past, are appalling.  We should never be in such a situation.  The questions that arise following on from that relate to particular areas.  I know that hip replacement operations is one area that has caused problems in the past.  Are there other treatments that show up more regularly than others and which require National Treatment Purchase Fund intervention?</p><p> With regard to competition, has Mr. Horan seen evidence of competition between the two sectors in responding to the demands made of them?  I know the old argument about people jumping the queue, and Deputy O'Reilly already referred to this.  It is one of the questions that comes up from time to time.  As public representatives, we ask parliamentary questions about when particular patients will receive treatment, having suffered on a waiting list for two, three, four, five years or sometimes much longer.  The general answer is that the clinicians will make that decision.  My answer to that is "let them decide quickly".  It is as good to do it quickly as it is slowly over a long period of time.  Why do we not have a more dramatic response?  It goes back to capacity and to staffing levels.</p><p> Mr. Horan referred to the fluctuating staffing levels in the NTPF organisation during the downturn in the economy.  There was a lack of funding in the public sector in general.  To what extent did the NTPF find that demand had fluctuated along with the staffing levels?  How did the demand move on the graph and what sort of cases were referred?  We all have anecdotal experiences but I can tell the committee of someone who has been waiting quite a long time.  The person was on the point of going to the NTPF only in the past couple of months, but there was a breakthrough, for some very good reason, and they suddenly got the treatment.  It was challenging treatment but they were able to get it through the public health system.  We all must be challenged from time to time so we can do our job well.  What were the most common causes that Mr. Horan observed in the creation of the backlogs under the various headings and categories?  </p><p> I am not a great supporter of the fair deal scheme, for obvious reasons.  It has a tendency to be insatiable in terms of how much it costs the patient.  People start off life, they may be newly married couples, and they try to raise a mortgage and raise families.  By the time they have that barely finished, somebody else has come along and the costs of nursing home care could visit them for a long time in certain cases.  The costs could leave them and their immediate families penniless for quite a long time also so I am not a great supporter of that system.  I know this system replaced an older one that was a throwback from the workhouses system, and which none of us would ever want to hear of again, but there were long-stay beds in public nursing homes in the fairly recent past.  They were efficient, maybe not by today's standards but they gave a very high quality of service when it was available nowhere else.  Patients who were in need of the service received the service.  It did not cost a fortune.  It was only when the times and legislation changed to the effect that people should not receive the service in public hospitals - because there was no legislation to back it up - that as a result we arrived at the system we are in now.  The number of public long-stay beds has dramatically reduced in the intervening period.  The shifting of that burden has gone from the public sector to the patient albeit in the private sector. </p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Horan here today and I wish him well in his reappointment.  It is a challenging position.  I believe that all here have a duty and a responsibility to work together, whether we are politicians, consultants, GPs or unions to try to improve the lot of the patient.</p> <p>  When we consider the National Treatment Purchase Fund and then look at the appalling waiting lists, we must do something.  I know that &euro;15 million has been allocated in this year's programme for Government for waiting list initiatives.  Perhaps Mr. Horan will indicate when this might be up and running and can he give dates?  I understand that a sizeable figure of &euro;55 million has been allocated for next year.  Will this be targeted in certain sections or will it be across the board?  Has Mr. Horan a target figure for how many people he thinks will be treated and could be taken off the waiting lists?</p> <p>  Turning to the nursing home scenario, in my Roscommon constituency there have been situations of appalling overcrowding in hospitals such as in Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinsaloe, for example.  Despite a competitive and top standard nursing home being out the road, there was no attempt to move some of the patients who could be moved to the nursing home for a few weeks in order to free up space in the hospital.  At that time things were so chronic with overcrowding that ambulances were taking people to the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar, County Westmeath.  They could not even be sent to University Hospital Galway, which is down the road.  That is how chronic and bad things were.  In a crisis situation such as that why would a nursing home not be used?</p><p>There is a whisper going around that some of the nursing homes are being overlooked.  It is hard to understand, when one sees that the costs associated with the public nursing home are well above the cost of the private nursing home.  </p><p> I recently received correspondence about the cross-Border fund.  Does Mr. Horan have any comment on that?  I was surprised when I read about it that it is not promoted and used more.  Better value could be made of it and more people could be dealt with more speedily.  </p><p> To return to the three year deals for the nursing homes, revaluation of property is not taken into account.  In many parts of the country property is being revalued.  There are some hidden costs because if there is a revaluation in the middle of a three year contract the costs will change.  It has been so long since there was a revaluation process in this country that many businesses are shocked by the level of their revaluations. </p><p> Mr. Horan said that he has appointed a new chief executive officer, CEO.  Who is that person and how much does that cost annually?</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Durkan's question about lack of capacity, I am aware that the programme for Government does contain a commitment to undertake a bed capacity review to feed into the Government's mid-term review of its capital plans.  I understand that review will have a wider scope than previous reviews and will extend across hospitals, primary care and social care.  The Department of Health is leading that review under the direction of a steering group which includes officials from the Departments of Health, the Taoiseach, and Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and experts with clinical and academic backgrounds.  It is fairly wide-ranging and involves an independent peer group of international health experts who will review the methodology and findings and so on.  We are not directly involved in that, but we are available to support it and look forward to seeing its findings which will come out later this year.</p> <p>  There are two factors that caused the lack of capacity, one is the well-known financial crisis when there were cutbacks here and there, resulting in ward closures, reductions in staff, nursing and consultants, all the shortages that are well-rehearsed.  The other element is on the demand side which is increasing dramatically.  Last year, 60,000 more inpatients were treated than in the previous year.  I am not apologising for a system that I am not responsible for but I do feel its pain to an extent. </p> <p>  In response to the point about the long-stay beds in public hospitals, I take it the Deputy is talking about the old town hospitals.  I was a great supporter of those and have personal experience of them through my extended family.  Some fell victim to what one person might call improving standards while another might call them increasing standards, which found them unsuited to their purpose and they fell out of the system.  That added to the lack of capacity.  A total of &euro;15 million of the &euro;50 million available this year is available to the NTPF, the rest goes to the normal hospital system.  We have been out of commissioning patient treatment care for a few years but we are back into it.  We started by getting expressions of interest from private hospitals, drawing up contract documentation, analysing the specific treatments we would target.  We identified the top 25 and went out to tender on those.  We got the tenders and we have started to give out that work.  We will soon have close to 2,000 patients in the system with case authorisation notices, CANs, purchase orders in layman's terms.  More individuals will come into the system very quickly.  That accounts for the first &euro;5 million of our &euro;15 million.  The second &euro;5 million goes to the public hospitals, the third &euro;5 million might be a combination of the two.  Next year, we will have &euro;50 million available and what we do with that will be informed very much by what we have learned in the current year. </p> <p>  As to why nursing homes are not used, I am very familiar with their situation and receive regular calls telling me they have beds available and so on but it is not the NTPF's decision.  That is not our role but I would not be against using them.  </p> <p>  In addition to the cross-Border fund, there is a European system and it is not as fully utilised as it might be.  It is advertised to an extent on the Department of Health or HSE websites.  It could be used more.  We do send some work to the North of Ireland but the bulk of it is within the State.  I would be worried about the impact of Brexit and I know this committee has had discussions with the Department of Health and the HSE about the impact of Brexit.  While it does not have an immediate impact on the NTPF we do need to be very conscious of it to make sure it does not affect us adversely.</p> <p>  In respect of the new CEO, before we moved back into commissioning we had been operating with a reduced staff because we had a reduced budget and were not going to spend money we did not need to spend.  We moved from having a full-time CEO when we were doing treatment of commissioning to having several part-time CEOs, working one day a week, for the past four or five years.  When we saw we were getting back into patient treatment commissioning we realised we needed to beef up the systems again.  Some of our staff had gone on secondment to other areas of the health care service and we want some of them back.  Some have settled in where they are but we will need to replenish our staff, not quite to the level it was at before.  We will see how we get on.  We are in that process.  As part of that we decided we needed a new full-time chief executive late last year, when we saw the budget had allocated us the money for that.  We advertised in November through the Public Appointments Service to make it an open and transparent competition but that takes time.  Big systems move slowly.  We then selected a very well qualified chief executive, Liam Sloyan.  It was clear, however, he was wanted where he was.  In a previous existence he was chief executive of the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, and since 2013, when the national lottery was sold off and the office of the regulator of the national lottery was set up, he was appointed to that role and has been there ever since.  He joined us four weeks ago.  He got his feet under the table quickly and working with the board and the executive team, he is gearing up for our move back into patient treatment commissioning.  The cost had to be approved by the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform and is in line with the chief executive levels for a body of our size, a grade 3 body.</p></speech>

On what we spend our money on, among the top ten procedures are cataracts, cystoscopies, the surgical removal of teeth, coronary angiography, varicose veins and skin lesions.  We have identified the top 25 procedures and are targeting them to begin with in spending the first &euro;5 million.  We will build from there.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome him and thank him for attending.  I wish to draw his attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to do so, he is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible he should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also wish to advise that any submissions or opening statement that is made to the committee may be published on the committee's website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against the person or persons outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I would also remind Members to remember to turn off their mobile phones.</p></speech>

The provision of medical scanning services in Ireland is unregulated.  This creates a situation where Irish women may be exploited and even harmed by inadvertently trusting a medical investigation which is performed by individuals who are either unfit or untrained to perform this investigation.  There are many aspects to this issue, and I will happily take questions on anything that members wish to discuss with me, there are three broad areas which I would like to briefly comment on.</p> <p>  I believe that the use of ultrasound in the practice of gynaecology is very important.  It gives valuable information about the anatomy of the female pelvis.  When a woman presents with symptoms suggestive of a gynaecological problem, she may be referred to a gynaecologist.  Unfortunately, the waiting times are long for those appointments.  More and more general practitioners are looking to investigate and manage these things themselves.  That is very worthwhile, but if they are depending upon an ultrasound investigation the people performing that ultrasound should be regulated and there should be defined training.  Unfortunately, ultrasound equipment, unlike radiological equipment, has now become very cheap, and any of us can buy an ultrasound machine and set ourselves up as an expert in any form of scanning one wishes to be an expert in.  No one oversees that, and the ultimate consequence of that could be harm.</p> <p>  On infertility services, virtually all of them in Ireland are in the private sector.  Within the private sector there is not the same regulation as there might be within the public sector.  There is a professional body which oversees the practice of infertility treatments.  Scanning is part of infertility services.  If one is having scans one has to be confident that the person who is performing those investigations is trained to do so.  In general, gynaecology provided and supervised by radiologists.  These are trained doctors who have gone through formalised training schemes and are competent to sign off on the examinations.  That is not to say that they perform all of the examinations, but there are images that one would expect to see.  The gynaecology scan is really the only scan in obstetrics and gynaecology which is entirely reviewed and signed off on by a doctor.  Outside of that the practice is disparate.  There are a growing number of infertility services, and couples who required infertility services are really a very at-risk group.  These people desperately want a baby and they will do virtually anything to get one.  They will go to anyone who professes to be able to help them achieve that.  Unfortunately, there is a wide variety of infertility services available in the country.</p> <p>  On the issue of pregnancy scanning, I will discuss two categories.  Early pregnancy assessment, which is the assessment of pregnancies before 14 weeks, has provoked much discussion since 2010 about the incorrect diagnoses of miscarriages.  An independent inquiry was set up which reported on the issue, and as a result of that the HSE made significant amounts of money available for training.  Every unit in Ireland got a very good ultrasound machine, and people were identified to oversee that services.  In general, that service runs reasonably well.  </p> <p>  Obstetric scanning has been discussed here before.  Dr. Peter Boylan and Professor Louise Kenny discussed it in some detail on 16 February.  The reality is that in Ireland many women do not get a foetal anomaly scan.  I believe that that is a tragedy and can result in tragic consequences for the baby, if it is born with a significant abnormality and born in the wrong place.  There is huge geographical variation in terms of where women attend for care during pregnancy.  If one is lucky enough to live in Dublin every woman, irrespective of her income, will have at least one anomaly scan.  However, that is not the case throughout the rest of the country.  </p> <p>  There is more information in my briefing document, but I am very happy to take questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2865" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#P00400"><p>I thank the witness for his presentation, which I had an opportunity to read.</p><p>I will not be alone in this, but people contact us regularly about infertility services because they are desperate to have a child.  They are so desperate that they will reach out to a stranger like me and share intimate details of their lives which are absolutely heartbreaking.  It is very concerning that these services are currently unregulated and that we are about to see a plethora of services emerge in that context.  While the service itself is not regulated, the individual radiographer, doctor and nurse must be registered with CORU, the Medical Council and the NMBI, respectively.  Is that sufficient regulation or is there a need to regulate the practice or industry, although I hesitate to use that word albeit that is what it is?</p></speech>

Those doctors go through a formal training programme over at least two years to become specialised in that area.  There are many infertility services where people have not undergone that training.  There are certainly very good infertility services available in this country but the Deputy is right that this is a very vulnerable group and people will reach out to whatever service they believe can help them achieve a pregnancy.  What most concerns me, or at least the reason I am here, is ultrasound.  On the provision of ultrasound in infertility, there is now a nine month training programme within UCD leading to certification of expertise in infertility services.  We should seek to ensure that everybody who is scanning within infertility services at least has that certification.  That is not to say that clinics need to close all over the country tomorrow.  They do not.  However, support should at least be given to allow people to go and train and that should be audited.</p></speech>

We are not alone in that.  There is a post-code lottery which Professor Daly rightly alluded to.  How far are we from being able to train the personnel we have?  Professor Daly said diagnostic equipment was getting cheaper, which it is.  In terms of being able to provide a 20-week anomaly scan as a matter of routine in every maternity unit in the country, we have the staff but there is obviously some skill deficit and possibly an equipment deficit, about which the professor might be able to tell us.  How far away are we from being able to train the people we have and provide them with the equipment they need?</p></speech>

The Health Service Executive must realise that it needs to put significant finance into this.  The equipment is not the real burden, rather it is getting the individuals trained up.  There is an MSc programme in UCD which takes 16 months and at the end, one is certainly skilled to realise what is not normal.  That is the key thing.  The other problem is one which is plaguing the service in the UK.  Every woman in the UK is entitled to two ultrasounds.  There is an early pregnancy ultrasound where one might diagnose multiple pregnancies and significant abnormalities which can be diagnosed early like anencephaly and women are offered screening for Down's syndrome.  Then one has the anomaly scan.  The difficulty is getting people trained and then keeping them within the system.  It is a tough job scanning people every 25 minutes for a whole day, day in and day out.  That is hard work.  If one steps away from being a midwife, for example, one gives up night duty and weekend duty and one's pay suffers significantly.  We need to reimburse these people properly to motivate them to stay within the service.  Many people are trained and leave the service and that is a huge problem in the UK.  That is the main challenge.  We need to provide money to train people and then we need to recognise that they are skilled individuals and try to motivate them to stay within the service.</p></speech>

However, she could not actually release them from their midwifery duties as they would not be replaced.  She said, however, that there was capacity within the system for her to provide people for training but they would not be replaced for their general work.</p></speech>

The situation in Cork is that they have been unable to provide ultrasound for every woman.  They have had to use some kind of metric to decide who gets a scan.  That is dreadful.  The purpose of the scan is not to diagnose Down's syndrome.  If one wants to diagnose Down's syndrome, it is an early screen because only about half of Down's syndrome cases will be diagnosed on the early scan.  It is really about structural abnormalities like spina bifida and gastroschisis.  They do not increase as a woman gets older.  Using a cut-off of 35 or 40 is not relevant if one is thinking about structural abnormalities.  We want to diagnose major congenital heart disease, spina bifida, gastroschisis and anterior abdominal wall defects in order to optimise things for that baby once it is born.  One does not want a baby born with no left ventricle in Letterkenny at 3 a.m. on the Sunday morning of a bank holiday weekend.  By the time that child gets to Crumlin, it will be significantly compromised.  That is the difficulty.</p></speech>

Does that mean a private company can set up a premises with 3-D scanning equipment and just offer fancy photographs to people who for some reason desire a 3-D image of their child?  Is that what is happening?</p></speech>

In Cork or somewhere where 20-week anomaly scans are not fully rolled out, one could go into a glorified photographer at 25-week gestation and maybe even know oneself from looking at the image that something is wrong.  The naked eye can tell if there is gastroschisis.  One could walk out of a glorified unregulated photographer with a very serious diagnosis for one's child 13 weeks after one had one's 12-week scan.  One is literally walking down the pavement going "God, I do not think that is right".  Is that possible the way things are at the minute?</p></speech>

The issue of 3-D scans is not one I am particularly exercised about.  People go to these places with an expectation that they will get a nice picture and not with the expectation they will have an anomaly scan.  It is difficult.  The Deputy is absolutely right that anyone can open a shop tomorrow on Grafton Street claiming to be an expert in ultrasound and that is not right.  However, if the expectation of the public going in is that they are going to get a pretty picture and that is what they get, they are happy.</p><p>If it is their expectation they will have a good scan in which their baby will be looked in detail, they will definitely not have it.  Many private institutions make people sign a disclaimer to acknowledge that they realise it is not an anomaly scan.  While I do not think it is ideal, it is the lack of anomaly scans in the public service about which I would be more exercised.</p></speech>

We have a GP present.  GPs deal with a lot of patients in the early stages of pregnancy and are often the ones who first diagnose a pregnancy.  Many of them now have ultrasound machines.  Has the Medical Council told GPs, as their regulatory body, that if they have not completed the proper course, they are in breach of ethics?  What is the position in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.2878" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Sean Daly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017053100002#R00300"><p>I do not think so.  GPs scan early in pregnancy to identify a foetal heart which anybody can see.  It is just as the Deputy said.  If they do not see it, they need to refer the patient on.  I can totally understand primary health care physicians wanting to reassure women that everything is okay.  If they use a scanner and see a foetal heart, everybody can see it, but it does not remove the need to refer on.  Where GPs will potentially run into trouble is when they come back from a weekend course and think they can scan as well as anybody.  That is a problem.  If they are using an ultrasound machine just to document a foetal heart, it is probably okay.</p></speech>

I have been dealing with this issue for many years in my role as a community pharmacist.  There are often very complex prescriptions and I have often wondered about the different regimes of different clinics and the complete difference in approach.  Some people leave with ten bags of stuff, while others leave with one.  Every case is individual and we are back to ethics again in the medical profession.  In his professional opinion and from what he has seen in his role, does Professor Daly think people are being taken advantage of by certain providers in certain circumstances?</p> <p>  Another thing I have seen is a lot of people going abroad.  They are referred by clinics in Ireland to undergo various treatments in Greece or Spain with donor eggs and sperm.  Is it Professor Daly's view that the system is not fit for purpose and that, in some instances, people are being taken advantage of?  How do we solve that problem?  IVF is very traumatic for both parties involved and sometimes the wider family.  I have heard about it costing &euro;30,000 by the time everything is taken into account.  Is it Professor Daly's view that this is a very serious problem?  It really only kicked off about ten years ago when IVF became mainstream in Ireland.  Will Professor Daly give me his view?</p></speech>

He had started in St. James's Hospital and then moved to the Rotunda Hospital in the early 1990s.  A plethora of services have since been made available.  For financial reasons, some decide to recommend that women travel to countries outside Ireland.  The Czech Republic is the most common.  My experience of these services is that they are good.  One of the key performance indicators - if that is the correct word to use - in infertility services is the number of multiple pregnancies.  Multiple pregnancy rates have dropped significantly as people are being much more careful.  Pregnancies end up being complicated with triplets or quads when the ovary is stimulated pharmaceutically and people do not make sure it is not over-stimulated and do not follicle-track the women involved.  That has been poor in this country.</p></speech>

An earlier delegate spoke about health literacy.  It is something that occurred to me in my role.  When people attend private fertility clinics, sometimes only the fertility element is focused on.  They do not look at anything else such as mental health or something more sinister in the bowel or that area.  Does Professor Daly see it as a problem if a fertility clinic focuses on that issue only and washes its hands of everything else outside the area of the ovaries and uterus?  Is there anything he can suggest we can do to address the issue?  I know that people are signing disclaimers in places where there is 3-D scanning.  I am not 100% convinced that service users are aware that it is a less holistic approach and has just one focus.  I have seen it happening in the community.  What is Professor Daly's experience?</p></speech>

I asked the committee to invite him because I had heard a number of complaints about people having scans on a Friday evening in services in which there was no medical backup to give advice.  Advice has been given on a Friday evening without a medical person being present.  That has occurred.  There are quite a number of such companies.  It is not a major problem in Dublin, but it seems to be happening outside the main population centres.  Has Professor Daly received complaints about it?  Is there a concern in the profession about these services being offered?  That is one issue.</p> <p>  The second issue concerns people, GPs or otherwise, who do not receive training.  If GPs have not received training and are providing a service, will there be complications about professional indemnity insurance?  I am wondering if they have been made aware of this.  I have heard of a GP giving advice, but when the person concerned presented at the hospital traumatised, it turned out that the advice which had been was incorrect.  That leaves the GP quite open to the giving of incorrect advice and a question arises immediately about whether he or she is covered by insurance, especially if he or she has not received training.  I am wondering if the issue has been highlighted.  </p> <p>  The third issue is anomaly scans.  What would it take to reach a stage where the service would be available to everyone?  About what numbers are we talking to be trained and what backup services would need to be provided?  The equipment is not that expensive; tt is, therefore, about personnel.  About what shortfall are we talking in real terms?  </p></speech>

There are 70,000 births in Ireland each year and each scan takes about 30 minutes.  That amounts to 35,000 hours of scanning.</p><p>Each midwife, sonographer and radiographer will do approximately 35 hours per week.  As such, the numbers required will be significant.  It is important to have scanning available when people go on holidays, etc.  That is the type of personnel numbers that will need to be trained and in place before routine anomaly scans can be rolled out.</p><p> To back up these people, foetal medicine consultants are required.  If someone scans and sees something, he or she will generally not make a diagnosis.  Instead, that person will get someone like me to confirm or refute.</p><p> Regarding GP training, everyone should be trained.  There are ultrasound training opportunities within UCD.  It is the only third level college that offers them and they take approximately six months to do.</p><p> Medical indemnity and insurance comprise a significant issue.  People who open up ultrasound facilities generally are not properly insured, so there is no comeback for the person who suffers as a result of inappropriate advice or a misdiagnosis.  This is an important issue and there should be a regulatory body charged with overseeing all of these services.</p><p> As to the first question, it is not necessary to have a doctor always available where there is a trained person doing the ultrasound.  In any hospital or clinic, sonographers or midwives function independently.  The hope is that they will not inadvertently diagnose or reassure people.  That is where the difficulty lies.  If someone believes that there is a problem, explains it to a patient and makes a treatment or referral plan, that is probably okay.  A situation in which a qualified radiologist or foetal medicine specialist is always available probably does not exist.  Even in centres like St. James's, where the radiology service is very good, radiographers function independently and radiologists review images afterwards.</p></speech>

Professor Daly has referred to risk groups.  To paraphrase him, my understanding is that there is screening in Cork of people who are over 40 years of age and are X, Y and Z.  High-risk people are being taken although, obviously, it has nothing to do with the mother's age, only certain conditions.  The committee worked out that approximately one pregnancy per week in the non-risk factor group was being missed, or 50 pregnancies per year that did not go to birth.  I am going from memory, so I will have to look back over the record.</p> <p>  How do we give people the best outcomes?  Purely from the point of view of assisting the child to survive rather than the opposite, as some people might interpret my question, is it a combination of the GP being the lead person for the patient in the community and maternal blood tests being conducted at eight or nine weeks to identify what might be coming down the tracks?  This would be followed on by a 12-week scan and a 20-week proper anomaly scan.  Is this what Ireland needs to provide to give the best outcomes to women who are producing the next generation?</p></speech>

There are two issues, those being, the provision of a service to diagnose structural abnormalities and the screening and identification of chromosomal abnormalities.  In the UK, everyone gets both.  In Ireland, people have not traditionally got either.  Were we to concentrate on one area, it should be the structural abnormalities.  If finance and so forth were no object, of course we would offer screening for chromosomal abnormalities to everyone, but we cannot even offer everyone a structural scan.  If we are to focus our attention on priorities, that should be it.  We should subsequently roll out screening for chromosomal abnormalities.  If more than 20,000 women are not getting a structural scan, it is awful.</p></speech>

It is late in the day.

Dr. Paul Oslizlok, the most senior cardiologist in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, reckons that approximately 50% of major congenital heart disease is unrecognised before birth.  That puts those babies at significant risk.  The provision of ultrasound to diagnose cardiac defects is problematic worldwide.  The UK, which has structural scanning, has set up an anomaly register.  There used to be anomaly registers in various places in the UK.  Interestingly, there was none in London.  Now there is a national register.  Every baby identified with a significant anomaly will be registered and followed.  Units will be identified that are not diagnosing, for example, heart defects.  That is an opportunity to have additional training.</p> <p>  If one element could oversee this situation, it would be an anomaly register.  We could then identify areas in the country where more resources and training were required.</p></speech>

We are all optimistic about it.  It calls for a guaranteed waiting time for procedures, outpatient appointments and diagnostic tests.  How realistic would it be to introduce legislation to guarantee women this right?  They would not just be eligible, rather, they would be entitled to a scan by legislation.  Is this a realistic proposition, particularly in terms of the maternity strategy, which is another matter on which the Committee on the Future of Healthcare is producing a report?  I presume that the maternity strategy refers to the provision of anomaly scanning.</p><p>Is it lack of political will that prevents these targets being met? </p></speech>

As people get bigger, scanning becomes more difficult.  Between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant is the ideal time to scan.  For example, in looking at the heart, as the ribs become more calcified it is more difficult to see the heart.  There is a four or five week window when we need to try to ensure that women have anatomy ultrasounds.  That is feasible, as long as resources are put in to training people and supporting the service.  In the UK, every woman is entitled to two scans whether she is in the centre of London or the outback of Scotland.  The service there does manage more or less to deliver on that commitment.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the issues before us do not, at first glance, seem to be the most interesting or significant by contrast with those the committee normally deals with.  As members know, the scrutiny of these proposals by the committee is a necessary step in facilitating the moving of the motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas, which will enable the opt-in to both measures to be exercised.</p> <p>  Members are familiar with the legal basis of the proposals before us.  That legal basis is to be found in Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, otherwise known as the Lisbon treaty.  The application of Title V to Ireland is subject to the provisions of Protocol 21, which provides that Ireland shall not take part in the adoption and application by the Council of proposed measures under Title V unless it notifies its wish to do so in accordance with Article 3 of the protocol within three months after the proposal is presented to the Council.  Under the same protocol, Ireland may, at any time after the adoption of a measure by the Council under Title V, notify the Council and the Commission, in accordance with Article 4 of the protocol, that it wishes to accept that measure.</p> <p>  Article 4a of the same protocol provides that the opt-in provisions of the protocol also apply to any measure, proposed or adopted under Title V, which amends an Act into which Ireland has already opted.  In this regard, Article 4a applies to both measures we are examining today.  Thus, while on the face of it, the matters before the committee are purely technical in nature, the examination which it is undertaking is an important element in maintaining the integrity of Protocol 21 to the Lisbon treaty. That protocol is, of course, one which we share with the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  Turning to the measures themselves, I propose to deal with the proposal for a regulation adapting a number of legal acts in the area of justice providing for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to Article 290 of the Lisbon treaty.  For the sake of brevity, I will henceforth refer to this as the adaptation regulation.</p><p>Article 3 of the protocol applies to this proposal and the relevant three-month period will expire on 13 June.  The proposed adaptation regulation relates to three legislative acts in the justice area.  The justice instruments affected by the proposal concern the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters, the European enforcement order for uncontested claims and the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil and commercial matters.  These are the only justice instruments in the civil area currently in force where an adaptation is required.</p><p> The adaptation regulation parallels a large omnibus proposal that seeks to adapt approximately 170 legislative acts across a broad range of sectors.  Separate proposals have been made for legislative acts in the justice sector because, by virtue of the special rules that apply in the justice area, the instruments in question do not bind all member states.  Denmark, for example, is only bound by the regulation concerning the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil or commercial matters.  The background to the adaptation regulation is the need to give effect to the new system set out in Article 290 of the Lisbon treaty, which substantially modifies the framework for powers to be conferred on the Commission by the Council and the European Parliament.</p><p> Prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty, there was a committee procedure in place whereby acts of the Commission which were of general application and which sought to amend or supplement certain non-essential elements of legal instruments were subject to what was known as "the regulatory procedure with scrutiny".  What this meant in practice was there was a mechanism available to deal with necessary adjustments of a technical nature without having to go through the ordinary legislative procedure in every case.  Representatives of the member states had the task of acting as a committee and scrutinising any proposals which the Commission might bring forward and adopting a formal opinion on them.  The kind of proposal allowed for included amendments to various forms where corrections or additions of a minor nature might be required, for example, where a member state adopted the euro as its currency or if some basic information such as a requirement for a postcode had inadvertently been omitted from the original form.  This committee procedure has been superseded by Article 290 of the Lisbon treaty, which provides for a system of delegated acts.  However, the scope of that article is almost identical in terms of the Commission acts which it covers to the acts covered by the old system.  Following protracted negotiations between the EU institutions, agreement was eventually reached in 2016 as to how the system of delegated acts would work in practice.  This is reflected both in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making, dated 13 April 2016, and in the Common Understanding on Delegated Acts, which is annexed to that agreement.</p><p> Taken together, these documents specify the extent to which the Commission is required to consult experts from the member states - this had been a particularly contentious matter - and the timescales within which various actions are to be taken.  A right of objection to a delegated act is also vested in both the European Parliament and the Council, and certain standard clauses for inclusion in delegated acts have also been agreed.  Negotiations on both the omnibus proposal and the adaptation regulation commenced recently.  Although it is too soon to say how long the negotiating process will take, the justice proposal is due to be discussed some time in June.  The delegation of power to the Commission envisaged by that proposal relates solely to modifying the forms annexed to the three relevant instruments.  In the circumstances, it is desirable that Ireland exercises its right to opt in to this proposal at the outset to ensure we can engage actively in the negotiating process.  As I stated, the three-month period in which we can do so expires on 13 June.  At this time, it is not anticipated that the negotiations relating to the justice proposal will present any particular difficulties for Ireland.</p><p> I will turn now to the other measure before us, which is Regulation (EU) 2017/353, replacing annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings.  Again, in shorthand terms, we might refer to this for convenience as the insolvency annexes regulation.  Article 4 of the protocol applies to the insolvency annexes regulation, that is, this regulation has already been adopted by the Council on 15 February this year.  It was not possible, for reasons of timing, for Ireland to opt in to this proposal under Article 3 of the protocol, prior to its adoption, and we therefore wish to accept it post adoption, in accordance with the Article 4 of the protocol.  It would be highly desirable that we opt in to the annexes regulation before 26 June 2017 for reasons I will now explain.</p><p> The insolvency annexes regulation is a technical update.  It amends the recast insolvency regulation, formally known as Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), whose scope and effect I will set out shortly.  Ireland already opted in to the adoption and application of the recast insolvency regulation, in accordance with Article 3 of Protocol 21, following approval by the D&aacute;il and Seanad on 28 March 2013.  The recast regulation duly entered into force on 26 June 2015 and will apply in member states, including Ireland, from 26 June 2017, except for some provisions relating to national insolvency registers, which will apply in member states on later dates.</p><p> Looking first at the scope of the recast regulation, as its name suggests, this measure consolidated earlier EU law going back to 2000.  It is limited to providing an agreed legal framework between EU member states for mutual recognition and enforcement of national insolvency procedures in insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension, such as where an insolvent company or individual has branches or assets in more than one member state.  It sets out agreed common EU rules on which member states' courts will have jurisdiction to deal with the insolvency, which member states' national law will apply, and ensuring court judgments made under the above rules, including appointment of a liquidator, will be recognised in all other member states.</p><p> The recast regulation also updates EU law in this area to strengthen recognition of pre-insolvency procedures and debt restructuring.  It sets out new strengthened rules on insolvency proceedings that involve groups of companies based in different member states.  Furthermore, it clarifies and extends the rules on so-called secondary proceedings, where the main insolvency proceedings are before a court in one member state but the company or individual also has a base, with assets or obligations, in a different member state.  The recast regulation is regarded as highly compatible with existing law and practice in Ireland.  Annexes A and B to the recast regulation set out definitive lists for each member state of, respectively, the different types of insolvency proceedings and the different types of insolvency practitioner, such as liquidators, that are accepted by the European Commission and recognised by other member states for recognition under the recast regulation.</p><p> As regards the scope of the annexes regulation, it is limited to updating the lists of Polish insolvency procedures and practitioners contained in those annexes to the recast regulation, following a substantial change to Polish insolvency law.  In December 2015, Poland notified the Commission that these changes would take effect at national level on 1 January 2016 and requested that the lists in Annexes A and B to the recast regulation be updated accordingly.  The changes are straightforward and simply reflect the reform of Polish national law.  The annexes regulation was duly presented by the Commission to the Council on 1 June 2016 and was adopted on 15 February 2017.  As I have already said, for reasons of timing it did not prove possible for Ireland to opt in to the adoption of the annexes regulation within three months of 1 June 2016, as required by Article 3.  Recital 4 of the annexes regulation indicates that Ireland is not taking part in its adoption.  This was not inserted due to any difficulties with the content of the measure but simply to reflect the procedural situation that existed.  Accordingly, it is desirable that Ireland should exercise its right to opt in to the annexes regulation post adoption in accordance with Article 4 of the protocol.  It is also important we should do so, if possible, in a timeframe that allows the annexes regulation to take effect in Ireland on 26 June 2017.  That would enable the recast insolvency regulation to enter into force in Ireland this summer in a way that reflects the up-to-date national law in all member states, including Poland.</p><p> I thank the committee for making the time available to deal with these matters today.  I look forward to comments and I will be happy to address any questions which the committee may have.</p></speech>

I remember when I chaired this committee that we dealt with quite a number of motions dealing with the European Commission as well.  At one stage we sent a reasoned opinion.  There was involvement and it is up to committees and parliaments to decide how much involvement and scrutiny they want.  The Lisbon treaty changed matters and now member states, such as that encompassed by our Houses, have involvement and input into what happens.  The proposed changes must be sent to committees and parliaments across Europe to be debated and discussed.  That gives them the opportunity to have an input before any decision is made.</p></speech>

The background to the adaptation regulation is the need to give effect to the new system set out in Article 290 of the Lisbon treaty, which substantially modifies the framework for powers to be conferred on the Commission by the Council and the European Parliament.  Are we giving more power to the Commission than it already has or am I picking this up wrong?</p></speech>

I opposed it at the time, the main reason for which was that it was a dream ticket for investment funds.  States were not allowed to spend money on infrastructure without breaking the 3% rule.  The Nice treaty was connected with that and I disagreed very strongly with it.</p> <p>  On the last point, what exactly has changed around insolvency?  It is an area I am very interested in, obviously, being personally bankrupt at the moment.  It sounds like it is going to improve co-operation between member states, but at the moment, if I had an asset in Italy or France, an Irish bank would be able to take it from me anyway.  What exactly is changing there?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in what he is saying there.  This would be where a insolvent company or individual has branches or assets in more than one member state.  It sets out agreed common EU rules as to which member state's courts will have jurisdiction to deal with the insolvency and which member state's national law will apply and ensure court judgments made under the above rules, including the appointment of a liquidator, will be recognised in all other member states.  The recast regulation also updates EU law in this area to strengthen recognition of pre-insolvency procedures and debt restructuring and sets out new strengthened rules on insolvency proceedings which involve groups of companies based in different member states.  It clarifies and extends the rules on secondary proceedings where the main insolvency proceeding is before a court in one member state but the company or individual has a base with assets or obligations in a different member state.  The recast regulation is regarded as highly compatible with existing law and practice in Ireland, as the Deputy has said.</p></speech>

I presume that wherever the insolvency action takes place, those are the rules which dominate even in relation to assets in other jurisdictions.  I am not sure what is changing.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will know from his own period as Chairman of this committee that it is important to be able to build the programme of work.  Uncertainty is presenting and I have more question marks over the Bills for the next period.  We just do not know.  There is a significant falling down on the part of the Department in progressing legislation in order that it is fit for purpose and ready to address on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The Minister and I attended those dialogues.  As a Government and Department, we are committed to an ongoing dialogue with the tourism and hospitality industry as the Brexit negotiations proceed.  The tourism leadership group will meet again in the coming weeks, on 6 July.  That group represents the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, and representatives of the industry.  Brexit has featured and will feature prominently in the discussions.</p> <p>  For tourism, the priority issues for the Government are preserving the common travel area, avoiding a hard border on the island, minimising the impact of Brexit on the tourism industry, and maintaining a liberalised aviation regime to protect and promote access, something we have all become accustomed to with the common aviation policies across the EU.  The decline in visitor numbers from Britain is of concern and reflects feedback we have been getting from our Irish industry partners with some softening in bookings from Britain.  Following what was a record year for overseas visitors to the island of Ireland and to this jurisdiction in particular in 2016, recent figures published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, showed that overseas visitors from February to April 2017 were slightly up on 2016.  While there was strong growth from the North American market, up by 25.7%, visitors from Britain were down 10.7% year on year.  </p> <p>  The sterling depreciation following the Brexit referendum has made Ireland, and every other eurozone country, more expensive for British travellers than was the case previously.  Furthermore, research has indicated that British consumers are likely to scale back on overseas holiday activity this year.  Much of our research is based on work that Tourism Ireland is doing in the market.  The tourism action plan is committed to seeking to restore the tourism marketing fund to pre-recession levels on a phased basis.  Budget 2017 increased funding for the tourism marketing fund and the Minister and I will be seeking further additional funding for next year in order to mitigate any negative effects of Brexit on tourism particularly in the British market.</p> <p>  Maintaining the overall competitiveness in our tourism industry is also vital at this time.  While the industry acknowledges its primary responsibility in this regard, I will be endeavouring to assist by seeking to maintain the lower value added tax, VAT, rate for the tourism industry and to keep the air travel tax at zero.  It would be helpful if the committee would add its support to this endeavour.  Tourism Ireland will continue to focus on protecting our market share in Britain, while at the same time seeking to increase diversification into other markets, particularly those that deliver higher tourism revenue.  We are focussing particularly not only on North America but also northern Europe.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working on a number of fronts to assist the diversification and development of our tourism industry and the attractiveness of our tourism product offering through current and capital expenditure.  Work is ongoing to develop the main experience brands, including the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East, and to enhance visitor experiences aimed at boosting our appeal to key target markets and priority consumer segments.  Some Deputies have mentioned other areas of the country in the D&aacute;il and in this committee.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland hopes to produce a report on that soon, particularly in respect of the lakelands which have been mentioned at this committee.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland offers a suite of supports to enhance the competitiveness, enterprise capability and sustainability of the tourism sector.  It is creating a new Brexit response programme that will focus on delivering a capability building programme for the industry.</p> <p>  The response to Brexit must come from the whole tourism sector, and not just from central Government and the agencies.  It must include local authorities.  I was delighted recently to launch each of the local authority tourism strategies at a tourism conference which the Department facilitated in Enniscorthy, County Wexford.  In the overall picture, there is good performance in numbers of visitors from other markets, particularly North America.  There is still strong sentiment in the industry as per F&aacute;ilte Ireland's tourism barometer published on 25 May, notwithstanding the fall-off from Great Britain and to a lesser degree from Northern Ireland.  We have to be cautious about the road ahead for the tourism industry given the risks arising from Brexit.  Challenging negotiations will be monitored closely by the Department and the tourism agencies. </p> <p>  Turning briefly to sport, the impact of Brexit is still subject to considerable uncertainty.  Anything that would impair or impede the free movement of athletes, sports people, their sports equipment, or indeed their animals, in the case of equestrian events, for example, has a potential to present logistical difficulties that do not currently exist.  Sport Ireland is engaging particularly with this issue.</p><p>We are very conscious of the importance of cross-Border co-operation with Northern Ireland in the area of sport.  Some 45 of our national sports governing bodies operate on an all-island basis, which represents about 70% of the total number of such bodies.  Officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport meet on a regular basis with their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  There is ongoing discussion between my Department and Sport Ireland to this end also.  There is extensive and effective dialogue on topics of mutual interest relating to sport, and this engagement will continue.  It is best represented by the bid for the Rugby World Cup 2023, and by the preparations for the Women's Rugby World Cup, which will take place later this year.  Through our contacts with the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland and with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in London, we have effective mechanisms already in place to monitor the impact of Brexit on the sporting landscape in Ireland.  For the benefit of the committee, I wish to note that I and my officials have met my British counterpart, Tracey Crouch, M.P.  We travelled to London to meet her in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum and are due to have further engagement with her Department and with stakeholders from the tourism and sport sectors in Britain in the coming weeks.</p><p> I will be happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

He stated that the tourism leadership group will meet again in the coming weeks and that Brexit will feature prominently in the discussions.  Can the Minister of State inform the committee of the make-up of this group?  What tourism areas will it specifically be targeting?  The CSO figures released recently show that although overall visitor numbers to Ireland were up in 2016, visits from the UK fell by 10%.  Does the Minister of State believe this is due only to fear of Brexit, or are there other factors at play?</p> <p>  Coming from a Border county which relies heavily on tourism, I know more than most the effects that Brexit might bring.  In areas of great natural beauty such as the Cooley region, including Carlingford and the Boyne Valley, tourism plays a major part in the local economy.  The Minister of State mentioned that the tourism action plan is committed to seeking to restore the tourism marketing fund.  Can he elaborate further on this?  He also stated that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working on a number of fronts to assist the development of our tourism industry.  I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on this and share what exactly is taking place on the ground.  He also stated that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is creating a new Brexit response programme which will focus on delivering a capability building programme.  What stage is this at?  I am amazed that such programmes are only being created at this stage.  Surely this should have been done within weeks of the Brexit vote.  Plans should be up and running by now.  </p> <p>  The Minister of State remarked that 45 of our national sports governing bodies operate on an all-island basis, which is about 70% of the total number of such bodies.  I have grave concerns for these bodies as Brexit gets nearer.  What does the Minister of State consider to be a viable solution for maintaining their all-island scope?  Could he elaborate on the details of his regular meetings with counterparts in Northern Ireland?  What tangible action will result from these meetings?</p> <p>  The Minister of State said that he has an effective mechanism in place to monitor the impact of Brexit on the sporting landscape in Ireland.  I put it to him that we need to be doing more than just monitoring the situation.  We need concrete plans in place to deal with Brexit and its impact on the sporting landscape in Ireland.</p></speech>

In respect of our interactions with Northern Ireland, unfortunately there is not a functioning Executive there at the moment, which is causing its own difficulties.  If anybody can assist in re-establishing a functioning Executive in the North, the Government would welcome that assistance.  In the absence of an Executive, we continue to engage through our embassy, officials in my Department and directly at ministerial level.  I have already had a meeting with my opposite number and I am due to go to London again shortly to meet the stakeholders in respect of Tourism Ireland.  We have already met the Secretary of State with responsibility for culture and media.  We are keeping the option open to have further dialogue.  We have been very conscious of the need to make the British authorities acutely aware of the impact of Brexit on tourism and sports.</p> <p>  In respect of sport, the Deputy is right.  We are very anxious to ensure that disruption is minimised.  Sport is a unifying force.  We want to maintain the ease of transition across the Border.  From an athlete's point of view, this would include the movement of sports equipment, animals and people themselves.  Under the direction of John Treacy, Sport Ireland looks after the day-to-day operation of the national governing bodies of sport.  This is obviously playing in to the narrative of how the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is looking at it through the Cabinet sub-committee.  We also need to focus on the very positive work that is being done.  When it comes to the Rugby World Cup, the Women's Rugby World Cup, the GAA or any other sporting organisation, the Irish Government does want difficulties placed in people's way.  That is the basis on which we are approaching the negotiations.</p> <p>  On F&aacute;ilte Ireland, I would draw attention to the work it is doing in engaging with local authorities in particular.  I brought legislation through this committee not that long ago in respect of the ceilings for capital expenditure.   The Department and the Government are very anxious to make sure that capital investment through F&aacute;ilte Ireland is maximised in a range of areas and projects.  In the Deputy's own constituency, I recently launched the redevelopment of Carlingford Castle  along with the Office of Public Works.  I have engaged with representatives in County Donegal in the last fortnight and am acutely aware, at both local authority and elected Member levels, of the concerns there.</p> <p>  I and my officials have met the new CEO of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We are looking to introduce very basic changes to how festivals are funded, particularly in Border areas that are going to be associated with Brexit to a larger degree than the rest of the State.  We have also ensured that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is aware of our concerns about capital funding.  The two categories of capital grants, both the large and smaller ones, are working their way through the system.  We have to be conscious of the fact that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is an accounting agency.  It receives its funding from the Department and delivers the money based on a needs analysis.  The Department is feeding in from an overall policy point of view, ensuring that we get the best bang for our buck across the country.  I met the new F&aacute;ilte Ireland CEO on a number of occasions and have relayed concerns about capital expenditure in rural communities in particular and also in respect of the development and further expansion of the brands the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  In fairness to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, a lot of announcements have been made and work has started on capital works and brand development.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the drop off in tourism figures from Great Britain, which to a large degree reflects the fall in sterling by about 11% since the original referendum result.  We cannot attribute everything to the drop in sterling, however.  Some of the decline may be due to people deciding to be more patriotic and holiday at home.  All of a sudden, Ireland is competing with Wales, Scotland and the Lake District to a much greater degree than before because of the value for money element.  We have a job to do in terms of attracting the discerning British tourist.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has worked on categorisation with Tourism Ireland so that we know exactly where our visitors come from.  We can identify the magazines and newspapers they read and radio stations they listen to and we advertise on that basis.  We have additional money this year and are going to look for more as part of the Estimates process, to mitigate the drop in numbers.  On 12 June, along with Tourism Ireland, I am going to meet the tour operators that bring people to the island of Ireland.  We will get first-hand information from them as to what they are looking for and what they want to see happening.  In an overall context, tourism numbers are up.  We have a difficulty in respect of Britain.</p><p>Emerging markets, however, are also very strong.  Northern Europe is very strong, North America is very strong and we are seeing more air gateways coming in from the Far East.</p><p> The tourism leadership group meets on a quarterly basis and is a representative group of the entire industry.  Everybody is equal, the Minister, Deputy Ross chairs and in his absence I chair the group.   We try to get a feel from the industry about what are the issues of concern to them and there are a number including Brexit and training.  Local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the State agencies are there and it is a frank, open and honest discussion.  It really guides policy development and Department focus from a tourism point of view.</p></speech>

The work of the Department and the Minister of State is very welcome in trying to address the issues such as Brexit.  The Minister of State has more or less said that the drop-off would occur due to sterling and value for money and so on.  I grew up at a time, 30 years ago, when we had huge UK business in the fishing in the lakelands of Roscommon, Leitrim and Cavan.  I had a newsagents and it had a staple diet of tourism with fishermen who came from the United Kingdom.  Even during the Troubles and the Border, it still made no huge impact and the tourists drank in the pubs and bought their papers and cigarettes and they were very welcome.  That market has totally dried up, I believe partly because of value for money but there were also other markets opening up in Eastern Europe and various places.  It is a market that we seem to have, effectively, forgotten about.  Before I participated in politics I was involved in Lough Key Forest Park.  We got &euro;15 million for its development and it is one of the major tourist attractions.  There is, however, a piece of infrastructure that is now missing.</p> <p>  The Wild Atlantic Way is terrific, as is Ireland's Ancient East.  Our area does not have the infrastructure of a hotel.  In any town this gives confidence and it attracts visitors and all the guest houses and restaurants work off that flagship.  All of these types of hotels were built in other towns around the country - places that probably did not need them.  We have a huge tourist attraction and the two hotels in the area are closed.  It is the same in Castlerea and Ballaghaderreen.  Nobody in their right mind will build a hotel unless they get some intervention.  I have discussed this with the Minister for Finance.  If we do not get this tourism infrastructure we will not have the potential.  Is the Government prepared to put in investment - I will not call it a tax incentive - for maybe one hotel? People go away for a few days to Galway, Westport or Carrick-on-Shannon, which is wonderful and is in our area, but we cannot attract those people to the towns I spoke of earlier if we do not have that infrastructure.</p> <p>  What is happening is even worse that just not attracting the tourist.  We have communions, christenings, weddings and even funerals having to leave those towns.  We speak of investment, but we now need to look at the smaller tourist towns that missed out on that huge, serious infrastructure investment.  What can been done by the Government in this regard and how does the Minister of State see the future for it? We are currently proposing an initiative called the scattered hotel where, for example, if there was a reception at King House, accommodation would be available through local property owners who would have used an incentive to do up a bedroom.  We do need a serious incentive also.  It does not need to be a five-star hotel but there are towns that are missing out on the great work being done by the Minister of State's Department - and he should take that as a huge compliment - but we would like to be part of that work.  We have King House and the tourist towns, but if we do not have the infrastructure then we are in big trouble.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.3000" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017053100002#J00600"><p>I do not disagree with anything that Senator Feighan has said.  I come from Newcastle West in County Limerick and up until recently we did not have a hotel that had any future, and still do not have a functioning hotel.  One of our own who did well in Britain decided to come back and buy the old one, knocked it and it is now under re-construction.  The reason is not too dissimilar to Senator Feighan's comments about a lot of passing trade where there is potential for local use such as communions, weddings and so on.  The Senator is correct to say that the development of any town in the country requires a basic piece of infrastructure such as a hotel.  It is soul destroying for a town when a hotel goes.  The locals see that they cannot hold a meeting, a wedding or a wake for a funeral.  There is no doubt that it is very difficult.</p> <p>  Part of what the Senator is referring to can be achieved by some of F&aacute;ite Ireland's initiatives.  Reference was made to the Wild Atlantic Way.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is now in the process, with local authorities, of developing loops off that route, the first of which will be in the Shannon Estuary between Limerick and Clare.  In parallel, one will be in the Burren to take people from the Wild Atlantic Way up in to north Clare and south Galway.  Similarly the Mulroy drive, close to the Fanad Peninsula area in Donegal - I am sure the Senator knows it very well - is pretty much ready for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to brand also.  In the west, especially in the counties referred to by the Senator, I believe the potential now needs to be driven through the local authorities and their strategies which, in fairness, I must compliment them on.</p> <p>  When I was appointed to this position I have said from the outset that there are areas in the middle of Ireland such as east Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Laois, east Clare, North Tipperary, Limerick and right down into Cork that need assistance.  The assistance should be driven locally by the local authorities, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The blueprint for that is in place because there are strategies now in place.  The local authorities know what they want to try and achieve.</p> <p>  From a current expenditure point of view, when it comes to festivals or upskilling people, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been instructed by the Department that we want it to work with local authorities and to engage with them, particularly in those areas that have a deficit in respect of tourism numbers.  The Senator is right when he says there are people who are driving in their droves through County Roscommon.  I drove through it yesterday on my way back from Achill.  There are some fabulous towns and attractions in County Roscommon, no more than there are in County Limerick.  It is about how we attract people in, which is through branding, advertising and the leadership of local authorities.  I thank the CEOs for that.</p> <p>  With regard to tax, I am not running down what the Senator is saying, but there were tax incentives for hotels before.  We know some were built in areas where they should not have been built, with the associated problems.  We are now at the other side of it where we do not have enough beds, especially in Dublin, but from a tax point of view we are already doing something.  We reduced the VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality industry and we took a major punt on that.  It was at a time when we had no money to do anything.  We invested in an industry that was basically banjaxed and it wound up with 35,000 additional people working in that industry who never had the prospect of a job.  We now want to spread that benefit.  A lot of people criticised us at the time and said that we should not have done it.  Some people still believe that we should not continue with the reduced VAT rate.  There are some political parties that think we should reverse it.  I do not agree with that idea.  In my part of the country, in the midlands and in parts of the mid-west and north west we still do not have that robustness where we can remove that crutch.  Pre -budget submissions are going to have to be made in the near future from parties and individuals around public expenditure and tax element.</p> <p>  The Department would be very open to any consideration, if it is properly costed.  When one has a tax measure in place that is a labour activation measure and it does not receive the support that it should from across the House it makes our job in the Department very difficult if political grandees are on the sidelines looking to have it abolished.  I believe it would be very helpful if we could get consensus on this tax measure in the first place.  If we were to then look at opportunities, be it private investment of public-private partnerships or whatever, I am open to suggestions.  Ultimately, however, tax breaks cost money.  If one introduces a tax incentive, a tax reduction or a tax measure it is money that must be taken out from the central Exchequer pot because it must be paid for and we must ask what is the return on investment?  We know the return on investment for the 9% VAT rate.  It is a lot of people with work who did not have the work before, who have the dignity of it and are able to pay for a mortgage and rear a family.  That is good value for money as far as I am concerned.</p></speech>

I would say that there are 30 towns in the State - four happen to be in my county - which are in a similar situation.  Take Boyle as an example.  We have Boyle Abbey, the 12th century Cistercian abbey, and we have Lough Key Forest Park, which is an outstanding facility.</p><p>It is one of the major tourist attractions in the country.  We have the Boyle Arts Festival but we do not have a hotel.  Tourists are going there but not staying because we do not have that unique piece of infrastructure.  We should target those approximately 30 towns in the country.  There must be some incentive because we missed the boat when every developer worth his or her salt was building houses and a hotel on the side; if it lost money, that did not matter.  We do not have the infrastructure and unless we get some serious assistance or incentive, people will not invest.</p></speech>

The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Canney, and I have realised this and we come from similar parts of the country.  The OPW is the largest landowner in Ireland and the custodian of some of our national monuments that open on a seasonal basis rather than all through the year.  These are located are in the towns to which the Deputy referred, such as Boyle, Frenchpark, Newcastle West, Gort, Ballinasloe, Tuam and elsewhere.  We want to broaden the base so that when somebody drives into Newcastle West or Boyle to find the national monument in the custody of the Office of Public Works is locked because it does not have the money to keep it open, there will be an opportunity for the local community to play a greater role.  The OPW, with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is looking at examples where, on a pilot basis, we could extend the period in which facilities are open.  When I was on this committee with the Chairman, we raised the issue continuously.  In fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, has drawn the OPW into that as he comes from a part of the country that is similar to ours, with people travelling through east Galway in their tens of thousands to get to Galway, Clifden and Connemara.  He - no more than Senator Feighan and Deputies Troy, Fitzpatrick and Barry, along with me - wants to ensure that rather than having them drive through to traditional places, these people stop in our areas.  It is another initiative at which we are looking.  I am sure the Minister of State and his successor will have no problem coming before the committee to update it on such matters.  I do not have a problem doing so either.</p></speech>

They are right in that tourism is very exposed to Brexit.  It is the largest indigenous industry in our country, with one in nine people employed in the sector.  The number of people coming from Britain is quite important.  I have great concern about the urgency and priority that the Department is affording this issue.  The Ministers speak about maintaining a liberalised aviation regime.  That is something I will come back to with the Minister, Deputy Ross.  Of trips to the UK, 63% will not happen with an alternative mode of transport if the liberalised aviation open skies policy is not maintained.  That is quite serious.  There are figures for the first quarter of this year indicating an 11% reduction in the number of visitors coming from Britain.  In 2016, &pound;1.3 billion was spent in our economy, with &pound;1 billion of this coming directly from the UK.</p> <p>  I will ask a number of questions about what exactly has been done.  The leadership group will meet again in the coming weeks but when was that group established and what exactly is its purpose?  What is the configuration of the group?  The Minister is aware that the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation published a document on its concerns about tourism, highlighting what the Government has done in other areas, including with Bord Bia, which has a &euro;150 million emergency fund and &euro;2 million for additional funding and strategies to support the Irish food and drinks industry.  There has also been a market identification programme, the doubling of one-to-one mentoring and an increase in the number of market and consumer research insight programmes and more trade events.  Enterprise Ireland has &euro;3 million in additional funding, with 39 additional staff, although I note from yesterday's paper that these are not yet nearly filled.  There is an export finance initiative, increased trade missions, market diversification programmes, nine additional IDA Ireland staff and increased promotion.</p><p>When we look at Tourism Ireland, we see it has no additional staff, no real increase in budgets and no enterprise or Brexit support programmes.  Is the Minister of State serious about the challenges facing this crucial sector of our economy?  I acknowledge good decisions were taken by the previous Government on the abolition of the travel tax and the reduction of VAT.  In the Minister of State's opening remarks, he identified the retention of the 9% VAT rate as a key proposal and criticised certain parties for not supporting it.  We support it, but I ask him to confirm it will be maintained in the upcoming budget.  Clarification and certainty for the industry are very important.</p><p> The committee agreed to forgo the pre-legislative scrutiny on legislation to help with the World Cup bid, which is very important.  It is an all-Ireland bid.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether the absence of an Executive in the North is having a negative effect on it?  While it is not totally related to Brexit, will the Minister of State comment on the current saga in the boxing association, given it is the number one or two story in the news agenda today?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.3009" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017053100002#P00200"><p>I thank Deputy Troy for his questions and comments and for his support for the industry.  It is important to point out Tourism Ireland is a North-South body funded by the Government here and by the Northern Executive.  We fund on the basis of two thirds to one third.  Comparisons can be made with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland but, to be honest about it, it is apples and oranges because to a large degree Tourism Ireland has an all-island remit.  Certainly the absence of a functioning devolved government in Northern Ireland is concerning from a tourism point of view.  As I said earlier, committee members have much more influence to bring to bear on the re-establishment of a Northern Executive, and the sooner it happens the better from our point of view and from Tourism Ireland's point of view.  There is a new chairperson and we wish her well.</p> <p>  The Deputy is quite right the tourism marketing fund has come from a pre-recession level of &euro;55 million and stands at &euro;36 million.  This is not an insignificant sum of money, but we need to bear in mind the decrease from &euro;55 million to &euro;36 million, which represents a drop of approximately &euro;20 million, also coincided with decreases in every element of public expenditure.  We are putting in place a trajectory to bring it back to pre-recession levels.  This will take time, and it is about ensuring we can get that level of support from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and from the whole of Government.  It is important to bear in mind that in the intervening period, when the tourism marketing fund was under enormous pressure, growth in the tourism industry exceeded all expectations.  The was much criticism at the time of the development and implementation of People, Place and Policy for lacking ambition.  We stated we expected to have 250,000 people working in the industry by 2025 and to have in excess of 12 million visitors.  We know these figures will be exceeded.  What we want to do is ensure the fund is enhanced as quickly as possible.  This will have to happen on an incremental basis because there are other demands in the Department and in the Government.  It is not for lack of leadership from the Department, certainly at official and ministerial level.  The whole of Government is acutely aware of it.  The Deputy is right that the 230,000 people employed in the industry represent approximately 9.5% of total employment in the State.  This figure has increased by 35,000 since we went into Government in 2011.</p> <p>  The tourism leadership group predates our time in the Department.  It has been there since the previous Government.  It was under the stewardship of the former Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and, latterly, Deputies Varadkar and Ring.  As I said to Deputy Fitzpatrick, it is an advisory group to the Department on issues confronting the sector as a whole.  It enables open and frank dialogue between us, the Department, the Ministers, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and representatives of the industry.  It has covered a range of issues in our time there, including hotel accommodation constraints in Dublin, and much positive work is happening.  We have engaged with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the banks to see what is the exact situation, rather than anecdotal evidence, on the provision of additional accommodation in Dublin, and progress is being made.  It has also discussed the value or otherwise of some of the schemes, such as those relating to the regional access fund or training and the existing leadership, and Brexit forms part of this.</p> <p>  I have met the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation on a number of occasions.  It would be failing in its duty if it did not raise issues of concern to the industry.  The Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and a number of other organisations, including those representing tour operators and coach operators, have also raised issues.  I have met pretty much all the stakeholders at this stage, individually and collectively, and I meet them regularly through the tourism leadership group and at unofficial and official organised events.  They know I have an open door policy and there is no issue about communication.</p> <p>  With regard to market intensification, the Deputy needs to take the whole picture and look at the phenomenal work Tourism Ireland does every year for St. Patrick's Day in terms of Government representatives and the diplomatic corps elsewhere.  If we look at the type of marketability done there, the greening has been a phenomenal success.  It gets huge traction in emerging markets.  I saw it in Australia and New Zealand.  We had 200,000 visitors last year from Australia and we want to increase this.  It is an emerging market.  Qatar Airways will open into Dublin shortly.  Etihad Airways is running double daily flights.  Emirates is also looking at expanding its presence in Dublin airport with A380s.  Many very positive things are happening in these markets.</p> <p>  In northern Europe, Tourism Ireland has a very heavy presence in France, the Benelux countries and Germany,  These were referred to earlier as traditional markets.  We cannot drag people here from the United Kingdom.  We cannot tell people they must holiday in a particular place.  We can advertise and market and we do this under a number of headings.  We know one of our greatest attributes is the culturally curious person who is looking at a whole package such as the sights of Ireland's Ancient East.  We also have city breakers, those coming for short breaks to cities such as Galway or Dublin.  We know their spending model and we can identify it.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has done work, for example, with Richard E. Grant, on penetrating the direct actual market audience in magazines, newspapers and social media platforms.  Social media has proven to be massively successful with regard to "Star Wars".  Skellig Michael and the Donegal coastline are among the most important attributes.</p> <p>  Tourism Ireland is functioning in a very strong and robust market.  The British market is very competitive.  I attended the world travel market and could see this very clearly.  It is a showcase for the entire world looking to book seats to their destination.  It is extremely competitive, particularly in Great Britain from a domestic point of view.  There are offerings, such as the Scottish Highlands, the Lake District and the Welsh mountains, that people, especially those from the south east of England, now look at in the same way as heretofore they may have looked at Ireland.  We cannot ignore the fact that 11% of the value of their currency has been wiped off.  This reduces their spending power by 11%.  If it means they can get value for money in Britain, we must make sure we demonstrate they can get as good, if not better, value for money in Ireland.  In the tourism leadership group we have been very clear as Ministers that, in particular, we need to keep an eye on Dublin hotel prices, transport costs in the private sector as much as the public sector, and a range of costs, particularly regarding visitor attractions.</p><p>The Irish Hotels Federation has provided us with regular information.  We have been at pains to point out the responsibility there.  I spoke to vintners in the Deputy's constituency recently.  One of the things we are very concerned about is competitiveness.  We do not want to get back to the field we were in before where Ireland had a reputation of gouging.  We do not want to be in a situation where tourists coming to Ireland feel they do not get value for money.  We are at pains to work with the industry.  I have already been to the UK on a number of occasions.  I have attended trade missions in Florida and Atlanta in the United States, and in Australia, New Zealand and Britain.  I will continue doing that because, apart from anything else, the leadership the Department can provide the industry is very important.  Industry roadshows happen on a continual basis.  The Deputy mentioned trade missions.  They are essentially the same thing.  The industry goes into a particular city, sets up shop and the buyers come in.  When the Minister is present, it makes a big difference.  It is my role and I make no apology for it.  People criticise Ministers for travelling, but it is my job.</p></speech>

I accept it is something he cannot control.  People travelling to mainland Britain get the same experience in Scotland and Wales as they possibly would get here.  What are we doing to attract other tourists to our island?  What are we doing to market and diversify our marketing spend?  We are not increasing the marketing spend.  While what Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland have done is welcome, we are not at the races.  We have not established a Brexit task force.  I asked about the leadership group to see if it had been established to look specifically at a Brexit task force.  It has not been established.  The Minister of State is right to commend the 220,000 people who work in the industry.  One in nine people in the country work in the industry.  They are not benefiting from access to low-cost finance the way food producers are but they need it.  I encourage the Minister of State to fight in order that people in the industry have access to the same level of funding as food producers.</p></speech>

We do not work in a vacuum.  We have to be conscious that whatever the Southern Government does, it has to be reciprocated.  We do not have a functioning Administration in Northern Ireland.  It is a major problem.  In its absence, I brought legislation through the committee to provide for how F&aacute;ilte Ireland can deliver capital works.  The Deputy has not acknowledged that.  He might have the opportunity to acknowledge it.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is in the game of trying to make sure our domestic business is maintained but, more importantly, that the visitor experience is being enhanced.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about a commitment on the 9% VAT rate.  I have said it to Deputy Fitzpatrick and I will say it again that we are not the Department of Finance.  That Department has competing demands.  The Minister for Finance and I believe the 9% VAT rate is necessary in terms of the continuing development of the tourism product, particularly in provincial Ireland.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that there are competing demands for Exchequer funds.  There is also the realisation that in Dublin in particular the industry is doing exceptionally well.  We would love to have a situation where we could regionalise VAT but that cannot happen.  Our commitment as a Department is to see its continuation but we are not the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  It is fair to point out that the &euro;36 million from our Department, which is an increase year on year, into a fund for Tourism Ireland is by no means insignificant.  In the absence of a functioning Administration in Northern Ireland, we are engaging with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in London which has tourism and sport under its remit.  When there is a functioning Administration in Northern Ireland, I would love to see a realisation that it is in the island of Ireland's interest for the fund to be increased.  We cannot work in a silo any more than Waterways Ireland can.  The Deputy knows that.  Tourism Ireland is covered by that.  It is not in any way an insignificant amount of money.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we were doing in the emerging markets.  I responded to Senator Feighan, Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Troy on the presence Tourism Ireland can successfully demonstrate through the market return from the North American, northern European and emerging markets.  We have a very strong presence there which I know because I have been there.  The figures speak for themselves.  We cannot run away from the fact the currency in the United Kingdom has devalued by 11%.  We also know from other markets that it is not unique to Ireland.  Other eurozone countries are also experiencing drops in markets.  Destinations such as those of the new and emerging markets in North America, Australia and New Zealand also have concerns about British overseas tourists who represent a very significant portion.  We will continue to do what we have done since the Brexit referendum.</p> <p>  It is not true we do not have a Brexit leadership group.  The tourism leadership group predates my time and that of the Minister, Deputy Ross, in the Department.  It captures all the issues and was set up at a time when tourism in Ireland was banjaxed and there was no investment, leadership, marketing, branding or anything when people walked off the stage.</p></speech>

A number of concerns have been raised on an ongoing basis with me.  It is my second time meeting the IABA in the aftermath of the Rio Olympics.  No one believes what happened in Rio is acceptable.  We have had two meetings with the IABA at my level and a number of engagements with Sport Ireland and officials in my Department.  I have huge concerns over the implementation of recommendations from the Rio Olympics.  The sense of urgency there is concerning.  The media reports on splits in boards is concerning.  Sport Ireland is constituted by the Houses of the Oireachtas through this committee to oversee the governance of all sporting organisations.  We have to be fair to everyone and if everyone is working from a template for sporting governance, we expect there to be no exemptions from it.  The CEO of Sport Ireland, John Treacy, has committed to discussing it at the earliest opportunity in an emergency meeting by the board of Sport Ireland.  Sport Ireland will make a decision and whatever its decision is, the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I will fully support it.  The current situation on the rule book, governance, accountability and who is in charge of the IABA cannot continue.</p></speech>

An allegation was made about me this morning on "Morning Ireland".  I met the IABA previously to discuss governance.  An issue was referred to me by a constituent.  A matter was referred to me by a boxing club in my constituency about the selection of a person to box for Ireland.  I referred the matter to John Treacy, who is the CEO of Sport Ireland, as it was the appropriate thing to do.  I made no contact with the IABA.  I referred it to Sport Ireland as a constituency Deputy, which was my only involvement in this.  It is up to Sport Ireland to oversee governance issues.  We have been very clear as a Department and Government.  There must be very clear selection criteria.  The high performance coach is being funded by the taxpayer to the tune of &euro;95,000 a year.</p><p>He has to have the same level of independence as high-performance coaches in other sports.  Based on what I have heard this morning, that is not currently the case.  Sport Ireland and the IABA need to resolve this situation.

Has he had discussions with his British counterparts on securing that agreement?  In view of the drop in the number of British tourists to Ireland even before Brexit is fully implemented, it is important that we retain, encourage and get as many tourists from not just north Europe but Asian countries in particular.  If that agreement is not secured by the Minister of State and his British counterparts, would it mean that a Chinese tourist visiting Britain may not be able to visit Ireland or may be able to visit Dublin but not Belfast or <i>vice versa</i>?  Have negotiations begun on securing those agreements?</p></speech>

At the opening stages of Brexit negotiations, the Taoiseach outlined the situation regarding Ireland and what the Government wants to achieve.  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has reciprocated in terms of the special case and relationship that Ireland has with the United Kingdom.  The issue of visa entries will form part of the overall Brexit negotiations to take place with the European Union.  The common visa situation is a recent development in many cases.  It was developed to ease access into Ireland.  It facilitates and suits us because Ireland does not have a diplomatic presence in many Asian countries.  It is a great facilitation for people to be able to transit through Heathrow or Gatwick directly on to Dublin, Shannon, Cork or elsewhere.  That ease of access is important and the Government wants to try to maintain it.</p> <p>  The issue of travel visas falls outside the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and for the Department of Justice and Equality in terms of the inward visit.  My officials have intimated, both at the Brexit Cabinet sub-committee and in their own bilateral interactions with other Departments, that this issue is very important.  Ultimately, the retention of the common travel area is critical in terms of Ireland's overall standpoint and, as Deputy Munster rightly pointed out, for the development of new and emerging markets.  It will form part of discussions on Brexit.  We will have to see how it will play out but the Government perspective and starting point is that the common travel area between the UK and Ireland, which predates our entry into the then EEC, should be retained.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland's role regards the development of capital and the domestic element of tourism.</p><p>I took the National Tourism Development Authority Bill through Committee Stage.  </p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland is as anxious as I am that the spending ceiling which had to be lifted to &euro;150 million would not be seen as a target but would be seen as something that we would try to achieve in a very short period of time. Through its capital programme, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is very anxious to engage with the private and public sectors and with local authorities to determine the demands around the country in terms of building infrastructure and tourist attractions.  The Deputy's own constituency has perfect examples of how that is being done.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's role, to be fair, has really taken off in the last number of years, particularly with the advent of the branding of the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  It has sufficient funding to continue the development of that.  </p><p> I referred earlier to new loops that are being taken off the Wild Atlantic Way which are being promoted in collaboration with local authorities.  They will receive financial support from F&aacute;ilte Ireland by way of signage, marketing, maps, social media advertising and so forth.  Similarly, support will be provided for Ireland's Ancient East for a signage programme and for capital investment that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has identified in particular sites.  Every State agency will say that it does not have enough money but F&aacute;ilte Ireland is sufficiently resourced to carry out the work it is empowered to undertake under the National Tourism Development Authority Act.  </p></speech>

I have regular meetings with the recently appointed CEO, Mr. Paul Kelly and I have also had a number of meetings with the Chairperson, Mr. Michael Cawley.  At all of those meetings I have been anxious to know how F&aacute;ilte Ireland is getting on.  I have asked for an outline of the challenges and opportunities.  Money is always going to be an issue.  Every State agency would be failing in its duty if it said it did not want money.  No-one is going to say that.  All agencies are going to want additional money but I believe that the board and CEO of F&aacute;ilte Ireland are doing a very good job with the resources that are currently available to them.  I believe that the organisation is sufficiently resourced and is well capable of continuing to drive out the numbers.  As we know, 2016 was a record year and 2017 looks like it will be another record.</p></speech>

I do not have the capital figures with me but I can get them for the Deputy.  The overall capital ceiling has been lifted to &euro;150 million, as per the Act.  That is not a limit but is required by legislation to make sure that none of us goes mad and starts doing things that the country cannot afford.  Once that level is reached, we will require further amending legislation which we can introduce.  I will ask the relevant departmental officials to provide the Deputy with the most up-to-date capital and current expenditure figures for 2016 and 2017.</p></speech>

In terms of the promotion of Ireland's Ancient East, while there are pockets of that area that have felt the benefit of the focus and investment from a tourism perspective there are certainly other parts that have not.  I am referring in particular to Border counties such as County Louth, which are particularly important in the context of Brexit.  The Minister of State made reference to the castle in Carlingford and its development is very welcome.  However, there are other parts of County Louth that have been seriously neglected and while the OPW has been working on one or two historical buildings with a view to opening them to the public, there is a lack of funding and investment to encourage and develop tourism in pockets along the Ancient East.  We are heading into June and we must invest now.  What is the Minister of State's vision or plan?  When will the more neglected areas get the investment, promotion and focus that they need?  I am particularly concerned about the Border counties in the context of Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.3060" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017053100002#S00700"><p>It is happening already and Deputy Munster has identified one example herself.  I can give another example of a new tourism initiative on the Fanad Peninsula in Donegal, another Border county, which I visited recently to see the work being done by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Donegal County Council.  I go back to the original point I made which is that local authorities have, for the first time, developed tourism strategies and I must pay tribute to the County Manager in Count Louth, in that context.  Recently we launched the tourism investment strategy in Newgrange for sites in both Louth and Meath but no Members of the Oireachtas attended the launch.  We announced the capital investment programme for Louth and Meath in the presence of the Meath County Manager and the tourism officer for the Louth, Meath region.  The Louth, Meath region has been to the fore with regard to the development of a destination plan, which is very important.  The counties are collaborating well together.  As I said at the outset, the CEOs of local authorities and, more importantly, local councillors cannot look at tourism as something in which they might get involved.  The Local Government Act makes it clear that tourism is something they must consider in terms of spending their own resources as well as accessing resources for current expenditure on things like branding, festivals and so forth, as well as capital funding.</p> <p>  As I said earlier to Deputy Fitzpatrick, where F&aacute;ilte Ireland sees a commitment from local authorities, I have encouraged it to look at those local authorities that have particular needs and deficits.  One of the things that Louth and Meath do not have, for example, is an underdeveloped hotel sector.  They have a very well developed hotel sector, with some of the finest hotels in the country in those locations.  I have spent time in those counties and Deputy Fitzpatrick will attest to the fact that I called on him, unsolicited, one day.  In terms of both  accommodation and dining opportunities, I am very familiar with the quality of the offering.  </p> <p>  However, it will not be down to F&aacute;ilte Ireland to magic up something for an area.  Local authorities, local councillors and Leader companies all have a role within the tourism strategies which have been launched and adopted.  What the Department wants to see on an annual basis is a statement of delivery.  Such a statement should include details of what was done in the previous year and the plans for the coming year.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department will reciprocate, based on that.  It is also important to point to the development of the greenway strategy.  Up until the time that myself and the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, were appointed there was no strategy for the development of greenways.  Everybody and anybody was involved.  The OPW, the NPWS, the county councils, the Department itself, Coillte and others had a role in the development of greenways.  I met representatives of the Louth, Meath area recently and they are very anxious to develop a greenway network in that region but that can only be done on the basis of strategic investment in a planned and organised fashion.  That is what we are trying to do in the Department.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his responses.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross has circulated the opening statement on transport.  Can we take that as read?  We are under time pressure because we must also deal with the Bus &Eacute;ireann issue before 1 p.m.   Is everyone agreed that we go straight to questions for the Minister on transport strategy in the context of Brexit?</p></speech>

Last year the principle of the EU negotiating directly was approved at the General Affairs Council.  This clears the way on the EU side for the commencement of the negotiations.  The next major milestone is the forthcoming UK general election, after which I understand Mr. Barnier and his team are seeking to commence the first round of talks during the week beginning 19 June.</p><p>In line with the agreed negotiation guidelines and mandate, the initial focus of the negotiations will be on the withdrawal agreement and after sufficient progress is achieved in this phase of the negotiations, it will be followed by negotiations on the future relationship.</p><p> Along with all other Departments, my Department has prepared for the commencement of the negotiations and has consulted widely in identifying the issues of importance to the transport and tourism sectors.  My colleague, the Minister of State, has referred to tourism.  With regard to transport, there is general consensus across all operators and users that any additional barriers, be they physical, regulatory or technical, to the current access arrangements between the UK and Ireland, including North and South, will be detrimental to them and to the overall economy.  The key issues for the sector are the maintenance of the common travel area; the maintenance, as far as possible, of existing common standards and regulatory regimes; the avoidance of a hard border between North and South, and the most efficient customs arrangement on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Great Britain; the protection of the fully liberalised and deregulated aviation market; ensuring current aviation traffic rights are not adversely affected by the UK exit with respect to their various air transport markets; and equal treatment of EU and UK airlines as well as UK and EU nationals in respect of ownership and control rules.</p><p> With respect to sector-specific concerns, the UK's exit from the EU and the single aviation market means that a new EU-UK aviation agreement between the remaining 27 member states and the UK will have to be negotiated.  Brexit, unless accompanied by some form of agreement replacing the impacted traffic rights and associated regulations, will affect the existing rights of Irish licensed airlines to fly between the UK and the EU, within the UK, and between the UK and a range of other countries, including the US and Morocco.  Specific political consent will be required for existing traffic rights to remain available and the desired end is for a comprehensive EU-UK agreement to be reached.  Uncertainty regarding traffic rights is exacerbated by ownership rules affecting Irish airlines.  To retain an EU airline licence and access to the EU single aviation market, an airline must be majority owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals.  It is also essential that robust transitional arrangement bridging the gap between a withdrawal agreement and a future relationship agreement are put in place to provide clarity and certainty for the sector and to ensure continuity of services.</p><p> Any negative impact on bilateral trade flows will impact on ports and shipping.  The UK has signalled it does not expect to be part of the EU customs union and, therefore, any additional levies or tariffs that may be introduced may divert goods to EU markets away from the UK and may depress Ireland's overall exports.  Reintroduction of border controls for freight together with additional administrative requirements would have a significant negative impact on the cost and efficiency of the transit goods through ports and a significant impact on the capacity of ports as a result of the likely negative impact on land utilisation and other port infrastructure.</p><p> Irish haulage and passenger operators who hold a Community licence have access to the EU market, including the UK and Northern Ireland.  It is unclear how Irish road transport operators will be able to access the UK and Northern Ireland post-Brexit.  Issues will also arise regarding road transport regulatory requirements post-Brexit when the UK will no longer be governed by EU legislation in this area.  A significant proportion of goods destined for EU markets use the UK land-bridge to access these markets.  Brexit could impact on the efficiency of the land-bridge routes, particularly where there are increased border and customs procedures and delays or where the UK may subsequently apply different standards, road charging or regulatory regimes.  Current alternatives to the UK land-bridge are regarded as slower and lacking capacity.  My Department, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office, is planning to undertake a study shortly into the UK land-bridge to help inform our negotiating position.  There is also considerable cross-Border traffic with hauliers operating on both sides of the Border.  They currently may make multiple crossings in a day.  Border controls could significantly disrupt these operations or render them unfeasible.  Employment and cabotage will also emerge as road haulage issues.  UK drivers will be considered to be non-EU and, therefore, work permits may be required, leading to potential driver shortages.</p><p> Irish bus and coach operators travelling to the UK or transiting through the UK to access continental Europe could be faced with increases in costs and restrictions on carrying out public transport cabotage operations in the UK.  Picking up and setting down passengers as part of a cross-Border trip is particularly an issue for services to and from Northern Ireland.</p><p> As part of my Department's preparations for Brexit, there has been wide engagement with sectoral stakeholders and there are established stakeholder fora in the tourism, aviation, maritime, public transport and road haulage freight areas to consider the implications of Brexit for these sectors.  Two major workshops have taken place.  Along with the Minister of State, and as referred to by him, earlier this year I hosted an all-island dialogue on the impact of Brexit on the transport and logistics, and tourism and hospitality sectors and, in April, my Department hosted a workshop on the impact of Brexit on maritime transport regulation.</p><p> In addition to Irish stakeholder consultation, we are seeking to deepen and broaden our alliances with the EU institutions and individual member states and continue to work to ensure they are fully mindful of and aware of core Irish concerns on various issues in the transport sector.  Such alliance building and positioning will require a concerted effort on our part seeking issue-specific coalitions often within individual sectors and policy areas.  As set out in the EU guidelines for the negotiations, flexible and imaginative solutions will be required.  Our absolute preference is to maintain the closest trading relationship based on a level playing field between the UK and EU, including Ireland.  What happens with Brexit will influence the transport and tourism sectors for decades to come and there will be much to do over the coming period to achieve the outcomes we want.</p></speech>

I am glad he stated it was not an Irish decision for the UK to leave the EU.  It is the result of a Tory feud and it is the UK's decision to leave.  I am glad the Government is committed to the Single Market, the euro and low corporation tax.  The Minister said the first round of talks will take place on 19 June.  What opportunities does he see with the UK leaving?  Foreign direct investment in the UK amounts to approximately &euro;35 billion a year while the equivalent investment in Ireland is approximately &euro;5 billion.  The IDA, Enterprise Ireland the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are working hard to get as many companies from the EU as they can to set up in Ireland.  What opportunities does this present?</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the currency issue earlier.  There has been an 11% reduction in the number of UK tourists visiting Ireland.  The fluctuation in sterling has been a major factor.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to a hard border.  I come from Dundalk, a Border town, and there is a great deal of concern about what will happen.  The Minister said additional barriers and customs procedures may be put in place.  What comfort can he give to the transport industry in the Border region?</p> <p>  The Government has committed &euro;50 million to the A5 motorway project in Northern Ireland.  If a hard border is put in place with customs posts, will the Government proceed with this investment?  There is a great deal of discussion in the Houses about providing money for health and disabilities and so on.  However, if there is a hard border, &euro;50 million would go a long way towards addressing these problems.  The Minister of State said the inactivity in the Northern Ireland Assembly is not helping the caused at the moment.  What is the Minister's view on this?  A few weeks ago, Newry Chamber of Commerce &amp;amp; Trade visited Dundalk.</p><p>We heard from them that the only people showing any concern about Northern Ireland is the Irish Government.  The background is that the Assembly is not operating and an election is under way in the United Kingdom.  Does the Minister have an opinion on that issue?</p><p> Much is being said about aviation, traffic rights and so on.  While the Minister stated this should not affect Ireland, a high profile individual involved in airline companies in Ireland stated this will cause problems.  More than 200,000 people are employed in sectors that trade with the United Kingdom.  Irish airports operate flights to London, Liverpool, Manchester and other UK cities.  We will negotiate our rights as part of the European Union.  I would not like anything to disrupt trade between Ireland and the UK.  Will the Minister provide an update on the position in Ireland regarding aviation rights?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-31a.3070" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017053100002#U00200"><p>I will take the questions one by one.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is correct that the decision on Brexit was not taken by Ireland and it is not one we would take voluntarily.  The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has landed us in a fair number of negatives.  There is no point in arguing that Brexit has many positives which are immediately apparent, although it is fashionable to try to find some.  On the whole, particularly in the transport sector, Brexit is a negative.  We are seeking to protect our interests and ensure the minimum amount of change from the status quo in the negotiations.  In that sense, it is difficult to find positives.</p> <p>  There will be some benefits as UK companies or companies from elsewhere relocate to Ireland.  This may deliver benefits for the financial services and insurance sectors as companies decide they do not want to be located in the UK.  IDA Ireland and other bodies have targeted companies, including financial institutions, in an effort to have them locate here.  Overseas and multinational companies may have taken a decision to locate in Ireland because they do not want to locate in the UK for obvious reasons.  We have linguistic advantages as Ireland will soon be the only English speaking country in the European Union.  That is a plus but when I look for pluses, I am clutching at straws to some extent.</p> <p>  Most of our energy post-Brexit is focused on protecting the interests that are threatened by Britain leaving the EU, man of which the Deputy eloquently identified.  We are also focused on shielding the country from the unknown, which is possibly the most frightening aspect of Brexit.  I refer in particular to aviation, an area the Deputy highlighted.  This issue is extremely alarming and we must rapidly take measures to ensure the sector is not affected in the way that has been outlined. </p> <p>  In terms of offering the Deputy comfort a substantial amount of work is being done on the issue of a hard Border and the dangers it presents.  Alternatives are being considered and officials have been examining what has been done in other countries such as Sweden and Norway.  Political decisions and technology will move together.  We hope that if Britain leaves the customs union, as I assume it will, and Border controls are introduced, the most modern technology will be implemented to ensure a minimum of disruption and disturbance for those crossing the Border, whether tourists, traders, freight and so on.  It is intended that we have a smooth operation of the Border, particularly in County Louth, Deputy Fitzpatrick's home area, and similar areas.  It is unthinkable that we would return to the days of queues at the Border because that would disrupt the frenzied cross-Border activity that takes place.  I say with some confidence, although I do not wish to give a hostage to fortune, that the research being done on this issue will ensure that if Border controls are introduced and customs or other delays become necessary, this will be done in the most sophisticated way possible.  All the indications are that the technology will follow the political decisions and it will be fairly sophisticated.  I hope I have given the Deputy some comfort on that issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked for an update on the position regarding the airlines.  The most honest update I can give is that this is the most pressing, acute and worrying problem for Ireland in view of Brexit because of the open skies agreements and the EU aviation market.  If Britain were to withdraw from the European Union, it would, on the same day, leave the EU aviation market and we must be prepared for this eventuality.  The imperative is to negotiate a new agreement with new rules between the 27 member states, of which Ireland is one, and the United Kingdom.  It will not be a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the UK.  It would be unacceptable if that were not to happen.  From my discussions with others in the aviation industry, the intention is to have transitional arrangements after the UK withdraws from the EU.  I hope these will be as close as possible to the current arrangements. </p></speech>

If Irish taxpayers contribute &pound;50 million towards a motorway project in the North, we should be given a commitment by the Northern Ireland or UK authorities that road users from the South will not face a toll.  Many people cross the Border every day and nobody knows if a toll will be charged.  These questions need to be answered before the project proceeds.</p></speech>

On the retention of the open skies policy, what key stakeholders has the Minister met in that regard?

The Minister will be aware that the total value of exports last year to this economy was &euro;117 billion.  The association has raised concerns regarding the threat posed by Brexit on our regional airports, including, for example, Ireland West Airport Knock, where flights from the UK currently account for 80% of air passenger traffic.  Has the Minister met the regional airport stakeholders?  The association also highlighted the need for the Department to seek a full derogation from the EU of state-aid supports to regional airports handling under 1 million passengers.  I understand that the announcement made a number of weeks ago restricts that state-aid rule to airports with fewer than 200,000 passengers.  Will the Minister consider that proposal?</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the Department's plans to shortly undertake a study of the UK land bridge but the consequences in this regard have been known for 12 months.  Does the Minister realise that two thirds of Irish exports to mainland Europe travel via the land bridge?  What plans are there to mitigate the impact of a hard Brexit and a British Government decision to impose tolls on their roads and thereby placing many obstacles in the way of the haulage industry?  Based on what the Minister has had to say thus far, there are no such plans in place.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to the regional airports which, if they are within the restrictions imposed by EU rules, will continue to get funding.

The important aspect is that it is being done in a thorough and very formal way.  That is in recognition of our need to have a fully researched piece of work on what exactly the effect would be and to have it completed in time before the negotiations start.

From previous meetings the Secretary General and members of staff and officials have had with the United Kingdom, from as early as January, we have certainly had a very detailed discussion about the land bridge issue and got a great deal of comfort from the United Kingdom that it has no wish to obstruct that very important means of transport in moving freight around.  We realise how important the issue is, but I assure members that the research will be carried out and a formal report will be available in very good time in order that the negotiations will be fully informed of the consequences of any obstruction or changes in the use of the landbridge.  That is vital, but it requires an enormous amount of research because of the level of traffic from here to Holyhead and on to Dover and Calais and back from across the Continent.  It is a very important vein.  It would not be responsible to address the issue without also looking at the alternatives.  That is what is being done and it will be done extremely thoroughly.  I am sure the Deputy will be the first to receive a copy of the report when it is available.</p></speech>

Did he receive the same assurances when he met his counterpart last week?  Has he engaged with the European Commission on the possibility of our qualifying for Trans-European Transport Network, TEN-T, funding to upgrade ports, including Rosslare and Waterford?  Has he engaged with the shipping companies on the possibility of increasing their connectivity to continental Europe?  </p> <p>  We have raised on a number of occasions at this committee the issue of the 42 tonne derogation.  The Government's failure to sign the derogation this year has put haulage companies at a disadvantage with some of their counterparts in the United Kingdom and on mainland Europe.  The United Kingdom is considering a 46 tonne derogation, with a six axle base, which would put Irish haulage companies at even more of a disadvantage.  In the light of Brexit, is that something the Minister would be willing to review?</p></speech>

I will examine it and come back to him on it.</p></speech>

I was going to ask the Minister if he had planned to deal with a scenario where Britain would no longer be part of the Open Skies agreement.  I listened to his response in which he said there should be an agreement between Ireland and the other member states, but is that as far as it has got, as it would have serious implications for us.  Has nothing definitive yet been worked out?  To whom did the Minister, his Department or the Government speak about the matter?</p> <p>  I note that the ports issue has been covered, but what plan does the Minister have for ports, given that the landbridge route is through Britain?  If the worst comes to the worst, capacity-wise, will ports be capable of dealing with it and does the Minister have plans to upgrade them?  Has the issue been put on the agenda?</p> <p>  I dearly hope there will not be a return to a position where I will see a customs post in my constituency.  What the Minister said was curious because the issue was not included in his written correspondence.  He made reference to a reassurance that if there were customs posts, they would involve the use of the highest technology and that delays would be minimised.  Who was it who said that?  Was the Government or the Department prepared to accept something like that, given the magnitude of what is at stake, that if customs posts were reinstated, we would need not to worry as they would involve the use of the highest technology and that delays would be minimised?  I am very interested in hearing the Minister expand on that issue.</p></speech>

That answer is, as far as I understand it, that the United Kingdom will start the withdrawal talks very soon after the general election.  They will proceed in a certain way and no talks on other matters, including the Open Skies agreement, should start before March 2019.  That would be a very long period in which to have no talks on the Open Skies agreement because the United Kingdom will come out of the agreement - the EU Aviation Single Market - automatically when it leaves the European Union.  There is, however, a provision for a framework to be put in place because of the urgency of what the Deputy is talking about in order that arrangements will be made for a transitional arrangement to the Open Skies agreement.  There are talks under way.  When I spoke to Chris Grayling last week, aviation was top of the agenda because the matter was so urgent.  Our objective is to ensure there will be as little change as possible in the context of the Open Skies agreement and that we will have an input into the talks early on - it must be remembered that Ireland is one of 27 member states and that we are not on the United Kingdom's side - in order that a transitional arrangement will be in place on the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  That is where we are and that is the intention of everybody involved.  Is that okay?</p></speech>

The horrific imagery of Border posts, with lorries and cars and freight queueing there, is unacceptable and we would have to introduce the most seamless way possible of doing that without disturbing either the local population, tourists or tradesmen, more than is absolutely necessary.

That continues but is nearing completion.  A principle has been agreed that all commercial bus operators, including Expressway, should be treated the same regarding the methodology used for compensation for participating in the scheme.  As I speak, the officials in the Department of Social Protection are broadening their examination to consider other aspects of the scheme's funding arrangements.  I have mentioned this to the committee and members will be aware that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I had previously instructed our officials to examine the funding arrangements associated with the free travel scheme.  It is open to all private operators to participate in the scheme, as members will know, and I encourage them to do so.</p> <p>  I would emphasise that the decisions on the funding of allocations will be made as part of budget 2018.  Interdepartmental meetings are ongoing on the matter and will continue.  There is a meeting on this scheduled in two weeks.  The committee should be aware that on PSO services, any shortfall in free travel funding is effectively made up through PSO funding and fare revenues so while there may be a shortfall from a particular source, there is no net shortfall in current overall Exchequer funding.  </p></speech>

They have gone up over recent years and will continue to do so.  They should be focused most where they are most needed.  I am conscious that some rural communities feel that they have been neglected or deprived in recent times.  My opinion is not that important because that scheme is run by the Department of Social Protection and the NTA has an input as well.  Politically, we should be conscious that there is a need for rural areas which feel that they are isolated to be serviced by the buses.  It is something that we as politicians should be aware of.  There are non-commercial areas and they must be looked after.  New services are an obvious focus but this is mostly a matter for the NTA.  However, I am conscious that there has been much discontent in rural areas where people were worried - wrongly worried - particularly during the dispute that they might become isolated but the connectivity has been assured in all those cases.</p></speech>

From our position, wherever housing expands, we must look at those areas and expand in those areas.  When housing density increases, it affects transport and it is very important that any new estates or developments are serviced by transport.  That is the most important area.  Where the houses go, we follow.</p></speech>

They have taken some difficult decisions in the long-term interest and sustainability of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Some of those decisions would not have been necessary had corrective action been taken by senior management at Bus &Eacute;ireann, its board and the Department when it became patently obvious a number of years ago that serious financial issues faced the company.  Are there consequences for the people who failed to take corrective action or decisions and who allowed this situation to develop over a 24-month period?</p><p> The Minister promised to establish a multi-stakeholder forum if the Labour Court recommendations were accepted.  They have been accepted, so I am disappointed that the forum has not been established, given its importance.  Will the Minister give a definitive timeframe for the forum's establishment?  Who will its members be?  Will the Minister fulfil his commitment to meet the unions before the forum is established?  Will the private operators, who have a role to play, be a part of the forum?</p><p> I understand that there are two pension schemes across the CIE Group.  One is performing well and the other is performing not so well.  Do these schemes have outstanding liabilities and will that have long-term consequences in the form of the possible removal of funding from front-line services?</p><p> There is a commitment to privatise 10% of routes and I understand that this process has commenced.  Is it the Minister's intention to restrict this level to 10%?  I would not have imagined that he would need his officials to advise him as to whether it was his intention.  Does he concur with one of the potential leaders of the Fine Gael Party, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, who said during the course of his campaigning for that leadership that he would like to see Bus &Eacute;ireann 100% privatised?</p><p> While school transport falls under the Department of Education and Skills, it is administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The anecdotal evidence being given to my constituency office - some of my colleagues might bear this out - is of an attempt to reduce the size of buses, thereby discommoding a number of people who are using them on a discretionary basis.  If the number of people who are entitled to avail of school transport based exclusively on the nearest school rule is decreased, those students who have availed of it on a discretionary basis over the years are being forgotten, and that is not fair.  Will the Minister examine this matter further?</p></speech>

I agree that it was a painful strike for some people and that difficult decisions were made.  I pay tribute to all sides on reaching an agreement, including the trade unions, employers, the WRC and the Labour Court, where significant efforts and sacrifices were made.  That should be acknowledged.  It was very difficult for certain people to accept it and they were faced with a difficult situation.

Of course I will meet the unions.  I received letters from three of them last week.  Those have been acknowledged and I will write to them in the next day or two to invite them to meet me.  That will be an open agenda.  I will discuss with them what we plan to do in terms of the stakeholder meetings.

I will not list everyone, but it would also include transport economists.  We would be happy to have that.  I will not delay it, but we want to set up something that is meaningful and will feed into the consultation process and review of transport policy.  They must have that input, so we want them to have it.  I promised that I would do it, so I will.</p> <p>  Regarding the pensions issue, I believe that the CIE Group is in discussions with trade unions at the WRC as we speak, but I can check for the Deputy.</p> <p>  I have no plans to increase the 10% level of privatisation.  Doing so would be provocative and I have no intention of being provocative despite the fact that Deputy Troy might like me to be.  The 10% level is what we have decided and that is where we intend to stay.</p> <p>  I will examine the school transport issue.</p></speech>

I am seeking information on this, so perhaps the Minister could forward us the details.</p> <p>  Who are the stakeholders that will be involved in the upcoming review and talks?  Bus &Eacute;ireann obviously will be, and I presume that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus will be as well, but who else among transport providers does the Minister intend to invite?</p> <p>  Regarding the Department of Social Protection and the free travel pass, the Minister stated that he had committed to working with the Minister for Social Protection on examining the level of funding for the scheme.  However, he did not commit to increasing that funding.</p><p>In three months in the run-up to the dispute, it was made clear that part of the contribution to the loss making in Bus &Eacute;ireann was a lack of subvention and subsidy of the free travel pass.  From my recollection, I understand the figure was 46% which was far short of what it should have been.  Therefore, it played its part in contributing to the financial losses of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  </p><p> The Minister's statement on the tree travel pass is somewhat watery.  He does not give a commitment to increasing funding for it.  He said he will examine it, but surely at this stage, in particular if he is holding a review and meeting all of the stakeholders, he has something more to bring to the table than a statement that he is examining the matter.  I imagine the Minister has examined it already and spoken to the Department of Finance.</p><p> The Minister knows that there needs to be a drastic increase in the PSO subvention.  It was part and parcel of the talks.  While I acknowledge that there was an increase this year, it is minuscule.  If we are to return to the subvention levels of 2008 and protect and preserve our public transport, further increases are needed.  Is there any indication of that, given that the Minister is going into the review with all of the stakeholders?  Does the Minister have any good news in regard to funding levels and subventions?  He knows substantial amounts of money are required.</p></speech>

There is no intention to exclude anybody who is an interested party.  I would anticipate all of the employers in the semi-State transport area, including private operators, should be there, as well as the State, politicians, all the unions, the NTA and others who are interested parties in that area.

There is no agenda, if that is what the Deputy means.  It is something trade unions have specifically required and it is a specific response to them.  That is why it is being done.

We have agreed a principle.  The payment of free travel is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.  We agreed a principle that funding for all commercial operations would be the same.  The effect of that is what the Deputy wants to know.  It means that there will be an increase in funding for Expressway.  It will now receive the same as any other commercial operation, in other words, an increased subsidy.</p></speech>

Even if it is brought up to that level, in the first instance there should never have been a difference between the amount given to public transport and private operators.  If it had not come to the fore during committee discussions, I suspect it would never have been changed.  That does not address the fact that even if the amount is increased by a minuscule 3% or 4%, it is insufficient.  The Minister knows that the fact the subsidy was so low contributed to the loss making in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Funding needs to increase substantially, in particular in our public transport network.</p></speech>

All he is doing is levelling it out.</p> <p>  Information came into the public domain to the effect that private operators were receiving more of a subsidy for the free travel pass than our public transport network.  That is what the Minister is addressing.  He is not addressing the overall issue of the subsidy.  Even if this issue is being addressed, the subsidy being granted is nowhere near what is needed for our public transport network.  That has directly contributed to the loss making situation, for which the workers have taken the rap.</p></speech>

The chap who owns it asked me what I was going to be doing today.  I told him I was going in to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to ask the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, a few questions.  He said to me: &quot;Shane Ross?  That fella used to be a communist with the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.&quot;  I explained that he used to be a columnist with the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  He said: &quot;Yes, that is what I told you.  He used to be a communist with the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.&quot;  I left it at that and went away thinking that if he was a communist or socialist, we would be in a better position with regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann than we are at the moment.</p><p>The Minister kicked off his remarks by making a couple of brief comments about the recent dispute.  I do not intend to dwell on that, but I will make a couple of brief points.  I am sure the Minister is well-informed about the situation, but I will outline the position just in case.  There is not a single bus driver, to my knowledge &ndash; I know a lot of them &ndash; who voted in favour of the package because they felt it was a positive option for them, their families or the future of the company.  Without exception, the men and women I know who voted for it did so because they felt that a gun had been put to their heads.  They felt that the threat of examinership was so serious that this time there was no alternative but to vote for the package.  That was the feeling among employees.</p><p>I compliment all of them on the stand they took.  The pay cuts and pension situation would have been significantly worse if they had not taken that stand.  It is to their credit that they fought their corner so well.  I will leave those points there.</p><p>I am not sure if whether when the Minister says that proposing to put more than 10% of the company's services out to tender is extremely provocative, he feels that the Minister for Social Protection's comments were extremely provocative because the Minister for Social Protection has made his position clear on that.  The Minister might like to clarify that point.  </p><p> On the immediate issues, in respect of funding for PSO, the Minister says we will see the colour of the money in budget 2018.  We will watch that with great interest.  On the question of free travel, the Minister says that this examination is ongoing but an important principle has already been agreed that all commercial operators, including Expressway, should be treated and compensated in the same manner under the scheme.  I am asking the Minister to clarify that.  Discrimination in favour of the private operators over and above Bus &Eacute;ireann in terms of the way that scheme is administered exists.  Can the Minister confirm that he is suggesting that this discrimination be ended?  That would be welcome but I would like to hear that point clarified.  </p><p> When we were discussing the free travel scheme during the dispute-----</p></speech>

What we are being told here is that the news will be unveiled in the budget.  The budget is a long way off.  Can the Minister give any indication that there might be positive news relating to the free travel scheme well in advance of the budget?  I would like some feedback on that.</p> <p>  The Minister has spoken about the forum previously and mentioned it verbally today but in the material, he speaks about talking to the unions in the next few weeks.  He talks about a dialogue with stakeholders later in the year.  Can the Minister confirm that what he has in mind is not a once-off dialogue but a forum which will meet on a regular basis and include the representatives of the workers who run the company and that there will be full representation for unions at that forum?  </p></speech>

For someone who said he was not going to address the subject of the dispute, Deputy Barry did pretty well.  He spoke about it for four minutes.  I will try to restrict myself.  Along with Deputy Barry, I compliment those bus drivers and other members of staff in all stations and jobs who suffered during the strike.  I compliment them on coming to a very hard decision.  That should be acknowledged.  They made a very difficult choice and I join with Deputy Barry in saying "well done" and thanking them for putting the Bus &Eacute;ireann buses back on the road and facilitating the travelling public and taxpayer. </p> <p>  Deputy Barry can watch with interest the funding for PSO.  It is certainly my intention that it will be raised this year and Deputy Barry can come back to me if he is still there and I am still here in December or November and tell me whether I did or did not deliver on what I said was going to happen.  </p> <p>  In respect of free travel, we have agreed in principle that funding for all commercial operations will be the same.  That is a fundamental change that is an agreement in principle.  There are few loose ends to be tied up.  It might not be announced in the budget.  It might be announced beforehand.  I must talk to the Minister for Social Protection about when the details will be announced but they will be announced fairly soon.  They will be implemented in the budget.  </p> <p>  In respect of the dialogue with shareholders, I will meet the unions.  I want to meet the unions-----</p></speech>
