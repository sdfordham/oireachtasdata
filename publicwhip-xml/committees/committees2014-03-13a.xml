    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300003#J00300"><p>Are the minutes of the meeting of 6 March 2014 agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  We have revised the decision of last week&rsquo;s meeting on two items, namely, the documentation relating to the HSE and Rehab and the records relating to the whistleblower.  The committee will hold on to the box provided to it by the whistleblower until such time as our work on it is completed.</p><p>  We agreed this morning to issue a request to Rehab for it to submit documentation directly to the committee.</p><p>  No. 1, correspondence, dated 5 March 2014, from SOLAS regarding follow-up information requested at the meeting on 27 February 2014 is to be noted and published, as is correspondence, dated 11 March 2014, from the Rehab Group regarding further information requested at our meeting of 27 February 2014.  No. 3B6 is correspondence from Tom Casey Solicitors, dated 11 March 2014, regarding a statement from John Kelly.  The committee reviewed this correspondence earlier.  The statement contains several serious allegations against named individuals who have or had associations with the Rehab Group.</p><p>  The committee has taken legal advice on the statement and has decided to forward a copy of the correspondence to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, pursuant to its obligations under the Criminal Justice Act 2011 and other enactments.  The allegations contained in the statement fall outside the committee&rsquo;s remit and could potentially involve criminal wrongdoing.  In that regard, the committee has agreed to refer the matter to the appropriate authorities, in this case An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The document is no longer a document of the committee and therefore, if published, does not have privilege.</p><p>  We have a letter, dated 11 March 2014, from Rehab which is the reply to the committee on outstanding issues from our meeting of 27 February 2014.  It will be published.  It falls short in answering our queries of what we expected from Rehab.</p> <p>A number of issues arise from this correspondence and have not been dealt with.  We have no details on how much was paid to Mr. Flannery for his consultancy work or the source of the money.  That raises the question whether it was part of the &euro;700,000 referred to at the meeting which came from the charitable lotteries fund.  One of the major issues on the Rehab Group is the lack of transparency regarding how public moneys are accounted for, therefore as part of the next hearing we will extend an invitation to Mr. Flannery and to the director of finance for the Rehab Group.  We are doing this to give the group and the director of finance an opportunity to walk us through the various accounts so we can follow the public money and the charitable donations that come to Rehab.  This is a key issue.</p><p> We will also need to know more about Mr. Flannery's consultancy work in the context of lobbying the Government and the charitable lotteries fund.  Much information has come into the public domain in the past week and we need to clarify this in terms of public accountability.  We are anxious to hear direct evidence from Mr. Flannery.  The salaries being paid to senior executives are out of line with the charities sector and based on information the HSE gave in the context of the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, they appear to be above public service norms.  The HSE is doing a piece of work on returns from section 39 agencies and will be able to comment on this aspect of our work.  The information supplied from the Towers Watson report does not provide a basis for making decisions on salaries.  I am sure that whether or not this is the full context of the Towers Watson report, we will need to hear about this from the remuneration committee, who will be invited to the next hearing.</p><p> We need to know how much is charged back to the HSE and SOLAS for executive salaries.  We need to know how the profitability of Rehab Enterprise is contingent on a subsidy from the Department of Social Protection and whether other states have made similar subsidies.  If these are factors, they clearly point to the fact that Rehab is very much a public sector, not a private commercial, operation.  We need that clarified.  We need details from the remuneration committee of the bonuses paid.  Up to &euro;14,200 was paid to senior executives.  We also need to know the bonuses paid to Ms Kerins.  We have not been provided with Mr. Flannery's pension arrangements and whether an abatement rule applies in respect of his consultancy work as is the case in the public sector.</p><p> We intend to schedule our next meeting with Rehab for Thursday, 10 April.  We will issue an invitation to Rehab to ensure the chairman of the board, Ms Kerins, the remuneration committee, Mr. Flannery and the director of finance attend.  This morning the committee agreed to schedule that meeting and invite the witnesses, as recorded.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300004#K00200"><p>The response is a smokescreen.  It does not give us what we sought and it is deliberately obscure.  It makes life harder for us and is typical of the characteristics of the replies we receive that we get nothing that we want, particularly in the case of the Towers Watson situation.  This was the promised report on salaries.  Instead we got a kind of PowerPoint summary.  Yesterday we wrote back to Rehab saying we want the full report.  What is the response to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300004#K00300"></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300004#K00400"><p>That is typically unsatisfactory.  It is more of the smokescreen.  As everybody on the committee knows, we got a very bland summary which gives us no idea of the basis on which people were being paid, what they were being paid and the pattern of pay.  If we get the full report we should get full details of what happened.  There is correspondence which specifically shows that Towers Watson allowed for the release of this report only if it was released in full and therefore Rehab is in breach of its agreement with Towers Watson by giving us an abridged version of that.  If we get the Towers Watson report I suspect we will get the information we seek.  Again, it is part of the smokescreen.  It is being deliberately withheld and is not being given to us despite its promises.  We are getting no more on the bonuses and the chief executive's salary.  It is shocking that people who were getting &euro;150,000 or more during a recession were getting bonuses.  We are not being told specifically who is getting what.  We should have got that.  What we got is totally unsatisfactory and that message should go out to Rehab, that we do not want them to come here again, not give us the full information and just stall for five or six hours.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300004#K00500"><p>I agree with Deputy Ross on the Towers Watson report.  The correspondence specifically mentioned that its consent to the sharing of the report was contingent on the disclosure of a complete copy of the report.  Rehab compares its salaries to industry averages, yet refers to reference and desired Rehab pay policy and philosophy.  That is a little subjective and very vague.  It is incredible that 12 people receive a total of &euro;1.7 million in salaries.  They gained bonuses between &euro;6,000 and &euro;14,000 in 2012.  It is a stark and incredible figure for the ordinary person looking in.  We need clarity on how this arose.  The documentation refers to a management charge of &euro;4.5 million from Rehab Care paid to Rehab Group.  We need to know the breakdown of that.  The correspondence from SOLAS states that 64% of the senior management salaries are funded by Rehab funds.  That is two thirds of senior management salaries coming from State funding.  There are major implications there.  We need to get replies back from Rehab and Mr. Flannery as quickly as possible.  When do we expect to hold a hearing on the matter?  Have we set a date?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300004#K00900"><p>What will be the process and logistics of invitations going out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300004#K01000"><p>I suggest that in the normal course of inviting witnesses to the Committee of Public Accounts we deal with Ms Kerins and the group of people we mentioned.  However, because of what is happening we should also ensure letters go directly to all the individuals concerned because we cannot rely on the information being passed on to them.  We do not even know if Mr. Flannery was notified of the last meeting.  To avoid all that for the future we will issue the invitation to Ms Kerins and then to the individuals concerned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300004#K01100"><p>We have an e-mail from Mr. Flannery, which came in on 12 March and a response has gone back to him.  His e-mail indicates that he awaits an invitation from the committee.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300004#K01200"><p>We agreed the date of the meeting this morning and he will get the invitation.  We relied on the usual committee procedure for issuing these invitations and we made it specifically clear to Ms Kerins, by telephone to her office, that it was the wish of the committee that Mr. Flannery, the remuneration committee and the chairman accompany her on the last occasion.</p> <p>That was completely ignored.  In the interests of absolutely clarity the same invitation will issue to Ms Kerins and the Rehab Group and we will also issue an invitation to the individuals concerned so there is no ambiguity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300005#L00200"><p>The response we received from Rehab is incomplete and does not deal with many of the points.  The level of public funds being spent is &euro;83 million.  RehabCare and the National Learning Network are its two main companies which function in Ireland and they receive almost 95% of their funding from the State.  The public is entitled to know the precise details from Rehab and all interested parties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300005#L00300"><p>Deputy O'Donnell raised an issue on SOLAS and mentioned two thirds of the funding.</p></speech>

All of these points can be clarified.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300005#L00600"><p>My point was with regard to the level of salaries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300005#L00700"><p>With regard to the correspondence we received on Rehab I am pleased we will invite it back on 12 April.  We are dealing with the issue of pensions, but I will not personalise it as it applies across the board in Rehab.  A letter received by the committee states that under the Data Protection Acts 1998 to 2003 without the consent of the individuals referred to pension details cannot be disclosed to the committee or any other body.  The HSE and State organisations are putting more than &euro;83 million into an organisation, but the HSE states in writing today it is not in a position to disclose a detailed breakdown of the cost of pensions for any individual unless the individual agrees to it under the Data Protection Acts.  I am highlighting this as an issue for the Committee of Public Accounts.  Even though the committee brings before it people in public session, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has done a full report, an organisation can receive tens of millions of euro from the taxpayer and the HSE can send a letter quoting the Data Protection Act as the reason it cannot give details of pensions without the consent of the individual.  We must ask ourselves as the Committee of Public Accounts whether we can continue to allow this situation.  A large proportion of taxpayer funds going into any organisation goes on pensions, and we are being told this information will not be disclosed to us, or to the Department providing the money, because of data protection issues.  We need to address this.  I would like us to have a mechanism in place before 12 April whereby the committee can obtain information on pensions, and I am not personalising this as every organisation we deal with has former employees.  This is a new obstacle being put in front of the committee to prevent it from finding out on behalf of the taxpayer the details of where taxpayers' money goes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300005#L00800"><p>For clarification, the meeting is on 10 April.  It is an issue which is a cause of concern and we can deal with it in the context of the recommendations we might make.  We will operate under these guidelines and legislation at our next hearing and this will not change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300005#L00900"><p>This has not been thrown at us before and it is becoming a practice to quote data protection.  It has been quoted at meetings and now it is being quoted in written correspondence.  I am concerned it will be used as a mechanism to stop us finding out information on behalf of taxpayers.</p></speech>

With regard to missing information and the submission we received from Rehab on the coffin venture with Complete Eco Solutions, this week the committee received anonymous correspondence on an invoice from Complete Eco Solutions.  The numbers simply do not tally.  In her letter Ms Kerins stated there was a one-off purchase in 2010 of two containers of coffins and 252 coffins were purchased.  We have an invoice, No. 4016, which one must presume is legitimate, made out to Mr. Michael Horgan, Rehab Enterprises Limited which mentions four 40 ft containers with 132 coffins in each container which amounts to 528 coffins.  Even the very basic information with which Ms Kerins provided us on the coffin venture does not seem to be accurate based on the invoice information we received.</p></speech>

What happened to the rest of the coffins?  Ms Kerins is trying to state Rehab only bought two containers as a one off but there is more than double this on the invoice.

We have been waiting nigh on two weeks for this information.  It is not necessarily informed by the fact Rehab officials could not locate the information; it is more informed by them finding the best way to present it to minimise the damage done to the organisation.</p><p>  I wish to move onto the consultancy work Mr. Flannery did for the organisation.  I stated here two weeks ago, and have repeated it since, that any remuneration for company directors associated with Rehab is expressly prohibited by a provision under the organisation's memorandum and articles of understanding.  According to media reports in recent days, Mr. Flannery was paid for this work through a UK subsidiary or associated organisation of Rehab.  It is important for completeness, and to assist in our discussion with Mr. Flannery if he accedes to our request to meet us on 10 April, to receive information about the company in the UK, how it is structured, who are the directors and it is memorandum and articles of understanding.</p></speech>

Before we move on to the next item I wish to add my voice and agree with Deputy Ross from the beginning, that the information we asked for was relative to our investigation into the spending of public moneys.  I am taken aback by the fact Rehab would not deliver this information in as full and comprehensive a form as possible and allow us get on with our work.  It is doing untold damage itself to the sector it represents by not doing this.  I encourage it, Mr. Flannery and anybody else who comes before us to come with full information, give a complete statement and answer the questions directly.  We did not have a good exchange of information on the last occasion and there was a certain reluctance to answer questions.  Some questions were simply not answered.</p><p>  If we are to complete our analysis of this we need to send a clear message to Rehab and others who come before us that it is far better to co-operate with the committee, deal with the issues which are raised and allow us continue our work.  The decisions made this morning in private session, and dealt with again in public session, are decisions made with the agreement of all members of the committee.  There was no dissenting voice to the invitations to be issued or to how this was to be approached.  It is with the full support of the Committee of Public Accounts we undertake this work.  Ministers and Members of both Houses should take note of this before making public comments.</p><p>  With regard to Mr. Flannery, it is not personal.</p> <p>We have a job to do and ask him for his full co-operation.</p><p> We will now deal with correspondence from individuals.  No. 3B.1 is correspondence received from Mr. William Treacy in regard to issues to do with Horse Racing Ireland and the Turf Club.  The correspondence is to be noted.  </p><p> No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated 2 March 2014, from Mr. Ham Goulding,  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  Mr. Goulding requests that a copy of the forthcoming report by the HSE interim administrator be forwarded to the former CRC board members prior to its release.  That is a matter in the first instance for the director general of the HSE who will receive the report.  We will ensure all witnesses will receive adequate notice of our meeting.  In that regard, all witnesses will have a full opportunity to read the report in advance of our meeting.  We also asked at a previous meeting that Mr. Goulding receive a transcript of the last meeting.  It has been sent to him.</p></speech>

The Chairman will recall that when the then board of the CRC and the HSE came before us, there were a number of missing pieces of correspondence, in particular the minutes of the remuneration committee meetings.  Mr. Goulding was a member of the remuneration committee and the man who had presented the "goodbye" package for Mr. Kiely to the board.  We have still not received the minutes.  I understand he is saying he must consult and take account of the confidentiality agreements, but he gave a very clear commitment on the national airwaves that he would be sending the documentation to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It has been dragging on a little.  We would be very grateful if we could receive the documentation as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It is extremely important that the general public has confidence in the sector.  The staff working in charities are doing fantastic work.

That Department is responsible for the charity sector.  I have received numerous telephone calls from charities telling me that they respect the work of the committee and encouraging it to complete that work, but it is the charitable organisations which are holding up the process.  I agree that the sooner we get to the end of it, the better.  We will be asking the HSE and the organisations involved to put their minds to it and complete the task.  For that reason, Rehab should acknowledge what has happened and is happening, understand the damage that has been done and co-operate fully with the committee.</p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, dated 21 February 2014, received from Mr. John Temple regarding Cluid Housing at College Manor, Dundalk.

Salaries accounted for 37% of gross expenditure.  At the end of the year just under 2,300 whole-time equivalent staff were employed in the Department and its related offices.</p><p>  As well as the administrative costs of the Department, expenditure was incurred on a wide range of services, including legal aid, immigration and asylum, the Probation Service, equality, integration and disability, charities regulation, the Irish youth justice service, the State pathology service, and the Forensic Science Laboratory.  The Vote also includes funding for a range of statutory services operating under the aegis of the Department, including the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p><p>  The committee is also considering today a report which concerns an ongoing project to provide new facilities for the State pathology service and the Dublin coroner's office, which operates under the aegis of Dublin City Council.   The State pathology service has operated since the 1990s from prefabricated accommodation in Marino on a site owned by the city council.  In embarking on the project, the Department acknowledged that the current accommodation lacks the range of facilities required for a modern pathology service.  There were also concerns about the security of the current accommodation, given the sensitivity of the work undertaken by the service and the critical dependence of certain prosecutions on the results of the service's work.  The location and physical condition of the coroner's mortuary and morgue were also considered unsuitable.</p><p>  The Department and the council decided in 2006 that the two services could be accommodated in one new building on the site at Marino.  Jointly, they developed plans for a new medico-legal centre project which included the construction of a new autopsy facility, body storage facility, a mortuary and other related accommodation.  It was agreed that the Department would fund two thirds of the cost of the new centre, with the council to provide the site and the balance of the construction costs.  The council took the lead role in project management, including procurement of the necessary professional services, contractor and so on.</p><p>  In March 2007, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government raised a planning objection relating to the location of the proposed project site adjacent to an important national monument, the 18th century casino at Marino.  It took around a year for the parties to resolve the planning concerns.  A tender competition for the construction project was launched in August 2008 and a contractor identified.  The proposed contract had been based on what was called the Government Departments and local authorities or GDLA form of contract.  However, the Department of Finance had issued new forms of construction contracts in February 2007 which all Government Departments and agencies, including local authorities, were required to use.  The project was re-tendered to use the new form of contract.</p><p>  Following the second public procurement competition, a contract between the council and a builder was signed in June 2010.  Work started on the site in July 2010 on what was expected to be a 13 month build.  The building contractor went into receivership in November 2010, however, leaving a partially completed structure.  Following legal advice, a decision was taken to tender again, this time for completion of the project.  The Department informed the city council in 2012 that it would not have the funding to proceed.  As a result, the project was deferred indefinitely.  The partially constructed premises was demolished in 2013 after deterioration in its physical condition which resulted in it becoming a health and safety hazard.</p><p>  When my report was being completed, the Department, in conjunction with the city council, was examining the feasibility of pursuing a significantly scaled down project using the vacated Whitehall Garda station which is owned by the Office of Public Works.  The net expenditure by the Department and the council on the abandoned project, after recoupment of money under a bond, was &euro;3.3 million with no material benefit from the expenditure accruing to the State.  The State pathology office and Dublin coroner's facilities remain in their existing prefabricated accommodation.  While lack of availability of funding was a key factor in the abandonment of the project, we noted that ample provision was made in the Vote over the life of the project to cover the Department's contribution had the project proceeded in a timely fashion.</p><p>  In light of these findings, and those of an examination of the bridge project which I reported on in the 2011 report, I recommended that the Department should review its project risk assessment procedures to ensure adequate steps are taken to secure necessary planning permissions, and to ensure the prevailing procurement and contracting rules are complied with.   The Accounting Officer will be in a position to update the committee on developments regarding the currently planned relocation of the service's facilities to Whitehall.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300007#N01200"><p>I propose to keep my opening remarks brief in the interest of making best use of members' time.</p><p>  The Justice and Equality Vote covers a wide remit, encompassing both the administrative divisions of the Department and a broad range of offices and agencies across the justice sector.  These areas include immigration, disability and equality services, the Criminal Assets Bureau and newer organisations such as the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  In line with the new programmatic approach, the various strands of the Justice and Equality Vote have been grouped into six separate programmes and details of the breakdown have been provided in briefing to the committee.</p><p>  It is important, given the number of different offices and agencies and the range and breadth of functions carried out, that strong governance arrangements are in place across the Department.  From my perspective, as Accounting Officer, strong oversight is vital to ensure the highest standards of financial control apply and that value for money is obtained from all the expenditure in the Justice and Equality Vote.  It is also important to acknowledge that a number of the Department's offices and agencies have been established on a statutory basis with independent functions, and with specific governance relationships with the Department.  A key feature of the governance structure within the Department is that each office and agency attached to the Justice and Equality Vote, while operating according to its legislative status and its own business plan and objectives, is accountable to the central Department in terms of budgets and expenditure.</p><p>  As far as the financial aspects in particular are concerned, most of these, including financial, payroll and accounting services, are dealt with by the Department's financial shared services centre in Killarney.  The expertise in the centre is supplemented by a financial management unit in the Department located in Dublin.   Representatives from both these areas sit on the justice sector financial management committee.  It meets every month and is chaired by the relevant assistant secretary to oversee financial developments across the justice sector.</p><p>  In my role as Accounting Officer for both the Justice and Equality Vote and the Prisons Vote, I am supported in my task of ensuring there is a strong system of internal controls in place by the Department's audit committee.</p> <p>The committee comprises four external members and one departmental representative.  The chairperson is external to and independent of the Department.  The committee is supported in its work by an internal audit unit which is headed up by the internal auditor, a professional accountant at principal officer level.  The internal auditor works closely with the Department's risk unit in identifying and managing risk.  The internal audit unit comprises four persons, being a combination of both internal and external resources. The unit, through its audit work programme, provides assurance that there are effective financial and other controls in place.  In 2013 there were 29 audit reports completed and the corresponding figure in 2012 was 26.</p><p> Turning specifically to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2012, chapter 9 outlines the position in relation to the State Pathology building project in Marino, Dublin.  This project was a joint venture with Dublin City Council, the aim of which was to develop new facilities at a site in Marino for the Office of the State Pathologist and the Coroner Service in Dublin.  The objective was to relocate these two related operations in one building at a site owned by Dublin City Council.  While it was agreed that the costs of the project would be shared between the Department of Justice and Equality and Dublin City Council - with the Department funding two thirds of the cost and the council funding one third - the council took the lead role in managing the project, including the procurement of contractors, etc.  While the project experienced delays in the early stages due to unforeseen planning and form of contract issues, the build began in July 2010.  Unfortunately, the main contractor went into receivership in November 2010, which halted work on the building.  The receivership gave rise to a number of legal and procurement difficulties, culminating in legal advice to re-tender the project with a view to completing the partially built structure on the Marino site.</p><p> However, in 2011, and following a reduction of up to 30% in the capital budget for the justice Vote group, it became necessary to defer the project again, due to a lack of funding to complete it.  The Department then examined various other options to bring the project to completion, including the use of a public private partnership, PPP, funding model.  However, following professional advice, it was concluded that this was not a viable option, given the specialised and complex nature of the building.  The Department then considered, with Dublin City Council and the Office of Public Works, OPW, whether the State Pathology Office and the Dublin Coroner Service could be jointly relocated to the former Whitehall Garda Station.  Initial examination indicated that this was a viable option, and the Department, the Council and the OPW agreed to progress the project.  The OPW, which is the owner of the Whitehall premises, has agreed to make the building available and to undertake the necessary refurbishment work.</p><p> A project oversight team, chaired by the Department, and comprising senior personnel from Dublin City Council and the OPW, is overseeing the project.  The primary task for the team is to take matters forward to a successful conclusion as efficiently and cost effectively as possible.  Plans have been developed to meet the relevant requirements and they are being taken forward by the OPW.  The costs incurred will be shared by the Department and Dublin City Council.</p><p> I must inform the committee that legal proceedings are ongoing by the Chief State Solicitors Office on behalf of the Department in relation to the lease of accommodation for a Probation Service project in Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin 1.  Therefore, as was the case at my last appearance before the committee, my legal advice remains that any further discussion of or comment on the facts of this matter could prejudice the State's case in the legal proceedings currently under way.  I can confirm that I will, obviously, be happy to discuss this matter at a future date when the case has been concluded.  Aside from this matter, I will go into further detail as the Members require.</p></speech>

As the witnesses will the aware, this committee has been examining the issue of penalty points and fixed-charge penalty notice cancellations for some time.  I think it is fair to say from our own examination of the issue that confidence in the justice system has been badly affected by the administration of the fixed-charge penalty notice system, highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his examination of the issues, and further confirmed, if I may say that, by the report from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate yesterday.  The reason I want to ask the Accounting Officer questions about it is that it was reiterated yesterday in the report from the Garda inspectorate that legitimate revenue has been lost to the State.  Does he accept the criticisms inherent in the Garda inspectorate's report in respect of the operation of the system and the recommendations in their entirety, and how is it proposed, essentially, to fix the system?</p></speech>

However, the State remains without an adequate building in which to house the State Pathology Service and the Dublin coroner's facility.  I note that in his opening statement, Mr. Purcell consistently reiterated the Department's commitment to strong oversight and the highest standards of financial control.  He referred to the Department's risk assessment mechanisms and audit facilities and essentially spoke on how good is the Department with regard to oversight, managing projects and managing its budgets.  However, in the case of the State Pathology Service farrago, this comedy of errors, there is no evidence to suggest, at least between 2006 and 2011 or 2012, that any of these traits were in evidence.  In his contribution earlier, the Comptroller and Auditor General went through in chronological order the series of events that led to this impasse and to a point at which considerable sums of taxpayers' money were spent on a project from which no benefit is being derived and that has lost well in excess of &euro;3 million for the taxpayer, notwithstanding the fact that in each year from 2006 to 2011 or 2012, the Estimates of the Department provided resources for this facility to be developed.</p><p>  I am seriously concerned about the lack of oversight the Department had in respect of this project.  It is clearly that from an investment point of view, Dublin City Council managed the project and invested one third of the resources into it, with the Department investing two thirds.  From the documentation I read arising from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it appears there was no single overarching document that detailed clearly who was responsible for what in respect of managing this project.  In itself, that constitutes a serious indictment of the Department and of Dublin City Council and may have led to the current situation, whereby the service now will be developed at the vacated Whitehall Garda station.  I simply am not convinced that any proper oversight was involved in this particular project and there is no evidence to suggest it was.  The project first moved from concept, that is, from the page to the stage as such in 2006.  It went out for public tender in 2007 at one stage but then had to go out for public tender again because the Department was not conforming with the 2007 framework instituted by the Department of Finance.  The Department claims it was not foreseeable that an objection might arise from anyone, even though this particular site was located right next to a national monument, namely, the Casino at Marino.  One would not need to be an expert to anticipate that the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as the line Department, would have had a view in this regard.  This clearly delayed the project, as did the fact that the original developer went into receivership at that point.  I accept this could not have been foreseen but why, for example, was the second firm on the panel not engaged to complete this project?  This has been a complete waste of money, there still is no facility, and this highly sensitive operation, the State Pathology Service, still is being carried out in prefabs in Marino.</p></speech>

The issues did not relate so much to the project but the broader historic and archaeological landscape around the casino.  They could only be resolved between Dublin City Council and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as they raised issues concerning planning and development for the entire area and not only the site of the new build.  This led to archaeological reports and excavations as well as the development of an archaeological conservation area under section 81 of the planning Act.  The issues went far beyond the nature of the proposed project and, with the benefit of hindsight, it seems the project was the trigger that may have been used to resolve long outstanding issues related to the national monument and its situation in the broader surrounding landscape.</p></speech>

What is the cost of fitting out that building, making sure it is fit for purpose?  We are talking about a building that will store sensitive material, have a mortuary, an autopsy facility and storage for evidence that may be used in court proceedings, and it needs to be essentially hermetically sealed, controlled properly and all that goes with that.  How much will that cost and when will this facility be open?  Is that building fit for purpose or will it need to be extended in future?  What other sites had the Department looked at that would have allowed it to develop something cost effectively, or was this the only site that recommended itself?</p></speech>

Obviously, we are talking about the casino in the meaning of Italian word as opposed to a place one would go to gamble, but it seems the Department might have been better taking the &euro;3.3 million and going to a casino with it because, as the Comptroller and Auditor General's report has clearly stated, &euro;3.3 million was spent and there is no material benefit from that for the taxpayer.  My colleague, Deputy Nash, touched on the issue of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government lodging an objection or a planning concern because of the location beside a national monument.  However, the problems did not end there because after that difficulty was dealt with, when the tender competition was launched in August 2008, another problem arose with another Department raising concerns, and this time it was the Department of Finance objecting to the form of contract used.  Mr. Purcell might explain that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014031300011#R02500"> <p>A contractor was selected in September and permission to proceed was sought from the Department of Finance.  However, in October 2008 that Department objected to the use of the GDLA form of contract and directed that a new form of contract drawn up by the Government construction contracts committee, GCCC, be used.  The new form of contract is focused on fixed price lump sum bids, with risks transferred to the contractor.  This decision obliged the project board to completely revise the tender documentation to comply with the new GCCC contract and required a painstaking and detailed upgrading of all tender documentation and specifications.<br/>The project board used the GDLA form of contract because the relevant paragraph of the circular on construction procurement reform provided that where detailed development tender documentation had already commenced, the GDLA contract could be used.  The project board decided in January 2008 to use that form of contract to avoid incurring considerable additional costs and delay.  The contract notice was placed in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union </i>in April 2008 and in August 2008 tenders were invited from eight pre-qualifying contractors.  However, in February 2008 the Department of Finance issued a new circular on construction procurement reform and the facility to use the GDLA form of contract was withdrawn from early March 2008.  The April contract notice thus missed the deadline by a number of weeks.<br/>As it would not have been possible for the project board to foresee that the provisions of circular 33/06 would change so radically and that permission to use the GDLA form of contract would not be forthcoming, it proceeded as planned.  Having considered the matter, I can understand the decision of the project board to use the GDLA form of contract.  The decision was taken in good faith based on a desire to avoid spending additional money on reworking the project documentation and further expensive delays, and in the belief that it was permissible to do so given that the documentation was in place prior to the introduction of the new contract.  As we now know, this did not prove possible due to the decision taken.</p></speech>

The budget had already been slashed from &euro;865,000 to &euro;307,000 between 2011 and 2012 because of the economic situation in which the country found itself.

The former Irish Ombudsman and now the European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, raised concerns about the safety of children living in direct provision, and she noted the very unsuitable conditions in which they were living.  Considering direct provision has no legislative basis, can Mr. Purcell provide us with an update on the number of people living in direct provision and the cost to the State of that each year?</p></speech>

We now have an average stay of three years and eight months with many spending more than seven years in the system, which is the equivalent of a childhood.  In the meantime, we, as taxpayers, paid &euro;62 million in 2012 to private operators for direct provision.  The firm behind Mosney received &euro;4.1 million and it received &euro;101 million over the ten years between 2002 and 2012.  I welcome a number of initiatives the Department has taken to reduce waiting times through the INIS and improvements to the citizenship process but there needs to be a sense of urgency about this.</p></speech>

I hope he can allay my concerns.  The committee opened a can of worms that needed to be opened in our examination of a number of sections 38 and 39 charitable organisations, although many charities do not fall under these sections.  Will the new structure be able to cope?  I am sure the Chairman and other members are taking inquiries from small charities up and down the country wanting to know how the new structure will work and seeking reassurance that supporting structures will be in place as well.  How many departmental staff will be allocated?  What will be the cost?  What happens if they are overwhelmed?</p></speech>

Did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have anything to do with it?  Have you any comment to make on the charity end of it?</p></speech>

The money we are talking about today is effectively money down the drain.  Mr. Purcell said the project is a product of the time we are in.  Equally, &euro;4 million of taxpayers' money forgone is a product of a time when issues such as this arose owing to a lack of due diligence.  Of the &euro;4.3 million spend, &euro;2.5 million was for consultancy and professional fees.  How did that happen?  Mr. Purcell might elaborate on the spend between 2006 and 2010 of &euro;1.9 million on consultancy fees and &euro;425,000 on professional fees and, in 2011, &euro;123,000 and &euro;41,000, respectively.</p></speech>

The witnesses have indicated the project could not be completed so the funding was not made available.  However, the Department put &euro;4 million of taxpayers' money down the drain.  There should be strategic commercial and financial decision making within Departments, particularly with capital projects.  I can understand the issue with revenue projects.  Capital projects should be considered on a multi-annual basis as distinct from a yearly basis.</p></speech>

As Mr. Purcell will be well aware, the project is significant for Limerick because of its proximity and location within the city.  I welcome the project and thank the Department.</p><p>  I wish to make a final observation.  Perhaps the committee will look at the way capital projects are appraised within Departments.  Clearly this project included advanced technology.  I ask the Departments to look at these projects on a multiannual basis as distinct from a yearly basis.  The project may have become hostage to the way public finances are apportioned and allocated on an annual basis and operated within Departments.</p></speech>

That can enable one to be as flexible as possible with a diminishing capital budget.  A significant level of planning goes into it and the bigger projects, of their nature, must be completed using a multi-annual plan.  The points made by the Deputy are very valid and we will certainly try to take them on board as far as we can.  </p></speech>

I apologise if this has come up previously, but I have a question about the company car and penalty points issue.  The Comptroller and Auditor General examined this issue and his investigation found that the State was losing approximately &euro;1.12 million every year because drivers using company cars were evading their penalties.  The report showed that one company alone had more than 200 unresolved cases.  Many companies responded to the effect that they did not know who was driving the car at the time of the offence.  Almost one quarter of road traffic offences involving a company car during 2011 and 2012 were quashed and almost half were not pursued.  I raised this issue with the Garda Commissioner when he came before this committee recently and asked him why, after ten years, it has still not been resolved.  The problem was first noted in 2002 or 2003 and it has still not been resolved.</p><p>  I understand that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is obviously key in this matter.  I heard a report on radio yesterday which was based on what the Garda inspectorate had reported.  What kind of input does the Department of Justice and Equality have in this situation, where a problem has gone on for so long?  When I asked the question of the Garda Commissioner I found his answer to be unsatisfactory.  I asked him if the legislation that was passed in 2003 was ineffective and if new legislation was needed.  I now understand that further legislation was passed but was not acted upon.  The relevant elements within the legislation have not been dealt with by the responsible Departments.  What role does the Department of Justice and Equality have in this?  Whose has the lead responsibility for this within Government?  In my opinion, there has been a real dearth of leadership on what is a very simple issue.  A problem has been identified, legislated for but not resolved.  We are talking about sizeable amounts of money and I want to know why somebody has not taken this by the scruff of the neck and dealt with it, once and for all.  What role does the Department of Justice and Equality have here?  What does the Department intend to do about it?</p></speech>

Why did it take the Garda inspectorate issuing a recommendation for that to happen?  This has been obvious for ten years.  It has been legislated for twice.  Why does the Department need the Garda inspectorate to tell it something that is already evident?  It is evident to anyone who has looked at it.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General has conducted his investigation and found that very significant amounts of money are being lost to the Exchequer.  Why does it take so long for two Departments and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to get around a table?  Why does it take a Garda inspectorate report to precipitate that?  That question must be asked.  The Public Accounts Committee has to ask that question.  We are now potentially talking about a third tranche of legislation, assuming we amend the 2010 Act, to get this right.  The question must be asked as to how efficient problem solving within our Departments really is, in the face of the company car issue.  Mr. Purcell has answered my question - he has a road map and the group is meeting.  However, even a cursory look at the history of the company car issue would lead one to assert that the Government has failed dismally to deal with it in a reasonable time period.  I do not know if the Comptroller and Auditor General has anything to say on the issue, given that he is the person who came up with these recommendations.</p></speech>

On foot of Mr. Purcell's response to the question, I must address the issue of penalty points in the broad sense.  I have reflected on what has happened in the past couple of years and the processes that have evolved as the penalty points became an issue in the media, the Oireachtas, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department and among the public.  Let me list the reports: we now have a Garda inspectorate's report; we are looking forward to a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission report; Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney's report; countless reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General; and other reviews.  Why has nobody in the Department taken a leadership role and with PULSE technology dealt with infractions that were easy to identify?  The Garda inspectorate has obviously done this.  Why has it taken so long for Government to deal with this issue?  Why was it a case of pushing the problem from desk to desk and passing the buck?  We have ten reports.  The question I pose may not be for the Secretary General directly or the Department of Justice and Equality, but they are involved, but what is the reason for the myriad of reports on an issue that should be reasonably simple to address?  Should there not have been an easier way to deal with this issue?  Why are elements of government in turmoil over something that should have been nipped in the bud if problems, such as those identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General years ago, were addressed?  Why are we now waiting for another report from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission?  Does the Secretary General have a response?</p></speech>

We are not dealing with issues as quickly as we should be, issues are put on the long finger and in some cases this may be up to ten years.  I would add the penalty point saga to that.  I do not think it is necessary for the Minister and the Department of Justice and Equality to refer it to somebody else, I think the Department should deal with it.  In some cases, officials may think that is impossible and the matter should be referred to an independent arbitrator, but the leadership in the Department should deal with issues that the Comptroller and Auditor General has flagged.</p><p>  I put questions to the Commissioner and frankly I could not believe some of the responses because they were so scant.  That is the reason I raised the company car issue.  As I have said, I have come to the conclusion after drilling into the figures that issues, which are simple to explain, are put on the long finger, when there is no need to do that.</p><p>  The Secretary General has answered the question.  In respect of penalty points, company cars and statute barred summonses, there is a distinct lack of action, whether that is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality or of collective Departments.  I think the group should focus on how to respond quickly to issues as they arise and deal with them collectively.</p></speech>

I have been given very clear instructions by the Minister that we have to ensure this group deals with these problems quickly.  If there are resource issues involved, we have to deal with that element.  As I stated, however, I assure the Chairman, members of the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General that they can expect to see progress being made quickly in this area.  I take the Deputy's point which is a valid one.</p></speech>

They look at the entire penalty points saga and ask what is going on and why people cannot simply step in and deal with it.  While Mr. Purcell is correct that the system as a whole works well, it was known for years that the use of discretion was a major factor in the penalty points system, yet the issue was not dealt with appropriately and was left hanging.  We now have four or five reports which clearly point out that the problem with the system has been known about for a long time.  Members of the public believe the matter should have been addressed a long time ago.</p><p>  With the indulgence of the Chairman, I will ask a further question on training, education and development programmes for former prisoners and the reintegration of former prisoners in the community.  One such programme, U-Casadh, is located in Waterford.  How much money is the Probation Service allocating to these organisations?  Does the Department intend to increase funding for these groups?  Do these programmes work and would it be worthwhile investing more money in them?</p></speech>

Given that a study of the programmes in which we are investing &euro;10.3 million has not been conducted in the past ten years, surely we need to analyse them to ascertain how effective they are?  All of these organisations keep track of the people who avail of their programmes and each of them will, therefore, have statistics.

As the witness will be aware Sergeant McCabe appeared before the committee in private session.  In spite of what you say about two per district and so on in terms of your analysis<b>,</b>28% were not paid.  In my opinion that results in a serious loss to the State and as leakage from the State it shows up governance issues in terms of how the whole system was managed.  I will not go into the detail of it but I would not like any comment from this committee meeting to be taken as implying it is not that bad.  I believe it is very serious and I would like to see much more action taken to resolve the matter.  We were talking about delivering summonses or delivering the paper to the offender in person at the end of it.  Is it<b></b>not amazing that courier companies can go to apartments, the most far-flung places and can deliver to individuals and yet we have a problem.  If these summonses and these pieces of paper were not delivered in the private sector they would be bust.  They would not accept the percentages of non-delivery that the Department or those involved in this particular instance seem to accept.  The percentage of non-delivered items of paper in the case of these issues was 11%.  Non-delivery in the transport business is down to 1%.  The Department lags behind in terms of a commercial comparison.  I am aware there are complications but to allow that situation to continue over the years, without dealing with the issue in some way, is an awful reflection on all of those involved in the Departments or whoever else is steering this through.  I would hope Mr. Purcell would take into consideration all of what has happened on this issue recently and get to grips with it rapidly. </p></speech>

They see it in terms of one in five fixed charge notices that are issued do not get acted upon.  Once people start to understand that, they can start gaming the system and try to avoid it.  Fundamentally, that will undermine the acceptance of it.  From a managerial point of view, we have to manage it as a set of processes, but we must always understand the combined effect of it and what it looks like to people from the outside.</p><p> I wish to go back to the point made by Deputy Deasy about why change does not happen.  Change is difficult.  It is hard to make change happen.  Very often it can be easier to get over a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and move on.  That is one of the reasons we have tried to be more explicit about recommendations in recent reports.  We will be coming back, checking, and reporting back to the committee, in a more routine way, on whether or not recommendations made have actually been implemented.  Hopefully that will effectively keep the pressure on to ensure that the change happens.</p></speech>

I am pleased to say I was able to travel at the end of February to Warsaw where I had a very useful exchange with my Polish counterpart, Minister Serafin, across the range of EU issues.  I also met the responsible Minister of State at the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development and raised our concerns about the difficulties three Irish construction companies had experienced as a result of their involvement in Poland's motorway construction programme.  We had a very constructive and productive meeting with my Polish counterpart and are working with companies on the issue.</p><p>  As part of the Government's programme of enhanced engagement with the European Parliament, on 25 February I attended the European Parliament plenary in Strasbourg.  During the visit I met many MEPs to discuss a wide range of issues that mattered to Ireland.  I had a very productive and wide-ranging meeting with Commissioner &Scaron;tefan F&uuml;le to discuss various issues, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and Kosovo, following my visits to or meetings with Ministers from these countries.  Overall, the visit confirmed my belief in the importance of continued engagement with the European Parliament.  It will be vital to ensure early engagement with the new Parliament following the European elections in May.</p><p>  I attended the last General Affairs Council meeting on 11 February in Brussels where we had some preliminary discussions on preparations for the March European Council meeting.  The focus of the discussion was largely on the 2030 climate and energy framework.  The discussions also touched on industrial policy, banking union, the European semester and EU-Africa relations.  The Greek Presidency presented its Presidency programme and there was, as planned, a discussion on a decision to authorise the cultivation of GMO maize.  The General Affairs Council meeting took place shortly after the Swiss referendum on EU migration, an issue on which we had a lengthy exchange.</p><p>  Let me turn to next week's General Affairs Council which will continue the preparatory process for the European Council meeting on 20 and 21 March.  The agenda covers a new Commission initiative on the rule of law mechanism.  We are due to hold a discussion with President Van Rompuy on both the preparations for the European Council and the issue of subsidiarity.  </p><p>  The main item on the agenda next Tuesday is the preparations for the next European Council meeting on 20 and 21 March which comes against the backdrop of the extraordinary meeting of Heads of State and Government last week to discuss the conflict in Ukraine.  We expect this will remain a major focus for leaders next week.  Foreign Affairs Ministers are due to discuss the situation at a meeting next Monday of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels which I will attend on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste.  As the Taoiseach and I spoke at length about the conflict in Ukraine and the Irish and EU position during the pre-European Council debate in the House yesterday, I will not repeat much of what we said.</p> <p>Let me reiterate, however, the Government's condemnation of Russian actions and calls for Moscow to initiate immediate contacts with the government in Kiev.  The European Union has been abundantly clear about its expectations.</p><p> As is usual for the spring European Council, the main focus of deliberations will be on economic issues.  Under the general rubric of growth, competitiveness and jobs, Heads of State and Government will consider the European semester, the Europe 2020 strategy, industrial competitiveness and climate and energy issues.  The European Council will also consider taxation issues and banking union.  The completion of banking union remains a priority for the Government and we want to see agreement reached with the European Parliament on the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM.  The ECOFIN meeting on Tuesday was updated on the Presidency's mandate for the SRM negotiations with the Parliament which continue urgently.  Again, both the Taoiseach and I spoke in detail about all of these issues in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  The committee is already familiar with the European semester process which I am looking forward to discussing in depth on 1 April.</p><p> We are also expecting the discussions at the European Council to lead to the Commission launching a full public consultation process in April on the future of the Europe 2020 strategy.  When the Commission&rsquo;s Secretary General, Catherine Day, met the committee on 23 January, she emphasised the importance of strong stakeholder engagement with this renewal of Europe's post-crisis growth strategy, including from national parliaments.  This is an important issue to which I am sure we will return in the period ahead.</p><p> Separate to the European Council preparations, the General Affairs Council's agenda includes an item on a Presidency synthesis report, essentially a compilation of the outcomes of discussion on different Council formations of the semester and particularly the annual growth survey.  Significant discussion of the report is not expected next Tuesday.</p><p> As I said in the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Government has been very active in preparing for the discussion on industrial competitiveness at the European Council.  We are expecting a productive discussion on the issue next week.  In our view, creating the right conditions for internationally competitive manufacturing companies, including linkages with bundles services, will be an important feature of a successful European recovery.</p><p> The European Council will hold a first policy debate on the climate change and energy framework for 2030.  Discussion will be on the basis of the Commission communication issued in January.  The debate will, of course, be followed closely at a wider international level owing to the importance of EU engagement and influence in the international climate process.  In the first place, the communication is a basis for a timely policy debate on the next phase towards the European Union's objective of transitioning to a competitive, low-carbon European economy by 2050.  Ireland recognises the benefits of increasing the share of renewable energy in our fuel mix, both from the economic and environmental perspectives.  The issue requires careful consideration, however, in terms of both the challenges and the opportunities in a global transition to a low-carbon future.  Both ambition and flexibility are important features of the package, but we must also reach an outcome that is sustainable for the European Union, as well as for individual member states, on environmental, economic and competitiveness grounds.  Since the last General Affairs Council, intense work has been ongoing in various Council formations on the climate change and energy framework.  It is clear from these discussions that many member states believe more clarity is required around the analysis, process and implications of the proposed headline EU targets for member states.  Ireland shares this view.  The European Council will also discuss completion of the internal energy market by 2014, developing gas and electricity interconnections and the importance of moderating energy costs.</p><p> As I told the committee last month, Ireland welcomes the proposal in the communication to examine and pursue the most appropriate climate policy approach to agriculture and land use.  This is an important development from Ireland's perspective.  We believe a coherent and cost-effective approach to the parallel priorities of sustainable food production and climate change is fundamental to a realistic way forward at national, EU and wider international level under the UN convention.  In anticipation of a new international climate treaty in 2015, we look forward to early development of this strand of the 2030 framework.</p><p> In addition to the situation in Ukraine, Heads of State and Government will also consider external relations issues, including the fourth EU-Africa summit in Brussels on 2 and 3 April.  The summit which will be attended by the Taoiseach provides an opportunity to look at how we can move the EU-Africa relationship from an aid-based one to one based on trade and investment.  It also presents a good occasion for Ireland to meet some of the leaders of key countries in Africa to build on our existing strong relationships and explore new opportunities for engagement.  Our relations with African countries are becoming more multifaceted, encompassing political, economic and development co-operation aspects.  Exchanges in areas such as trade, investment and people-to-people links will continue to increase.  Ireland has developed expertise in the area of sustainable and inclusive growth specifically around the issue of agriculture and food security.  This will form the basis of Ireland's intervention at the summit and is an area which also complements the priorities of the African Union which has identified agriculture and food security as its key focus for 2014, the tenth anniversary of the comprehensive Africa agriculture development programme.</p><p> The agenda for the General Affairs Council also includes a European Commission communication on the rule of law which was published yesterday.  As member states will not have had an opportunity to fully consider the communication, a substantive discussion on the initiative is not expected.  During our Presidency of the European Union in 2013 Ireland initiated a debate at the Justice and Home Affairs Council about protecting fundamental rights and enhancing the rule of law as a means of tackling the growth in hate crime, xenophobia and other forms of extreme intolerance across EU member states.  The need for a method to better protect the values on which the European Union is based was also the subject of a joint letter in 2013 from the Foreign Ministers of Denmark, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands EU Presidency.  Following a discussion of both the letter and the Irish initiative at the General Affairs Council last year, the Commission undertook to produce this communication which we will, of course, be examining in detail.</p><p> Subsidiarity is, I know, of great interest to the committee and has been raised with me here on many occasions.  At next week's General Affairs Council there will be an informal debate over lunch with the European Council President, Mr. Van Rompuy, on the question of subsidiarity.  A Presidency paper has been prepared setting out the issues involved.  The issue has been the subject of some discussion at European level in recent months, following the publication of a review by the Dutch Government last summer.  It has also been raised in the context of the British Government's ongoing balance of competencies exercise.  Several ideas have been presented as to how the institutions and member states might look at ensuring the principle, as set out in the treaties, is respected.  It is the Presidency's intention on this occasion to allow the Council to discuss some of these ideas at greater length.</p><p> National parliaments have an important part to play in safeguarding the subsidiarity principle.  The issue has been the subject of discussion between national parliaments for some time, including at COSAC, the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the European Union, and I will be interested to hear the committee&rsquo;s comments and reflections in due course.  In discussing the issue it is important to affirm, first, what the principle of subsidiarity means and, equally, what it does not mean.  As laid down in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, the principle affirms that the European Union should act &ldquo;only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states ... but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level&rdquo;.</p> <p>So subsidiarity is not a question of limiting EU competences or avoiding EU legislation, but of ensuring that, within the EU, initiatives are taken at the right level.  It is not about more Europe or less Europe, but better Europe.  The enforcement of this principle plays an important role in ensuring the efficacy of the legislative system.  At the forthcoming GAC discussion, I will emphasise Ireland's support for constructive measures which aim to strengthen Europe's capacity to enforce the principle within the framework of the current treaties.  We have already welcomed the Commission's commitment to a smart regulation agenda, evident in its use of roadmaps, impact assessments and, most recently, the development of the regulatory fitness, REFIT, programme.</p><p> In common with other member states, we would like to see these initiatives further developed and built on by the Commission, with greater scope afforded to national parliaments to present their opinions and concerns early in the process.  We recognise, as I said, the role national parliaments have in ensuring compliance with subsidiarity, as set down in the Lisbon treaty.  Measures which support parliaments in making full use of their treaty powers warrant consideration, whether through a deepening of co-ordination, for example at COSAC, or through enhanced engagement with the European Parliament.  There is merit in the suggestion that commissioners should appear more often before national parliaments and that Commission experts should be available for technical briefings, not least in connection with the European semester.  A well-functioning and independent European Commission is essential to the future of the Union.</p><p> It is important that the Commission be accountable, and greater use of impact assessments, sunset clauses and engagement with national parliaments will contribute to this.  However, we share the view of many member states that, in improving our subsidiarity checks, we should be careful not to impinge on the Commission's independence or right of initiative, a point I will repeat at the GAC discussions.  I hope this has given the committee members a reasonable overview of the many discussions of next week.  As ever, I look forward to their questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.543" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014031300005#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the very comprehensive overview.  It does not give rise to many questions because he has covered all the areas and explained what he will do.  I welcome the fact that he had a meeting with Mr. Kurt Bassuener of the democratisation policy council in Bosnia.  In a paper he recently produced, he said: "Even if the protest movement dissipates, the deep social frustrations that underlie it will continue to simmer and eventually find another outlet &ndash; with the potential for violence which could be diverted ethnically."  I am sure when he met the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, he said all is not well and Bosnia is not functioning as a normal society and there is considerable violence, trouble and strikes.</p><p>  The goal is that it would function properly.  Mr. Bassuener's contention is that EU policy to date is not succeeding there in that the carrot of enlargement and the prospect of joining the EU is inadequate and is not functioning satisfactorily.  He argues that there needs to be a change of direction in policy, maybe a much more straightforward, direct language from the EU to Bosnia, in the mode of what must be said to Russia about Ukraine.  When the Minister of State responds later, I would be interested if he would respond to that contention that the EU strategy on Bosnia is failing, as evidenced by the reality on the ground, and that a change of tack is necessary.  Does the Minister of State agree that a change of tack is necessary?  If so, what precise form should that take?  Does he agree with the analysis Mr. Bassuener states publicly in papers and which he, presumably, put to the Minister of State privately as well?</p><p>  I welcome the Minister of State's statement that he will work on behalf of our Government and people on banking union.  That is of great interest to all of us in this country and I applaud it and concur with it.  I would like to hear the Minister of State say that he will continue to pursue the retrospective separation of sovereign and banking debt for this country.  Hard-pressed taxpayers, people who are in a difficult place and are collectively referred to as the "coping classes", have put a lot of their money into bailing out the banks with great pain.  Ireland was a pilot scheme in that respect and should not be retrospectively victimised.  We should be put on a level playing field.  There have been commitments in this regard at the highest level and I recently heard the Minister of State speaking about this in the national media.</p><p>  I would like to hear that it remains a top priority and that the Minister of State will try to advance it in the context of this meeting.  I would like the Minister of State to enlighten us on how he feels he is getting on with that and where he sees it going from here.  The eyes and ears of the whole country are waiting on that issue.  Given our history, there is considerable interest in the Bosnia question too.  Whether or not there is a mass interest in it, there is objective merit in pursuing it properly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.544" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014031300005#D00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials, together with his comprehensive presentation.  In addition to what the previous speaker said, I understand the Minister of State met the Commissioner for enlargement, Mr. Stefan F&uuml;le.  Could the Minister of State talk us through his views a little more?  Deputy O'Reilly has outlined the views coming from the democratic policy council and Mr. Bassuener, which I agree with in principle.  There seems to be a view that the carrot of enlargement or membership of the EU is not enough and maybe the interaction at European level needs to be broader than just examining the enlargement opportunity.  It appears that the structured dialogue approach which the Commissioner has undertaken, in the views of some in that region, would "just pile new failure upon a three-year history of counterproductive policy."  That is a rather strong statement, but it is a view that is emanating.  Could the Minister of State tell us a little more of what the Commissioner has been saying?  It is clear that there is deep concern and the achievements that have already been made are starting to be undermined and we are facing into a period of considerable unrest.  The T&aacute;naiste talked about that back when Ireland held its Presidency.  We have a role to play there.  Could the Minister of State talk that through a little more?</p><p>  I imagine the Ukrainian situation is front and centre in the discussions and will occupy most of the time.  It is an emerging and changing landscape so it is probably difficult to set out today the nature of the discussion.  It will depend on how things ramp up.</p> <p> With regard to Ireland's role, I support the T&aacute;naiste's engagement with the Russian ambassador to this country.  Has consideration been given by the Government to the non-attendance of its representative, namely, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, at the St. Patrick's Day festivities in Moscow in the next few days?  While the T&aacute;naiste started out correctly in taking a broad European approach by engaging with the ambassador, for us to be seen to be doing our own bidding on the side sends the wrong message.  This is one of the most serious issues to befall Europe for some time and it will take strong diplomacy by all states.  We are in a strong position as a neutral country to lead the diplomatic charge and would have the respect of all sides in that regard.  However, we will undermine our own position by taking part in the St. Patrick's Day festivities considering what has happened in Ukraine in recent months and, more particularly, the approach taken by the Russians on the Crimean Peninsula.</p><p> The Minister of State and I have locked horns previously in the banking debate and I am sure we will have an opportunity to do so again.  While it is important and an issue the Government needs to continue to raise, some positive statements emanated from the EPP congress which was held in Dublin and during which I am sure the Minister had a central role.  We often hear positive statements on the margins of various meetings or political grouping interactions, but we do not see the hard movement that is important.  Will the Minister of State update us on the status of banking union because it seems to be the prerequisite for all of this to happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.546" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014031300006#E00200"><p>I refer to the sad decision by Switzerland to restrict the movement of people within Europe.  What have been the repercussions of this decision to date?  I understand the country has lost senior education positions within the European Union, but what penalties has it suffered?  What are the implications for Swiss nationals in Europe?</p><p>  I welcome the debate on Africa and Europe.  It is wonderful that we have moved so far from the black baby box to support African children to recognising that the continent has come of age with major economic development and growth in certain areas.  As a member of another joint committee, I have listened to ambassadors from Africa argue in favour of the development of trade as a mechanism to empower them to address poverty issues.  We are trying to alleviate poverty in Europe through jobs and competitiveness.</p><p>  With regard to the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, visiting Russia to attend St. Patrick's Day festivities, I applaud the Government's decision to pick the most uniquely suited Minister to travel to the country.  He is a level headed, competent barrister who has been well briefed by the T&aacute;naiste.  The Government could not have chosen a better person to represent Ireland in Russia on St. Patrick's Day.</p><p>  The Russian ambassador appeared before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday.  I have three questions regarding the situation in Ukraine.  The Minister of State has said he has had talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and Kosovo.  The Russians claim the legitimacy afforded to Kosovo is the same as that they are demanding for Crimea.  Will the Minister of State comment on that claim?  The Russians argue, on foot of the release of a recording of a conversation between the Estonian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Catherine Ashton in which he suggests the sniper bullets were used from the same weaponry, that this is proof that the snipers who killed people in Ukraine were from the right-wing parties in the country.  The interim government intends to hold a presidential election on 23 May.  The Russians claim this is an illegal government which cannot make this decision, but they will abide by it if the election is held later in the year, presumably around September.  Ukraine, funnily enough, tends to have elections in the middle of winter, as I have attended a few of them.  What are the potential difficulties confronting the holding of elections, given the conflict in Crimea, the Russians' refusal to recognise the interim government and their argument that the elections should be held as part of the natural progression in September or October as opposed to having a "rushed" election under "an illegal regime"?</p></speech>

I do not doubt his credentials.  My comment was related to the symbolism of Ireland's participation in a celebration of Irishness at a time when the host was taking an aggressive position on the Crimean Peninsula.  I mentioned the Minister of State because he was the person travelling.  I do not doubt his qualities and hugely respect him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.548" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014031300006#E00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  He was in my constituency earlier while I was representing his interests in his constituency in his absence and I hope we were both successful.</p><p>  On the previous issue, the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, is well placed to be a positive influence during his visit to Russia and I have no doubt that he will reinforce the issues raised at the other committee meeting yesterday to good effect.  It is important that this be done on a regular basis.</p><p>  With regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina, it was well known for many years that the situation in the western Balkans was going to be a difficult issue to deal with comprehensively, satisfactorily and successfully and that it could not be dealt with through standard enlargement negotiations.</p> <p>The recent street violence in the region is enough to indicate that it is time for the European Union in general to focus on the issues involved, to try to deal with them in a more expeditious way and to address the issues and concerns that are obviously now uppermost in the minds of the people.  Civil unrest in a situation that is volatile, to say the least, is something that can bring all of the effort to date to nil.</p><p> Let us reflect on the war in Bosnia.  Much tearing of hair, beating of breasts and shedding of crocodile tears took place throughout Europe and the free world while the free world tied its hands behind its back, looked on and did nothing about it.  I recognise the Minister of State is focused on this area and I hope he will convey to the European Commission and his colleagues the importance of focusing on the issue once again.  It will not go away by itself and it will not melt.  It requires ongoing treatment, as is the case in all similar situations throughout the globe where there has been a history of political division, doubt, prejudice and, sometimes, hatred.  Add to this situation all the ingredients with which we are familiar in this country and it becomes a recipe for disaster.</p><p> I have some concerns about climate change and energy.  I am somewhat confused about where Europe is going with energy and the generation of electricity using non-fossil fuels.  We know that the Union has changed its targets in this area in recent times.  However, it has not been explained to us in any great detail the reason for the change of targets or the reason for the shift from wind energy to other sources of energy.  I reckon I might know the answer but I am keen to have it explained by those who make the decisions.  They should recognise that we in this country have had a debate on the issue for some considerable time and we thought we had the answers heretofore.  If the Commission moves away from what it has already committed to, it can leave individual member states in particular situations isolated on the shore.</p><p> I have no wish to comment in detail on EU Africa relations, save to say it is a good thing.  However, the Minister of State should be careful and watchful in the area of trade versus aid.  Several countries have placed one against the other - trade for aid -and the combination has been of dubious benefit to the people for whom it was intended.  We need to consider this carefully.  Some countries are benefiting to a far greater extent than those who give aid without any conditions and the European Union should keep an eye on this.</p><p> I raised the matter of genetically modified organisms and maize at the last meeting.  I am pleased to see that it is featuring in discussions.  These may have implications for this country and we need ongoing reassurance in this area.</p><p> I will try to come to a quick conclusion on Ukraine.  It was interesting to listen to the Russian ambassador.  We have had previous discussions with the Ukrainian ambassador and several other people.  There is a difference of opinion about how things should happen in such situations.  However, there is a certain similarity between the way the situation is unfolding in Ukraine and the situation that unfolded previously in the Western Balkans.  There is a possibility that when unilateral action is taken nothing else can happen of a remedial nature to address the political, social and economic issues that arise.  There are implications for everyone in the region politically, economically and diplomatically if the current conflict is allowed to continue.  The European Union must be more insistent - I realise that word carries a certain amount of doubt - in asserting recognition of the rule of law.  In other words, it is not a good idea for a neighbouring country in one way or another to superimpose its authority on an adjoining country within or outside Europe Union and it will lead to a serious problem for all of us in the event of things progressing in that direction.</p><p> My final point is something I have referred to many times before and I believe the European Union must address this issue.  There is evidence to suggest that some member states within the Union look outside the Union or seek to have a preference for a looser arrangement with it.  There are several countries to which this applies.  I have no wish to go through the list but they are well known at this stage.  As far as I can see, if that trend is allowed to continue indefinitely, if it remains in place and is not answered or addressed and if nothing is done to change the emphasis then, ultimately, it will lead to a lesser European entity in future.  Individual member states and those with an association outside the Union will feel free to travel in their own way gaining benefit from having access to membership with none of the responsibilities involved in being part and parcel of the inner sanctum of the European Union.  I am sorry for going on for so long but I had indicated at the beginning of the meeting and unfortunately you did not see me.  It is not that I have diminished to that extent in the course of time, I hope.</p></speech>

I will finish up with some brief questions.  I realise you have many questions before you, Minister of State.  However, will you flesh out a little the rule of law initiative and how you see that proceeding?  Reference was made, as is often the case, to working within current treaties.  Will you give your assessment of the broader European view?  Is there a shared position within the European Union to the effect that progressing within the current treaty structure is the way Europe should proceed for the foreseeable future or the near future?</p><p>  I was in the Chamber yesterday when you addressed the House on the Ukraine issue, as did the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  There seemed to be broad agreement between all parties.  Anyway, does the situation in Ukraine show up once again how ineffective European foreign affairs policy is?  Has Europe the tools, the unity of purpose or the threat capacity to deal with any issues that occurs outside its borders?  You have a lot of questions so we will give you the floor immediately.</p></speech>

I will go through each of them in turn.  I will start with the questions raised by my colleague Deputy O'Reilly in respect of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The theme was echoed by several others, including Deputy Dooley, Deputy Eric Byrne and Deputy Durkan - all the committee members.  It reflects the broad interest that the committee and the country have in the issue.  It also reflects the size of the Bosnian community here and the circumstances in which our country facilitated their arrival at a time of great difficulty for them, something which did great credit to the then leaders of our country in terms of how they handled it.</p><p>  I was in Sarajevo some weeks before the unrest broke out.  One thing I did in Sarajevo was to organise and speak at a public meeting in the University of Sarajevo at which any students, members of the public or organisations were free and welcome to turn up.  I experienced at first hand at that meeting the serious level of concern that people young, old and in between have regarding the future of their country.  I was, therefore, saddened to see how it was articulated in the riots that the committee members have referred to and the difficulties that arose.</p> <p>Members also referred to the engagement of the European Union with Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There is a view that the focus of the European Union was too preoccupied with the requirement for co-ordinating mechanisms to be set up to allow greater efficiency in dealings between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the European Union.</p><p> When I attended the public event in Sarajevo I met a member of the Jewish community who is not currently permitted to stand for any public office in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  If the European Union is about anything, it is about equality and opportunity for everyone, regardless of ethnicity, religion or community.  This is a demanding objective to which we struggle to aspire and which we do our best to deliver.  It is a core value of the European Union and it is correctly the focus of Mr. Sorensen and the European Council and the Foreign Affairs Council.  </p><p> In light of events, members have questioned whether that position can be developed and if further focus should be given to Bosnia-Herzegovina specifically.  We must acknowledge the role of the EU in the great progress made in the Western Balkans in general.  I refer to the results delivered by the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue, the courage of the people and the leadership of their leaders in Kosovo and Serbia.  I refer to the role of the Government of Croatia in bringing Croatia to full membership of the European Union.  The European Union in this region is delivering results of real worth to the people in the different communities of the Western Balkans.</p><p> Since I was there, the Commissioner has returned to the area at least once.  The violence occurred during the period of that visit.  I refer to the developments resulting from the EU engagement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The structured dialogue is the means by which the EU Commission engages directly with the federal Executive in BIH and this has been broadened to include measures to tackle corruption.  There has been a renewed focus on the issue of economic governance in the country.  More support will be given to the leaders and government to allow them to assist in drawing down EU funding.  We need to recognise the difficulties faced by the people in the communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This has to be reciprocated and matched by leadership and by the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina responding to the European Union's work.  </p><p> We know from our own experience in Ireland that the best response to difficulties are those delivered by the people elected to respond to the difficulties and for whom the European Union cannot be a substitute.  We work with the democratically elected leaders and we need and expect them to continue to demonstrate leadership.</p><p> I refer to points raised by Deputies O'Reilly and Dooley about the proposed banking union.  Negotiations between the Presidency and the European Parliament are currently under way on the nature and funding of the single resolution mechanism.  At last week's ECOFIN meeting a renewed mandate was granted to the Presidency to achieve agreement on this area before the end of the term of the current European Parliament.  Deputy O'Reilly raised the issue of banking debt and I have discussed this issue with Deputy Dooley on many occasions and will continue to do so.  We will continue to pursue all options for dealing with the portion of our national debt created by the need to support the banking system at a very vulnerable time and banking union is an important element.</p><p> I have answered the questions about new developments for the expansion of the structured dialogue and the economic governance and the support for the drawing down of EU funding.  I was asked about the Minister of State, Deputy White's visit to Moscow.  He still plans to travel to Moscow to attend events to support the Irish community there.  The Government has a role in recognising that community and supporting it on an important day being celebrated a long way from home.  His visit will consist of engagements associated with the Irish community and with the embassy.  It is absolutely appropriate that we reach out to Irish communities working all over the world and his visit is undertaken in that spirit.  We will be asserting our view on the situation in Crimea and in Ukraine, as the T&aacute;naiste and this committee expressed to the Russian ambassador.  While making our views clear on the situation in Ukraine, we must do so in an environment in which dialogue is possible.  The Minister of State goes to Moscow in that spirit.  We will make our views clear on developments in Ukraine.</p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne raised the issue of the Swiss vote.  He asked whether there are any consequences of that decision.</p> <p>The answer to that question is "Yes".  I am not aware of the particular point the Deputy made in respect of individuals.  However, there have been consequences in terms of the ability of Switzerland to access and gain support from the Horizon 2020 and Erasmus programmes.  The Government and the General Affairs Council have both stated that it is now up to the relevant Swiss bodies to decide how they will respond to the referendum.  I understand that the framework the Swiss have for doing this spans three years.  What we will do is emphasise now that any action which impacts on a core European value, namely, freedom of movement, will be the subject of substantial consequences.  However, we must wait to see what action will be taken within Switzerland in response to the vote by its people.</p><p> I completely agree with the point to the effect that it is important for the relationship between Africa and the EU to develop and broaden.  I would make the point - this struck me as I was making my opening contribution - that while I believe it is extremely important to broaden our relationships, in the context of investment and trade, in the areas to which reference was made, we will also continue to focus on development policy and on the kind of work Ireland, Irish aid, volunteers and NGOs do very well.  We should also focus on the trade and investment agenda, recognising the fact that the leaders of many African states want to engage at that level and their ambassadors have indicated as much.  In view of the developments across the continent of Africa - the phrase "African renaissance" has been used in this regard - there is a need for a changed relationship.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, and the T&aacute;naiste are leading the work relating to this matter and are well aware of what is required.</p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne also raised a number of points in respect of the situation in Ukraine and I will respond to each of them in turn.  There are no parallels between what happened in Kosovo and the situation in Crimea.  What we believe should happen is that people should independently make their own decisions with regard to the future of their communities and the parts of the country in which they live.  This should be done in a manner that is consistent with the law of their country and with broader international law.  What is taking place in Crimea does not meet either requirement.  In other words, it is not consistent with international or Ukrainian law.  I need hardly state that the developments and events which took place in the region prior to this vote also show how very different it is to other countries and regions in the western Balkans and the way these have developed in the recent past.</p><p> On the activities of snipers and the origin of the ammunition used to murder people, I do not wish to comment on the details involved.  However, I welcome the fact that an impartial independent investigation will be carried out into this and related matters.  As I have stated on previous occasions, we have always believed that restraint must be demonstrated by everybody and that there is a greater responsibility on those who are in government and who control police and armed forces to exercise particular restraint in terms of how the latter are used.  We welcome the fact that an independent investigation will take place in respect of some of the matters to which reference was made.</p><p> The Deputy also referred to the holding of elections.  Of course, these are taking place within a country - this could also be said for the wider region - that is very volatile at present.  We are of the opinion that the only way inclusive political arrangements can be put in place is through the holding of elections in the first instance.  It is clear that there is a diversity of views within Ukraine and I need hardly tell the Deputy that the ballot box is the best way to resolve matters.</p><p> Deputy Durkan referred to Bosnia-Herzegovina and climate change.  I have already touched on the former.  In the context of the latter, the key point of difference - as has been the case in the past - is that while binding targets remain in place across the EU, member states are meant to have greater flexibility in the context of how they deliver their share of a binding EU-wide target.  That is why the Government has been placing particular emphasis on the very large agricultural component of our economy, on our future plans for our national herd and on how our land use generates certain things which, for us, must be recognised in these national plans.</p><p> I have also already touched on the point the Deputy made in respect of trade.  He is aware of the decision made in respect of GMO maize at the General Affairs Council's previous meeting.  I voted against the proposal which was on the table at that point.</p><p> The Vice Chairman referred to the rule of law.  The initiative in this regard involves putting in place an instrument which will be as strong but not as hugely powerful as other such instruments which currently hold sway, to deal with issues relating to freedom of the press, the independence of institutions and free speech.  The initiative relates to issues as diverse as xenophobia, the growth in hate crime and extreme intolerance.  There are worrying signs that the latter is prevalent in small portions of the European Union and that it is arising in the context of political debate taking place at present.  The initiative in question emanates from the Commission and is a response to the difficulty to which I refer.  It was published yesterday and will be the subject of some initial debate at next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council.</p><p> On current treaties and whether this is an issue which is shared by everybody, different countries have different views.  Many countries share our view that the existing treaties offer the tools required to deal with many of the political issues arising at present.  I re-emphasise my own view that many of the political difficulties which have arisen are a consequence of the economic crisis.  I remain of the opinion that we should continue to invest our energies in dealing with that crisis in the first instance.</p><p> The Vice Chairman's final point was about whether the difficulties in Ukraine demonstrate the ineffectiveness of European Union foreign policy.  The European Union only has at its disposal the competences which member states choose to give it.  We should not be criticising the European Union in the context of powers and competences it does not possess and which member states decided not to give it.  The European Union put forward the association agreement with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine and both Georgia and Moldova signed it.  If one considers the efficacy and strength of the European Union's foreign policy and the instruments available in that regard at present, one will discover that an example of the strong successes it has enjoyed is the agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.  Until recently, many commentators thought such an agreement would be exceptionally difficult to achieve.  Another example in this regard is the rule the EU is currently playing in the negotiations taking place in respect of Iran in the context of weapons, etc.  There continue to be difficulties but High Representative Ashton is playing an exceptionally prominent role in respect of that matter.  I am certain that the European Union - in the context of next week's meetings of the General Affairs Council and the Foreign Affairs Council - will continue to demonstrate that using the tools member states have made available it can continue to play a strong and positive role in dealing with the difficulties in Ukraine.</p></speech>

With the tools at its disposal, from an economic point of view, it has put in place a support programme of &euro;12 billion - admittedly it has been done in conjunction with other international bodies - to support the stabilisation of Ukraine.  It has already made it clear that it will suspend future visa arrangements with Russia in response to what has happened in Ukraine, but it has also made it clear that it will take further steps in terms of what could happen.  We must hope that what could happen does not happen, that a good agreement can be reached to resolve the current difficulties in Ukraine and Crimea.  The tools are in place and use has been made of them and more use could be made of them in the coming period.</p><p>  On Deputy Bernard Durkan's question on the neighbourhood policy, I point to the strong and prominent role the European Union is playing in Serbia and Kosovo.  In any evaluation of the Union's success we should remember two aspects, namely, the positive role it is playing in these two countries and that anything it does must be matched by leadership in the countries in which we are operating.</p></speech>

We saw what happened in Armenia and there were telltale signs way back that there would be a rough ride ahead for Ukraine.  Nobody seemed to notice Armenia and its reasons for opting out of the eastern partnership programme.  The former Soviet states of Albania and Moldova, in particular, will be feeling very insecure as a result of what is happening.  Will the Minister of State assure me that the Europe Union is consciously boosting their morale, investing in and working alongside them in a more intensive way, given the ramifications of what is happening in Ukraine?</p></speech>

If he was referring to my contribution, I apologise if I made such an omission and he should allow me to rectify the matter now.  I emphasise the Government's view that the upcoming referendum is illegal; that the actions we believe have been taken by Russia should not have happened; and that there is a strong need which has been articulated by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste for a peaceful resolution of the difficulties.  We have been very consistent of and strong on this point for many months and will continue to adopt this role at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday and the European Council next week.</p><p>  On Deputy Eric Bryne's specific point on the neighbourhood policy and the situation in Moldova and Albania, I assure him that Moldova will be the subject of discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday.  The point he has made is correct, namely, that we also need to recognise the countries that signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement - Moldova and Georgia.  In the context of what is happening within their neighbourhood, we need to ensure they receive the support they need.  This will be the subject of discussion at the meeting on Monday.  I have met representatives of the Moldovan Government and I am very much aware of their concerns.  A good articulation of our interest and support for Albania is that I understand the members of the committee will be travelling there.  Am I correct?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Chairman's ongoing support and the support of the committee for the public consultation process that we are undertaking with regard to suicide prevention.  I also welcome the witnesses this morning.  I do not intend to say a great deal about the paper being presented.  I would prefer to listen to the comments and opinions of the witnesses.  Some clarifications have been offered in the opening statements of some of the witnesses.  These clarifications have been noted and will be incorporated into the report in due course.</p><p>  The committee will note that I have circulated new hard copies of the paper.  There have been one or two minor changes.  It was pointed out to me that the intention of the paper may not be 100% clear.  Therefore, I added one or two minor changes in the interests of achieving greater clarity.  The document downloaded and circulated to members previously is almost identical, although not quite, to the hard copy before members this morning.  For example, the signposts for conversations within the paper might best be approached as if they were a series of questions.  Instead of being thought of as recommendations, it might be better to consider asking the question, "What if we were to..." followed by the signposts.</p><p>  I will detail something of my background for information.  I am the health spokesperson for the Labour Party in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Previously, I worked for 28 years as a psychiatric nurse in the Irish and United Kingdom mental health services, mainly in the area of acute mental health.  I was appointed as committee rapporteur.  I decided to approach the project in a manner that might not immediately suggest itself.  Some might have thought that a good place to start would have been to hold discussions with the Department, the National Office for Suicide Prevention or the main agencies working in the area.  However, I decided to pursue a different path.  Instead, I sought the opinion of members of the public in the first instance, including people who have been affected by or who have an interest in the area.  Having done that, I decided I would bring the concerns to the attention of the main stakeholding organisations.  This is how we find ourselves at this meeting this morning.</p><p>  I held public consultation meetings at nine locations through the country.  They were attended by approximately 600 people.  I also met many individuals, groups and organisations.  During the past 12 months I have devoted virtually all my time to the process.  During the course of the public consultation many concerns were raised about the issues of suicide and suicide prevention and I have incorporated those concerns into five main points in the paper.  The first point relates to the effects of the recession.  The point was one of the most frequently raised topics from the public.  Points 2 to 5, inclusive, were raised frequently as well.  I do not believe any member of the public used the actual words that I have used in the report.  For example, no one said to me that we need to reconfigure the policy formulation and delivery apparatus.  The point set out in conversation five uses my words but they contain the ideas of the members of the public with whom I consulted.  In attempting to bring together the various points I formulated them in the manner apparent in the document.  To expand on the points and create a conversation around them I laid them out in the manner apparent in the paper.  While the writing is mine, the ideas are not.  I could have laid out the five points for discussion as a series of questions from one through to five.  However, to create a conversation around the points and achieve a level of engagement with stakeholders I decided to put forward some ideas about how they might be addressed.</p><p>  I am pleased to note a divergence of opinion among the stakeholders with regard to the paper.  That is the point of the exercise.  I look forward to hearing the opinions of the committee.  I remind the witnesses that this is not a final report.  These are the opinions and comments that I have gathered from members of the public and they have been formally brought before the committee and the witnesses.  Following today's hearings, I intend to move onto the next phase of public consultation, which will involve engagement with the stakeholder organisations at former level.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.584" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ella Arensman" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014031300003#C00900"> <p>It co-ordinates 22 research projects in the area of suicide, self-harm and related mental health issues, including one on the evaluation of interventions and suicide prevention programmes.  One of the major projects is the national registry of deliberate self-harm.  It is unique for Ireland to manage such a national system.  It is funded by the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP.  The NSRF works in partnership with the NOSP and other key stakeholders in implementing evidence-informed actions at regional and national levels, for example, the national implementation of dialectical behaviour therapy for people with frequent patterns of repeated self-harm, guidelines for assessment and management of self-harm in emergency departments, restricting access to lethal means and the implementation of guidelines on media reporting of suicide.</p><p> This draft report and the discussion I hope will follow are timely considering that we are this year reviewing the national strategy for action on suicide prevention, Reach Out.  In parallel with this, we are working hard - the NOSP is taking the lead - on preparing the next phase of suicide prevention, that is, a new framework to be launched in autumn.</p><p> I will make a few comments on the section in the draft report on the accuracy of suicide statistics.  It correctly addresses the concerns about the level of accuracy.  Therefore, I support the proposal to conduct a nationally representative survey of coroners' records to establish which deaths might be attributable to suicide but do not meet the legal standard of proof required at inquest.  It is exactly for this reason that, in recent years, the NSRF has piloted the suicide support and information system, SSIS, in Cork city and county, funded by the NOSP.  In the national and international contexts, the SSIS can be considered innovative, as it combines a number of key objectives, for example, facilitation of support for people bereaved by suicide, access to real-time information on the incidence of suicide and associated risk factors and identification of emerging suicide clusters.  One of the key outcomes of the SSIS revealed that the characteristics of people who died prematurely and were classified by a coroner as open verdicts were found to be more similar than dissimilar when compared with confirmed cases of suicide, in particular, their psychosocial and psychiatric characteristics.</p><p> In recent months, the NSRF has also started a review of all external cause of death verdicts in the Dublin region covering the 2011-12 period in close collaboration with Dr. Brian Farrell, the Dublin area coroner.  We are using internationally validated screening criteria to detect probable cases of suicide and are using the review to enhance these criteria further.  This approach could be expanded to coroners' services in other regions in the country.  In line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, WHO, improving national data systems for surveillance of suicide and access to real-time data is fundamental to national suicide prevention strategies.</p><p> I will comment on the report's section on suicide and the economic recession.  It correctly describes the increasing trend of suicide and self-harm, particularly between 2007 and 2012, with as many as 560 extra cases of suicide and an increase in the number of cases of deliberate self-harm to 8,862.  These numbers are based on analysis recently completed by the NSRF and reflect the worrying impact of the recession.  We still do not have a clear indication as to whether the recession is over, if matters have stabilised or so on.</p><p> In addition to these statistical outcomes, the SSIS provides supporting evidence that reflects the impact of the recession.  For example, of 307 suicide cases that we investigated in great depth, 35.8% were unemployed at the time of death and 41.6% had worked in the construction or production sector until they died.  As we know, those work settings were particularly affected by the recession.  We must take a balanced view, however, as the SSIS also found that, of the people who died and were unemployed at the time of death, nearly half had a history of alcohol and-or drug abuse and 42% had a history of self-harm.  This reflects the importance of the interaction of individual risk factors and external contributing factors.</p><p> When we compared Irish trends in suicide with those of neighbouring countries, we found something remarkable.  Most of the five nations in question has seen a strong increase in the rates of suicide and self-harm.  The exception is Scotland, which has not seen a significant increase during the recession.  In fact, it has actually seen a significant decrease in the past 12 years.</p><p> Taking this information into account, I propose that we undertake a comparative study involving experts in suicide research and prevention from the five nations to compare suicide trends, the characteristics of the recession and the austerity measures implemented by the different governments, for example, reduced access to mental health and community services, being unable to afford treatment, losing medical cards and having sickness and disability supports restricted.</p><p> I wish to comment on another important section in the report, that being, mapping and predicting suicide and self-harm using geospatial analysis, which is an innovative approach to this field.  I am pleased to see that the report underlines the importance of using these techniques.  A recommended form of analysis is something called SaTScan, which has been used for more than two decades to map infectious diseases but has never been applied to suicide.  Last year, the NSRF applied this technique for the first time to suicide data obtained through the SSIS and we identified two significant clusters of suicide in the South.  Applying this technique to real-time suicide mortality data from coroners and possibly An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would help us in identifying emerging suicide clusters much sooner than we have been able to do previously.</p><p> This approach has a number of important advantages.  For example, it improves the early identification of clustering of suicide and self-harm and identifies areas with recurrent suicide and self-harm clustering, something that we have not been able to do so far.  We hear about repeated clustering in certain areas through the public and the media, but we have been unable to verify them.  The other advantage would be the ability to identify the area level and individual factors associated with clustering of suicide and self-harm, particularly in repeated patterns.</p><p> I strongly recommend the use of our national registry of self-harm and this technique, given their possible benefits.  In light of the significant and consistent association between trends in non-fatal self-harm and trends in suicide among men in particular, I would also recommend applying the SaTScan to the registry nationally in order to enable the possible prediction of suicide clustering among men in specific areas.</p><p> I will make two brief comments on a pair of sections in the report, the first of which is on the establishment of a national registry of organisations that provide services relating to suicide.  I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of enhancing co-ordination and collaboration among services working in the field of suicide prevention, ensuring best practice and enhancing quality wherever possible.</p> <p>In a highly positive development the National Office for Suicide Prevention is compiling a directory of quality assured services in suicide prevention and the Irish Association of Suicidology and representatives from the University of Ulster are developing guidelines for the accreditation of organisations working in suicide prevention.  This work has been commissioned by the NOSP. </p><p> The final proposal for future action in the report refers to the repositioning and reconfiguring of the National Office for Suicide Prevention at the Department of the Taoiseach and the provision of a dedicated budget for the organisation.  While this proposal requires in-depth and lengthy discussion, my current view is that, in light of the growing insight into suicide and the need for multisectoral partnership and collaboration in suicide prevention nationally, there may be benefits in repositioning the NOSP at the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Department of Health is, without doubt, the key player and stakeholder and should retain its fundamental role in suicide prevention.  Nevertheless, other Departments should take a more prominent role and should be the subject of greater collaboration.  I refer specifically to the Departments of Education and Skills, Justice and Equality, Social Protection, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  A move towards a multisectoral partnership approach would be in line with recommendations issued by the World Health Organisation in the public health area of suicide prevention.  Other benefits of repositioning the National Office for Suicide Prevention at the Department of the Taoiseach include greater autonomy and enhanced political prioritisation of suicide prevention.</p><p> My written submission includes several practical notes providing clarification on certain matters. </p></speech>

It is clear the Senator has invested a significant amount of time and effort in preparing the draft report.  I am of the view that it will make a very useful contribution to the committee's overall contribution to addressing this most serious and distressing subject.  I also thank our guests for their respective contributions.</p><p>  I have a number of brief questions to ask in respect of what we have been told.  There is much to be grappled with in the context of what has been said.  I would like to ask the opinion of Professor Arensman from the National Suicide Research Foundation on a particular matter.  It is stated in the foundation's submission that a survey carried out in respect of the incidence of suicide in Cork city and county and the impact thereon of the recession shows that nearly half of those who were unemployed at time of death had a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse.  Of 307 suicide cases that the foundation investigated in great depth, 35.8% of the individuals involved were unemployed at time of death.  In addition, there were questions as to what might have been underlying contributory factors - in the context of a disposition towards alcohol and/or drug abuse - in 55% of those 307 cases.  The foundation proposes to carry out a further comparative test in conjunction with the authorities on the neighbouring island and across this island.  It has cast this matter in the context of the recession and there is no question that the latter and the difficulties to which it has given rise have been a factor in terms of the incidence of suicide.</p> <p>There is no question in my mind that the recession and the difficulties contingent on it have been a factor in suicide incidence.  I am aware of that in my constituency. </p><p> Is it possible to do an assessment for the years prior to 2007 to ascertain whether the same statistics would hold if alcohol and drug abuse were as prevalent at all times as opposed to in the context of a recession only?  Such an exercise would shine a useful light on that area.  Death by suicide constitutes approximately one sixth of all deaths taken into account in the exercise.  I ask the witnesses to comment.  Could they undertake such an exercise?  Dealing with the situation as we know it is by far the most informative approach.  I am a little puzzled as to the reason our Scottish cousins have been able to make such significant progress in suicide prevention.  Perhaps our guests would comment on that matter also. </p><p> It was very interesting to note the information shared with us on the role of coroners.  This is an area of significant interest to people and not one where any of us would like to present as it generally indicates that a tragedy of close connection may have taken place.  A point was made regarding the compilation of statistics and how we can obtain a more accurate picture.  In previous exchanges in this committee members have all been of the view that the statistics understate the factual position and the position is graver than the statistics suggest.  I do not recall any member taking a contrary view.  Dr. Cullinane is strongly of the opinion that coroners hold the best primary source of statistical and other information in this regard.  What specific steps must be taken to ensure this source is of an appropriate standard, exactitude and reliability?</p><p> On Dr. MacFeely's presentation on the figures from the Central Statistics Office, it is interesting that the CSO takes a more cautious approach to the general view that the number of suicides has increased.  I do not use the word "cautious" in a disparaging manner.  The CSO's figures do not blow the views of members out of the water.  It was noted that coroners' opinions are overridden for statistical purposes in certain circumstances.  I ask Dr. MacFeely to elaborate on that practice.  Is it appropriate that it should take place?  In respect of my earlier question to Dr. Cullinane, would this practice address the need to have a specific, focused and dependable source, rather than a number of possible sources?  Ultimately, we want to get as close to exactitude as possible to better inform how prevention is addressed, as all of us would like.</p></speech>

Before her election to the post of president of the International Association for Suicide Prevention, she held the position of vice-president for many years.  All of those involved in suicide prevention are proud of this development.  I thank Professor Arensman for her contribution and that of her association towards understanding suicide and suicide research.  Is international evidence available on suicides that take place beyond the boundaries of our discussion, for example, in single-vehicle road accidents and certain drownings?  No such research has been carried out at national level.  Is any information, even low level information, available in this area?</p><p>  In Northern Ireland and Britain, the coroner can reach a verdict of suicide without an inquest or hearing in the coroner's court.  We are all aware of the difficulties and trauma the bereaved endure in a coroner's court, as the process is currently structured.  In certain countries, in circumstances where it is obvious that no verdict other than death by suicide can be reached, the coroner can reach a verdict without a hearing.  Does Dr. Cullinane have any views on that practice?</p><p>  A Coroners Bill introduced in 2007 has not yet been passed.  I was recently informed that the Bill is to undergo a full review.  Has the Coroners Society of Ireland been consulted as part of any such review?  What are its views on the Bill?</p><p>  I found the presentation from the Central Statistics Office very interesting, specifically with regard to Form 104.  Some years ago, the National Suicide Research Foundation did good research on the number of these forms being returned.  It found that the number of forms returned was much lower in certain areas, especially in Dublin where Garda stations are very busy and garda&iacute; are under great pressure.  Has the position changed in this regard?  Are coroners concerned about variations in the number of forms being returned between districts and how this divergence may affect statistics?  Undetermined deaths are included in suicide statistics in most other jurisdictions and Ireland is one of the few western states where this does not occur.  Does Dr. Cullinane have any views on that matter? </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their very interesting contributions and look forward, if possible, to exploring at a deeper level some of the issues they raised.  It is convenient that some of them are, like the Chairman and myself, based in Cork.</p><p>  To elaborate a little on an issue raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, it would be useful to establish in the first instance if suicide is being under-reported and, if so, where the under-reporting occurs in the mechanism for collecting data.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.597" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014031300008#H00100"><p>I apologise for being unable to be present for the presentations.  The most important thing about this document is that it can challenge assumptions and highlight the need for purposeful conversation, two things we decidedly need to do in this country.  Reference was made to expressions we make in terms of describing suicide as an epidemic and a national crisis, as mentioned in the report.  We must be brave.  To a certain extent this document challenges traditional thinking in the area and that is positive in view of the fact that we are facing a serious situation with the escalating number of suicides in the country.  We also need to consider the issue of mental health.  Obviously, the HSE has a lead role in addressing this issue.  We need to have a serious conversation as a nation and we need to do so quickly because while we prevaricate as a people there are vulnerable people in the country every day who are contemplating suicide.  Although we talk about it, are we putting the structures in place?  As a people, do we accept that the issue must be addressed?  Are we aggressively and actively pursuing policies and implementing and resourcing those policies?  One could argue that the HSE has been lethargic, to say the least, in addressing many of the issues.  One could argue that the recruitment of people has not been aggressively approached.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention was left without a lead person for a long period.  There may be reasons for this but while all these reasons are being offered as excuses, many people are taking their lives and that should be our priority.</p><p>  This document pushes the boundaries to a certain extent in this regard.  Senator Gilroy has brought forward this document.  However, the key issue to flow from it is to identify where there is an alarming lack of resources and where to prioritise resources.  That is where the real conversation will take place in terms of our priorities.  This is not a political point against the Government.  As a people, are we willing to make a larger contribution from the Exchequer to ensure that suicide prevention is at the highest level in every aspect?  This is something we need to do.</p><p>  We need to consider the practicality.  Often, as Deputies, we hear of cases.  We have raised issues in the areas of mental health and associated support services.  Often people who are in a vulnerable position have to go to the emergency departments of hospitals out of hours.  People may argue that this is the obvious place for a person to go if he is in a crisis.  However, assuming that he has not ingested anything dangerous or self-harmed in any way, he may simply need talk therapy rapidly.  Is an emergency department the right place for people to go in the first instance?  Should we reconsider this?  I am unsure whether there should be an isolation area or separate area but perhaps there should be an area where people can go and sit down with professionals in a more relaxed format to have a discussion, as opposed to being in the front line in an emergency department.  This is something we should examine quickly.</p><p>  I have no wish to delay the committee but I wish to make another point relating to under-reporting.  I missed the last part of the presentation on that.  Why is there under-reporting, if any?  What is the motivation or the reasoning?  Why does the system allow under-reporting?  Is it because of the coroners' inquests?  Is it because of family sensitivities?  What exactly is the reason that there may be under-reporting of suicide?  The deputations pointed to concerns about the alarming figures.  If there is under-reporting then we should be more alarmed again but I am unsure whether that will spur us into swifter action.</p><p>  Senator Gilroy's report referred to the downturn in the economy and financial pressures.  The Chairman and I are aware of some tragic episodes in our city because of people who were under serious financial pressure.  This was not necessarily the only reason but it could have been a contributory reason.</p><p>  I have a question about another area although I am unsure whether we will have the answers in the committee today.  I am keen for a more in-depth analysis carried out on the linkage between alcohol, drug addiction, relationship break-up and suicide, especially among young males.  I have no evidence whatsoever other than my own instincts and what I have heard anecdotally.  I attend funerals from time to time and I have met families who were bereaved.  Perhaps the son was involved in drug addiction or was taking drugs for some time and then life escalated out of control to a certain extent and then ultimately it ended in suicide.  Often families will explain that it started off and then gradually escalated to the point where the person saw no hope.  Do we have enough analysis and detail in this area?  The cohort of young males stands out obviously.  What are the reasons young males aged 19, 20, 21 and 22 years of age believe that there is nothing left in life?  I am keen to hear some observations on that.  I congratulate the rapporteur on his work.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Gilroy for bringing forward the report.  Many of the issues I wanted to raise have been raised already.  Deputy Kelleher referred to the problem in respect of males under 30 years of age.  What changes have occurred in the past five or six years in this area?  Has any analysis been carried out?  Has the substantial increase in suicides been in any particular age group?  We have seen the figures in respect of unemployment but are there corresponding figures for the various age groups?</p><p>  Another issue is the role of the coroner and coroners' inquests.  I realise I am straying somewhat from the report.  I raised the matter at a meeting less than two weeks ago of the period following which coroners hold inquests.  I have come across cases in which there has been a substantial delay in the holding of an inquest although I know for a fact that in one case all the information was available.  The case does not relate to Cork, in case the coroner thinks it does.  All the information was available to the coroner but there was a substantial delay in holding of an inquest.  Such was the delay that representatives of the hospital concerned contacted the State Claims Agency because they were concerned that the family might have come to the conclusion that something was being hidden.  I understand there is no requirement for a given period under the Coroners Act, although I am open to correction.</p><p>  Another issue relates to what is written on death certificates.  I have come across situations in which the physical cause of death is written on the death certificate.  One case arose in which a parent had to present the death certificate to the primary school of the child.  The parent was concerned about what was written on the death certificate.  What are the criteria for what should be written on death certificates?  Is medical cause included?  For example, what if there was a physical cause?  Let us suppose a death was caused by suicide but the medical cause of death was not written; rather, the physical cause of death was put down.  Do we need to tidy up this area?  What are the views of the witnesses?  The case in question caused major trauma for the spouse have to bring the death certificate to the primary school to show that the parent had full responsibility for the care of the child.  Can the position be clarified?  What is the view of the deputations on whether we should change the law on the issue?</p></speech>

It is most illuminating and very well put together.  I am unsure whether I should direct my questions to Senator John Gilroy or the witnesses but perhaps they can offer some comments.  One of my questions relates to suicide numbers.  I realise we have discussed the recession and population growth.</p> <p>I wonder about cyberbullying and homophobic bullying.  We had representatives of the transgender community before the committee and they talked about the rate of suicide being high among its members.  I would welcome a comment in that regard.</p><p> I wish to ask about the coroner&rsquo;s report.  I do not know much about it, but I did watch a programme last week which worried me.  It featured two families, one of which stated it was not allowed to attend the coroner&rsquo;s inquest to give evidence.  As a member of the public, will our guest tell me how one decides who is brought in to give evidence?</p><p> In the context of family sensitivities, I am also concerned about life insurance and mortgage repayments.  Does this impact on what is written in a coroner&rsquo;s report?</p><p> Reference is made on page 16 of the Gilroy report to the organisations working in the area of suicide prevention.  Are coroners happy with what is available?  How many organisations are involved?</p><p> Reference was also made to the accreditation of suicide support services.  I understand the need for suicide prevention measures, but I am also worried about what happens to families following a death by suicide.  Are coroners happy with the counselling services provided for families and communities?</p><p> I note the recording of verdicts.  Is counselling training provided for persons dealing with families who have been bereaved such as members of the Garda or those involved in the coroner's service?  Are they trained to deal with individuals in huge emotional distress?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.612" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Myra Cullinane" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014031300009#J01300"> <p>One aspect of the statistics gathering process that has become apparent in the course of the hearing is the interchangeability of the terms used such as report, verdict and death certificate, not all of which are used accurately.  Coroners are strongly of the opinion that the gathering of information based on the coroner's certificate is inadequate because there is no entry on the certificate for a verdict.  It simply requires an indication of the medical cause of death which may not be helpful in establishing whether it was a death by suicide.  Coroners have no role in regard to form 104 which is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> The Health Research Board study that has been compiled in recent years of deaths associated with drugs and alcohol provides a useful model.  An analogous study focusing on deaths by suicide could yield very comprehensive and accurate information by looking at the totality of the coroner's file, not just the coroner's certificate or record of the verdict.  I have explained the issues around the latter in that it may not always reach a standard whereby one could record a death by suicide.  In looking at the totality of the file, one will identify factors such as whether there was, for instance, drug addiction, marital breakdown, homophobic bullying, cyberbullying and so on.  All of this will be contained within the file.  A formal analysis of coronial files every year, analogous to the HRB study, is something we would strongly support.  There is a fund of information for analysis.</p><p> Deputy Dan Neville asked about the possibility of recording a verdict of suicide without the hearing of an inquest.  My own experience is that a sensitively held inquest into a death that may have been caused by suicide can be a very cathartic experience for the family.  It can serve to vindicate the life of the deceased, give an opportunity to acknowledge the efforts the family had made in life for the deceased and acknowledge the individual's pain.  In addition, it provides an opportunity to answer some of the questions that may remain to be answered for the family.  There is a great public utility in the holding of an inquest in such cases.  I am aware that a Bill was published in 2007 which is being progressed through the Oireachtas.  Coroners are engaging in that process.</p><p> Deputy Billy Kelleher asked why suicide deaths were under-reported.  I agree with my colleague that we do not know whether they are, in fact, being under-reported.  We need a proper analysis of the data in order to establish exactly what is the position on suicide deaths.  I refer once again to the suggested HRB-type analysis which would capture all of the related factors the Deputy raised.  These data will not be captured on the coroner's certificate or form 104 which, as I understand it, are the basis of all statistical analyses.</p><p> Senator Colm Burke asked about the time lag between the occurrence of a death and the hearing of an inquest.  This can vary considerably, depending on the circumstances of the death and the complexity of the evidence required to be compiled by the coroner.  One of the main causes of delay is where results of toxicology tests from the State laboratory are required, which can take between four and six months.  Other issues which may delay the holding of an inquest include the making of arrangements for hearing rooms and court access, the notification of witnesses and general administrative issues.  Coroners agree that once the information has been compiled and they are in a position to hold an inquest, it should not, for the sake of the family, be delayed unduly.</p><p> The Senator also referred to the death certificate.  I assume he is referring to the coroner's certificate which is submitted to the registry of deaths and from which the information that will appear on the formal death certificate is extracted.  Coroners have long been of the opinion that it would be of assistance to families if a short form was available, as is the case in the United Kingdom.  The death would still be registered and include the full medical cause of death, the details of which we are obliged to set out fully.  All of this information is essential for the statistical analysis and so on.  However, there is nothing to preclude the introduction of a short form which would simply set out the fact of death, the name of the deceased and the date and place of death, without including the cause.  We know it causes distress when people have to deal with a certificate which includes very personal information on a deceased parent or sibling, for example.  We are very much in support of having a short form.  This is not a matter for coroners or the Department of Justice and Equality but for the Department that governs civil registration.</p><p> Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor asked how coroners decided which witnesses would be heard at an inquest.  Again, I preface my remarks by noting that I am not in a position to comment on the practice of any of my colleagues.  In general terms, however, the inquest is an inquisitorial form and, therefore, different from other court proceedings.  The coroner is the inquisitor carrying out the investigation and the witnesses are called at his or her discretion.  By contrast, in other court proceedings the parties will bring their own witnesses.  Coroners, in calling witnesses and deciding who is to give evidence, do so to establish the facts they are obliged to establish under statute and assist them in recording a verdict.  The coroner is governed in all of this by the principles of fair procedure.  If a properly interested party presenting before the coroner expresses a desire to hear from a particular witness, the coroner will give due consideration to that request.</p><p> The Deputy also asked whether coroners and coroners' staff received any counselling or other training to deal with members of the public who were distressed and bereaved.  I can only speak for my own jurisdiction, but I have arranged informal training for my staff in this regard, which was kindly delivered by Professor Arensman and her staff.  It is an important issue because we need to be able to deal with distressed individuals in a professional manner.</p></speech>

The period included the years of the recession.  This model is usually recommended when one is dealing with a relatively small population - even 4 million is considered small - and a correspondingly small number of suicides.  Even in the context of this analysis, we still discovered a significant - 4.5% - increase in the number of suicides from 2007 to 2011.  I apologise for extrapolating, but we also have available to us the national registry of self-harm which allowed us to identify the fact that between 2007 and 2011 there was a 30% increase in the level of male self-harm in Ireland.  In the 25 years I have been working in this area I have never come across such an increase in the level of male self-harm.  There is sufficient international evidence available to allow us to stand over our approach and use changes in trends in male self-harm as a proxy for changes in trends in suicide.  I very much appreciate, however, that we are not fully up to speed in knowing all of the details of people's histories and additional factors, particularly over a long period.</p><p> The first question to which I wish to respond came from Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and relates to whether we might be able to consider baseline figures for the period prior to the recession.  If they were available, we would have examined them already.  The Deputy also inquired about what we had identified by means of the suicide support and information system.  It is a new system that we can use to access full data from coroners' records, including post-mortem records.  We also invite family members who have been bereaved as a result of suicide to participate in interviews with well-trained specialist psychologists.  In addition to the interview, we also seek permission from the family member involved to contact a health care professional who was in contact with the deceased prior to death.  These are three sources from which we have been able to collect very in-depth information.  Given that we only began collecting the information in question in 2008, it is very difficult to carry out a baseline study.  If we consider the comprehensive psychological autopsy study compiled by Dr. Tom Foster in Northern Ireland some years ago, we find similar prevalence rates in respect of previous self-harm and mental health issues, particularly depression, but significantly lower levels of unemployment and much lower numbers of people working in the construction and production sectors.  Even though they do not provide a direct baseline, the high levels of unemployment and the large numbers of people working in the construction and productions sectors which we identified give an indication of the contributing impact of the recession in Ireland.</p><p> I was also asked about the potential value of comparing the position here with that in neighbouring countries.  I have just proposed this to a colleague in Scotland.  It is certainly something we could consider, particularly in the context of potential differences.  One of the differences I have already encountered relates to the fact that at the beginning of the recession the government in Scotland decided to increase alcohol prices and introduce even more stringent rules in the advertising of alcohol at sports and other events.  During the same period alcohol prices in Ireland were reduced.  Regardless of whether there is a recession, we know that alcohol has an important impact in the context of suicide and self-harm.  I hope that by the time the committee moves forward with its report, we will have begun our comparison with neighbouring countries.</p><p> Deputy Dan Neville inquired about the international experience with regard to other external causes of death which might include or capture probable cases of suicide.  In the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom comprehensive research has been conducted into possible other categories of external causes of death which may capture probable cases of suicide, including single vehicle road traffic accidents and accidental drownings and poisonings.  Unfortunately, there has been an increase in the number of such poisonings in Ireland in recent times.  Before the recession began, there were indications of a reducing trend in the number of suicides in the United Kingdom.  At the same time, however, there had also been an increasing trend across that jurisdiction for so-called narrative verdicts.  Such verdicts refer to descriptions of particular situations in the context of the methods used, the circumstances in which a person died and the sequence of events, but they do not involve specific findings on whether the death was intentional or accidental.  On the basis of this work, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States developed screening criteria.  They were first introduced in the 1980s, but they have been updated in the interim and there is always scope to update them further.  There is a tool available to facilitate screening for external causes of death in respect of the probability of whether they capture probable cases of suicide.</p><p> I was delighted when Deputy Billy Kelleher asked whether accident and emergency departments offered an appropriate setting for dealing with people - even if they have not engaged in self-harm - expressing suicidal ideation.  On the basis of the current setting and also the capacity of staff in accident and emergency departments to deal with such individuals, I would be concerned.  I am particularly concerned about whether staff are adequately equipped to deal with this very challenging group of individuals.  One of my concerns is based on the outcomes of an evaluation of accident and emergency department staff, particularly nurses, in terms of the extent to which they had received training in the area of suicide and self-harm awareness.  We recently finalised this evaluation in Cork and discovered that fewer than 10% of the relevant staff had received such training.  I do not have a clear-cut alternative to offer, but we must give further consideration to this matter.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Gilroy for the report he compiled which is very interesting.  I am conscious there might be people watching these proceedings on television at home and I want to assure them that although we are talking about suicide and statistics we know we are talking about their loved ones and that they are not statistics.  I want to make that point because it strikes me when we are discussing a subject such as this one and the proceedings are broadcast to the public that sometimes it might appear that we are insensitive to the subject we are discussing, but this is a very important issue.  I want to assure people that we are all very conscious of that fact that somebody could be watching these proceedings who has lost somebody through suicide or as a result of a tragic death.</p><p>  It is hard to single out one of the contributors as one could sit in awe of them all listening to what they had to say but I wish to refer to one of them, the coroner, Dr. Myra Cullinane.  If is very difficult for any family to go to an inquest in the Coroner's Court.  It takes a great deal of courage.  Many people go because they want to find some answers and closure.  Dr. Cullinane explained the process very well and the sincerity that is shown at the time of the inquest in having regard to people's feelings about their loved one who has passed away.  I compliment Dr. Cullinane on that.  When we think of coroners, we thinks of other things but we do not realise that coroners have a very a particular and sensitive job to do and they need to be able to deal with people who are sitting in the room at the time.  I attended an inquest and I felt that it was dealt with very well and I left with a sense of comfort that the person who was being spoken about was very important to them.  When the inquest is over, unfortunately, sometimes there are no answers for the coroner or for the family.  In a moment of darkness a person can take his or her life who, as a member of a family, would never have dreamt of doing so previously.  That is an important point to make. </p><p>  I note from the report, and also from Dr. Steve MacFeely's comments on statistics, that it deals with the last 12 years.  Are there figures for the period prior to that covering the last 30 years?  </p><p>  I grew up in a society where religion was very important.  We lived in a very religious society where people had deep religious beliefs.  There was less money and probably less drink consumed, particularly at home.  I do not remember there being alcohol in my home - only at Christmas, when a few bits and pieces were brought in for visitors.  There were no drugs, in the sense of illicit drugs that are prevalent now, at that time.  I know from having teenage children that drinking plays a big part in their social outlook when they go out.  I am always conscious of guiding them when they go out to be careful of what they drink because it completely changes a person's mood.  I am not a drinker but I know that is the case.  </p><p>  I have two questions.  The contributors probably cannot answer this question but I would highlight the impact religion had on people's lives in the past.  I am conscious of that in today's world where views around religion have changed.  Do the contributors believe that enough is being done in our schools to identify young people with difficulties given that this report shows a major increase from the age 15 to 24 in the number of young males - and females presumably - taking their lives?  Teachers do their best but I often think that we need to be more proactive in this respect, particularly during students' college years when they are thinking of many things and their lives are changing around them.  Is enough being done in that respect?  One of the contributors might provide some insight on this aspect.</p></speech>

I had no intention of speaking today as basically came here to look, listen and learn because I have no experience of dealing with suicide.  There is not a family in the country who has not had some experience of dealing with suicide.  The biggest issue for family members, friends and colleagues is that they would like to know if there is a pattern that could be identified indicating that something was wrong with the person concerned.  If I were to go to a friend's funeral and talk to the family members, they would ask if there was any sign to point to what was about to happen because the person concerned always seems to have been in a very happy frame of mind, which might have been due to the fact that he or she knew that the end was close.</p> <p>It is a very delicate subject.  Many families ask whether there is something they should have seen or some help they could have given.  We can all talk about problems with finance or other problems but could the witnesses indicate whether there is something one can do if someone is behaving strangely or having mood swings? Families try to get closure over what happened to loved ones and they just cannot seem to achieve it.</p><p> I do not have experience in this area and I am sure the witnesses are very experienced.  Could they indicate whether mood swings or other such behaviour would suggest that something is wrong with their loved ones?  If they could interact perhaps it would help the person with the problem.</p></speech>

Interestingly, in terms of non-fatal self-harm, which we have observed over many years, the highest peak of self-harm among young men occurs in the 20 to 24 years age group.  That is also the age group among which we see many cases of suicide, where possibly the link between non-fatal self-harm and suicide is strongly associated.  Would you like me to comment on the other points, Chairman?</p></speech>

Under the umbrella of ReachOut, a lot of initiatives have taken place in recent years.  An important document was implemented and launched last year on guidelines for schools on how to take on issues around mental health and how to respond when a suicide occurs.  It is great when those documents exist but the next step is appropriate implementation.</p><p>  Even though I am very optimistic that it is feasible to implement the work, we are still dealing with very strong stigma around mental health.  If I see that among health professionals then it is certainly still there in schools.  I am a strong supporter of implementation in terms of not only explaining to school principals what the guidelines are about but offering them a training package as well or lunch time sessions where they can also talk about their experiences with young people who have engaged in self-harm or who have died by suicide.</p><p>  My final comment is in response to the very good contribution of Deputy Fitzpatrick.  That is an issue of great concern.  Through the very in-depth approach we have established with the suicide support and information system we have seen a relatively large number of groups of teenage friends but also families with multiple cases of suicide or self-harm in a short space of time.  It is one of the priorities that we have put in place &ndash; a lot of work has been done by Console and the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP &ndash; but we still need to have a greater capacity of counsellors who can liaise with families after a suicide in particular where they can also address the needs of the people who are left behind.  That is particularly a priority when one sees multiple cases of suicide and self-harm in one family.</p><p>  In terms of risk factors it must be clear that there is a great variety of risk factors but reference has already been made to behaviour change and changes in mood.  Increases in alcohol and substance abuse are often indicators of possible risk of self-harm and suicide.  Interestingly, a pattern that we have seen through the suicide support and information system among men is that when men who may have been depressed or abusing alcohol or drugs over a long period come closer to a plan and have higher ideation of suicide their depression or substance abuse sometimes apparently improves.  That is all information that is apparent in hindsight, unfortunately, but it seems that up to two weeks prior to a suicide family members who otherwise might have been quite severely depressed or suffering from addictions suddenly seem to do better, but that pattern of improving may be part of their plan or decision or even a ritual such as organising events to get distance from family members.  To refer to that in a more clinical way, people become more disconnected from their loved ones.</p></speech>

A review was carried out in the 1980s where suicide was again the topic and there were concerns about the level and recording of suicide.  That is when the form 104 was introduced.  There might be issues with comparability.  I congratulate Deputy Gilmore on his table.</p></speech>

I thank all of the witnesses for their participation and for their very informative, challenging and provocative comments, which as Deputy Byrne correctly said are about people.  All of us in this room are concerned about people, be they those suffering from mental health issues or the families of those who have died from suicide or self-harm.  We are discussing people&rsquo;s lives, their families, people in the workforce, colleagues in work and in the community.  We are very conscious that it is not about statistics.  The work of the witnesses is very much focused on the person as well.  We thank them for that.</p><p>  I thank those who are watching at home on channel 207 and remind them that we do have a second hearing following this meeting, which will be equally as informative and challenging.

I thank everyone for their attendance and I thank the witnesses for their patience.  As the last part of the meeting was extended and the joint committee also had some business in private session at the outset, I apologise for the delay.  The joint committee has reconvened for the second part of its two-part meeting today on the issue of suicide as part of the report being compiled by the joint committee's rapporteur, Senator Gilroy, entitled, "Challenging Assumptions: A Powerful Conversation".  At this point, I thank Senator Gilroy for his work.  He will complete the aforementioned report, which then will be furnished to the joint committee for adoption after which it will be forwarded by the joint committee to the Minister as a committee report.  I welcome Mr. Ciaran Austin, director of services, Console; Mr. Dominic Layden, chief executive officer, Aware; Ms Joan Freeman from Pieta House; Dr. Justin Brophy from the Irish Association of Suicidology; and Mr. Gerry Raleigh and Ms Susan Kenny from the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  They are all welcome to this meeting and I thank them for their attendance.  I also welcome viewers on UPC channel 207.</p><p>  Before we commence, I remind people their mobile telephones should be in the off position or in aeroplane mode.  In a similar manner to the previous part of the meeting, it is important to put this in context by noting we are talking about the lives of people, the families affected by this issue, as well as people's colleagues, friends and communities.  I also wish to remind witnesses of the position regarding privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Before calling on Mr. Ciaran Austin, I invite the joint committee's rapporteur, Senator Gilroy, to make a few brief opening remarks.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for his ongoing support for this public consultation process.  I also welcome the witnesses who are giving evidence this morning.  I do not intend to say a great deal about the paper presented to the committee as I prefer simply to listen to the comments and the opinions of the witnesses.  I acknowledge that one or two clarifications have been offered in respect of the opening statements of some of the witnesses.  These clarifications have been noted and will be incorporated into the report in due course.</p><p>  The witnesses will note that I have circulated to them hard copies of the paper.  There are one or two minor editorial changes.  It was pointed out to me that the paper's intent might not be 100% clear and consequently, I added one or two minor changes in the interests of achieving greater clarity.  For instance, the signposts for conversations within the paper might best be approached as if they were a series of questions.  Instead of being thought of as recommendations, it might be better to consider them as asking the question "What if we were to do...(whatever is contained in the signpost in question)?".</p><p>  As for my background, I am the health spokesperson for the Labour Party in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Previously, I worked for 28 years as a psychiatric nurse in the mental health services in Ireland and the United Kingdom, mainly in the area of acute mental health.  I was appointed as the joint committee's rapporteur and decided to approach the project in a manner that might not immediately suggest itself.  Some might have thought a good place to start such an exercise would have been to hold discussions with the Department, the National Office for Suicide Prevention or the main agencies working in the area.  However, I decided to pursue a different path and instead sought the opinion of members of the public in the first instance, including those who have been affected by or who have an interest in the area.  Having done that, I decided I would bring their concerns to the attention of the main stakeholding organisations.  This is how we find ourselves at this meeting today.</p><p>  I held public consultation meetings at nine locations through the country that were attended by approximately 600 people.  I also met many individuals, groups and organisations and during the past 12 months, I have devoted virtually all my political time to this project.  During the course of the public consultations, many issues were raised and I have incorporated those concerns into five main points in the paper.  The first point relates to the effects of the recession, which was one of the most frequently raised questions from the public.  Points 2 to 5, inclusive, also were raised constantly.  While I do not believe any member of the public used terminology such as expressing to me the need to reconfigure the policy formulation and delivery apparatus, this was the theme of many conversations I had.  Consequently, I have modelled the questions within the paper on that kind of thematic view.  These are questions on how to deliver services or how such services have an impact on the lived experience of those affected by suicide as well.  Therefore, I have attempted to bring together the various points by formulating the questions in the manner to be found in the paper.  To expand on the points and create a conversation around them I laid them out in the manner the witnesses can see before them and while the writing is mine, the ideas are not.  I could have laid out the five points for discussion as a series of five questions but to create a conversation around the points and achieve a level of engagement with stakeholders, I decided to put forward some ideas as to how they might be addressed.</p><p>  I am pleased to note a divergence of opinion among stakeholders with regard to this paper, as its purpose is to create a conversation.  Were one able to agree on everything, one could claim that everything was being done perfectly and this is not the case.  I look forward to hearing witnesses' opinions of the paper and remind them that this is not the final report.  These are the opinions and comments I have gathered from members of the public that have been formally brought before the committee and the witnesses.  Following today's hearings, I intend to move onto the next phase of public consultation, which will involve engagement with the stakeholder organisations such as those represented here today.</p></speech>

We also operate Ireland's only 24-hour freephone suicide prevention and bereavement helpline, also manned by fully qualified and accredited therapists, supporting those in crisis, bereaved or supporting a loved one with suicidal ideation.  In addition, in the past two years, we have taken ownership of the farm and rural stress helpline initiative which started in HSE South approximately two years ago.  We also provide a wide range of information, training and education programmes and resources for communities, agencies, workplaces and professionals.  Recent, we opened our first centre in the United Kingdom, in Westminster in London.</p><p> There are two points of note about the organisation relevant to Senator Gilroy's report.  This year, we are introducing a new family Suicide bereavement liaison service, in counties Donegal, Galway, Sligo-Leitrim, Clare and Limerick-north Tipperary, in collaboration with HSE West.  In 2012, Console published the National Quality Standards for the Provision of Suicide Bereavement Services, in collaboration with the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, in an effort to provide a robust framework and self-assessment tool for any organisation providing postvention support in Ireland, and that is available to download on the website for anyone who wants a copy.</p><p> I will touch on the five key areas in Senator Gilroy's report.  Some of this may reiterate key messages that came out this morning.</p><p> On suicide and the recession, we are in broad agreement with the findings outlined in the report on the rise in suicide and self-harm rates during the time of economic recession.  Increasingly, since 2008, our work has involved supporting individuals and families who are experiencing unemployment, financial pressure, reduced employment prospects and mortgage stress.  These additional risk factors have greater potential for harm with those already vulnerable to mental ill-health.</p><p> Nonetheless, we are also of the view that, given the multifaceted nature of death by suicide and its varied risk factors and complexity, directly relating suicide to economic stress is not always helpful.  The oversimplification of reasons behind suicide, in particular, from a media perspective, may be harmful to those in similar situations and hurtful to those who have already been bereaved by a suicide loss.  That is something that comes to mind on recent media coverage of the publication of this report, even prior to the weekend.</p><p> On how we gather information about suicide and self-harm, there is no doubt that the number of deaths recorded as suicide or intentional self-harm under-represent the true numbers of such deaths in Ireland.  This morning the committee heard from witnesses who talked about the lack of analytical evidence to suggest this but, from our evidence in working with bereaved families, there is definitely an under-representation.</p><p> In addition, given the current system, the probable time lapse between the death and registration with the CSO means that annual or monthly patterns are difficult to ascertain and are often skewed.  The process of recording and registering such deaths is outdated and the provision of much more timely and accurate statistics on suicide is crucial, if services are to respond effectively to emerging trends, clusters or community crises.  Console is of the view that the research standard noted in Senator Gilroy's report would go some way in addressing these deficits.</p><p> The inquest and coroners' courts are often traumatic and upsetting experiences for bereaved families - that might contradict a little of what the committee heard this morning.  In our experience, unfortunately, it is a negative experience for bereaved families.  In working with bereaved families for over 12 years, we have noticed a distinct lack of consistency across coroners' courts in Ireland, with extremely varied types of systems in place or levels of care afforded to bereaved families at such a traumatic time in their lives.  Bearing in mind that some suicides may have been preceded by fractious family difficulties, relationship break-ups, etc., the need of a bereaved family for support, privacy and sensitivity after such a devastating loss should remain paramount.  In Scotland, if all concerned parties form a consensus about a suicide death, a public inquest is not held.  There must be a more compassionate way forward with this process in Ireland.</p><p> On the mapping of suicide deaths, Console also endorses the suggested development of the SaTScan programme, as noted in the report, in particular, its linking with first responders such as garda&iacute;.  If front-line service providers, such as Console, are to effectively mobilise services, address educational and awareness deficits in communities and respond to suicide in the most helpful way possible, the provision of accurate real-time information is crucial.</p><p> In addition, community agencies, such those present here, and front-line service providers are ideally placed to participate in new systems for provision of more timely regional data.  We collaborated with the National Suicide Research Foundation on its Suicide Support and Information Systems, SSIS, project, which the committee heard about this morning, and there were extremely productive and proactive community responses as a result.</p><p> During this year, as I mentioned, we are developing a family suicide bereavement liaison service in five counties across the western seaboard.  This service will provide a proactive approach to families after a suicide loss, promoting access to services and practical support for the bereaved.  The service will see the development of county-specific protocols on responding to suicide, outlining collaborative roles for the first responders, service providers, coroners and health services.  If extended nationwide, such projects provide ample opportunity for the development of new systems for registering and mapping deaths by suicide.</p><p> The area of the community and voluntary sector is particularly relevant to ourselves.  Here, too, we are in broad agreement with the issues raised in Senator Gilroy's report.  Our considerations include the following.  First, while there are numerous agencies working in the fields of suicide awareness, prevention or postvention, and, often, it is quoted that there are too many, careful consideration should be given to the extremely varied types of services or supports offered.  For those in immediate crisis, bereaved or concerned about suicide, there is rarely a sense from them that there is a wide variety of options open to them.  Second, given that suicide is such a complex and multifaceted issue, the number of initiatives, services or programmes required to tackle it effectively is large.  Without significant investment and restructuring, the required targeted and general population approaches to prevent suicide could not be realistically achieved by one agency or merely a few.  Third, the issue of standardisation of work is most important.  Quality frameworks are essential, if we are to ensure the safety and standard of individuals, groups or agencies working to prevent suicide.  The National Quality Standards for the Provision of Suicide Bereavement Services of 2012 attempts to do this with regard to postvention services.  The document relies on self-assessment and to be effective, tools like this would require significant external input to assess and ensure compliance.  Still, it allows agencies of all sizes to ascertain their level of contribution to a wider nationwide postvention strategy and benchmarks their work by providing specific standards and recommendations relevant to their particular service levels.</p><p> Lastly, on the reconfiguration of policy formation and delivery, I suppose our only comment as a front-line service provider is we acknowledge the significant good work of the National Office for Suicide Prevention, in particular, the considerable impetus it has got in the past few years under some new directorship, but also note the enormity of the tasks asked of it.  If it is to carry out its work more effectively, the NOSP requires greater sustenance and significant financial investment.  With a new national strategy on suicide prevention due for development this year, agencies and policy makers need to support the NOSP in its difficult work and to help improve its constructive engagement with community and agencies across Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank him for being here and ask that he make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.662" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dominic Layden" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014031300015#Q00300"> <p>An omnibus survey was conducted by Am&aacute;rach Research in February and it showed Aware is the organisation most widely spontaneously associated with depression and mental ill health in Ireland, at 31%, followed closely by the Samaritans, at 28%.  A wide range of other organisations was recalled although these were listed as having significantly lower levels, including the State and HSE, at 12%.  This points to the fact that where mental health is concerned, people think of Aware and the Samaritans before they think of the public sector, the HSE and other organisations.<br/>This prompts two questions.  Why does the public think of Aware and the Samaritans before any other body?  What are they looking for when they come to our organisation?  Aware has longevity, trust and brand awareness.  The organisation has been in existence for just over 29 years.  All our services are independently evaluated.  A clinical sub-committee of our board oversees all the services we provide.  We appointed a clinical director and a full-time training and recruitment officer in recent years.  The independent evaluation of services for any organisation is a major challenge.  Within the voluntary sector, it poses even more challenges because, obviously, most of our services are provided by highly trained, active and committed volunteers.<br/>We have a very strong and committed volunteer base nationwide.  More than 345 active and highly-trained volunteers are involved in our service delivery and each receives a minimum ten hours&rsquo; training.  We have a wide range of volunteer policies and procedures, from confidentiality policies to procedures in dealing with individuals attending our support groups or helpline.  We have a well-trained organisation.<br/>The public, when it approaches Aware, comes for information in the first instance, then for support and education.  The public is now coming to us for wellness training programmes at work.  The primary source of information on depression stress and other mental health mood-related disorders is our website.  We get approximately 260,000 unique hits on our website every day, which amounts to approximately two hits every two minutes.  We hold a monthly lecture in St. Patrick&rsquo;s.  We video them and have published them online in the past year and a half.  Over 39,000 people have downloaded the monthly lectures.  A range of experts in the field, namely, experts in depression, mood-related disorders and suicide, are invited to deliver the lectures.<br/>We have three support mechanisms.  We have a helpline and just over 50,000 calls have been answered in past three years.  We have an encrypted e-mail service, which means a volunteer will not know whom an e-mail has been sent from.  The transcript of the response is read by another volunteer before it is sent back to the person who sent the e-mail.  Finally, we have support groups.  We have 45 locations nationwide.  Some groups meet weekly and sometimes bimonthly or monthly.  In the past 29 years, many people have remained alive because of the services attendees at the support groups have been able to receive.<br/>Beyond the provision of information and support, the third area is education.  We have three educational programmes.  The first, Beat the Blues, is delivered by professional trainers to students aged from 15 to 18 in all secondary schools.  In the past two years, we have delivered the programme to over 60,000 students.  Approximately half of all secondary schools have received our programme to date.  This programme helps young people to learn coping skills for dealing with concerns, in addition to tips for looking after mental health and building resilience.  It costs approximately &euro;7 to deliver the programme to each child.  This is excellent value for money.<br/>Our second education programme is a lifeskills group programme, which is available for adults of 18 and over.  It is delivered to groups of up to 25 people over six weekly 90-minute sessions and it is based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy.  Launched in May 2012, the programme has now been delivered to 3,000 people across most counties, with several more phases planned between now and the end of the year.  The programme is independently evaluated.  We have seen significant improvements in self-reported depression and anxiety, using standardised clinical measures.  Crucially, these results are sustained at 12-month follow-up, as shown in evaluations by Dr. Katrina Collins.  With private one-to-one cognitive behavioural therapy sessions costing approximately &euro;100 each, the real value of Aware&rsquo;s free programmes could be estimated at just under &euro;2 million. <br/>The third education programme is Life Skills Online.  It offers a unique option for service users to access a programme based on cognitive behavioural therapy from the comfort of their own home, with the added benefit of encouragement from a trained supporter, equivalent to a personal trainer in a gym. Launched in 2012, the eight-module programme has been completed by over 800 to date, and we are currently involved in a randomised controlled trial with Trinity College Dublin and SilverCloud technology company.  All these services are free to the public.  We recently launched wellness-at-work training programmes that provide talks for employees and half and full-day training programmes for managers in the workplace.<br/>Aware welcomes the report on suicide by the rapporteur to this committee, Senator John Gilroy, and has a number of observations and comments.  First, as referenced in the report, there are a large number of organisations working in the area of mental health, and their services are provided in addition to the services provided by the State.  We welcome the suggestion that there should be a national registry of all organisations working in this area.  We believe such a registry would be helpful for all stakeholders and that, in addition, the publishing of information on how and why organisations or projects are funded is important for transparency and accountability.<br/>Second, Aware has significant concerns about the use of the word &ldquo;suicide&rdquo; and the focus, particularly in media circles, on the issue.  Suicide has become an everyday word, and to a vulnerable person, particularly a younger person, the common, almost casual, manner of speaking about such a serious issue can mean suicide is in some way perceived as a real option in life.<br/>Aware would like people to understand that just because someone has thoughts of taking his or her own life does not mean he or she has to do it; there are always alternative options.  Just because someone has depression does not mean that he or she will inevitably take his or her own life as many people experience depression and make a full recovery.<br/>Third, the recession over recent years has made many people feel more vulnerable.  There have been continuing conversations about austerity and a sense that there will be many years of battle before things begin to show signs of recovery.  There is a real need for people to understand what they can do to maintain their mental health in the face of such challenges, and how to build and develop resilience to lessen the impact on their mental well-being.<br/>Fourth, alcohol is a significant factor in influencing mental health but there seems to be reluctance to acknowledge this.  The rapporteur has included detail in his report about the link seen between the increase in the suicide rate in the late 1990s and the increase in the <i>per capita</i>alcohol consumption rate.  Research commissioned by Aware in 2004, carried out by Dr. Conor Farren, noted that in Ireland, being unique among European countries, there was a 41% increase in alcohol consumption per head of population over the ten years to 2000, and this mirrored a parallel increase in the national suicide rate.<br/>Fifth, in addition to the need to provide services that focus on helping people who are in acute suicidal crisis, there is a real need for everyone to understand suicide prevention is not just about acute crises.</p> <p>It begins at a much earlier point in the journey.  If this were understood and acted on, so many lives and so much distress could be prevented.  If we look at how cancer is dealt with, people are encouraged to check themselves regularly for symptoms of some of the more common types of cancer, such as breast cancer or testicular cancer.  There are also a number of screening options which people are actively encouraged to take advantage of such as cervical cancer screenings.  These seem to be showing real results in terms of identifying people who are at risk at an earlier stage and improving outcomes.</p><p> Aware is trying to encourage people to take more responsibility for their mental health and monitor how they are doing through its positive mental health programmes.  It is helping people to understand that mental health is something that we all have but there are ways that we can look after it to prevent issues from developing.</p><p> Aware believes education is the key to bringing about a fundamental shift in society&rsquo;s attitude to mental health and, ultimately, suicide.  Aware has delivered its Beat the Blues positive mental health programme to 60,000 senior cycle students in over half of the secondary schools in the past two years.  We recommend the State and Department of Education and Skills encourage all secondary schools to avail of this free programme, as there is nothing else there for young students at this pivotal stage in their lives.</p><p> We also recommend that mental health education and resilience development should be part of the curriculum, including at primary level.  We should all aspire to create a well society with young men and women resilient and adaptable no matter what the challenges they face.</p></speech>

The footnote on his submission on the organisation&rsquo;s board members&rsquo; salaries is welcome and shows leadership.</p><p>  I call on Ms Joan Freeman, Pieta House, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.666" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joan Freeman" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014031300017#S00300"> <p>I have heard many criticisms about using the word "suicide" and that we have nearly normalised it.  We can never go back to putting it under the carpet.  Last year 4,000 people came to us because they were unafraid to do so.  I ask the Government to examine this issue in a way that we can tell the public that there will be a major reduction in suicide if they include us in that dialogue and in the implementation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-13a.668" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Justin Brophy" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014031300018#T00200"> <p>It is still difficult to get help because the point of call is often an out-of-hours service in a general practice that would not necessarily know the person and may involve a lot of waiting or an emergency department that is often a fraught and difficult environment in which to conduct such assessments.  There is a better way of doing it.</p><p> We also recommend greater investment in a comprehensive range of drug and alcohol services.  We do not have services commensurate with the extent of the problem in this country.  We recommend greater drug controls around benzodiazepines.  There have been notable examples this week, including reports in today's newspapers, of banks taking measures to protect people who are about to lose their family home.  They are taking commendable and honourable debt correction measures and if people lose their home, pathways are being provided to ensure they do not become homeless as a result of debt repayment measures.</p><p> We would like to recommend further investment in the NOSP.  We believe it does great work and we believe, contrary to some of the evidence the committee has heard, that it is the best placed agency to commission and co-ordinate suicide prevention efforts.  Stigma campaigns need to be balanced with campaigns that show the impact of suicide on communities and individuals.  The normalisation of self-harm needs to be challenged.  The more training, the better and suicide resource officers should be trained and given standard operational procedures in order that they can operate in a co-ordinated and targeted way.  We also suggest that any relief measures in respect of assisted suicide that this or a subsequent Government may need to be assessed not only in terms of a civil rights, human rights and legal perspective but also in term of the impact on the population.  If assisted suicide is to be supported by the Government, it needs to be done in a way that does not defeat the other purpose of the Government to prevent suicide.</p><p> We ask the Government to recognise the achievability and political value of suicide prevention because there is still a lot of defeatism and complacency in public and even in political circles that suicide can be prevented.  We strongly commend to the Government the importance and achievability of suicide prevention and ask it to be unstinting in its efforts in that regard.</p></speech>

The establishment of any new data-recording systems on suicide mortality should be done as part of the development of a new strategic framework for suicide prevention.  Consideration needs to be given to the cost effectiveness of any new data-recording system having regard to the current investment in the national self-harm registry funded by the NOSP and delivered by the NSRF; integration with existing suicide bereavement support services; and the learning from existing national and international data-collection systems for suicide and other public health concerns, for example substance misuse.</p><p> On signpost 4, as part of the HSE's new national mental health awareness campaign, which will be launched in 2014, a national mapping exercise of support services that have a relationship with the NOSP and partner organisations will be made available to the community in an effort to provide very simple and clear signposting to services, with an emphasis on services that are accredited.</p><p> On signposts 5 and 6, the NOSP recognises the need for the establishment of national standards for agencies working in the area of suicide prevention, which would apply equally to all community groups working at a community and national level.  The development of standards will form part of the new national strategic framework.  Consideration needs to be given to the accreditation process to support this and the appropriate agency to oversee these standards.</p><p> On signpost 7, the NOSP has its own budget of &euro;8.8 million for 2014.  The reconfiguration of the NOSP to a new location is a policy decision for Government.  It is our view that at present the NOSP should remain within the HSE mental health division, because that is where we can exercise most influence in delivering help to people who seek it.  As part of a new strategic framework on suicide prevention, consideration needs to be given to the governance structures both within the HSE and at government level.  In addition, any new governance system will need to be integrated and linked to the Cabinet committee on social policy governance structure for the Healthy Ireland framework.  In terms of signpost 8, this is a policy decision for Government and the Department of Health. </p><p> In 2014, the NOSP has been mandated by the Department of Health to take the lead on the development of a new Government strategic framework for suicide prevention.  This is an exciting but challenging task for the organisation.  The process for the development of the framework has commenced and the NOSP will commit to using the signposts and the discussion that has commenced today in terms of developing this framework.  We see the outcome as one which is action based, reflecting the input of all our partners and will allow us to give very clear direction and confidence to the community that we can reduce the loss of life by suicide.  We would also welcome any additional recommendations that the committee may feel are helpful for the new framework.</p></speech>

I wish to pay tribute to Senator Gilroy, our colleague, for his work so far.  I know he has a very special interest and has done considerable work in this area.  The Fianna F&aacute;il members of the committee, Deputies Troy and Kelleher, and I, will give our own policy, entitled Actions Speak Louder than Words, to Senator Gilroy as our submission to the committee.  Some of those present may be aware of that policy which was prepared about a year ago.</p><p>  I fully agree with Ms Freeman of Pieta House.  Governments and politicians do not have the solutions and will never have the solutions.  We are all tired of what happens following a high-profile incident.  There is shock and horror, and shouting from the rooftops about what has to be done and the reports that are needed.  It goes on for about a week and then if falls away.</p><p>  While I agree with everything the witnesses said, I am not sure we agree on how to achieve it.  The Government of the day is responsible for the structure and resourcing to allow the organisations represented here to excel at what they do.  They are the super heroes in this regard.  They peel back the blindfold on the phenomenon of loss of life through suicide.  There is nothing we can say here to teach them how to cook the burgers in McDonalds, so we will not try to do that.</p><p>  However, the correct structure needs to be in place and we need the appropriate resourcing for that structure to excel.  I certainly do not believe that is the case at the moment.  I fully agree that the National Office for Suicide Prevention is overwhelmed, overworked and under-resourced.  While I do not expect people from the office to agree with me, their efforts are hampered by being subservient to an organisation that has financial challenges on a daily basis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, would agree with me that when the chips are down the first money to be cut is from the mental health area.  That is why I believe responsibility for this area must be removed from the HSE - it needs to be an organisation in itself.</p><p>  As the organisation knows the area best, it should define the national policy.  The old policy has not really worked although it has some great aspects.  We need to draw up a new policy quickly and get on with it.  There has been enough talk and as the witnesses have rightly said, action is what is required.  The Scottish model has shown us what can be done, with a 16.7% reduction in eleven years; this is a battle we can win.  We know two planes are going to crash next year and we know where, but what are we doing about it?  The witnesses are doing the best they can with almost no resources.</p><p>  Our estimate - it is available online for those who want to see it - is that the National Office for Suicide Prevention is under-resourced by &euro;80 million based on what is needed.  We will submit our proposals to Senator Gilroy, who can factor them into his work.</p><p>  I believe that as a nation we are emotionally illiterate and are doing nothing to teach people how to be angry and what anger is, how to be sad and what sadness is, and how to cope with the various emotions in life.  There is no teaching in that regard of which I am aware.  Among other items, we proposed that guidance counsellors be restored to schools, including primary schools.  We proposed that SPHE should include that kind of emotional training and for it to be extended into the senior cycle to prepare students for the difficult challenges of life.  While the issue might be repossession for one person, it could be depression for another person and relationship break-up for someone else.  There is no exact science to this.</p><p>  While all the witnesses are doing a great a job, the one thing the Government should do is to put the correct structure in place and begin to resource that structure.  At that point the work of the Legislature will be done and the organisations represented here can do the rest.  Apart from those organisations, which are the high-profile ones, there is a plethora of organisations throughout the country that are engaged in superficiality.  Following an incident in a community, money is raised and goes somewhere.  However, are we having the kind of penetrative impact that such a level of effort should have?  The answer is "No" because we pay lip service to putting the correct structure in place and resourcing it.  That is what needs to change.</p><p>  I am aware of all the organisations represented here today and have read a considerable amount about them.  My only question is on the emotional literacy.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations and I commend each of them for the very important work they do.  Everyone has been affected in some way by death by suicide.  The work done on this is very important to the committee.  All of us are on a continuous learning curve.</p><p> A point was made on comparing trends in suicide in Ireland to those in neighbouring countries.  Suicide rates in Scotland decreased by 18% between 2002 and 2012.  Why did the suicide rates there decrease?  Does it have better resources than here or is it how suicides are reported?  A proposal was made to undertake a comparative study of suicide trends involving experts on suicide research and prevention from the five nations.  Do witnesses agree with this?</p><p> Alcohol is a significant factor in mental health but there seems to be a reluctance to acknowledge this.  During one of the presentations it was stated there was a 41% increase in alcohol consumption per head of population over the ten years to 2000.  I presume all of the witnesses agree a decrease in alcohol consumption would lead to a decrease in suicide.  Our relationship with alcohol in this country leaves much to be desired.  As a nation we are completely in denial about the effects of alcohol.</p><p> It should be mandatory for all schools to take part in an education programme.  Considering some of the programmes outlined this morning I am absolutely astonished, and it is hard to believe, that some schools do not partake in them.  It is essential they are all encouraged to do so.</p><p> There is no doubt the number of deaths recorded as suicide or intentional self-harm under-represent the true numbers.  Suicides are under-reported.  What do witnesses believe are the real figures?  Do they have a percentage of by how much they feel the figures are under-reported?</p><p> It was stated the National Office for Suicide Prevention requires greater resources and significant financial investment if it is to carry out its work more effectively.  This was also mentioned with regard to mental health issues and people's medical cards being discontinued.  Many people who may have mental health issues present to our constituency offices.  They are often the most vulnerable and have difficulties with getting on housing lists, getting their entitlements and having their medical cards discontinued.  The very people who need less stress than others are often those stressed out more.  I have had instances of people not taking medication because they cannot afford it although they really need it.  Recently I spoke to a lady whose medical card was taken off her and whose husband was working.  He did not understand her depression and need for medication and told her she did not need the tablets and to get on with it.  Many issues arise which we do not accept and do not really understand.</p><p> There is a lack of consistency in how families are dealt with in the Coroner's Court.  I presume this is a resource issue.  How can it be improved?  I thank the witnesses for their positive recommendations.  I am sure they will be very useful to the committee.</p></speech>

It would be admirable to have earlier statistics and confidence in their accuracy.  There is quite a complicated approach in operation at present, between form 104 and the coroner's report.</p><p>  I wish to discuss the effect of stigma.  All of the organisations are working on reducing stigma, and this is done through their discussing it, speaking about it and providing services to people in crisis.  Amnesty International and St. Patrick's Hospital have conducted surveys on the level of stigma which still exists with regard to those with mental illness.  St. Patrick's Hospital examined the general population and Amnesty examined those who suffer or have suffered from a mental illness.  It is quite frightening.  It is accepted it is under-reported because people want to be positive rather than negative.  This is a very big challenge faced by everybody involved in mental health services, NGOs and suicide prevention.</p><p>  The former Minister of State, John Moloney, did excellent work.  I cannot overstate how interested he was in working on mental health and suicide.  He launched the See Change programme.  Has any evaluation been done on how effective State organisations are in reducing the stigma of mental illness and suicide?</p></speech>

If somebody comes to my constituency office seeking advice on where to go, where do I send the person?  This has happened in the past.  I accompanied someone to a mental health hospital and I was very disappointed and concerned because on every evening I went to see the person different personnel were working there.  There were also different members of staff at family meetings and one had to start at the beginning and explain the whole case again.  I do not have much confidence in sending people to mental health hospitals, one in particular.  Where do the witnesses suggest we send people when they come to our offices?</p><p>  My background is in education.  When the witnesses spoke about education in the classroom for children and teenagers do they believe it should be delivered by guidance counsellors?  I believe it must come from the home.  One must learn one's resilience in the home and bring it with one to the classroom.</p> <p>My experience is that if they do not get learn that at home, it is very difficult to develop it in the school.</p><p> Mr. Austin's report alludes to the fact that there may be too many agencies.  I asked the previous group the number of agencies providing support to people who have difficulties in mental health and suicidal ideation.  </p><p> The representative of the Irish Association of Suicidology mentioned quality assurance of counselling.  Can he assure us that there is quality assurance in respect of the people delivering it on the ground, be it to people with suicidal ideation or to family members after a suicide who are very vulnerable?  I want to make sure there is quality assurance in that regard.  Can Mr. Austin tell me if that is the case?  I am sure that is the case in respect of some of his organisation's groups but I have attended meetings where people have outlined their experiences and I would be concerned about them giving advice.  We must have sound advice from experts.  Is that happening on the ground or is the service so diluted and fractured that some of the expert organisations are not getting the resources that should be ploughed into them?  Is it being diluted across the sector?</p></speech>

I have identified some common themes from the witnesses' submissions.  Would I be right in saying they believe there is a lack of a united approach and, if so, will they expand on that?  We frequently read about the tragedies that befall people's families and communities and I am exasperated that we still do not have a united approach when we are all trying to get to the end result of keeping people alive and well in their communities.  Why do we not have a united approach on the fundamental issue of keeping people safe and well?</p><p>  My background prior to becoming involved in politics was as a social worker working with very young children, and often with families who had significant difficulties.  To pick up on a question Senator MacSharry posed about emotional literacy, I believe we can and should be teaching children as young as two and a half and three years of age about emotional literacy, and there are programmes that do that.  Barnardos has a programme called T&uacute;s Maith where the language is explained and the emotional support given by their preschool teachers.  That message and exposure to education trickles home, and it is reinforced with the parents with support from people like those in Barnardos.  However, Barnardos is not an organisation that springs to mind in terms of promotion of mental health and emotional literacy, and that highlights the lack of a united approach.  The work Barnardos is doing with children aged three, four and five in very disadvantaged communities across this country is as important as the work being done by Aware, Pieta House and the Office of Suicide Prevention.  We must not forget that we are all stakeholders in positive mental health and looking after ourselves.</p><p>  Another important consideration, and Mr. Layden from Aware spoke about it also, is screening.  We have very effective cancer screening and have seen great results but we rarely screen ourselves in regard to how we are feeling.  People often ask us how we are doing and the response is "I am grand", but we do not look at that in a significant way.  That is important for all of us, regardless of whether we are on top of the world or at the bottom of the heap in terms of how we feel.  There should be some way of being able to monitor that.</p><p>  I would like to know from the witnesses the reason for the lack of a united approach because that greatly concerns me.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing some of the contributions but I have read them.<br/>I raise the issue of suicide among males between the age of 15 and 30.  Is there one area the witnesses believe we should prioritise in terms of trying to reduce suicide in that age group?  There is a range of actions we should be taking, some of which, in fairness, are being done, but is there any one area we should priorities to try to make an impact on reducing the suicide rate in that age category?  Between 2005 and 2010, the population in the 20 to 24 age group was 28.5% per<b></b>100,000.  The highest number of suicides is in that age group.  How can we bring about a change to reduce the number of suicides in that group?</p></speech>

Since I wrote the paper in draft form I have had the opportunity to meet some of the chief executive officers and leading people in some of our voluntary organisations.  I met with Mr. Austin, Mr. Layden and Ms Freeman, and I met Ms Kenny this week.  Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to meet Dr. Brophy.  I was very impressed by the quality of thinking taking place at the top levels of our organisations.</p><p>  We have heard the contributions from the witnesses and how some of them have approached the problem of suicide from their own perspective.  We have heard a divergence of opinions, which is welcome.  The Central Statistics Office will take the statistical approach, as one would expect.  The coroner and even ourselves as politicians have a different perspective on how we might approach this area but juxtaposing those perspectives creates an energy with which we might be able to gain further insights.  It is important that when we leave here today we do not forget about it.  This process should be seen as a starting point.</p><p>  I wish to clarify one or two issues that may not be clear from the report, one of which was raised by two witnesses earlier.  It relates to the application of the geospatial analysis to the electoral division.  There was no suggestion that we would use 10,000 of a population to change the rates of suicide; it was merely used for illustrative purposes.  We could have used any other cohort of the population including small areas or even constituencies.  The point is that there is data available within which cohorts can be measured and to which geospatial tools can be applied.  That is not to suggest that we intend to change the way we map the rates of suicide.</p><p>  I address this question to Mr. Raleigh.  I congratulate him on his appointment.  The new energy he has brought to the national office is obvious, even in the course of my travels in the past 18 months, and I commend him on that.  When I mentioned the National Office for Suicide Prevention at a meeting there was no recognition of its value.  Senator MacSharry's research from the year before last would verify that but that has changed since Mr. Raleigh took over the office, and we congratulate him on that.</p><p>  We welcome that the national strategic framework is making good progress.  When are we likely to see that?  What agencies are involved in compilation of the policy?</p> <p>The reason I refer to the National Office for Suicide Prevention and express the rather radical view that it should be removed from the area of mental health services, serves several purposes.  One reason is that we are not very good at policy-making in this country and I mean generally, not just in the area of health or mental health.  We have seen the results over the years, much to our dismay.  Our policy-makers may be of the view that it is sufficient to decide policy at the top and expect it to be fully implemented at the bottom without being mediated through each stage of its implementation.<br/>I commend the Reach Out document but it suffers from some of the flaws I have outlined.  It is vague in many areas and its language is woolly, which is very difficult to understand.  The document presents no measurable outcomes.  There is no built-in formal annual review as opposed to an <i>ad hoc</i>review even though it is a ten-year policy across both sides of the recession.  There is a great lack of resource planning.  Some media reports last year - before Mr. Raleigh's time - may have suggested that the National Office for Suicide Prevention had underspent its budget in 2012.</p></speech>

The Reach Out document does not contain a list of named agencies with responsibility for implementation or outcomes nor does it contain any timeframe for completion of the outcomes.  That is not a criticism of the National Office for Suicide Prevention but rather of us as politicians.</p><p>  The Health Research Board published a document entitled Document No. 7 which included a rather depressing and dispiriting statement.  It stated that when it comes to basing our policies on empirical evidence or basing it on political expediency, political expediency always wins out.  </p><p>  I hope all these issues will be addressed in the national framework.  I acknowledge that my view that suicide prevention should be moved away from its connection with mental health services may seem counter-intuitive but hopefully it will create a debate.</p><p>  I will speak again to the stakeholders and include more national organisations.  I will amend this paper accordingly to include some of the suggestions made at this meeting.  I will attach the deliberations of this committee and the evidence of the witnesses to an amended document which will be circulated for further public consultation.  I hope the committee will oblige me in a few months' time by giving time to discuss the final report.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I am very impressed with the level of thinking, which is excellent and very hopeful for the future.</p></speech>

We have a budget of almost &euro;9 million this year.  I might bite my lip saying this but I believe we have sufficient resources for this year to do what we need to do.  </p><p> In terms of the future, the platform is around the new national framework, which I believe should set out clear targets and points of delivery in terms of what we will do so that we can say to the man and woman in the street that, in terms of suicide prevention, these are the services we will deliver in their community, this is how we will resource them etc.?  We have learned from Reach Out, which was mentioned.  That was an excellent document of its day and we would embrace and bring forward many of the principles that underlie Reach Out but we must be much sharper in terms of what we intend to do, who will do it, who will resource it, what it will cost and how we will monitor its effectiveness.  We see the timeframe for a new framework as being four to five years.  Our expectation is that we will deliver it in November, although there is a lot of road to be travelled between now and November.  We will have a much surer point of view in mid-summer on delivering it but that is our objective, and we are confident we will achieve it.</p><p> In terms of how we will arrive at that point, today is an important part of our discussion.  We want to open the discussion as widely as possible without having the capacity - we are not sure of the value - of travelling across the country with a blank sheet, so to speak.  We know enough in terms of where the priorities lie and how we approach that but we are trying to design an engagement process, which will involve the community and the sector, in terms of agreeing a new framework.</p><p> The issue of stigma was mentioned.  On a personal level, I have read the See Change evaluation, which shows that we are making progress in terms of stigma but as a slightly beyond middle aged man, I know the challenges in terms of the discussion about mental health with my peers and while there has been some improvement in that regard, there is still an issue of stigma, particularly for men in terms of opening up about their emotional literacy and welfare.  We have a further journey to go in that regard.</p><p> On whether there are too many agencies, I genuinely believe that the response to dealing with suicide requires everybody putting their shoulder to the wheel.  Everybody in every community has a role to play.  There are probably too many agencies.  Agencies often arise locally in response to local tragedies but often have a very beneficial impact on the community in that they provide a forum for people to come together and support one another at a time when they are in distress.  From a community point of view, therefore, they have their purpose.</p><p> Sometimes we see agencies drifting into areas of therapy provision, which would worry me.  I heard Deputy Neville speaking on a radio programme last Sunday about the issue of regularising, overseeing and quality assuring counselling services.  I strongly endorse that view, and we need to examine a platform for doing that, be it legislative or whatever is the best approach.</p><p> On whether there is an issue for men in the 15 to 21 age group raised by Senator Burke, I will defer to Dr. Justin Brophy to give a clinical perspective.  Every death by suicide shakes us but most particularly the death of young people who have their lives in front of them.  What brings a young person to that space?  It is difficult to understand and very difficult to rationalise.  As we mentioned earlier, generally, there are multiple issues involved.  It is very seldom one causative factor and therefore we need to look behind that.</p></speech>

It pertains to the licensing and regulation of counsellors as well but in the next iteration, I expect that issue to be raised and perhaps addressed.  As for a singular approach to suicide, that speaks around the notion of a single agency.  We only have had a single agency with responsibility for suicide in recent years.  Its singular authority and mandate to deliver in this area will increase as it is expected to deliver not merely on aspirations but on actual results.  I have confidence in the agency's ability to deliver in that way, given an opportunity to develop a singular programme in the context of a wider policy development.</p><p> As for measures to reduce the incidence in respect of 16 to 18-year-olds, binge drinking in that age group probably is the single most important risk behaviour for self-harm and other forms of accidental death.  I believe we still have not merely an ambiguous attitude but an extremely wanton approach to the State-sponsored encouragement of drinking sprees through extensions and State-sponsored festivals at which 18 to 30-year-----</p></speech>

The Department of Education and Skills has a responsibility.  This is not merely a health issue; this is an education issue.  The Department of Education and Skills has a responsibility to ensure that our children have those skills.  At present, the SPHE programme finishes when students reach 15 years of age.  The reason we are going into the schools is because the schools are asking us to come in.</p><p> When we go into the schools, we have professional trainers who go in to deliver.  We used to have volunteers who might have come in and given their own personal experience.  We stopped all of that.  We ensure that it is a standardised programme that they are delivering and we independently evaluate those.  There is an inspection that goes on with all of those trainers to ensure that they are delivering the content that we have asked them to deliver.</p><p> If one sits in the classroom, it is interesting to hear the children and the questions that they ask.  They ask relevant questions.  One might be surprised to hear them.  In many cases, they are actually quite well informed about depression and mental health.  More often, we hear they are aware of it because of what is going on in their families.  One will hear a question asked about what is going on in the pupil's family or an example of something.  They are quite well aware that if there is a relationship breakdown, financial pressures or the loss of a job in a family, it has an impact.  That is what we are here to do in our education programmes.</p><p> The second question related to stigma.  Many come to organisations, such as Aware, Console and Pieta House, in times of crisis and we deal with the individual at that point in time.  Since Aware was founded 29 years ago, and the other organisations that are here were founded, there have been massive changes in perceptions of mental health in Ireland.  It has changed significantly.  Earlier mention was made of the change in the law, but a variety of changes have taken place.  However, there is one area that has probably been neglected, that is, the workplace.  It is important to recognise there is a growing trend.  If one watches companies, particularly the foreign multinationals coming into Ireland, they will have wellness programmes, and these are connecting diet, mind and body.  One will find there are a number of organisations that have wellness managers operating.  They are coming to us asking what training we can give their managers and HR staff, and what we can provide to their employees, because there are plenty of staff in their work environment who are experiencing severe stress from career change and additional work pressures.  We are responding by trying to deliver programmes to the workplace.  I believe that as we do that, as we engage in the workplace environment, it is another way of trying to reduce the issue of stigma.</p><p> The final point I would make is this.  I believe there are too many agencies.  I fully respect how in agencies and among individuals, when a tragedy occurs in a local community, there is a natural response.  I fully accept that.  However, there is an issue.  The State has limited resources.  There is austerity.  Obviously, the Government is working in a challenging environment for the next few years.  The private sector is funding a lot of this stuff.  I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation that when one asks what organisations the public thinks about first in mental health, the public thinks of organisations such as Aware, The Samaritans, Pieta House and Console.  That is where the people come to first.  That is not in any way to speak ill of the State or to cherry-pick.  That is where the people go when they have an issue.  That is where we are called in.  However, as for where we fund it, 92% of our funding comes from the private sector, which I am sure is like a lot of other organisations.</p></speech>

It was tremendously useful in what I am proposing to do.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  Their comments, constructive and otherwise, are more than welcome.

If we all agreed on everything, we would have a perfect service, and we are very far from that.  I thank them very much.</p></speech>

The most important message that we leave today for them is that our public messaging must be positive, we must be united in our response, there is a need for all of us to engage and to talk, and there are organisations available to help.  After the meeting, we will put up on the Joint Committee on Health and Children's website the organisations which were here today, plus The Samaritans, and their contact details.  It is important that we are united in our messaging and that we engage properly on this.
